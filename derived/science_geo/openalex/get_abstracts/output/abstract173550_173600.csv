Exposure of purified PTEN or of cells to H2O2 resulted in inactivation of PTEN in a time- and H2O2concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of various cysteine mutants, including mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides, indicated that the essential Cys124 residue in the active site of PTEN specifically forms a disulfide with Cys71during oxidation by H2O2. The reduction of H2O2-oxidized PTEN in cells appears to be mediated predominantly by thioredoxin. Thus, thioredoxin was more efficient than glutaredoxin, glutathione, or a 14-kDa thioredoxin-like protein with regard to the reduction of oxidized PTEN in vitro. Thioredoxin co-immunoprecipitated with PTEN from cell lysates; and incubation of cells with 2,4-dinitro-1-chlorobenzene (an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase) delayed the reduction of oxidized PTEN, whereas incubation with buthioninesulfoximine (an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis) did not. These results suggest that the reversible inactivation of PTEN by H2O2might be important for the accumulation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides and that the uncontrolled generation of H2O2 associated with certain pathological conditions might contribute to cell proliferation by inhibiting PTEN function.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced by all mammalian cells as a by-product of normal metabolism, including the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP and the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, as well as by phagocytic cells in the host defense response to noxious stimuli. In addition, ultraviolet and γ irradiation of cells results in the production of H2O2. A substantial increase in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 is generally associated with deleterious effects, including cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion. The generation of H2O2 also appears to be required, however, for many normal cellular functions, including propagation of receptor signaling (1Rhee, S. G., Bae, Y. S., Lee, S.-R., and Kwon, J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which H2O2 achieves these effects remain unknown. It is unlikely that H2O2specifically binds proteins and thereby affects their functions. On the other hand, H2O2 is a mild oxidant that is able to oxidize cysteine residues in proteins to cysteine sulfenic acid or to disulfide, both of which are readily reduced back to cysteine by various cellular reductants. Because the p Ka (where Ka is the acid constant) of the sulfhydryl group (Cys–SH) of most cysteine residues is ∼8.5 (8Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997; 36: 883-885Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and because this group is less readily oxidized by H2O2 than the cysteine thiolate anion (Cys–S–), few proteins might be expected to possess a Cys–SH that is vulnerable to oxidation by H2O2 in cells. However, certain protein cysteine residues do exist as thiolate anions at neutral pH as a result of the lowering of their p Ka values by charge interactions between the negatively charged thiolate and nearby positively charged amino acid residues (9Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Proteins with low p Ka cysteine residues include protein tyrosine phosphatases (10Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 11Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). All protein tyrosine phosphatases contain an essential cysteine residue (p Ka, 4.7–5.4) in the signature active site motif, HC XXG XXRS/T (where X is any amino acid residue), that exists as a thiolate anion at neutral pH (11Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This thiolate anion contributes to formation of a thiol-phosphate intermediate in the catalytic mechanism of protein tyrosine phosphatases. The active site cysteine is the target of specific oxidation by various oxidants, including H2O2, and this modification is reversed by incubation with thiol compounds such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and reduced glutathione (GSH). The ability of intracellularly produced H2O2 to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase activity was demonstrated by the observation that stimulation of A431 cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in a selective reduction in the extent of subsequent labeling of the active site cysteine residue of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B by [3H]iodoacetic acid in cell lysates (12Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). PTEN is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family and reverses the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by catalyzing the removal of the phosphate attached to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the phosphoinositide inositol ring (13Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 14Maehama T. Dixon J.E.

We now show that H2O2 induces reversible inactivation of PTEN through oxidation of the essential Cys124 and the formation by this residue of a disulfide with Cys71 and that the PTEN disulfide is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx). Given that stimulation of various receptors induces H2O2 production, we propose that the receptor-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase may not be sufficient for the accumulation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides; the concomitant inactivation of PTEN by H2O2produced in response to receptor stimulation might also be necessary for this effect. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Both PDGF-BB and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PTEN were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and monoclonal antibodies to PTEN and to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G were from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant Trx and glutaredoxin (Grx) were prepared as described previously (12Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Glucose oxidase, GSH, DTT, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were from Sigma. Bovine xanthine oxidase and catalase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and xanthine was from Calbiochem. A 30% solution of H2O2 was from Fisher. Human PTEN cDNA cloned in the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) for expression of the protein with a histidine tag at the NH2 terminus was kindly provided by K. M. Yamada (National Institutes of Health). The cDNAs encoding the PTEN mutants C71S, C83S, C105S, C124S, and C136S were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. The histidine-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli according to standard procedures and purified with the use of an immobilized nickel resin (Qiagen). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then stored at –80 °C. The phosphatase activity of PTEN was assayed with32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) as described previously (13Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cDNAs encoding wild-type PTEN or the C124S mutant tagged at their NH2 termini with HA were subcloned into the pCGN plasmid (22Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and the resulting vectors were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells by transfection with the use of Effectene (Qiagen). After stimulation, cells (1 × 106 cells in 1 ml of DMEM) were scraped into 0.2 ml of ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid and transferred to microfuge tubes. The cell suspensions were sonicated briefly and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed with acetone and then solubilized in 0.2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 2% SDS and 40 mm NEM. Portions (5 μl) of the solubilized pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with either rabbit antibodies to PTEN or a monoclonal antibody to HA. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (AmershamBiosciences or Pierce). The intensity of PTEN bands was quantitated with an Image Station 440 instrument (Kodak Digital Science). Oxidized PTEN (100 μg) was obtained by incubating the purified protein for 5 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm H2O2; the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 μg of catalase. The protein was then denatured with 6 m guanidine-HCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the free cysteine residues were alkylated by incubation for 2 h with 10 mmiodoacetamide in an anaerobic chamber. Alkylated PTEN was digested overnight at 37 °C with Lys-C (0.5 μg/ml) in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 10% acetonitrile. The digestion products were then fractionated by HPLC on a C18 column with a linear gradient (0–60%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A peak that eluted at 30.5 min was exposed or not exposed to 10 mm DTT for 10 min and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Purified human PTEN was inactivated by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). PTEN was also inactivated on incubation with xanthine oxidase and xanthine, the combination of which results in the generation of superoxide anions that are subsequently converted to H2O2 (Fig. 1B). The inactivation of PTEN by the xanthine oxidase-xanthine system was inhibited by up to ∼80% by catalase (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PTEN oxidation was mediated predominantly by H2O2 rather than by superoxide anions. PTEN that had been treated with H2O2 migrated faster on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions than did the untreated protein (Fig. 2A). This observation suggested that H2O2 induces the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups of PTEN to a disulfide, a reaction that generally results in a more compact protein structure. The PTEN protein comprises 403 amino acids, with the catalytic domain located in the NH2-terminal region and a C2 domain present in the COOH-terminal region (23Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M., Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of human PTEN contains cysteines at positions 71, 83, 105, 124, and 136 (15Maehama T. Taylor G.E. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To identify the cysteine residues that form a disulfide, we changed each of these five cysteines in the catalytic domain individually to serine, thereby generating the mutants C71S, C83S, C105S, C124S, and C136S. The mutant proteins were incubated with H2O2 and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Like the wild-type protein, the C83S, C105S, and C136S mutants migrated faster after exposure to H2O2, whereas the mobility of the C71S and C124S mutants was not affected by H2O2 (Fig. 2A). These results thus suggested that, on oxidation with H2O2, the Cys124 residue in the active site of PTEN forms a disulfide bond with Cys71. To demonstrate directly the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys71 and Cys124 of PTEN, we subjected the H2O2-treated protein to alkylation under denaturing conditions with iodoacetamide (to block free cysteines) and then to digestion with the endoproteinase Lys-C. The resulting peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. A peak that eluted at 30.5 min (data not shown) revealed several components on analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, including one of 4432.86 mass units (Fig. 2B); this size is highly similar to the value of 4435.88 mass units calculated for a 37-residue fragment of PTEN in which a Cys71-containing peptide and a Cys124-containing peptide are bridged by a disulfide bond. When the HPLC peak fraction that eluted at 30.5 min was treated with DTT before analysis by mass spectrometry, no mass peak corresponding to the 37-residue fragment was detected; instead, fragments of 1696.37 and 2741.02 mass units, similar to the values of 1695.90 and 2741.98 mass units calculated for the 14-residue Cys71-containing peptide and the 23-residue Cys124-containing peptide, respectively, were apparent (Fig. 2B). These results thus demonstrate that Cys71 and Cys124 of PTEN form a disulfide on exposure to H2O2. This conclusion is consistent with the crystal structure of PTEN, which reveals that, among the four other cysteine residues in the catalytic domain, only Cys71 is sufficiently close (a distance of 5.9 Å) to Cys124 to form a disulfide with this residue (23Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M., Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). We examined whether PTEN is oxidized in cells exposed to H2O2. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated for 5 min with various concentrations of H2O2, after which cell extracts were exposed to NEM to block free sulfhydryls and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PTEN. Exposure of cells to H2O2 at concentrations as low as 50 μm resulted in the appearance of the higher mobility (oxidized) form of PTEN, and the intensity of this band increased as the concentration of H2O2 increased (Fig. 3A). The amount of the oxidized form of PTEN also increased with time of incubation of cells with 0.5 mm H2O2, reaching a maximum at 10–40 min and decreasing gradually thereafter (Fig. 3B). The amount of the reduced form of the protein decreased as the amount of the oxidized form increased and vice versa, suggesting that PTEN was inactivated by H2O2 and then reactivated by cellular reductants as the concentration of H2O2 declined. When extracts derived from NIH 3T3 cells treated with H2O2 were incubated with DTT before gel electrophoresis, only the lower mobility PTEN band was detected (Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with the notion that the higher mobility form of the protein contains a disulfide. To demonstrate that Cys124 contributes to the disulfide responsible for the increase in PTEN mobility, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells separately with vectors encoding either the C124S mutant of human PTEN tagged with HA or the HA-tagged wild-type protein. Exposure of the transfected cells to H2O2revealed that the HA-tagged wild-type protein, but not the HA-tagged C124S mutant, underwent reversible oxidation (Fig. 3C), confirming that Cys124 forms the disulfide bond responsible for the mobility shift of PTEN. The reversible inactivation of PTEN was also apparent in HeLa cells exposed to 1.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 4A). When HeLa cells were incubated in a medium in which H2O2 was produced continuously as a result of the presence of glucose oxidase (which converts molecular oxygen to H2O2 with electrons derived from the glucose also present in the medium), the oxidized form of PTEN persisted (Fig. 4B). Two prominent physiological electron donors for protein reduction are GSH and Trx (24Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). GSH reduces proteins either directly or indirectly through the regeneration of Grx after its reaction with oxidized proteins. Oxidized Trx is reduced by TrxR with the use of electrons supplied by NADPH. Purified PTEN that had been inactivated by exposure to glucose and glucose oxidase was incubated with electron donors, and the extent of its reduction was monitored on the basis of the mobility shift in nonreducing gels (Fig. 5A). The most rapid reduction was achieved with the nonphysiological electron donor DTT (5 mm). The Trx system, comprising 5 μm Trx and saturating concentrations of TrxR and NADPH, was almost as efficient as DTT; the Trx system devoid of Trx was completely inactive (data not shown). GSH (5 mm) was markedly less effective than the Trx system, and the presence of 5 μm Grx in addition to 5 mm GSH (the Grx system) did not substantially increase the efficiency of the latter (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when PTEN reduction was monitored on the basis of enzyme activity (data not shown). We also measured the rate of PTEN reactivation in the presence of various concentrations of Trx (Fig. 5B). Half-maximal reactivation was apparent at 1 μm Trx. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed that Trx was co-immunoprecipitated with PTEN from NIH 3T3 cell extracts (Fig. 6). Estimation of the relative amounts of PTEN and Trx in the immunoprecipitates by comparison of the band intensities with those of protein standards yielded a molar ratio of PTEN to Trx of 1:0.07. Mammalian cells contain a 14-kDa protein, which is 20% identical to Trx in amino acid sequence. This Trx-related protein, named TRP14, contains a WC XXC motif, which is conserved among the members of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily that includes Trx, Grx, and protein disulfide isomerases. The reduction potentials of TRP14 (−0.257 V) and Trx (−0.274 V) are similar, and oxidized TRP14 and Trx were reduced with equal efficiency by TrxR. 2W. Jeong and S. G. Rhee, unpublished data. As such, we tested whether TRP14 can reactivate oxidized PTEN in the presence of TrxR and NADPH. TRP14 was nearly as ineffective as GSH, further suggesting the specificity of electron donor molecules (Fig. 7). To evaluate the relative importance of GSH and Trx with regard to reactivation of PTEN in cells, we incubated HeLa cells with either 2,4-dinitro-1-chlorobenzene (DNCB), which prevents recycling of Trx by inhibiting TrxR activity (25Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), or buthioninesulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits GSH biosynthesis (26Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), before exposure to H2O2. Treatment of cells with 100 μm DNCB for 15 min resulted in the accumulation of >80% of Trx in its oxidized form, and treatment with 300 μmBSO for 24 h resulted in the depletion of GSH by >90% (data not shown). Whereas BSO did not substantially affect the reduction of H2O2-oxidized PTEN, DNCB induced a marked delay in PTEN reduction (Fig. 8), suggesting that the reduction of PTEN in cells is mediated predominantly by Trx. DNCB is known to be toxic and induce cell death upon incubation for several hours (27Ishikawa A. Kubota Y. Murayama T. Nomura Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 277: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Incubation of HeLa cells with 100 μmDNCB for 15 min, however, did not cause any detectable cell death as measured by the trypan blue exclusion assay, and detectable levels of cell death were apparent after incubation for 90 min (data not shown). A variety of cellular stimuli induce the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, resulting in the conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 (28Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20110-20116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the catalytic cores of all of them contain two signature active site motifs, (F/I)W XGD XN(F/Y)R and (R/N)XP(S/A)(W/Y)(C/T)DR; these motifs, unlike the active site motif of the 3-phosphatase PTEN, do not possess a conserved cysteine residue, however. The 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides bind and modulate numerous proteins that regulate a variety of cellular functions (15Maehama T. Taylor G.E. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 29Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). One of the best-characterized targets of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 is the protein kinase Akt. Both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 activate Akt (20Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), although their relative contribution to this process in vivo remains unclear (32Kisseleva M.V. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6266-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Activated Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating the proapoptotic factors BAD and caspase-9 and thereby inhibiting their functions (33Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y.

However, the 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositide that accumulates in response to H2O2 is almost exclusively PI(3,4)P2 rather than PI(3,4,5)P3(24Holmgren A. Antioxid.

Given that H2O2 activates receptor-type protein tyrosine kinases such as the PDGF receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (37Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 39Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P.

Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), it also likely activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase, resulting in the production of PI(3,4,5)P3. In support of this notion, H2O2-dependent activation of Akt is blocked by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (6Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 37Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Biophys. 2001; 386: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have now shown that PTEN is inactivated by H2O2. This observation, together with the fact that PTEN, but not 5-phosphatases, contains an oxidizable cysteine residue at its active site, suggests that in cells exposed to H2O2, PI(3,4,5)P3 synthesized by phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity is rapidly dephosphorylated by 5-phosphatases that are insensitive to H2O2, whereas dephosphorylation at the 3′ position is markedly inhibited as a result of inactivation of PTEN by H2O2. The H2O2-dependent inhibition of the lipid phosphatase activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN suggests that H2O2 produced under pathological conditions, such as during chronic inflammation, might contribute to inhibition of apoptosis, to hyperplasia, and to tumor formation. Indeed, many normal cells exposed to H2O2exhibit increased proliferation and express growth-related genes (42Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 43Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroki T. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8300-8306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, given that tumor cells produce large amounts of H2O2 (45Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar, 46Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), this metabolite might also promote tumor cell proliferation. Previously, the tumor-promoting activity of reactive oxygen species has been explained mainly in terms of the mutagenic activity of the hydroxyl radicals derived from them. A variety of cell surface receptor ligands induce the production of H2O2, which is necessary for receptor-mediated cellular events such as chemotaxis, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progress (3Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 47Page K., Li, J. Wang Y. Kartha S. Pestell R.G. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Like exogenous H2O2, the receptor-produced H2O2 also likely causes PTEN inactivation and contributes to the accumulation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Thus, the receptor-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase may not be sufficient for the accumulation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, and the concomitant inactivation of PTEN by receptor-produced H2O2 might also be necessary for this effect. Despite numerous studies demonstrating the importance of PTEN in cell growth, survival, and migration, the mechanisms by which the activity of this protein is regulated have remained unclear (15Maehama T. Taylor G.E. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). PTEN contains tandem phosphatase and C2 domains, which share an extensive interface (23Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M., Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The phosphatase domain exhibits substantial structural homology to protein tyrosine phosphatases, but it contains an enlarged active site with several basic residues that are important for the accommodation of the bulky inositol trisphosphate moiety. PTEN also contains a putative PDZ domain-binding motif at its COOH terminus. Although this notion remains controversial (48Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 49Tolkacheva T. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Leslie N.R.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PTEN by casein kinase II has also been shown to increase the susceptibility of the protein to proteasome-mediated degradation (54Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). How these modes of regulation might be affected by the activation of cell surface receptors, however, is not known. Although in vitro measurements of its lipid phosphatase activity suggest that PTEN might be constitutively active, no mechanism for its negative regulation has previously been revealed (15Maehama T. Taylor G.E. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Constitutive activity of PTEN is likely required to prevent accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and unwanted triggering of proliferation signals in quiescent cells. The oxidative inactivation of PTEN in response to H2O2 generation might therefore be an important determinant of the timing and localization of the production of this important lipid messenger elicited by receptor stimulation. Oxidized PTEN is gradually converted back to the reduced form by intracellular reducing agents, indicating that the reversible oxidation and reduction of the active site cysteine residue is an important mechanism for the regulation of PTEN. The best candidate for the intracellular reducing agent is Trx, given that oxidized PTEN was reduced much more effectively by Trx than by Grx or GSH in vitro. Furthermore, depletion of reduced Trx, but not of GSH, markedly reduced the rate of reactivation of oxidized PTEN in cells. The association of Trx with PTEN revealed by the co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins suggests that the reduction reaction might be governed by a specific interaction between oxidized PTEN and reduced thioredoxin. Such a specific interaction is also supported by the observation that a 14-kDa Trx-related protein (TRP14) was not able to reduce oxidized PTEN despite the fact that it contains a WC XXC motif, which is conserved among members of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily, and that TRP14 and Trx exhibit similar redox potentials and reactivity toward TrxR.

Determinants within the amino-terminal half of ETR1 are sufficient for targeting to and retention at the endoplasmic reticulum. These data support a central role of the plant endoplasmic reticulum in hormone perception and signal transduction. Hormone perception is necessary for the coordinated growth and development of multicellular eukaryotes. Subcellular localization of hormone receptors is strongly dependent upon the biochemical nature of the hormone (1Pimentel E. Handbook of Growth Factors. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1994Google Scholar, 2Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For example, polypeptide hormones do not diffuse across membranes and thus utilize receptors localized to the plasma membrane (PM). 1The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membraneERendoplasmic reticulumGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinACC1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, In contrast, steroids can diffuse across membranes and utilize soluble nuclear receptors. In plants, the gaseous hormone ethylene regulates growth, ripening, senescence, abscission, and wound responses (3Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit M.E., Jr. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Ethylene is diffusible in both aqueous and lipid environments, and a receptor for ethylene theoretically could be localized anywhere within the cell (3Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). plasma membrane endoplasmic reticulum glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, Some constraints upon localization are dictated by the nature of the hormone-binding site. In the plant Arabidopsis, the ethylene receptor family is composed of five members: ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 (4Bleecker A.B. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 269-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Of these receptors, the ethylene receptor ETR1 has been characterized in most detail because it was the first member of the receptor family identified (5Chang C. Kwok S.F. Bleecker A.B. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 1993; 262: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of ETR1 indicates that there are three predicted transmembrane domains located near the amino terminus: a GAF domain, a histidine kinase domain, and a receiver domain. GAF domains are involved in cGMP binding and light regulation in other proteins, but the function of the GAF domain in ETR1 is unknown (7Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Histidine kinase and receiver domains are signaling elements originally identified as components in bacterial phosphorelays and are now also known to be present in plants, fungi, and protists (8Schaller G.E. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 32: 109-148Crossref Google Scholar). Histidine kinase activity has been demonstrated for ETR1 (9Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but the function of this activity in ethylene signal transduction has not been resolved. The predicted transmembrane domains of ETR1 apparently serve two functions. First, they result in membrane localization of the receptor (10Schaller G.E. Ladd A.N. Lanahan M.B. Spanbauer J.M. Bleecker A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12526-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Second, genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the ethylene-binding site is located within the transmembrane domains of ETR1 (6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B.

Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). According to the current model, ETR1 is a disulfide-linked homodimer (10Schaller G.E. Ladd A.N. Lanahan M.B. Spanbauer J.M. Bleecker A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12526-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) with each dimer containing a single ethylene-binding site (11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of ethylene is mediated by a copper co-factor that is coordinated by two conserved amino acids (Cys-65 and His-69) (6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) present in the second transmembrane domain. The importance of the transmembrane domains is emphasized by the finding that, although the other members of the ethylene receptor family share similar features with ETR1, the highest degree of amino acid conservation is found within this region implicated in ethylene binding (12Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement of a hydrophobic environment for optimal ethylene binding may have favored use of a membrane-bound receptor for ethylene signal transduction. Ethylene perception in plants thus represents an intriguing variation on known ligand-receptor paradigms as it involves a readily diffusible ligand but a membrane-bound receptor. Although some members of the ethylene receptor family have predicted signal sequences, suggesting entry into the secretory system, ETR1 has no signal sequences or obvious information to indicate subcellular localization (10Schaller G.E.

In this paper, we demonstrate that ETR1 predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Arabidopsis. Subcellular localization to the ER has implications for ethylene signal transduction and for our understanding of the factors that determine receptor localization. Microsomal membranes were isolated from Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture as described (10Schaller G.E. Ladd A.N. Lanahan M.B. Spanbauer J.M. Bleecker A.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12526-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), then eluting with 0.1m glycine (pH 2.5). As a final purification step, the antibody was passed through an Affi-Gel column coupled with soluble proteins from Arabidopsis. Leaf segments of Arabidopsis were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, then embedded in Epon 812 resin, and polymerized for 3 days at 60 °C. Thin sections were cut and collected onto naked nickel grids. Section surfaces were etched with 10% H2O2 for 15 min, blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.2 m glycine in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% Tween 20), and then incubated with antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBST overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBST, grids were incubated for 1 h with protein A-colloidal gold conjugate (10 nm, Sigma) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBST, poststained in 5% uranyl acetate for 15 min and lead citrate for 5 min, and then observed with a transmission electron microscope. The ethylene receptor ETR1 has a modular structure (Fig. 1A) and contains three predicted transmembrane segments implicated in both membrane localization and ethylene binding (6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 10Schaller G.E. Ladd A.N. Lanahan M.B. Spanbauer J.M. Bleecker A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12526-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We analyzed the localization of ETR1 in Arabidopsis membranes by two independent biochemical strategies: aqueous two-phase partitioning and sucrose density-gradient fractionation. Aqueous two-phase partitioning in polyethylene glycol-Dextran mixtures allows for purification of PM vesicles based on their preferential partitioning into the upper phase (13Larrson C. Widell S. Kjellbom P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 558-568Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Partitioning is dependent upon surface properties of the membranes and under optimal conditions can result in about 90% of the plasma membrane partitioning to the upper phase and 80–90% of the intracellular membranes partitioning to the lower phase (13Larrson C. Widell S. Kjellbom P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 558-568Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 17DeWitt N.D. Hong B. Sussman M.R. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following partitioning of Arabidopsis membranes, the relative distribution between the two phases of ETR1 and various membrane markers was determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). The PM marker (H+-ATPase) enriched to the upper phase, and markers for ER (BiP) and tonoplast (VM23) enriched to the lower phase. Membrane vesicles containing ETR1 enriched in the lower phase, indicating that ETR1 is not localized to the PM. A good correlation between the distribution of ETR1 and the ER marker BiP was observed in several independent experiments, consistent with ER-localization. To resolve the membrane location of ETR1, sucrose density-gradient centrifugation was performed with Arabidopsis microsomes. Centrifugation was performed in the presence and absence of Mg2+. Association of ribosomes with the ER is Mg2+-dependent, so removal of Mg2+ results in dissociation of ribosomes from the ER and a diagnostic redistribution of ER from higher to lower density on the gradient (21Lord J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fractions from the sucrose gradient were analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of ETR1 as well as for markers specific for PM, tonoplast, and ER (Fig. 1C). ETR1 co-fractionated with the ER marker BiP and exhibited the same diagnostic Mg2+-dependent density shift from 29–36% to 38–44% (w/w) sucrose observed with the ER marker. A small amount of BiP, an ER resident chaperone, is also present at the top of the gradient and arises due to release of some soluble contents of the ER lumen. The distribution of ETR1 could be differentiated from the plasma membrane marker (H+-ATPase), the tonoplast marker (VM23), and the chloroplast thylakoid marker (chlorophyll absorbance), which did not demonstrate the same Mg2+-induced shift. ETR1 could be differentiated from the Golgi marker (latent UDPase), which had a broader distribution than ETR1 in the Mg2+-containing gradient. To cytologically corroborate ER localization for ETR1, we performed immunogold electron microscopy. For this purpose a polyclonal antibody against ETR1 was affinity-purified to monospecificity (Fig. 2). Due to low native levels of ETR1 in Arabidopsis, we used a transgenic line transformed with an additional genomic copy of the ETR1 gene (tETR1) for cytological studies (22Hall A.E. Chen Q.G. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transgenic expression of ETR1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in the level of immunodetectable ETR1 (Fig. 2). The increased expression of ETR1 does not affect receptor localization based on analysis by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (results not shown). In photomicrographs of mesophyll cells from Arabidopsis leaves, gold granules were found on the ER (Fig. 3, A–D). The ER was identified on the basis of associated ribosomes and by immunogold localization of ACA2 (Fig. 3, E–F), a transmembrane Ca2+ pump previously demonstrated to be ER-localized (16Hong B. Ichida A. Wang Y. Gens J.S. Pickard B.G. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gold granules representing ETR1 were not detected in context of the PM except where the ER contacted the PM, nor were gold granules detected above background levels on other membrane systems such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, vacuoles, and the Golgi apparatus. Localization of ETR1 to the ER was confirmed by control experiments performed by omitting the anti-ETR1 antibody, by replacing it with preimmune antibody, and by probing the etr1–7 line (23Hua J. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) that lacks immunodetectable ETR1.Figure 3Localization of ETR1 to the ER by immunoelectron microscopy. Immunogold labeling of ETR1 (A–D) and ACA2 (E and F) in leaf mesophyll cells. C, D, and F are 2-fold enlargements of sections from A, B, and E, respectively. ETR1 labeling is confined to the rough ER as evidenced by the associated ribosomes. ETR1 labeling is absent from the PM, cell wall (cw), mitochondria (m), and vacuole (v). ACA2 labeling is present on the ER and is absent from the PM, cell wall (cw), chloroplast (c), and vacuole (v). Examples of gold granules (solid arrowheads) and ribosomes (open arrowhead) are indicated. A, B, C, D, E, and F contain 7, 5, 3, 3, 13, and 3 gold particles, respectively. Scale bar = 0.25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Efforts to visualize ETR1 by use of fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were unsuccessful. Transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts of an ETR1-GFP fusion, driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S::ETR1-GFP), could not be interpreted due to formation of large intracellular aggregates of fluorescence (results not shown). Stable expression of 35S::ETR1-GFP in Arabidopsis resulted in expression at close to native ETR1 levels, and the fluorescence was insufficient for visualization. To determine whether the ER localization reflects stable retention of ETR1 at the ER membrane, we treated Arabidopsis plants with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Use of cycloheximide has been demonstrated to be an effective means to clear transmembrane and secretory proteins in transit through the secretory pathway (24Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that ETR1 was a long-lived protein, allowing use of this experimental approach. Immunoblot analysis of sucrose density-gradient fractions revealed that ETR1 was still ER-associated after a 6-h cycloheximide treatment based on the Mg2+-dependent density shift (Fig. 4), indicating that ETR1 was retained at the ER and did not migrate to the PM. Localization of receptors may be affected by ligand binding (26Wiley H.S. Bittar E.E. Fundamentals of Medical Cell Biology. 5A. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1992: 113-142Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of ethylene in plant tissue are not saturating because one does not observe the gross morphological changes associated with increased levels of ethylene (3Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit M.E., Jr. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine localization of ethylene receptors in an ethylene-bound state, plants were treated with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) for 24 h prior to membrane isolation. Treatment with 50 μm ACC is above the level needed to induce ethylene-mediated responses in Arabidopsis (27Larsen P.B. Chang C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and, based upon the dose dependence for ethylene binding by the ethylene receptor ETR1 (6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), should produce sufficient ethylene to yield greater than 90% occupancy of receptor-binding sites. Immunoblot analysis of sucrose density-gradient fractions indicated that ETR1 isolated from ACC-treated plants was ER-associated based on the Mg2+-dependent density shift (Fig. 5A). We also considered the formal possibility that a receptor lacking bound ligand might localize to a membrane system other than the ER. Inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis exist, but these reduce rather than eliminate ethylene production in Arabidopsis (28Sanders I.O. Harpham N.V.J. Raskin I. Smith A.R. Hall M.A. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 1991; 68: 97-103Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore took a mutant-based approach to examine localization of an ethylene receptor incapable of binding ethylene. For this purpose, the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1–1 was used. The etr1–1 mutation results in the change of a single amino acid (C65Y) within the second transmembrane domain of the receptor, disrupting binding of a copper co-factor necessary for liganding ethylene (6Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of sucrose density-gradient fractions indicated that the etr1–1 mutant receptor was predominantly ER-associated based on the Mg2+-dependent density shift (Fig. 5B). A small amount of etr1–1 did not demonstrate a Mg2+-dependent density shift and may represent etr1-1 protein that has escaped the ER and now resides at the PM or at another membrane. Overall, our results indicate that the ligand-bound status of ETR1 has little effect upon the localization of ETR1 within the secretory system. Several amino acid motifs have been implicated in the ER retention and retrieval of plant proteins. These include the cytosolic di-lysine motif, KK XX-COOH found in type-1 membrane proteins and the (H/K)DEL-COOH motif found in soluble proteins (29Denecke J., De Rycke R. Botterman J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30Napier R.M. Fowke L.C. Hawes C. Lewis M. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 261-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Benghezal M. Wasteneys G.O. Jones D.A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1179-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ETR1 and other members of the ethylene receptor family in Arabidopsis lack these known ER localization motifs. To gain information on the localization requirements for ETR1, we examined the subcellular localization of ETR1-(1–349), a truncated version of the receptor that contains the amino-terminal 349 amino acids (full-length ETR1 = 738 amino acids) (20Gamble R.L., Qu, X. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).ETR1-(1–349) was transgenically expressed in the etr1–7 genetic background of Arabidopsis that contains a loss-of-function mutation in the endogenous ETR1 gene. Analysis by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation supported ER localization of ETR1-(1–349) based on the Mg2+-dependent density shift (Fig. 6), indicating that determinants for ER targeting and retention are contained within the amino-terminal half of ETR1. We report here several independent lines of evidence demonstrating that the ethylene receptor ETR1 predominantly localizes to and is retained at the Arabidopsis ER. We cannot rule out that low levels of the receptor (e.g. 1%) may be present at other membrane locations, but if so, these are unlikely to be major contributors to ETR1-mediated ethylene perception for the following reasons. First, the pool of ETR1 is predominantly ER-localized based on all methods of analysis we employed. Second, we observed no change in ER localization following a cycloheximide chase; nor did we observe any substantial ligand-dependent change in localization. Third, due to the solubility of ethylene in aqueous and lipid environments (3Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit M.E., Jr. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar), ethylene can readily access an intracellular pool of receptors (i.e. no transporter need be hypothesized for movement of ethylene across the PM to reach an ER-localized receptor). Thus, our data support the ER as the site of action for ethylene binding to the receptor ETR1. This localization is consistent with studies, performed before the identity of the ethylene receptors was known, in which ethylene-binding sites were reported at the ER and protein bodies of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (kidney bean) (32Evans D.E. Dodds J.H. Lloyd P.C. apGwynn I. Hall M.A. Planta. 1982; 154: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Evans D.E. Bengochea T. Cairns A.R. Dodds J.H. Hall M.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1982; 5: 101-107Google Scholar). ER localization presents several advantages for signal transduction. It is energetically efficient, as the receptor is not exported all the way through the secretory system to the plasma membrane. Receptors are rapidly delivered to their site of action, which may be important for members of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family such as ERS1, ERS2, and ETR2 whose expression is induced by ethylene (12Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It also potentially allows for local regulation of ER-based processes such as Ca2+ release and protein secretion, Ca2+having been previously implicated in plant ethylene responses (34Raz V. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kwak S.H. Lee S.H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ETR1 could also potentially interact with the membrane-associated proteins RAN1 and EIN2 (37Hirayama T. Kieber J.J. Hirayama N. Kogan M. Guzman P. Nourizadeh S. Alonso J.M. Dailey W.P. Dancis A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 383-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 38Alonso J.M. Hirayama T. Roman G. Nourizadeh S. Ecker J.R.

Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), both of which are implicated in ethylene signal transduction but whose subcellular localization is unknown. RAN1 is a copper transporter thought to deliver the copper co-factor required for ethylene binding by the receptors (37Hirayama T. Kieber J.J. Hirayama N. Kogan M. Guzman P. Nourizadeh S. Alonso J.M. Dailey W.P. Dancis A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 383-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 39Woeste K.E. Kieber J.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). EIN2 is similar to the Nramp family of cation transporters, although no transport ability has been demonstrated for the protein (38Alonso J.M. Hirayama T. Roman G. Nourizadeh S. Ecker J.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2148-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Entrance into the secretory pathway and/or ER localization may be due in part to sequences present in the ancestral ethylene receptor. Ethylene receptors are thought to have originated with the endosymbiont cyanobacterium that gave rise to the chloroplast, because the cyanobacterium Synechocystis contains a protein slr1212 with similarity to the plant ethylene receptors (11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The slr1212 polypeptide contains three predicted transmembrane domains with 38% amino acid sequence identity to those of ETR1 and has the capacity to bind ethylene (11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Over evolutionary time, intracellular gene transfer from chloroplast to nucleus has occurred (40Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Such transfers would typically be expected to result in “mis-localization” of the gene products, which lack transit sequences for retargeting back to the chloroplast. Transfer of a gene for the ancestral ethylene receptor from chloroplast to nucleus could therefore result in localization of the protein to a new membrane system, entrance into the secretory system representing one possibility as the mechanism for targeting to the ER is similar to that found in bacterial export systems (41Garcia P.D. Ghrayeb J. Inouye M. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9463-9468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences required for both targeting to the secretory system and retention at the ER are contained within the amino-terminal half of ETR1. Other members of the ethylene receptor family, notably ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4, contain predicted signal sequences for entry into the secretory system (8Schaller G.E. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 32: 109-148Crossref Google Scholar), although whether these receptors are retained at the ER is currently unknown. ETR1 does not contain a predicted signal sequence and thus information for targeting to the secretory system is likely to be contained within its first transmembrane segment (42von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which would in this case function as an uncleaved signal sequence. There is only limited information on sequence determinants for the retention of membrane proteins at the ER, the best known being the cytosolic di-lysine motif KK XX-COOH found in type-1 membrane proteins of plants, mammals, and yeast (31Benghezal M. Wasteneys G.O. Jones D.A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1179-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 44Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This sequence is lacking in ETR1 and the other members of the Arabidopsis ethylene-receptor family, thereby supporting the existence of as yet unidentified sequences responsible for ER retention of the ethylene receptors. The ethylene receptor ETR1 represents one of only a few ER-localized receptors that has been identified in eukaryotes. The transmembrane receptor Ire1 mediates the unfolded protein response in yeast, mammals, and plants, its ligands being unfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen (45Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 46Koizumi N. Martinez I.M. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). ABP1, a binding protein for the plant hormone auxin, is also predominantly ER-localized (47Bauly J.M. Sealy I.M. Macdonald H. Brearley J. Droge S. Hillmer S. Robinson D.G. Venis M.A. Blatt M.R. Lazarus C.M. Napier R.M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 48Henderson J.

ABP1 is a soluble protein found in the ER lumen, localization being mediated in part by a KDEL sequence present at the carboxyl terminus. The function that ABP1 performs in the ER is still debated (49Timpte C. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 586-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but it has been hypothesized to act as a ligand-mediated chaperone (50Chen J.G. Ullah H. Young J.C. Sussman M.R. Jones A.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The finding that receptors for two of the best-characterized plant hormones are present at the ER is suggestive that the ER plays a central role in perception and signal transduction of plant hormones.

https://openalex.org/W2097485803,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides to form amyloid plaques. Understanding the balance of production and clearance of Abeta peptides is the key to elucidating amyloid plaque homeostasis. Microglia in the brain, associated with senile plaques, are likely to play a major role in maintaining this balance. Here, we show that heat-shock proteins (HSPs), such as HSP90, HSP70, and HSP32, induce the production of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha and increase the phagocytosis and clearance of Abeta peptides. This suggests that microglial interaction with Abeta peptides is highly regulated by HSPs. The mechanism of microglial activation by exogenous HSPs involves the nuclear factor kB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 activation. In AD brains, levels of HSP90 were increased in both the cytosolic and membranous fractions, and HSP90 was colocalized with amyloid plaques. These observations suggest that HSP-induced microglial activation may serve a neuroprotective role by facilitating Abeta clearance and cytokine production"

Whereas steroid hormone receptors have been the most studied in terms of their activation by Hsp90, protein kinases form the largest coherent class of Hsp90-dependent client proteins (1Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 157-185Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recruitment of many protein kinase clients to the Hsp90 system involves a specialized co-chaperone Cdc37p (in budding yeast) or its mammalian orthologue p50cdc37 (15Perdew G.H. Wiegand H. VandenHeuvel J.P. Mitchell C. Singh S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3600-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unlike Sti1/Hop/p60, which recruits clients to Hsp90 via interaction with Hsp70, Cdc37p/p50cdc37 can interact directly with client protein kinases via its N-terminal region (16Grammatikakis N.

However, it is far from clear whether all protein kinases that interact with Cdc37p/p50cdc37 are Hsp90-dependent or if all kinases that are Hsp90-dependent are recruited by Cdc37p/p50cdc37 (18Hunter T.

In contrast, Cdc37p/p50cdc37 has no detectable TPR motifs and does not require the C-terminal MEEVD of Hsp90, however, its binding is mutually exclusive with Sti1/Hop/p60 (20Owens-Grillo J.K.

The common ability of Sti1/Hop/p60 and Cdc37p/p50cdc37 to interact (directly or indirectly) with Hsp90 client proteins, together with their mutual exclusivity of binding to Hsp90, suggests that they may act as alternative recruitment factors for different classes of client protein. To gain further insight into this possibility, we have characterized the interaction between Cdc37p/p50cdc37 and Hsp90 and investigated the effect of Cdc37p/p50cdc37 co-chaperone binding on the inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90. The results of these studies suggest a common mechanism for recruitment of client proteins into the Hsp90 complex requiring suppression of ATP turnover by Hsp90 during the loading phase. Expression and purification of His-tagged yeast Hsp90, His-tagged cSti11 (C-terminal Hsp90-binding domain of Sti1, residues 237–589), and His-tagged Cpr6 were described previously (6Prodromou C.

DNA sequences encoding a truncated N-terminal domain of human p50cdc37 (sNp50, amino acid residues 30–127) and C-terminal p50cdc37 domain (Cp50, amino acid residues 128–379) were cloned in-frame with the His tag of pRSETA (NheI-XhoI). Full-length p50cdc37 cloned into pET16d was a kind gift from Nick Grammatikakis.Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC37 was cloned in-frame with the His tag of pRSETA (NheI-XhoI). The various p50cdc37 and Cdc37p constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS by induction at 20 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl (Buffer A) and lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant applied to a Talon metal affinity column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and finally p50cdc37 /Cdc37p eluted with Buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.0). 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added, and the eluent was concentrated with Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius) with an appropriate molecular weight cut-off. Concentrated sample was applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex 75PG for Np50 and Cp50 and Superdex 200PG for p50cdc37 and Cdc37p), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing p50cdc37 or Cdc37p were dialyzed (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The bound protein was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing pure p50cdc37 or Cdc37p were dialyzed (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) and subsequently concentrated using Vivaspin 5,000 and 30,000 molecular weight cutoff concentrators as appropriate. The protein concentrations reached are as follows: p50cdc37 = 99.7 mg ml−1, Np50 = 60 mg ml−1, Cp50 = 50 mg ml−1, Cdc37p = 131.6 mg ml−1, Hsp90 = 31.2 mg ml−1, cSti1 33.2 mg ml−1, and Cpr6 = 92.7 mg ml−1. Further treatment of proteins destined for ATPase assays and the regenerating enzyme-linked ATPase assay itself were as described previously (3Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R.

Average ATPase activities were plotted as a percentage of the maximum average activity for Hsp90 at 37 °C. Sedimentation equilibration experiments were conducted at 15 °C in a Beckman-Optima XLI analytical centrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor and 1.2-cm path length cells. p50cdc37, sNp50, and Cp50 were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 25 mm NaCl. The proteins were used at concentrations of 23.6, 76.8, and 34.9 μm, respectively. Experiments were performed on 100-μl samples that were equilibrated for ∼48 h at speeds ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 rpm. Sedimentation curves measured by absorbance at 280 nm were compared with a buffer reference cell. Multiple data sets were fitted simultaneously to yield the Kd and molecular mass values quoted, using Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (version 4.0). Data fitting and simulations used the following calculated parameters: buffer density at 15 °C = 1.00064 mg ml−1; monomeric molecular mass, p50cdc37 = 45,780 Da; sNp50 = 13,508 Da, and Cp50 = 30,817 Da; partial specific volumes, p50cdc37 = 0.7241; sNp50 = 0.7161 and Cp50 = 0.7271 and extinction coefficients (280 nm), p50cdc37 = 50,042, sNp50 = 16,500, and Cp50 = 26,930. CD spectra were recorded on a nitrogen-flushed Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. For an accurate determination of Kd values, multiscanning was required for high data precision. At a scan speed of 20 nm min−1, nine scans were demanded in the 245–335 nm region for the CD titrations of Hsp90 with several co-chaperones. The concentration of the proteins were determined spectroscopically using the following molar extinction coefficients: ε(Hsp90) = 54,050m −1 cm−1, ε(Cdc37p)= 24,180 m −1 cm−1, ε(p50cdc37 ) = 50,340m −1 cm−1, ε(sNp50)= 17,190 m −1 cm−1, ε(Cp50) = 26,390 m −1cm−1, and ε(cSti1) = 34,480m −1 cm−1. All CD spectra were reported in ΔA = (AL −AR). The spectropolarimeter was calibrated with ammonium d-champor-10-sulfonate. The dissociation constant Kd was determined by analyzing the CD data using a non-linear regression analysis as described previously (6Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L.

The CD titrations were conducted in a stepwise manner adding small aliquots of 5–10 μl of ligand stock solution directly into the cuvette of 1 cm path length containing an initial volume of 520 μl of Hsp90 in 20 mm Tris-HCl. Each titration was terminated upon ligand saturation that never reached a final volume greater than 15% of the initial volume, and each CD spectrum was subsequently corrected for its dilution. To achieve the highest accuracy and precision, Finnpipette PCR with a volume range of 2–20 and 20–200 μl were used to add aliquots of ligand solution in a stepwise manner to reach the desired molar ratio for the solution of Hsp90 of the appropriate concentration. For a single binding site at equilibrium, the CD, expressed in ΔA, at any wavelength is proportional to the concentration of the bound and unbound species of the host (H) and ligand (L) components (as shown in Equation 1) (24Freeman D.J.

Equation 17 can be simplified if the ligand has no CD (ΔεL = 0) either because it has no absorbing chromophore in the UV region studied (25Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J.R. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or because it is non-chiral (26Siligardi G. Hussain R. Enantiomer. 1998; 3: 77-87PubMed Google Scholar) (see Equation 18).ΔA=(ΔɛHL−ΔɛH)({(K[HT]+K[LT]+1)−((K[HT]+K[LT]+1 )2−4KK[HT][LT] )−2}/2K)+ΔɛH[HT]Equation 18 The plot of the titration CD data at single wavelength versus the molar concentration of the ligand was analyzed by non-linear regression to Equation 18 as a function of ligand concentration to determine the dissociation constant Kd = 1/K. This equation is not only valid when only one component of the binary complex has intrinsic CD (one “active” CD component with bound and unbound species). It can also be applied to systems where both components show intrinsic CD, providing the data collected are transformed back to one active CD component system. This can be achieved by transforming the CD data to differential CD data (Δ(ΔA)) calculated by subtracting from each observed spectrum of the host-ligand mixture the equivalent CD contribution of the ligand. The ΔεL[LT ] component of Equation 17, which is the CD of the ligand added to the host, is subtracted, and ΔεHL − ΔεH becomes the new ΔεHL. In this way the fitted or simulated Equation 18resembles a Michaelis-Menten saturation curve rather than a change in slope of the curve generated by Equation 17. It is crucial to terminate the titration upon reaching saturation. As a rule of thumb, to achieve saturation within the ligand excess used in the CD titration, the total host concentration [HT ] should be ≥30 to 50 times the value of Kd. Obviously, for dissociation constant Kd in the order of 10−4 m, these conditions might not be achieved and hence saturation will not be reached, but as long as the plot ΔA versus ligand concentration is of parabolic type, the Kd can be still determined by Equation 18. For Kd in the region between 10−7 and 10−6 m, the plot is of Michaelis-Menten type of shape with saturation that can be achieved at 1:1 molar ratio stoichiometry. In the case of a ligand with no CD, the CD changes associated with the host plateau upon ligand saturation. In the case of a ligand with CD, the saturation is normally achieved with [LT ] ≥5–10-fold [HT ], and ΔεHLcan be calculated in a first approximation using the concentration of [HT ] = [HL] (that is all host molecules are bound to the ligand). With the best fitting achieved by either visual inspection or by Levenberg-Marquardt method, the calculated value of K can be used to calculate [HL] from Equation 16. From Beer's Law, a more accurate value of ΔεHL = ΔAHL/[HL] can be calculated and used again in Equation 18 to fit again the experimental CD data in order to determine a more accurate value of K and hence Kd. This method has been used to calculate the Kd value for 29 titrations of Hsp90 and several of its mutants with different ligands, such as ADP, ATP, AMP-PNP, Sti1, Cpr6, and geldanamycin (6Prodromou C.

Meyer, S. Singh, D. N. Woolfson, P. W. Piper, L. H. Pearl, and C. Prodromou, unpublished data. The Kd values determined from differential CD data were in very good agreement with those obtained from calorimetry. A similar approach has been used to determine the Kd values of binary complexes by a non-linear regression method (27Kurz L.C. Shah S. Crane B.R. Donald L.J. Duckworth H.W. Drysdale G.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7908-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using the difference CD obtained by subtracting the CD of the total added concentration of both host and ligand from the observed CD of the host-ligand complex. To address the question of whether X and Y form a binary complex, three CD spectra were measured ((X), (Y), and (X +Y)). Spectrum (X + Y) is the observed spectrum of X + Y, whereas spectrum ((X) + (Y)) is the simulated spectrum calculated by adding the observed spectrum of X to that of Y. If the observed and simulated spectra are identical, one can readily infer that there is no detectable interaction between X and Y, whereas if the spectra are different, there is unambiguously a binding interaction and hence a binary complex. To address the question whether X, Y, and Z form a ternary complex, eight CD spectra were measured ((X), (Y), (Z), (X + Y), (X + Z), (Y + Z), (X + Y + Z) and (X +Z + Y)). Spectrum (X + Y) is the observed spectrum of X + Y, whereas spectrum ((X + Y) + (Z)) is the simulated spectrum calculated by adding the observed spectrum of the binary complex X + Y to the observed spectrum of Z. Difference CD spectra {(X +Y) − (X)} and {(X +Z) − (X)} were calculated by subtracting the spectrum of the total concentration of (X) from the observed spectrum of the binary complexes (X + Y) and (X + Z), respectively. The observed spectra of (X + Y + Z) and (X +Z + Y) were compared with the simulated spectra ((X) + (Y) + (Z)), ((X +Y) + (Z)), ((X + Z) + (Y)), ((X) + (Y + Z)), ((X) + {(X + Y) − (X)} + {(X + Z) − (X)}). The simulated spectrum ((X) + (Y) + (Z)) is the sum of the spectra of each component as if no binding interactions were present among the three components X, Y, and Z. The simulated spectra ((X + Y) + (Z)), ((X +Z) + (Y)), ((X) + (Y +Z)) represent each of the three independent combinations of binary complexes together with the non-interacting third component. The simulated spectrum ((X + Y) + (Z)) can be seen as the spectrum obtained when component Z does not bind to the binary complex (X + Y). The simulated spectra ((X + Z) + (Y)) and ((X) + (Y + Z)) represent the displacement of Y and X, respectively, from their binary (X + Y) complex by ligand Z. Of course, if ligand Y and Z do not interact with each other, the simulated spectrum ((X) + (Y +Z)) is therefore redundant. The simulated spectrum ((X) + {(X + Y) − (X)} + {(X + Z) − (X)}) represents the spectrum as if a ternary complex was formed but without interactions between ligands Y and Z, namely without direct contacts. The difference CD components represent the CD changes associated with each binary complex. If none of the simulated spectra superimposes the observed spectra, it excludes all the possibilities described above. There is only one possibility left, which cannot be simulated, that all three components X, Y, and Z interact with each other upon forming the ternary complex. The apparently similar roles played by Cdc37p/p50cdc37 and by Sti1/Hop/p60 in the recruitment of client proteins to the Hsp90 complex prompted us to characterize the binding of Cdc37p and p50cdc37 to Hsp90 using CD spectroscopy. As observed previously with Sti1/Hop/p60 (6Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), the near-UV CD spectra obtained for mixtures of Hsp90 and Cdc37p cannot be simulated by linear combination of the individual spectra of Hsp90 and Cdc37p in isolation, indicating that Hsp90 and Cdc37p interact to form a complex (Fig. 1 A). Titration of Cdc37p into Hsp90 produces dose-dependent perturbations in the near-UV region (240–280 nm), and difference spectra (Fig. 1 B) were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the isolated co-chaperone (n molar equivalent) from the spectrum of Hsp90 + co-chaperone (1:n) mixtures. Although saturable changes in the near-UV region were not achieved due to the relatively weak binding of Cdc37p to Hsp90, the observed signals are consistent with changes in the environment of aromatic residues due to molecular interaction. The Kd value for the interaction of Cdc37p with Hsp90 was estimated as 113 ± 4 μm (Fig. 1 C). As in the case for Cdc37p, titration of human p50cdc37 into Hsp90 also produced dose-dependent perturbations in the near-UV region (240–280 nm). The difference spectra (Fig. 2 A) showed changes that initially peaked at a molar ratio between 1:1 and 1:1.4 (Hsp90:p50cdc37) and subsequently decreased at higher p50cdc37 concentrations. The behavior of these spectra is consistent with two different association processes occurring. The first phase results from binding of p50cdc37 to Hsp90 that saturates at ≈1:1, whereas the second phase results from self-association of excess p50cdc37. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the CD spectrum of p50cdc37 is concentration-dependent, consistent with self-association (Fig. 2 B). The Kd value calculated for the interaction of p50cdc37 with Hsp90 was 2.5 μm(Fig. 2 C) and that for p50cdc37 dimerization was 9.8 ± 1.9 μm (Fig. 2 D), assuming saturation of Hsp90 by p50cdc37 at a 1:1 molar ratio. Because binding of the mammalian p50cdc37 to Hsp90 was significantly tighter than that of its yeast orthologue Cdc37p, further analysis of interactions with Hsp90 was conducted mainly with p50cdc37. To confirm and quantitatively analyze the self-association of p50cdc37 observed in the CD studies, p50cdc37 oligomerization was analyzed by equilibrium sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge. Equilibrium data sets obtained were intermediate between theoretical traces calculated assuming ideal single species with molecular weights equal to one or two p50cdc37 units. These data could be fitted with high confidence to an equation describing a monomer-dimer equilibrium mixture (Fig. 3) with a Kd for the monomer-dimer transition of 5.5 μm (95% confidence limits = 4.4–7.1 μm) which is comparable with the results obtained by CD spectroscopy (Kd = 9.8 ± 1.9 μm). It has been demonstrated previously (16Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell.

To determine which domain was responsible for the inherent dimerization of p50cdc37, the separate N- and C-terminal domains of p50cdc37 were subjected to analytical centrifugation in a similar way to the full-length protein. For both domains the data could only be fitted with high confidence to an equation describing monomer-dimer equilibrium mixtures (results not shown) indicating that homodimerization is a consequence of both N to N-terminal domain and C to C-terminal domain interactions. However, dimerization of the N-terminal kinase-binding domain was very weak with a Kd estimated as 971 μm (95% confidence limits = 812–1160 μm) and that for the C-terminal domain was 167 μm (95% confidence limits = 145–192), indicating that the main dimerization interface is between the C-terminal domains. However, it should be noted that the p50cdc37 N-terminal domain used in the current studies lacks the first 29 N-terminal amino acids which, although relatively poorly conserved, could contribute to dimerization. The similar recruiting roles that Cdc37p/p50cdc37 and Sti1/Hop/p60 play in the Hsp90 system, and the fact that both are capable of dimerization and of binding to Hsp90 as dimers, led us to q"
https://openalex.org/W1979476810,"Membrane type 1 metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) is a transmembrane metalloprotease that plays a major role in the extracellular matrix remodeling, directly by degrading several of its components and indirectly by activating pro-MMP2. We investigated the effects of MT1-MMP overexpression on in vitro and in vivo properties of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells, which do not express MT1-MMP or MMP-2. MT1-MMP and MMP-2 cDNAs were either transfected alone or cotransfected. All clones overexpressing MT1-MMP 1) were able to activate endogenous or exogenous pro-MMP-2, 2) displayed an enhanced in vitro invasiveness through matrigel-coated filters independent of MMP-2 transfection, 3) induced the rapid development of highly vascularized tumors when injected subcutaneously in nude mice, and 4) promoted blood vessels sprouting in the rat aortic ring assay. These effects were observed in all clones overexpressing MT1-MMP regardless of MMP-2 expression levels, suggesting that the production of MMP-2 by tumor cells themselves does not play a critical role in these events. The angiogenic phenotype of MT1-MMP-producing cells was associated with an up-regulation of VEGF expression. These results emphasize the importance of MT1-MMP during tumor angiogenesis and open new opportunities for the development of anti-angiogenic strategies combining inhibitors of MT1-MMP and VEGF antagonists."

In the presence of α-lactalbumin (LA), the Gal acceptor specificity is altered from GlcNAc to Glc. Gal-T1 also transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to GlcNAc, but with only ∼0.1% of Gal-T activity. To understand this low GalNAc-transferase activity, we have carried out the crystal structure analysis of the Gal-T1·LA complex with UDP-GalNAc at 2.1-Å resolution. The crystal structure reveals that the UDP-GalNAc binding to Gal-T1 is similar to the binding of UDP-Gal to Gal-T1, except for an additional hydrogen bond formed between the N-acetyl group of GalNAc moiety with the Tyr-289 side chain hydroxyl group. Elimination of this additional hydrogen bond by mutating Tyr-289 residue to Leu, Ile, or Asn enhances the GalNAc-transferase activity. Although all three mutants exhibit enhanced GalNAc-transferase activity, the mutant Y289L exhibits GalNAc-transferase activity that is nearly 100% of its Gal-T activity, even while completely retaining its Gal-T activity. The steady state kinetic analyses on the Leu-289 mutant indicate that the Km for GlcNAc has increased compared to the wild type. On the other hand, the catalytic constant (kcat) in the Gal-T reaction is comparable with the wild type, whereas it is 3–5-fold higher in the GalNAc-T reaction. Interestingly, in the presence of LA, these mutants also transfer GalNAc to Glc instead of to GlcNAc. The present study demonstrates that, in the Gal-T family, the Tyr-289/Phe-289 residue largely determines the sugar donor specificity. β1,4-Galactosyltransferase I (Gal-T1) normally transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn2+ ion.

UCLA Forum Med. Sci. 1979; 21: 63-86Google Scholar), producing β1,4-linked galactosylated glycan. In addition to GlcNAc as an acceptor, the enzyme can also use other sugars, such as N-acyl-substituted glucosamines and N-acetyl-d-mannosamine, as acceptors (2Berliner L.J. Davis M.E. Ebner K.E. Beyer T.A. Bell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 62: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The enzyme does not have an absolute requirement for the sugar donor UDP-Gal; instead, it exhibits polymorphic donor specificity, in that it also transfers glucose (Glc), d-deoxy-Glc, arabinose, GalNAc, and GlcNAc from their UDP derivatives, albeit at low rates (0.3–5%) compared with Gal transfer (3Berliner L.J.

Kumar S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 255-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This activity is described as the lactose synthase (LS) activity of β4Gal-T1 (EC 2.4.1.22). LA has been shown to alter not only the sugar acceptor specificity of the enzyme, but also its sugar donor specificity (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol.

Commun. 2002; 291: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), because it stimulates the transfer of Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc. Similarly, it has been shown previously that the transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to GlcNAc by Gal-T1 is also enhanced in the presence of LA (5Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To better understand the modulation of substrate specificity, we had carried out a series of studies on the crystal structure of LA·Gal-T1 complex with various substrates (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Analysis of the molecular interactions between LA·Gal-T1 and Glc from the crystal structure suggested an explanation for the way in which LA modulates the acceptor specificity (10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The structural studies of the LA·Gal-T1 complex with UDP-Glc, together with the kinetic studies of Glc transfer from UDP-Glc to an acceptor sugar, also offered an explanation for the way in which LA modulates the donor specificity of Gal-T1 (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In our continuing efforts to understand the structure and function of Gal-T1, we examined in the present study the interaction of UDP-GalNAc with Gal-T1. The results suggest that the formation of a hydrogen bond between GalNAc and Tyr-289 is responsible for the poor GalNAc-transferase activity that Gal-T1 exhibits. On the other hand, mutation of Tyr-289 to leucine, isoleucine, or asparagine enhances the GalNAc-transferase activity. Among these mutants, Y289L has GalNAc-transferase activity that is nearly equal to Gal-T activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PCR method. Construction of the mutants was done using plasmid pEGT-d129 as the template; this contains a BamHI/EcoRI fragment inserted into pET23a vector, coding for residues 130–402 of bovine Gal-T1 (11Boeggeman E.E. Balaji P.V. Sethi N. Masibay A.S. Qasba P.K. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and has a Cys-342 to Thr mutation. The mutation primers corresponding to the upper DNA strand are: Y289L, 5′-CCTTACGTG CAATTG TTTGGAGGTGTCTCTGCTCTAAGTAAA-3′ and 5′-GACACCTCCAAA CAA TTGCACGTAAGGTAGGCTAAA-3′; Y289I, 5′-CTACCTTACGTGC AGATC TTTGGAGGTGTCTCTGCTCTAAG-3′ and 5′-GACACCTCCAA AGAT CTGCACGTAAGGTAGGCTAATCCAA-3′; Y286N, 5′-GGATTAGCCTAC CATATGTGCAGAAT TTTGGAGGTGTCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGAGACACCTCCAAAATT CTGCA CATATGGTAGGCTAAATCC-3′. The restriction sites are shown in italics and the mutation codon in bold letters. Typically, the entire Gal-T1 DNA was PCR-amplified as two fragments using the terminal cloning primers and two mutagenesis primers. The fragments were then cut with the restriction enzymes MfeI, BglII, and NdeI for Y286L, Y286I, and Y286N mutants, respectively, and ligated. The full Gal-T1 DNA with the mutation was amplified from the ligation mixture using the cloning primers and then inserted into the pET23a vector. Mutants were screened for the incorporated mutations, based on alterations in the restriction enzyme digestion patterns, and then sequenced. The positive clones were transformed into B834(DE3)pLysS cells as described previously (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were expressed and purified according to the published method (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, based on the method of Bradford and further verified on SDS gel. An in vitro assay procedure for Gal-T1 has been reported previously (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The activities were measured using UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc as sugar nucleotide donors, and GlcNAc and Glc as the acceptor sugars. For the specific activity measurements, a 100-μl incubation mixture containing 50 mm β-benzyl-GlcNAc, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 μm UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc, 20 ng of Gal-T1, and 0.5 μCi of [3H]UDP-Gal or [3H]UDP-GalNAc was used for each Gal-T or GalNAc-T reaction. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of cold 50 mm EDTA, and the mixture was passed through a 0.5-ml bed volume column of AG1-X8 cation resin (Bio-Rad) to remove any unreacted [3H]UDP-Gal or [3H]UDP-GalNAc. The column was washed successively with 300, 400, and 500 μl of water, and the column flow-through was diluted with Biosafe scintillation fluid; radioactivity was measured with a Beckman counter. A reaction without the acceptor sugar was used as a control. A similar assay was carried out to measure the GalNAc-T activity with Glc and other acceptors in the presence of 50 μm bovine LA (Sigma). The true Km of the donor (KA) and of the acceptor (KB), the dissociation constant of the donor, Ki(a), and kcat, were obtained using two-substrate analyses and the primary plots of five concentrations of donor (UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc) and five concentrations of acceptor, and the corresponding secondary plots of the intercepts and slopes. Initial rate conditions were linear with respect to time. A suitable range of donor and acceptor concentrations were chosen, which allowed an accurate Michaelis-Menten plot to be derived. The data were also analyzed for a general two-substrate system using the following equations (12Zhang Y. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the software EnzFitter, a Biosoft nonlinear curve-fitting program for Windows. ν=Vmax[A][B]Ki(a)KB+KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B]Equation 1 ν=Vmax[A][B]KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B]Equation 2 Here ν is the initial velocity and the rate equation for sequential symmetrical initial velocity pattern associated with Equation 1, an ordered or random equilibrium mechanism in which substrate A dissociates well from the E·S complex with a dissociation constant of Ki(a). Equation 2 is for asymmetric initial velocity pattern for a double-displacement or “ping-pong” mechanism. The kinetic parameters KA, KB, Ki(a), and Vmax, were obtained from the fitted curves using the above rate equations. The graphical method and EnzFitter program gave very similar kinetic parameters. In the GalNAc-T assay, the maximum substrate concentrations used for UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc were 1 and 200 mm, respectively. However, in the Gal-T assay, because of the limited solubility of GlcNAc in water, the concentration of GlcNAc was limited to no more than 400 mm (which is 2-fold higher than its Km value), whereas up to 300 μm UDP-Gal were used. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 1 ml that contained 100 μg of Y289L mutant plus 10 mm each triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, UDP-GalNAc, GlcNAc, and MnCl2at 37 °C for 48 h. The mixture was first passed through a 1-ml Chelex 100 column and then through a 1-ml cationic column containing AG1-X8 resin (200–400-mesh). The disaccharide product in the flow-through from 4 bed volumes was pooled and freeze-dried. The product was finally dissolved in 400 μl of D2O, and its1H NMR spectrum was obtained in a 400-MHz NMR spectrometer. The catalytic domain of the recombinant bovine Gal-T1 from residues 130 to 402 (mass ∼33 kDa) and mouse recombinant LA (mass ∼14 kDa) was co-crystallized in the presence of UDP-GalNAc and MnCl2. The crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop method, using 20 mg ml−1 Gal-T1 and 10 mg ml−1 LA in the presence of a substrate with the precipitant containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6, and 12.5% polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystals of the complex could only be obtained in the presence of 17 mm UDP-GalNAc and MnCl2. Complete three-dimensional x-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X9B, National Synchroton light source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using a Quantum-4 ccd detector with 1.02-Å wavelength. The frames were processed using DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to monoclinic, space group P21 with the cell constants a = 57.5, b = 95.7,c = 100.6 Å, and β = 101.4°. A total of 120,498 reflections were collected, of which 62,285 are unique (90% completeness), with an Rsym of 6.0%. The crystal structures were solved by the molecular replacement method, using AMORE (14Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of lactose synthase (9Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Qasba P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) without the substrate was used as the model for molecular replacement. After initial refinement, the difference electron density maps revealed the UDP-GalNAc and a Mn2+ ion bound to the Gal-T1 molecule and were included for further refinement. The two LS molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. All the refinements were carried out initially by XPLOR3.85, followed by CNS1.0 (15Brunger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Only reflections with F > 2ς(F) were used for the refinement. The final R factor for the 55,765 reflections is 23.2% with Rfree (10% reflections) is 27%. The mean r.m.s. deviations of the bond lengths and angles are 0.001 Å and 0.01°, respectively. All the figures were drawn using MOLSCRIPT (16Karulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The overall molecular structure and the interactions between Gal-T1 and LA molecules in the Gal-T1·LA·UDP-GalNAc·Mn2+ are quite similar to those observed in the previous crystal structure of Gal-T1·LA·UDP· Mn2+ complex (10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mean r.m.s. deviation on Cα atoms between these two structures is only 0.7 Å (Fig. 1 A), indicating that binding of UDP-GalNAc has neither perturbed the crystal structure of Gal-T1 nor its interactions with LA. In the crystal structure the UDP-GalNAc molecule and a Mn2+ ion could be clearly located from the electron density maps. The Mn2+ ion exhibits six coordinations: two with UDP-GalNAc, three with Gal-T1, and one with a water molecule (Table I). Although these coordinations are quite similar to those found in the previous crystal structure of the Gal-T1·LA·sugar nucleotide·metal complexes (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the sixth coordination with a water molecule has not been observed. Even though there is enough space available for this water molecule to coordinate with the Mn2+ ion in the previous crystal structures, none was observed (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J.

This may be because of the presence of the bulky N-acetyl group in UDP-GalNAc, which may better trap the water molecule.Table IMn2+ ion coordination distances in the crystal structure of Gal-T1·LA·UDP-GalNAc·Mn2+ResidueAtomDistance in molecule-1Distance in molecule-2ÅÅHis-347Nε22.432.29UDP-GalNAcO(Pα)2.242.17UDP-GalNAcO(Pβ)2.312.25Met-344Sδ2.842.82Asp-252Oδ22.222.36WaterO2.572.35Unlike the earlier crystal structures (7Ramakrishnan B.

Although the interactions of Gal-T1 with the GalNAc moiety of UDP-GalNAc are similar to the interactions of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal (17Ramakrishnan B. Balaji P.V. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), additional interactions are observed between the N-acetyl group of UDP-GalNAc with Gal-T1 (Fig. 1 B). In the Gal-T1·UDP-Gal complex, the O2 hydroxyl group forms only one hydrogen bond with Asp-252, but in the present crystal structure the N2 nitrogen atom is hydrogen-bonded to the Asp-252 side chain carboxylate oxygen atom, whereas the carbonyl oxygen atom is hydrogen-bonded to the Tyr-289 side chain hydroxyl group. The presence of the N-acetyl group seems to have perturbed the conformation of both the GalNAc and the Tyr-286 side chain. The orientation of the N-acetyl group with respect to the sugar ring is represented by the torsion angle H2-C2-N2-HN, which in the case of GalNAc, GlcNAc, and ManNAc was observed to be nearly 180 ° (18Rao V.S.R. Qasba P.K. Balaji P.V. Chandrasekaran R. Conformation of Carbohydrates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands1998Google Scholar). In the present crystal structure, there are two Gal-T1·LA·UDP-GalNAc·Mn2+ molecules in the asymmetric unit; in one molecule the torsion angle is 150° and in the other it is 120°, suggesting the existence of the N-acetyl group in an unfavorable orientation. This unfavorable orientation is a result of the lack of space between the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr-289 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group. In the two molecules of the asymmetric unit, because of this slight difference in the torsion angle of H2-C2-N2-HN, orientation of the side chain of Tyr-289 is slightly different to accommodate the N-acetyl group. Among the interactions of the N-acetyl group of UDP-GalNAc with the Gal-T1 molecule, the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group and the Tyr-289 side chain hydroxyl group seems to cause steric hindrance for catalysis. Studies using positional isotope exchange, secondary deuterium isotope effects, and inhibition of catalytic activity by acceptor analogs have suggested a plausible catalytic mechanism for the Gal-T1 (19Kim S.C. Singh A.N. Raushel F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Hindsgaul O. Kaur K. Srivastava G. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Crawley S.C. Heerze L.D.

According to this mechanism, upon a nucleophilic attack from the O4 hydroxyl group of the acceptor molecule, Gal moiety, during its separation from UDP-Gal in the transition state complex, exits with a substantial sp2 character at the anomeric center C1. Such an oxocarbonium ion intermediate forms a covalent linkage with the O4 oxygen atom, forming a β1–4 glycosidic linkage between galactose and the acceptor molecule. Because it is not feasible to obtain the crystal structure of Gal-T1 in the presence of both donor and acceptor molecules to determine the nature of interactions between the substrates and Gal-T1, we have carried out modeling studies based on the individual donor and acceptor bound to Gal-T1 structures (10Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,17Ramakrishnan B. Balaji P.V. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the O4 hydroxyl group of the acceptor lines up against the anomeric center C1 of the bound UDP-Gal molecule at 4.5 Å (Fig. 2 A). During catalysis, this assembly of the substrates in the catalytic pocket requires the displacement of the substrates toward each other. Because any displacement of the acceptor GlcNAc toward the donor is prevented by Trp-314, it is most likely that the donor Gal moiety moves toward the acceptor during catalysis. In the Gal-T reaction, when the Gal moiety is involved during catalysis, there is enough space between the C2 atom of Gal and the side chain of Tyr-289, as the O2 hydroxyl group of Gal is facing away from the Tyr-289 residue (Fig. 2 A). However, in the crystal structure of Gal-T1·LA·UDP-GalNAc·Mn2+, the bulky N-acetyl group of GalNAc occupies this space with its carbonyl oxygen atom hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-289 (Fig. 2 B). We hypothesized from this observation that, during catalysis, this hydrogen bond is expected to hinder the reaction by not allowing the GalNAc moiety to move toward the acceptor molecule. Second, because of lack of available space between the N-acetyl group and Tyr-289, the former exists in a less favorable orientation. To create the space in the Gal-T1 molecule in the vicinity of the N-acetyl group binding site of UDP-GalNAc, we mutated the Tyr-289 residue to Leu, Ile, or Asn (Fig. 2 C). A phenylalanine mutation was not considered, because it does not create enough space when the N-acetyl group adopts its favorable conformation. Although Leu or Asn residue substitution creates a similar pocket because of the similarity of their side chain length (Fig. 2 C), Leu is expected to create a hydrophobic pocket whereas Asn creates a hydrophilic one. Additionally, because of its shorter side chain length, an Ile substitution would be expected to create even a larger pocket size than the Leu substitution. Thus, investigations of these three mutants were expected to identify the required size and the nature of the pocket in the vicinity of the N-acetyl group-binding site of UDP-GalNAc. The mutants Y289L, Y289N, and Y289I exhibit both Gal-T and GalNAc-T activities at the saturation substrate concentrations (Table II and Fig. 3). The mutants Y289L and Y289N exhibit equally strong Gal-T and GalNAc-T activities, suggesting that a Leu or Asn substitution of Tyr-289 seems to create the required optimal space. The specific GalNAc-T activity of the mutant Y289I at the saturation concentration is half that of Y289L (Table II); it exhibits a slightly weaker affinity to UDP-GalNAc (Fig. 3). Therefore, an Ile substitution seems to create more than the required space, thus reducing the specific activities. Although Asn substitution exhibits the GalNAc-T activity as well as the Leu substitution, the protein seems to be less stable and tends to denature rapidly compared with the Leu mutant. It has been shown that wt-Gal-T1 exhibits a very low glucosyltransferase activity (Glc-T), but no N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-T) activity (3Berliner L.J. Robinson R.D. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6340-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Ramakrishnan B.

On the contrary, the mutants exhibit reasonable GlcNAc-T activity (Table II) where they transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the acceptor GlcNAc but do not exhibit Glc-T activity. It is interesting to note that in this GlcNAc-T activity the initial product, the disaccharide GlcNAc β1,4-GlcNAc, itself is an acceptor for the enzyme, thus producing tri- and longer chain saccharides. A separate study on this GlcNAc-T property is being carried out.Table IISpecific activities of the catalytic domain of Gal-T1 (d129-Gal-T1, residues 130–402) with C342T mutation and the Tyr-289 mutantsEnzymeUDP-galactose → GlcNAc Gal-T activityUDP-GalNAc → GlcNAc GalNAc-T activityUDP-GlcNAc → GlcNAc GlcNAc-T activitypmol/min/ngpmol/min/ngpmol/min/ngC342T11.80.10Y289L_C342T16.227.38.2Y289I_C342T3.814.76.2Reactions were performed under saturating conditions of all substrates (see “Materials and Methods” for assay conditions). In these reactions, the concentration for the donors was at 500 μmand the acceptor β-benzyl-GlcNAc was at 25 mm. In the Gal-T reaction of C342T, the acceptor concentration was 10 mm, because at 25 mm it showed inhibition. Because Y289N rapidly undergoes denaturization, reliable data could not be obtained. Open table in a new tab Reactions were performed under saturating conditions of all substrates (see “Materials and Methods” for assay conditions). In these reactions, the concentration for the donors was at 500 μmand the acceptor β-benzyl-GlcNAc was at 25 mm. In the Gal-T reaction of C342T, the acceptor concentration was 10 mm, because at 25 mm it showed inhibition. Because Y289N rapidly undergoes denaturization, reliable data could not be obtained. Because the Y289L variant of Gal-T1 exhibits both Gal-T and GalNAc-T enzyme activities with equal efficiencies, double substrate kinetic studies were carried out to determine the kinetic constants for both the donor and acceptor molecules. The kinetic data from both reactions fit best to Equation 2, with a zero Ki(a) value, describing an asymmetric initial velocity pattern for a double-displacement or “ping-pong” mechanism. The Y289L mutant in the Gal-T reaction shows for the acceptor nearly 20-fold higher Km than the wild-type Gal-T1 (Table III). The catalytic constant (kcat) in the Gal-T1 reaction is comparable with the wild type, but it is nearly 3–5-fold higher in the GalNAc-T reaction (Table III). It is possible that this high kcat was achieved either by stabilizing the transition state or by the increase in the free energy of the ternary complex. Although the mutation was designed to eliminate the steric hindrance caused by Tyr-289 during the transition state, the latter possibility cannot be ruled out because of the observed high Km value for the acceptor GlcNAc. In the crystal structure of Gal-T1, the residues around Tyr-289 are involved in the acceptor binding. The lack of an aromatic side chain at position 289 may destabilize these residues, thus affecting the binding of the acceptor substrate. This is substantiated by the earlier mutational studies on human Gal-T1, where substitution by Phe for the corresponding residue Tyr-287 does not affect the acceptor binding, whereas substitution with Gly totally abolished the catalytic activity (22Aoki D. Appert H.E. Johnson D. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Currently, mutational studies are being carried out to enhance the acceptor affinity of Y289L mutant to determine which mechanism is responsible for the high catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the donor and the acceptor substrates by Y289L_C342T mutant in the Gal-T and GalNAc-T catalytic reactions (see text for assay conditions)MutantGal-T UDP-galactose → GlcNAcGalNAc-T UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine → GlcNAcKAKBkcatKAKBkcatμmmms−1μmmms−1C342T93 (6)11 (1)14NDNDNDY289L_C342T75 (1)198 (1)8.5354 (3)51 (1)40ND, not determined.

Although the weak GalNAc-T activity of the wild-type Gal-T1 had been demonstrated in the earlier studies and the product disaccharide, di-N-acetyllactosediamine (LacdiNAc), was characterized by1H NMR technique, no details were reported (6Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the Y289L mutant exhibits equally high GalNAc-T activity as it does Gal-T activity, the disaccharide product from this reaction was purified and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Previously, the same product LacdiNAc, from a N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase isolated from bovine mammary gland, had been fully characterized by1H NMR spectroscopy (23Van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Schiphorst W.E. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The present NMR spectrum is quite similar to that of the already characterized LacdiNAc, demonstrating that the mutant Y289L transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to GlcNAc, forming a β1–4 linkage between GalNAc and GlcNAc. In humans, the β4Gal-T family has seven members (Gal-T1 to -T7), each with high sequence identity within their catalytic domain (24Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Waskisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These family members are known to transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to different sugar acceptors. For example, Gal-T6 transfers Gal to Glc of Glc-ceramide, whereas Gal-T7 transfers Gal to xylose (25Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Waskisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Among these seven members, four members, Gal-T1 to Gal-T4, have a Tyr residue at position 287 (which corresponds to Tyr-289 in bovine Gal-T1), whereas Gal-T5 and Gal-T6 have a Phe residue. Mutational studies in human Gal-T1 have shown that theY287F mutant exhibits the same enzyme characteristics with kinetic constants as that of the wild-type Gal-T1 (22Aoki D. Appert H.E. Johnson D. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the Phe residue may also create a similar steric problem for UDP-GalNAc as the Tyr residue, these enzymes are expected to exhibit low GalNAc-T activity. It is interesting to note that the family members show variation in their codon nucleotide sequence for residue 287 (Table IV), particularly at the second and third nucleotide positions of the codon. A mutation of the first nucleotide base thymidine (T) to either adenine (A) or cytidine (C) would result in a mutation of the Tyr/Phe residue to either Leu or Asn. Such a spontaneous point mutation at the first nucleotide position of the codon for the residue 287 would generate an enhanced equal GalNAc-transferase activity that might have adverse effects. Incorporation of GalNAc instead of Gal might lead to 1) termination of the total synthesis of a glycoconjugate, or 2) glycans with different oligosaccharide sequence. It is worth noting, however, that, although mutants may possess dual enzyme activities, the substitution of Gal by GalNAc is expected to be highly irregular and will depend on whether or not UDP-GalNAc is available in the Golgi apparatus.Table IVCodon usage for the amino acid at position 289 among the Gal-T1 family membersEnzymeCodonAmino acid at position 289Bovine Gal-T1T ATTyrHuman Gal-T1T ATTyrHuman Gal-T2T ACTyrHuman Gal-T3T ACTyrHuman Gal-T4T ATTyrHuman Gal-T5T TTPheHuman Gal-T6T TCPheHuman Gal-T7T ACTyrIn human Gal-T1 the corresponding amino acid is at position 287.

Although Gal-T1 transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to GlcNAc with ∼0.1% of its Gal-T efficiency, it has been shown that LA enhances this transfer (5Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a situation similar to glucosyltransferase activity (Glc-T) of Gal-T1, where LA increases this activity from 0.3 to 10% (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have shown previously through crystal structure and enzyme kinetic studies that, in the Glc-T reaction, LA plays a kinetics role in stimulating Gal-T1 to transfer Glc from the UDP-Glc to GlcNAc (7Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Qasba P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although we have not carried out detailed kinetic studies on the GalNAc-T reaction by the wild-type Gal-T1 in the presence of LA, the similarity between Glc-T and GalNAc-T catalytic activities indicates that LA probably plays a similar role in the GalNAc-T reaction. It has been stated that LA enhances this GalNAc-T activity to 55% of its Gal-T activity (5Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, we find that the activity is enhanced only to nearly 1% (data not shown). This may have been because of the differences in the assay methods. For example, in the present study and the studies reported by others (12Zhang Y. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the donor concentration is determined by the unlabeled UDP-sugar, and only a small amount of 3H-labeled UDP-sugar is used during the assay. Therefore, the catalytic activity is determined accurately by the amount of unlabeled UDP-sugar used, whereas, in the previous study (5Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the specific activity of the 3H-labeled UDP-GalNAc provided by the manufacturer was used to determine the specific activity of the enzyme. Unlike wt-Gal-T1, where LA stimulates the transfer of GalNAc only to GlcNAc and not to Glc (5Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the Tyr-289 mutants (Y289L, Y289N, and Y289I) in the presence of LA transfer GalNAc preferably to Glc rather than to GlcNAc. This property is quite similar to LS activity in which the wt-Gal-T1 in the presence of LA transfers Gal to Glc instead to GlcNAc (Table V). Furthermore, like wt-Gal-T1, these mutants also transfer Gal to Glc in the presence of LA (data not shown). For example, an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity in the bovine mammary gland extracts with a similar catalytic property has been identified (26Van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Schiphorst W.E. Van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This enzyme also transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to GlcNAc in the absence of LA, whereas in the presence of LA it transfers GalNAc to Glc instead to GlcNAc. In fact, a small amount of the lactose analogue GalNAcβ1–4Glc is found in the milk (26Van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Schiphorst W.E. Van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the protein sequence for this N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase is not yet known. Thus, it seems that an N- acetylgalactosaminyltransferase enzyme is present in cells with enzyme properties similar to the present mutants. The exact nature and the function of the oligosaccharide synthesized involving this enzyme are not yet known. It has been pointed out that, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, large amounts of N-glycans are found to carry GalNAc instead of Gal, linked β1,4 to GlcNAc (27Van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Koistinen H.

In all the measurements, the acceptor concentration was 100 mm and the LA concentration was 55 μm. The crystal structure of UDP-GalNAc bound to Gal-T1 shows that the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group of GalNAc is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-289, which hinders the transfer of GalNAc during catalysis. For the Gal-T1 to function efficiently as GalNAc-T, an optimal space for the binding of the N-acetyl group of UDP-GalNAc to Gal-T1 is required, and such a space need not be hydrophobic nor hydrophilic in nature. In the present study, we have shown that the Tyr-289 mutants of Gal-T1, which have an optimal space for the binding of N-acetyl group, exhibit as high GalNAc-T activity as Gal-T activity, as well as GlcNAc-T activity. In the human Gal-T family members, the Tyr/Phe residue at 287 (or in bovine Tyr-289) seems to be important for determining the donor sugar specificity of these enzymes, and mutation of this residue broadens the donor specificity of the enzyme. The present study suggests that a single point mutation can result in glycan moieties substituting Gal with GalNAc or GlcNAc, which may have significant effects on cellular functions."

The function of TFF1 in breast cancer is unknown. To test the hypothesis that it promotes tumor dissemination, we produced recombinant TFF1 and assessed its ability to stimulate the movement of breast cancer cells by using in vitro wounding and migration assays. Recombinant TFF1 stimulated migration at concentrations of TFF1 found in culture medium. Migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which secrete TFF1, was stimulated by lower concentrations of TFF1 than MDA MB231 cells that do not produce TFF1. Dimeric TFF1, linked by a disulfide bond, and monomeric TFF1 are produced by estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines. Recombinant TFF1 dimer was eightfold more potent than TFF1 monomer, implying that the interaction of TFF1 with its receptor is facilitated by dimerization. The majority of TFF1-stimulated migration resulted from chemotaxis, but dimeric TFF1 stimulated some chemokinesis. These results show that estrogens can stimulate the motility of breast cancer cells via the induction of TFF1 and suggest that one reason for the efficacy of hormonal therapies is their ability to reduce expression of TFF1 and, hence, the migration of breast tumor cells."

In the full-length enzyme, phosphorylation of Thr229 and Thr389 is tightly regulated by growth factors and inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin treatment (10Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B.

A significant degree of resistance to both inhibitors is achieved by substituting acidic residues for Thr389 and for the carboxyl-terminal Ser/Thr-Pro sites in the autoinhibitory domain (11Pearson R.B.

Interestingly, the element of sensitivity displayed by S6K1-E389D3E in the presence of either inhibitor is roughly equivalent to its ability to be activated by mitogens, an effect thought to be mediated by Thr229phosphorylation (11Pearson R.B.

Efficient Thr229 phosphorylation appears to require Thr389 phosphorylation and the Ser/Thr-Pro sites in the autoinhibitory domain (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol.

In support of this hypothesis, membrane-targeted alleles of the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110, constitutively activate PKB and S6K1 (22Dufner A. Andjelkovic M. Burgering B.M.T. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

However, no significant changes were observed in the ability of PDK1, derived from cells treated with either mitogens or the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, to phosphorylate S6K1-E389D3E in vitro (16Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to S6K1, S6K1-E389D3E has elevated basal levels of Thr229 phosphorylation (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that PDK1 is constitutively active and only requires disruption of the carboxyl and amino termini in S6K1 to access Thr229 (16Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar,18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The findings above raised the possibility that mitogen-induced increases in S6K1-E389D3E activity, as well as its sensitivity to wortmannin and rapamycin, were mediated through a phosphorylation site distinct from Thr229. To test this possibility, phosphospecific antibodies to Thr229 were generated to analyze its role in regulating S6K1-E389D3E activity by mitogens, rapamycin, and wortmannin. These results led to the finding that S6K1-E389D3E activation is regulated through a distinct phosphorylation site, which is rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive, and which serves as a direct substrate for mTOR. Unless otherwise stated, all S6K1 constructs were expressed as fusion proteins from a cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector, which was amino-terminally Myc- or HA-tagged as described elsewhere (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Where referred to, S6K1 is the cytoplasmic isoform. HA-tagged mTOR and mTOR-KI (D2537E) have been described (2Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged PDK1-KI (K111Q, D205N, D223N) was a kind gift from M. Frodin. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, 106 HEK 293 cells were seeded per 10-cm culture dish, and then, 24 h later, the cells were transiently transfected with 1–20 μg of the appropriate construct, using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Where required, the final DNA concentration was brought to 20 μg with empty vector. After 12 h, the cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained in same media for an additional 24 h prior to treatment and extraction. Where indicated, cells were treated with either 100 nm insulin or 10% serum for 30 min and were pretreated with 20 nm rapamycin or 250 nm wortmannin for 15 min prior to insulin stimulation and extraction. Cells were extracted for S6K1 as described previously (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or for mTOR in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C prior to flash freezing in liquid N2and storage at −70 °C. Determination of protein concentrations, S6 kinase assays, immunoblotting, and chemiluminescence were carried out as previously described (2Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the acrylamide concentrations were decreased from 10 to 6%, which allowed resolution of the S6K1 phosphoderivatives. Phosphospecific antibodies against Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 of S6K1 were obtained from New England Biolabs and used as directed. mTOR kinase assays were performed as follows. HA-mTOR and Myc- or HA-S6K1 were separately extracted from transiently transfected 293 cells. The mTOR and S6K1 immunocomplexes were each prepared separately, incubated with the specific antibodies, mixed together, incubated with protein G beads, and washed extensively. Where indicated, the immunocomplex was incubated with GST-FKBP12 and rapamycin in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm ATP at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture was washed to remove excess ATP and then further incubated with 40 S ribosomes in a kinase buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 m β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP. Following SDS-PAGE, the upper or middle part of the gel was cut, transferred to membrane, and immunoblotted with the specific antibodies against mTOR or S6K1, respectively. The lower part of SDS-PAGE was analyzed by autoradiography or storage phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) to measure S6 phosphorylation. GST constructs for FKBP12 were prepared in pGEX5T-1 vector (Promega) and purified as described (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 h after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, the cells were collected by centrifuge, lysed in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol), sonicated, and centrifuged for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the recombinant proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione (Sigma). Phosphospecific antibodies directed against Thr229 and Ser371 were produced by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the following synthetic phosphopeptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: Thr229 (GTVTHT*FCGTI) and Ser371 (FTRQTPVDS*PDDSTLS). Nonphosphospecific antibodies were removed by adsorption to a peptide column generated from the nonphosphorylated peptide sequence. Phosphospecific antibodies that passed through this column were passed over a column composed from the phosphopeptide sequence and after washing antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and then dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline. The specificity of the Thr229phosphospecific antibodies was confirmed by probing a Western blot containing wild type S6K1 and S6K1-A229. The S6K1 variant, S6K1-E389D3E, which harbors acidic residues at both Thr389 and in the autoinhibitory domain Ser/Thr-Pro sites (Fig. 1 A), has increased basal kinase activity, which can be further augmented by serum or insulin stimulation (14Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30von Manteuffel S.R. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The assumption has been that the increase in basal activity is through increased phosphorylation of Thr229 in the activation loop, facilitated by the acidic amino acid substitutions in the linker and autoinhibitory domain (11Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 21: 5279-5287Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The additional increase in insulin-induced S6K1-E389D3E activity was thought to be catalyzed by the activation of PI3K, leading to increased production of phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate and activation of PDK1, the Thr229 kinase (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the activity of PDK1 appears to be constitutive and refractile to mitogen stimulation (19Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and, with regard to S6K1 activation, phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate-independent (15Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 16Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Thr229 phosphorylation in mediating S6K1-E389D3E activation, a Myc-tagged variant was ectopically expressed in 293 cells, and following insulin stimulation, the state of Thr229 phosphorylation was monitored with a phosphospecific antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a control, Thr229 phosphorylation was followed in parallel in a Myc-tagged wild type S6K1 (Myc-S6K-WT), transiently expressed in 293 cells. Consistent with earlier studies by two-dimensional phosphopeptide analyses (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Thr229 phosphorylation and S6 kinase activity in Myc-S6K-WT were increased following insulin treatment (Fig. 1 B). However, Thr229phosphorylation and S6 kinase activity in Myc-S6K1-E389D3E were already elevated in serum-deprived cells (Fig 1 B). It should be noted that the extent to which basal activity of Myc-S6K1-E389D3E is elevated varies as a function of expression level (14Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30von Manteuffel S.R. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Following insulin treatment, Thr229 phosphorylation did not increase further, despite the fact that kinase activity toward S6 was increased (Fig1 B). Consistent with PDK1 mediating Thr229phosphorylation, a Myc-tagged kinase inactive variant of PDK1 (Myc-PDK1-KI) (31Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), when co-expressed with Myc-S6K1-E389D3E, lowered basal and insulin-induced Thr229 phosphorylation as well as S6 kinase activity (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these findings indicate that increased Thr229 phosphorylation in S6K1-E389D3E is not responsible for an insulin-induced increase in S6 kinase activity and that other phosphorylation sites or activating mechanisms must mediate this response. In previous studies, four additional residues, Thr367, Ser371, Ser404, and Thr447, were identified as insulin-induced phosphorylation sites (11Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 21: 5279-5287Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, when either the serine or threonine residues at 367, 404, and 447 were individually replaced by either alanine or by an acidic amino acid, these variants showed no difference in kinase activity with mitogen treatment, as compared with wild type S6K1 (11Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 21: 5279-5287Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, conversion of Ser371 to either alanine or aspartic acid abolished kinase activity (13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analysis of Ser371phosphorylation by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping following tryptic digestion is difficult, since this phosphorylation site migrates with several incomplete tryptic digestion products in a poorly resolved area of the chromatogram (13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To resolve this, an anti-phospho-Ser371-specific antibody was developed (see “Experimental Procedures”), which recognizes phosphorylated Ser371. Insulin stimulation of 293 cells transiently expressing Myc-S6K-WT led to an approximately 2-fold increase in Ser371 phosphorylation in the kinase (Fig. 2 A), compatible with previous observations by two-dimensional phosphopeptide chromatography (13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This increase is paralleled by an increase in Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), as monitored with a previously described anti-phospho-Thr421/Ser424-specific antibody (32Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-., P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). These sites, like Ser371, also have a proline in the +1-position and a hydrophobic residue in the −2-position. To ensure the specificity of the anti-phospho-Ser371 antibody, its ability to recognize phosphorylated Ser371 was examined in the Myc-S6K1-S371A variant, having an alanine substituted at this site. The results show that the anti-phospho-Ser371-specific antibody did not recognize the Ser371 variant, despite increased phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser424(Fig. 2 A). It is also evident that the alanine substitution has little effect on overall S6K1 phosphorylation as evidenced by the decreased mobility of the protein in low acrylamide gels (see “Experimental Procedures”), consistent with earlier findings (13Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of Ser371 in the kinase-inactive allele of S6K1, S6K1-KI, was clearly observed (Fig. 2 A), indicating that Ser371 phosphorylation is not an autophosphorylation event. To determine whether Ser371 phosphorylation is still regulated in S6K1-E389D3E, its level of phosphorylation was monitored in Myc-S6K1-E389D3E following transient expression in either quiescent or insulin-stimulated 293 cells. The results show that although basal levels of Ser371 are elevated in quiescent cells, they are further increased following insulin stimulation, but as shown in Fig. 1 A, there is no corresponding effect on Thr229 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). These data are consistent with Ser371 being the site responsible for mediating S6K1-E389D3E activation. In previous studies, we have shown that S6K1-E389D3E retains an element of sensitivity to rapamycin and wortmannin, which is roughly equivalent to its ability to be activated by mitogens (14Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This effect would not appear to be mediated through Thr229 phosphorylation, since ectopically expressed PDK1 is resistant to both inhibitors (16Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of the two inhibitors on insulin-induced Thr229 and Ser371 phosphorylation"
https://openalex.org/W1817574342,"At sites of ongoing inflammation, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, neutrophils) migrate across vascular endothelia, and such transmigration has the potential to disturb barrier properties and can result in intravascular fluid loss and edema. It was recently appreciated that endogenous pathways exist to dampen barrier disruption during such episodes and may provide an important anti-inflammatory link. For example, during transmigration, PMN-derived adenosine activates endothelial adenosine receptors and induces a cAMP-dependent resealing of endothelial barrier function. In our study reported here, we sought to understand the link between cyclic nucleotide elevation and increased endothelial barrier function. Initial studies revealed that adenosine-induced barrier function is tightly linked to activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Because PKA selectively phosphorylates serine and threonine residues, we screened zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) immunoprecipitates for the existence of such phosphorylated proteins as targets for barrier regulation. This analysis revealed a dominantly phosphorylated band at 50 kDa. Microsequencing identified this protein as vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), an actin binding protein with multiple serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that VASP localizes to endothelial junctional complexes and colocalizes with ZO-1, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1). To address the role of phospho-VASP in regulation of barrier function, we generated a phosphospecific VASP antibody targeting the Ser157 residue phosphorylation site, the site preferred by PKA. Immunolocalization studies with this antibody revealed that upon PKA activation, phospho-VASP appears at cell-cell junctions. Transient transfection of truncated VASP fragments revealed a parallel increase in barrier function. Taken together, these studies reveal a central role for phospho-VASP in the coordination of PKA-regulated barrier function, such as occurs during episodes of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2010129998,"Anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide) is an endocannabinoid that belongs to the acylethanolamide lipid family. It is produced by neurons in a calcium-dependent manner and acts through cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Other members of the acylethanolamide lipid family are also produced by neurons and act through G-protein-coupled receptors: homo-γ-linolenylethanolamide (HEA) and docosatetraenylethanolamide (DEA) act through CB1 receptors, palmitylethanolamide (PEA) acts through CB2-like receptors, and oleylethanolamide (OEA) acts through receptors that have not yet been cloned. Although it is clear that anandamide and other acylethanolamides play a major role in neuronal signaling, whether astrocytes also produce these lipids is unknown. We developed a chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method that allows femtomole detection and quantification of anandamide and other acylethanolamides. Using this method, we unambiguously detected and quantified anandamide, HEA, DEA, PEA, and OEA in mouse astrocytes in culture. Stimulation of mouse astrocytes with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, enhanced the production of anandamide, HEA, and DEA, whereas PEA and OEA levels were unchanged. Endothelin-1, a peptide known to act on astrocytes, enhanced the production of anandamide, without affecting the levels of other acylethanolamides. These results show that astrocytes produce anandamide, HEA, and DEA in a calcium-dependent manner and that anandamide biosynthesis can be selectively stimulated under physiologically relevant conditions. The relative levels of acylethanolamides in astrocytes from rat and human were different from the relative levels of acylethanolamides in mouse astrocytes, indicating that the production of these lipids differs between species. Because astrocytes are known to express CB1 receptors and inactivate endocannabinoids, our finding strongly suggests the existence of a functional endocannabinoid signaling system in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033728702,"A yeast two-hybrid assay was employed to identify androgen receptor (AR) protein partners in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal cells. By using an AR deletion construct (AR-(Δ371–485)) as a bait, β-catenin was identified as an AR-interacting protein from a gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal cell library. Immunolocalization of co-transfected AR and FLAG-β-catenin demonstrated that FLAG-β-catenin was predominantly cytoplasmic in the absence of androgen. In the presence of 5α-dihydrotestosterone, FLAG-β-catenin completely co-localized to the nucleus with AR. This effect was specific to AR because liganded progesterone, glucocorticoid, or estrogen α receptors did not translocate FLAG-β-catenin to the nucleus. Agonist-bound AR was required because the AR antagonists casodex and hydroxyflutamide failed to translocate β-catenin. Time course experiments demonstrated that co-translocation occurred with similar kinetics. Nuclear co-localization was independent of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β, p42/44 ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways because inhibitors of these pathways had no effect. Transcription assays demonstrated that liganded AR repressed β-catenin/T cell factor-responsive reporter gene activity. Conversely, co-expression of β-catenin/T cell factor repressed AR stimulation of AR-responsive reporter gene activity. Our data suggest that liganded AR shuttles β-catenin to the nucleus and that nuclear interaction of AR with β-catenin may modulate transcriptional activity in androgen target tissues.

Weigel N.L. Marcelli M. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 199-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In androgen target cells, AR is predominantly localized in the cytoplasmic fraction in the absence of ligand and translocates to the nucleus in the presence of the endogenous androgens, testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), where it activates transcription of AR-responsive genes (2Simental J.A.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition to the genomic actions of AR, nongenomic signaling mechanisms of androgens have also been described in several cell systems. Through activation of the Src/Shc/ERK signaling pathway, AR was shown to be anti-apoptotic in osteoblasts, osteocytes, embryonic fibroblasts, and HeLa cells (4Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

Activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by AR has also been demonstrated in prostate cancer cell lines (5Peterziel H. Mink S. Schonert A. Becker M. Klocker H. Cato A.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In bone, androgens have been shown to increase intracellular calcium, diacylglycerol, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation (6Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol.

Several androgen-response elements are also recognized by the glucocorticoid receptor, and it is believed that protein-protein interactions play a role to discriminate AR- versus GR-mediated effects at these sites (8Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Other nuclear factors that modulate AR transcriptional activity include cAMP-response element-binding protein, AP-1, and members of the POU family of homeodomain transcription factors (8Adler A.J.

Protein-protein interactions are also involved in the role of AR as a transcriptional repressor independent of DNA binding. Recently, the mechanism of AR repression of the α-glycoprotein hormone subunit gene in the αT3-1 pituitary gonadotrope cell line was found to be through interactions with c-Jun and ATF-2 (12Jorgensen J.S. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1496-1504PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of the luteinizing hormone β subunit gene involved protein-protein interactions between AR and SF-1 (13Jorgensen J.S. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1505-1516PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate study, AR-mediated repression of the luteinizing hormone β subunit gene was also found to occur through protein-protein interactions with Sp1 and to a lesser degree Egr-1 (14Curtin D. Jenkins S. Farmer N. Anderson A.C. Haisenleder D.J. Rissman E. Wilson E.M. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system has been used successfully to identify protein partners of AR. Both co-activators and transcriptional repressors have been found. For example, Chang and colleagues (15Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol.

Additionally, TIP60, a co-activator of human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein, and TRAM-1, a thyroid receptor co-activator, have been isolated from yeast two-hybrid screens using AR as a bait (19Brady M.E.

French F.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The androgen receptor-specific co-activator FHL2 was also identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen (21Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal enhancer of split was identified as an AR repressor using a yeast two-hybrid assay (22Yu X., Li, P. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4614-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a GT1-7 cell cDNA library to identify potential protein partners of AR in GT1-7 GnRH neuronal cells and found β-catenin as an AR-interacting protein. β-Catenin was originally identified at adherins junctions involved in the binding of cadherins with the actin cytoskeleton (23Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) and therefore is important in the regulation of cell adhesion. However, a role for β-catenin in development and signal transduction was proposed because of sequence similarity with the DrosophilaArmadillo protein that is a component of the wingless signaling pathway (24McCrea P.D. Turck C.W. Gumbiner B. Science. 1991; 254: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In the absence of signaling mechanisms that stabilize cytoplasmic β-catenin, its levels in the cytoplasm are tightly regulated because of phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and subsequent proteosomal degradation (25Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 26Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). During development, Wnt signaling pathways inhibit β-catenin degradation and cause accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (27van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Subsequently, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/Lef) family of transcription factors and stimulates transcription of target genes. Because it lacks a nuclear localization signal, the mechanisms for β-catenin nuclear translocation are not well understood. In our studies, we found that agonist bound AR but not progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or estrogen receptor α (ERα)-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Furthermore, liganded AR repressed β-catenin/TCF activation of β-catenin/TCF-responsive promoter activity. Conversely, β-catenin/TCF expression repressed AR-responsive promoter activity. Our results suggest that interactions between AR and β-catenin may modulate the nuclear localization of β-catenin and transcriptional activity in AR-responsive target tissues. AR (PA1–111A), ERα (PA1–308), GR (PA1–511A), and polyclonal FLAG (PA1–984) antibodies were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO).

The human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) construct RSHGRα was a kind gift from Ron Evans, and human PR (pSG5hPR) and ERα were obtained from Pierre Chambon. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the CLONTECH Matchmaker 3 system. A cDNA library generated from GT1-7 neuronal cell mRNA was subcloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector pGAD10. Rat AR-(Δ371–485) was subcloned into the bait plasmid pGBKT7 that contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain to generate pGBKT7-AR-(Δ371–485). Yeast AH109 cells were sequentially transformed with the library vector and pGBKT7-AR-(Δ371–485). Approximately 4 × 106 independent clones were plated on synthetic drop-out media (CLONTECH) without histidine, leucine, or tryptophan in the presence of 30 mm3-aminotriazole and 200 nm 5α-DHT. Positive clones were confirmed by replating and selecting clones that grew in the presence, but not absence, of 5α-DHT and by liquid β-galactosidase assays. For the β-galactosidase assays, pGBKT7-AR-(Δ371–485) and potential positive interacting clones were transformed into Y187 cells. Cells were grown to stationary phase in appropriate selection media and then diluted 1:4 into 8 ml of YPD media. Cells were grown an additional 5 h in the absence or presence of 10 nm 5α-DHT. Cells were harvested and lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles in buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4. To 0.1 ml of cell lysate was added 0.7 ml of lysis buffer containing 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by 0.16 ml of lysis buffer containing 4 mg/ml of o- nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside. Samples were incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance values were measured at 420 nm. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-myc-AR and FLAG-β-catenin in the presence of 10 nm 5α-DHT. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.5% Triton X-100; 5 mm EDTA; 50 mm NaCl; 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 50 mm NaF; 1 mm Na3VO4; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. For immunoprecipitation assays, 300 μg of lysates were incubated with 1 μg anti-Myc antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated for 1 h using protein A + G (Oncogene Sciences) and washed three times in lysis buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were separated using 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to HyBond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with either anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies (1 μg/ml each). For immunoblot analysis of cell extracts, 20–40 μg of whole cell lysates were separated using 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to HyBond-P, and incubated with either anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or β-catenin antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL (AmershamBiosciences) following the manufacturer's directions. NLT GnRH neuronal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 36–48 prior to transfection. For transfections, ∼15,000 NLT cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were transfected using 320 ng of FLAG-β-catenin and 80 ng of steroid receptor constructs using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen) and incubated for 16 h. For immunocytochemistry, cells were rinsed with 1 ml PBS at RT and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at RT. Cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of PBS and then permeabilized with 0.5 ml of 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 90 min at RT. For double label experiments, cells were incubated with either anti-AR (2 μg/ml), anti-PR (1:1000), or anti-GR (2 μg/ml) and either monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2 Sigma; 2 μg/ml for AR and GR) or polyclonal anti-FLAG (2 μg/ml for PR) antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to either Texas Red or FITC (1:1000) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 90 min at RT. For immunocytochemistry of endogenous β-catenin, cells were fixed and incubated with polyclonal anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by anti-rabbit FITC conjugate (1:1000). Coverslips were coated with 1 mg/ml p- phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol, 0.25× PBS prior to mounting and visualization. Images were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope. NLT cells were grown in 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in Opti-MEM for 36–48 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of the luciferase reporter construct (MMTV-LUC or pGL3-OT), 0.5 μg of β-catenin, 0.3 μg of TCF-4, and 0.5 μg of either pCMV-AR or empty control pCMV vector. Cells were also transfected with 0.1 μg of RSVβgal to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 16–18 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (37Kepa J.K. Wang C. Neeley C.I. Raynolds M.V. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Wierman M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Comparisons between ethanol control, and 5α-DHT-treated samples were analyzed using unpaired t test using GraphPad InStat version 3.02 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. To identify neuronal protein partners of AR, a cDNA library was prepared from the GT1-7 GnRH cell line. This library was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen using an AR deletion mutant (AR-(Δ371–485)) that contained a truncation of amino acids 371–485 (Fig. 1 A). This construct was designed to possess lower transactivation activity in the yeast two-hybrid system than the wild-type AR, yet still contain AR domains essential for potential protein-protein interactions,i.e. N-C domains and DNA-binding domain. From ∼4 × 106 clones screened in the presence of 5α-DHT, one of the positive clones encoded an open reading frame of 236 amino acids. BLAST analysis against the NCBI protein sequence data base demonstrated that this open reading frame consisted of amino acids 187–423 of murine β-catenin. This region of β-catenin spans the Armadillo repeat region beginning at repeat 2 and ending in repeat 7 (Fig. 1 A). These Armadillo repeats are also necessary for β-catenin binding to cadherins, APC, axin, and TCF transcription factors (38Zhurinsky J. Shtutman M. Ben Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3127-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of ligand for the interaction between AR-(Δ371–485) and β-catenin-(187–423) was confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Constructs were co-transformed into the yeast strain Y187 which allowed for quantitative analysis of the interaction by measuring β-galactosidase reporter activity (Fig. 1 B). No measurable β-galactosidase activity was detected in the absence of 5α-DHT with the bait plasmid alone or together with β-catenin-(187–423). In the presence of 5α-DHT, β-galactosidase activity was detected using AR-(Δ371–485) alone because of the ability of this construct to transactivate the β-galactosidase reporter gene. β-Galactosidase activity was increased ∼5-fold, however, when the interaction between AR-(Δ371–485) and β-catenin-(187–423) was assayed in the presence of 5α-DHT, confirming the ligand dependence of this interaction. Because the yeast two-hybrid assay detected an interaction between an AR deletion mutant and the Armadillo repeat region of β-catenin, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with full-length FLAG β-catenin and myc-AR to determine whether AR could interact with β-catenin in mammalian cells. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG. Fig. 1 C demonstrates that FLAG-β-catenin was co-immunoprecipitated with AR in cells transfected with both constructs but not from cells transfected with FLAG-β-catenin and control pCMV-myc vector. To confirm the presence of β-catenin in GnRH neuronal cells, endogenous β-catenin was visualized by immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry. By immunoblot analysis, β-catenin was present in both GT1-7 and NLT cell lines, with slightly higher expression in NLT cells (Fig. 1 D). Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that endogenous β-catenin was predominantly localized to cell membranes, consistent with its cytoskeletal role. Additionally, low levels of diffuse cytoplasmic staining was apparent in both cell lines (not shown). These results confirmed the presence of β-catenin in GT1-7 and NLT GnRH neuronal cell lines and are in agreement with previous studies (39Sun W. Lee H. Choe Y. Cho S. Kim D.H. Kim K. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 13: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that investigated the presence and distribution of β-catenin in GT1–1 cells during neurite outgrowth. The mechanism of nuclear translocation of β-catenin is not completely understood. To determine whether liganded AR could facilitate nuclear translocation of β-catenin, initial studies were performed using GT1-7 cells that were co-transfected with rat AR and FLAG-β-catenin. To discriminate nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin from cytoskeletal components, cells were transfected with FLAG-β-catenin. Co-localization of AR and FLAG-β-catenin in the nucleus was observed in the presence of 5α-DHT (not shown); however, GT1-7 cells adhered poorly to the slides required for immunocytochemical analysis. Therefore, further experiments were performed in the NLT GnRH neuronal cell line. In co-transfected cells, AR and FLAG-β-catenin were distributed between the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in the absence of 5α-DHT. In the presence of 5α-DHT, however, both AR and FLAG-β-catenin were exclusively nuclear, suggesting that cytoplasmic β-catenin translocated to the nucleus with liganded AR (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of AR, 5α-DHT alone had no effect on β-catenin localization (data not shown). The time course for nuclear translocation of AR in response to 5α-DHT has been shown previously to be rapid, within 30 min (3Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5α-DHT, AR translocated to the nucleus in NLT cells within 15–30 min (Fig. 2 B). FLAG-β catenin also localized to the nucleus within 15–30 min in the presence of AR and 5α-DHT (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that a direct interaction between AR and β-catenin was necessary for co-localization. The anti-androgenic compounds casodex and hydroxyflutamide have been shown previously to target AR to the nucleus; however, they do not activate transcription by AR and antagonize the physiological effects of androgens (40Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these anti-androgens could also induce the co-localization of FLAG-β-catenin with AR, NLT cells were co-transfected with AR and FLAG-β-catenin and treated with either 100 nm casodex or hydroxyflutamide. Although these anti-androgens induced nuclear localization of AR, they failed to result in β-catenin translocation (Fig. 2 C). Flutamide, which binds AR with very low affinity (40Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not induce nuclear translocation of AR or FLAG-β-catenin (data not shown). The fact that casodex and hydroxyflutamide induced nuclear translocation of AR but not β-catenin suggests that translocation of AR alone is not sufficient to induce complete nuclear localization of β-catenin and that agonist, but not antagonist, -bound AR was required. Because transfected β-catenin is distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the absence of 5α-DHT, an alternative explanation for the nuclear co-localization of AR with β-catenin might be that 5α-DHT treatment induced cytoplasmic β-catenin degradation, thus leaving only the nuclear fraction. The balance between cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin during development and Wnt signaling is due to the regulation of degradation and stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin (27van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic β-catenin is rapidly degraded through a proteosomal pathway following phosphorylation by GSK-3β (25Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

In this study, we introduced Iba1 into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and demonstrated the enhancement of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced membrane ruffling and chemotaxis. Wortmannin treatment did not completely suppressed this enhanced membrane ruffling in Iba1-expressing cells, whereas it did in Iba1-nonexpressing cells, suggesting that the enhancement is mediated through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-independent signaling pathway. Porcine aorta endothelial cells transfected with expression constructs of Iba1 and PDGF receptor add-back mutants were used to analyze the signaling pathway responsible for the Iba1-induced enhancement of membrane ruffling. In the absence of Iba1 expression, PDGF did not induced membrane ruffling in cells expressing the Tyr-1021 receptor mutant, which is capable of activating phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) but not PI3K. In contrast, in the presence of Iba1 expression, membrane ruffling was formed in cells expressing the Tyr-1021 mutant. In addition, Rac was shown to be activated during membrane ruffling in cells expressing Iba1 and the Tyr-1021 mutant. Furthermore, dominant negative forms of PLC-γ completely suppressed PDGF-induced Iba1-dependent membrane ruffling and Rac activation.

Cell motility is a dynamic process driven by structurally and functionally coordinated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar,2Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Among various types of cells, macrophages are extremely motile to migrate rapidly to sites of infection or inflammation, suggesting that highly integrated systems should exist to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in macrophages (3Hartwig J.H. Yin H.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Downey G.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition to circulating monocytes/macrophages, there are many types of tissue-resident macrophages, including Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, dendritic cells, splenocytes, and microglia. In response to various pathological phenomena, microglia are activated to exhibit drastic changes in shape and the abilities to become locomotive and to phagocytose (5Nakajima K. Kohsaka S. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 7: 187-203Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar). These cellular reactions are also profoundly underlaid by dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. The Rho family GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, are known to be molecular switches that organize remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar).

Dominant active RacV12 induces remarkable membrane ruffling, and dominant negative RacN17 completely inhibits peptide growth factor-induced membrane ruffling; therefore, Rac is recognized to be an essential component in this type of membrane ruffling (8Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar).

Ibata I. Ito D. Ohsawa K. Kohsaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and showed that the expression of Iba1 is up-regulated in activated microglia following facial nerve axotomy (10Ito D. Imai Y. Ohsawa K. Nakajima K. Fukuuchi Y. Kohsaka S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 57: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In our recent study, Iba1 was further characterized by using a microglial cell line MG5 (11Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Nakajima K. Kohsaka S. Glia. 1997; 21: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and loss of function Iba1 mutants, and it was demonstrated that mutant Iba1 effectively suppresses the membrane ruffling produced by stimulation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or by expression of dominant active RacV12 (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3073-3084PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Iba1 was involved in the molecular basis of membrane ruffling of macrophages/microglia and interacted with the signaling of Rac, which is a key molecule in controlling membrane ruffling also in macrophages (13Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Iba1 is therefore considered to be one of the candidate molecules underlying the extremely motile property of macrophages/microglia. In this study, to address this hypothesis, we introduced Iba1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, porcine aorta endothelial (PAE) cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, none of which expresses endogenous Iba1, and examined the formation of membrane ruffles, chemotaxis, and profiles of intracellular signaling molecules, including PDGFR, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), and Rac. Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Mouse iba1 cDNA (9Imai Y. Ibata I. Ito D. Ohsawa K. Kohsaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) was inserted into the tetracycline-regulated expression vector pTet-Splice (Invitrogen) to construct pTet-iba1. The cells were transfected with pTet-iba1, transactivator pTet-tTAK, and pSV2-neo by calcium phosphate coprecipitation, and stably transfected clones were isolated by selection with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). PAE cells (14Westermark B. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. C.-H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Sweden) and Dr. Koutaro Yokote (Chiba University, Japan) were cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. pLXSN plasmids carrying wild type (WT) and a series of mutant human β-PDGFRs (15Valius M.

Kazlauskas (Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). F5 mutant PDGFR, which was constructed by the substitution of phenylalanines for five tyrosine residues that are required for the binding of PI3K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1, is unable to associate with any of these proteins. Add-back mutants of PDGFR were generated by restoring tyrosine residues at individual binding sites for each of the receptor-associated proteins (15Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). PAE cells were transfected with the tetracycline-regulated Iba1-expressing system and cloned as described above. Subsequently, Iba1-expressing cells were transfected with WT PDGFR or the add-back series of PDGFR mutants by the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) and selected by 5 μg/ml of blasticidin S (Funakoshi, Japan). PAE transfectants were incubated in Ham's F12 containing 0.5% FCS for 8 h before microinjection of 0.6 μg/μl pFLAG-CMV2 carrying WT and Y771F/Y783F plc-γ1 cDNAs, which were kindly provided by Dr. P.-G. Suh (16Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G.

Injected PAE cells were maintained for 3 h at 37 °C to induce protein expression. Expression plasmids for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PLC-γ1–2SH2 and GST-PI3-K SH2 (N) (17Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. T. Takenawa and Dr. K. Fukami (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan). The purified GST fusion proteins were microinjected into the cytosol and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stimulated with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. CHO cells were maintained in RPMI 1640/Ham's F12/DMEM (2:1:1) medium supplemented with 10% FCS. CHO cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with pLXSN carrying WT PDGFR, pFLAG-CMV2 carrying WT or mutant plc-γ1, and pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) carrying WT-iba1 or mutant iba1-(1–115) (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3073-3084PubMed Google Scholar). A microglial cell line, MG5, was maintained as described previously (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3073-3084PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μm pepstatin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, normalized for protein concentration, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electrotransferred to an Immobilon (Millipore, MA) membrane, which was then blocked with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 4% skim milk. The membrane was incubated with anti-Iba1 antibody (1 μg/ml) (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3073-3084PubMed Google Scholar), then subsequently with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1500 dilution) (Bio-Rad, CA), and visualized using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., UK). Swiss 3T3 or PAE transfectants (1 × 104) were plated on a 13-mm poly-d-lysine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)-coated glass coverslip, cultured for 2 days, then serum-starved for 13 h in DMEM without FCS (Swiss 3T3) or in Ham's F12 with 0.5% FCS (PAE) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline. The cells were stimulated with human PDGF-BB (UBI, NY), bradykinin (Sigma), or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Sigma), then fixed for 60 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were treated for 5 min with PBS containing 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride, permeabilized for 20 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X100, and blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 3% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (blocking buffer). The cells were incubated for 13 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing 8 μg/ml rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody, then washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) and 6 units/ml Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were then observed with fluorescence microscope AX70 (Olympus, Japan) or confocal laser scanning microscope CLSM2010 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cell migration was assayed by a modified Boyden chamber method (18Yokote K. Mori S. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol.

The lower wells that were filled with 25 μl of DMEM containing 1% BSA and PDGF were overlaid with an 8-μm pore polycarbonate filter (Neuro Probe) pre-coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA). Above the membrane, the upper wells were set and loaded with 50 μl of DMEM with 1% BSA containing 3 × 105 trypsin-dispersed cells per milliliter. The chamber was then incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The cells on the upper side of the filter were scraped off, and the cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed and stained in PBS containing 12% formaldehyde, 10% ethanol, and 0.05% crystal violet. Cell numbers were counted in four fields per well. Values are means of triplicate experiments. The PAK pull-down assay was performed mainly as described previously (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H.

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, incubated with GST-PAK fusion protein (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J.

Bound activated Rac was visualized by Western blotting with an anti-Rac1 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse goat IgG (1:1500 dilution) using the ECL system. Serum-starved quiescent PAE and M-CSF-starved MG5 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF and 100 ng/ml mouse M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer at 4 °C for 20 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration before immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated with 1.7 μg/ml anti-PLC-γ1 (UBI) or anti-PLC-γ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody and with protein G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.). The precipitated proteins were then subjected to Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Seikagaku, Japan), and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse goat IgG (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) using the ECL system. In this study, to analyze the functions of intact Iba1, we transfected a tetracycline-inducible Iba1-expression construct into Swiss 3T3, a fibroblast cell line expressing no endogenous Iba1. As a result, we established five clones of stable transfectants exhibiting inducible Iba1 expression. Immunoblotting with the anti-Iba1 antibody demonstrated that the expression of Iba1 was tightly inhibited under the presence of tetracycline whereas 13 or 22 h after the removal of tetracycline, strong expression of Iba1 was induced (Fig. 1A). In Swiss 3T3 cells, bradykinin, LPA, and PDGF are known to specifically activate Cdc42, Rho, and Rac, respectively, and lead the cells to form filopodia, stress fibers, and membrane ruffles (7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of Iba1 on these structures, the Iba1-inducible cells were serum-starved, stimulated with bradykinin, LPA, and PDGF, and stained with phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. When Iba1 expression was suppressed in the presence of tetracycline, the cells formed filopodia, stress fibers, and membrane ruffles in response to bradykinin, LPA, and PDGF, respectively (Fig. 1B), as reported for parent Swiss 3T3 cells (8Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar, 20Ridley A.J. Hall A.

When Iba1 expression was induced by tetracycline removal, the cells also formed filopodia and stress fibers indistinguishable from those shown in the absence of Iba1 expression after stimulation with bradykinin and LPA (Fig. 1B). By contrast, in response to PDGF, the Iba1-expressing cells formed apparently enhanced membrane ruffles in comparison with the Iba1-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 1B). When the cells were doubly stained with phalloidin and the anti-Iba1 antibody after PDGF stimulation, Iba1 was shown to be localized at the sites of membrane ruffles, together with F-actin (Fig. 1C), but Iba1 did not colocalize with F-actin in filopodia or stress fibers induced by bradykinin or LPA stimulation (data not shown). All other clones of the transfectants exhibited similar enhanced membrane ruffling (data not shown), indicating that Iba1 definitely enhances PDGF-dependent membrane ruffling in Swiss 3T3 transfectants. Because membrane ruffling is considered to be related to cell motility (23Sánchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), we determined the chemotaxis of Iba1-expressing cells by the Boyden chamber method (18Yokote K. Mori S. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5101-5111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using PDGF as a chemoattractant. As shown in Fig. 2, Swiss 3T3 parent cells and the Iba1-nonexpressing transfectants showed similar motile responses toward PDGF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the Iba1-expressing cells exhibited about a 2-fold increase in chemotactic response. Similar results were obtained in all clones of Iba1 transfectants. Tetracycline itself had no effect on PDGF-induced migration in Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Iba1 is also able to enhance the chemotaxis of Swiss 3T3 cells. The PI3K signaling pathway is reported to be necessary for PDGF-induced membrane ruffling of Swiss 3T3 cells (24Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether this pathway is also required for the Iba1-dependent enhancement of membrane ruffling, the effect of PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, on PDGF-induced membrane ruffling was examined in both Iba1-nonexpressing and -expressing cells. Without treatment with the inhibitors, both transfectants formed membrane ruffles as a result of PDGF stimulation, but the extent of ruffle formation was greater in Iba1-expressing cells than in Iba1-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 3). With the wortmannin treatment, membrane ruffling of Iba1-nonexpressing transfectants was completely abolished, indicating that the formation of membrane ruffles of Iba1-nonexpressing Swiss 3T3 cells depends totally on the PI3K signaling pathway. By contrast, the Iba1-expressing cells formed obvious membrane ruffles even after wortmannin treatment, indicating that membrane ruffling of Iba1-expressing cells does depend on a certain signaling pathway in addition to PI3K. The same results were obtained using another PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (Fig. 3). These observations led us to speculate that the enhanced membrane ruffling associated with Iba1 is transduced by a PI3K-independent pathway. To elucidate the possibility that Iba1 is involved in the PI3K-independent signaling pathway, we utilized the add-back mutants of PDGFR, which were transfected into PAE cells lacking endogenous PDGFR (14Westermark B. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PDGFR associates with various signaling molecules via its autophosphorylated tyrosines. PI3K selectively targets tyrosine at amino acid positions 740 (Tyr-740) and Tyr-751, whereas RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLC-γ recognize Tyr-771, Tyr-1009, and Tyr-1021, respectively. These signaling molecules are unable to bind to the PDGFR F5 mutant, in which all of the five tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines (15Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). PAE cells, which did not express Iba1, were co-transfected with the Iba1-inducible construct and PDGFR mutant-expression vectors. Similar expression levels were seen for all the PDGFRs in the stable transfectants, as measured by fluorescence-activate cell sorting analysis (data not shown). Without stimulation with PDGF, the morphology of the cells was identical in the presence and absence of Iba1 expression (data not shown). When the Iba1-nonexpressing cells were stimulated with PDGF, obvious membrane ruffles were formed in the cells co-transfected with WT PDGFR receptor or Y740/51 mutant, which is capable of PI3K activation, in agreement with a previous report (25Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing F5 or Tyr-1021 receptor did not respond to PDGF (Fig. 4). These observations indicate the necessity of PI3K signaling for PDGF-induced membrane ruffling in the absence of Iba1. On the other hand, after the induction of Iba1, apparent membrane ruffles were formed in the cells transfected with Tyr-1021 mutant, capable of activation of PLC-γ. Membrane ruffling was also detected in the Iba1-expressing cells with the WT or Y740/51 mutant, as in the Iba1-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 4). Cells expressing Tyr-771, Tyr-1009, or kinase inactive receptor (Arg-635) did not show PDGF-induced membrane ruffling regardless of Iba1 expression (data not shown). These observations strongly suggest that PLC-γ is the key signaling molecule in Iba1-dependent and wortmannin-resistant membrane ruffling. Iba1 was recently demonstrated to function together with Rac in the membrane ruffling of microglia, and Rac was shown to be activated during their membrane ruffling (12Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Kanazawa H. Sasaki Y. Kohsaka S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3073-3084PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rac is also activated in Iba1- and PLC-γ-dependent membrane ruffling, the activation of Rac was monitored by pull-down assay with the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain of PAK (19Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) using PAE transfectants. In the absence of Iba1, PDGF stimulation efficiently converted Rac into the GTP-bound form in the cells expressing WT and the Y740/51 mutant but not in the cells expressing the Tyr-1021 (Fig. 5A), Tyr-771, or Tyr-1009 (data not shown) mutant. All lysates contained equal amounts of total Rac. These results indicate that Rac was activated through the PI3K-dependent pathway in the absence of Iba1. However, in the presence of Iba1, in addition to WT- or Y740/51-expressing cells, Tyr-1021-expressing cells also showed Rac activation in response to PDGF (Fig. 5B). These observations indicate the existence of an Iba1- and PLC-γ-dependent Rac-activating pathway that triggers the formation of membrane ruffles. To confirm the involvement of PLC-γ in Iba1-dependent and PI3K-independent Rac activation, we investigated the effects of PLC-γ mutants that act as dominant negative forms against endogenous PLC-γ. PLC-γ1-Y771F/Y783F had phenylalanines substituted for tyrosines 771 and 783 and obtained the ability to specifically suppress the activity of endogenous PLC-γ1 (16Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 WT or Y771F/Y783F mutant was expressed in the PAE cells expressing both PDGFR Tyr-1021 and Iba1. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with PDGF and stained with phalloidin. Typical membrane ruffles were formed in WT PLC-γ-expressing cells that were located by the marker signal of co-expressed EGFP (Fig. 6A, upper panel). By contrast, PDGF-induced membrane ruffling was inhibited in PLC-γ1-Y771F/Y783F-expressing cells (Fig. 6A, lower panel). When the PLC-γ1-expressing cells were located with an anti-FLAG antibody, the cells that were recognized corresponded perfectly to the EGFP-expressing cells (data not shown). GST-PLC-γ1–2SH2 is a fusion protein of GST and a PLC-γ1 fragment containing two SH2 domains but no catalytic domain and is able to specifically inhibit PLC-γ1 signaling, whereas GST-PI3K SH2 (N) contains the PI3K N-terminal SH2 domain but does not suppress PLC-γ signaling (17Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Into the PAE cells expressing both PDGFR Tyr-1021 and Iba1, we microinjected GST-PLC-γ1–2SH2 or GST-PI3K SH2(N) fusion protein together with FITC-conjugated dextran to mark the cells that were injected. The cells injected with GST-PLC-γ1–2SH2 fusion protein were stimulated with PDGF and stained with phalloidin. PDGF-induced membrane ruffling was inhibited in the GST-PLC-γ1–2SH2- injected cells, whereas the cells injected with GST-PI3K SH2 (N) were not inhibited. Next we investigated whether PLC-γ1-Y771F/Y783F mutant blocked Iba1-dependent Rac activation. We induced the transient expression of WT PDGFR, and WT or mutant Iba1 and PLC-γ1 in CHO cells, which lacked PDGFR expression (26Ma Y.-H. Reusch H.P. Wilson E. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T.

https://openalex.org/W2056729456,"The concept of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) put forward in 1980 by Furchgott and Zawadzki implies that nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthase (NOS) in the endothelium diffuses to the underlying vascular smooth muscle, where it modulates vascular tone as well as vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by increasing cGMP formation with subsequent activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. According to this concept, VSMC do not express NOS by themselves. This attractive, simple scheme is now under considerable debate. To address this issue, we designed this study with the use of a novel supersensitive immunocytochemical technique of signal amplification with tyramide and electron microscopic immunogold labeling complemented with Western blotting, as in our recent studies demonstrating NOS in the myocardial and skeletal muscles. We provide the first evidence that, in contrast to the currently accepted view, VSMC in various blood vessels express all three NOS isoforms depending on the blood vessel type. These findings suggest an alternative mechanism by which local NOS expression may modulate vascular functions in an endothelium-independent manner."

Mx proteins in particular are rapidly induced to high levels after interferon treatment and may be responsible for the bulk of the antiviral effect of interferon (for reviews, see Ref. 1Haller O. Frese M. Kochs G. Rev. Sci. Tech. O.I.E. (Off. Int. Epizoot.). 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Several Mx proteins have been shown to inhibit the replication of a diverse set of viruses. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not clearly defined and varies depending on the Mx protein, virus, and cell type. Human MxA is one of the best characterized proteins of this group and has antiviral activity against a number of viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus (2Pavlovic J. Zurcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hepatitis B virus (3Gordien E. Rosmorduc O. Peltekian C. Garreau F. Brechot C. Kremsdorf D. J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3904-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mx proteins are members of the dynamin family of large GTPases. Dynamins work in membrane trafficking and remodeling events throughout the cell (for reviews, see Refs. 5Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin.

A common property of dynamins is the propensity to self-assemble into ring structures of a characteristic size (7Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 8Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol.

Equally vital to their role within the cell is the ability to bind, tubulate, and in some cases, vesiculate membranes (12Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

Dynamin family members display distinct cellular locations that often provide insight into function (5Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin.

Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but how this relates to function is not clear, because an assembly-deficient protein was still able to inhibit Thogoto virus replication (24Di Paolo C. Hefti H.P. Meli M. Landis H. Pavlovic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32071-32078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Schumacher B. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thogoto virus appears to be the most sensitive to the actions of MxA (4Frese M. Kochs G. Meier-Dieter U. Siebler J. Haller O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3904-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inhibitory mechanism is the most clearly described. It has been demonstrated that MxA blocks the nuclear import of Thogoto virus nucleocapsids (30Kochs G. Haller O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), a step essential for its replication in the nucleus. It was proposed that MxA wraps around the incoming viral nucleocapsids, perhaps masking a nuclear localization signal and preventing entry into the nucleus. MxA must block other viruses in a somewhat different manner, however, because not all of the viruses it inhibits have a nuclear replication step. In general, MxA appears to interfere with steps involving viral transcription. However, neither the precise mechanisms of interference nor the roles of MxA assembly and GTP hydrolysis in antiviral activity are currently understood. To further define the mechanism of MxA antiviral activity, we tested if this large GTPase shares certain properties with conventional dynaminin vitro despite modest sequence homology. We examined and defined the nature of MxA self-assembly and tested its ability to bind and modify the shape of added lipids. Here we demonstrate that, like other dynamin family members, recombinant His6-tagged MxA can assemble into very regular rod and ring structures as visualized by EM1 and that MxA can bind and tubulate lipids in vitro. To test whether these properties are directed toward specific organelles, we conducted extensive light and electron microscopic imaging of cells expressing wild-type or mutant MxA protein. By light microscopy we found MxA associates with smooth ER but not rough ER endosomes, mitochondria, microtubules, or actin, without any obvious defect by either light or electron microscopy. Expression of the MxA mutant however, demonstrated a substantial proliferation of the smooth ER as visualized by EM. Taken together these findings provide compelling evidence that the Mx family of proteins possesses many biophysical properties of traditional dynamin proteins and may act to inhibit viral replication through alterations in membrane organization or traffic. The following primers were used to amplify MxA from the plasmid pBS-T7/MxA, a generous gift from Dr. G. Kochs: 5′-GTACAGGGATCCATGGTTGTTTCCGAAGTG and 5′-GTACACCTCGAGACCGGGGAACTGGGCAAGCCG-3′ or 5′-GTAGACGCTAGCGCCACCATGGTTGTTTCCGAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-GTACAAGGATCCAGTTTAACCGGGGAACTGGGCAAGC-3′. The gene was cloned into the pQE80 plasmid (Qiagen) for protein expression in bacteria and into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) for mammalian cells. To make the MxA K83A mutant, the primers 5′-GACCAGAGCTCGGGCGCTAGCTCCGTGTTGGAG and its reverse were used. Human interferon β (Sigma) was used at 1000 units/ml. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Hep3B cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were transfected using GeneJammer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbits were immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, LLLNGDATVAQKNPGSVA, and the anti-MxA antibody, MxA (20–37), was purified and characterized as described previously for other antibodies (22Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The AMF-R antibody was a generous gift from Dr. I. R. Nabi. For AMF-R staining, cells were fixed for 10 min at –20 °C with an 80/20% methanol/acetone solution. The remaining immunofluorescence methodology was carried out as published elsewhere (22Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cultures of M15(pREP4)Escherichia coli (Qiagen) transformed with pQE80-MxA were induced overnight at 25 °C with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100), and sonicated. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with Probond resin (Invitrogen) with agitation. The resin was washed with lysis buffer and then twice each with wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 20 mmimidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100) and wash buffer 2 (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 250 mmimidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100), concentrated, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the appropriate buffer. Assembly assays, lipid binding and tubulation, and electron microscopy of negatively stained proteins were performed as described elsewhere (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed by adding 2× fixative (5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 2.5% sucrose in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) directly to the culture medium. After 10 min, the medium was replaced with 1× fixative and incubated for 50 min. The cells were then scraped, pelleted, and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 1 h at 4 °C or on ice. The cell pellets were bloc-stained with 1–2% uranyl acetate in maleate buffer at pH 5.15 overnight. The samples were then dehydrated, embedded in Spurr's resin, and polymerized at 60 °C. Thin sections were cut and stained with Sato lead for 5 min. Sections were examined with a Jeol 1200 electron microscope at 60 kV. To better understand the mechanisms by which MxA mediates viral resistance, we utilized purified recombinant MxA using biochemical assays already established for dynamin. One property of dynamin family members is the ability to homo-oligomerize. MxA has been reported to form large multimers when purified from tissue or expressed in bacteria (24Di Paolo C. Hefti H.P.

In an attempt to further elucidate the nature of Mx oligomerization, we expressed His-tagged MxA in E. coli and analyzed the sedimentation properties of the purified protein. This sedimentation assay has been used to estimate the relative amount of assembled protein for dynamin (7Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotide, ∼34% of MxA is in the pellet fraction in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, indicating that a substantial amount of MxA is oligomeric (Fig. 1a). Under similar conditions, dynamin 1 has been found to be predominantly soluble (8Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol.

To test the nature of oligomerization, we varied the salt concentration in the sedimentation experiments. We found that in low salt concentrations (25 mm) 66% of MxA was in the pellet, whereas in higher salt conditions (300 mm) more than 70% of the MxA was found in the soluble fraction (Fig.1a). These results indicate that MxA assembly is mediated in part by ionic interactions. The addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS, induced more MxA to self-assemble, consistent with results found for another dynamin-related protein, DLP1 (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that GTP consistently enhanced the formation of MxA oligomers in all salt conditions (Fig. 1a). This is in agreement with an earlier report that recombinant murine Mx1 formed larger aggregates in the presence of GTP based on negatively stained purified protein (33Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a very recent paper published while this manuscript was in review (34Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). High concentrations of GTP cause conventional dynamin to disassemble. In summary, MxA self-assembles through an ionic interaction that is enhanced in the presence of guanine nucleotides. Under conditions in which dynamin self-assembles, the resulting multimers can be visualized as rings and stacks of rings by EM after negative staining (7Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Using this same technique, we found that MxA also formed rings (Fig. 1, c and d) as well as rod-like structures. The rings had inner and outer diameters of ∼25 and 35 nm, respectively, which is significantly smaller than rings formed by conventional dynamin (30–50 nm) or DLP1 (30–40 nm) (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) that were viewed together during the same experiments. The rods varied in length but were generally 50 nm long and 5 nm wide. In some instances the rods were curved and occasionally looped back upon themselves. These assembly data clearly demonstrate a fundamental similarity to conventional dynamin, in that MxA oligomerizes in a salt- and nucleotide-dependent manner into ring- and rod-shaped structures. Lower salt conditions favor both MxA and dynamin assembly, whereas nucleotides promote MxA assembly. At the same time, the GTP-induced aggregation implies that MxA may have unique oligomerization or hydrolysis characteristics. Another distinct property of dynamins is the propensity to associate with membranes (12Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 13Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P.

Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Conventional dynamin contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which mediates binding to phosphoinositides within the membrane (36Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

Biochemical Journal. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Recently however, DLP1 was also found to bind lipids, despite the lack of a PH domain (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine whether recombinant MxA, which also lacks a PH domain, could associate with lipids as well. To this end, we mixed purified MxA with liposomal membrane and tested whether MxA would co-sediment with the lipid. MxA alone when centrifuged at a low speed (10000 × g), did not pellet, but remained in the supernatant (Fig.2, −PS). Adding nucleotide to the assay had little effect on the ability of MxA alone to pellet, indicating that assembled protein alone is not sedimentable under these conditions. However, the addition of phosphotidylserine to the recombinant protein caused ∼50% of MxA to pellet with the lipid (Fig. 2, +PS). The presence of GTP or GTPγS did not increase MxA pelleting further, suggesting that the MxA-membrane interaction is nucleotide-independent. These results show that, like dynamin, MxA has the ability to associate and pellet with lipids. As for DLP1, this interaction does not depend on an obvious PH domain. Dynamin has been described as a molecular pinchase (6McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 9McNiven M.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in light of the elegant in vitrodata showing the ability of dynamin to deform purified liposomes into tubules (12Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 13Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and the subsequent vesiculation of the tubules upon the addition of GTP (12Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Likewise, DLP1 tubulates membrane in vitro as well as in cells (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Given that MxA self-assembles into rings and binds lipids, we tested whether this dynamin family member also remodels membranes in vitro. Synthetic liposomes were prepared from phosphotidylserine, and recombinant MxA was added to the liposomes in the presence or absence of nucleotide. The mixture was spotted onto EM grids and negatively stained as described previously (31Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, b–d, MxA constricted the liposomes into long, often branched tubules. Although tubules were visible in the absence and presence of nucleotide, no tubules were seen in the absence of MxA, consistent with the observations made in the lipid binding assay (Fig. 3a). These tubules were electron dense in the central core, like lipid tubules bound by dynamin and DLP1. Upon examination of higher magnification micrographs, striations were visible along the membrane (Fig. 3d). Preparations that did not include GTP also exhibited tubulated lipid structures although striations could not be resolved, suggesting that the nucleotide-bound MxA rings may undergo a conformational change into a higher ordered structure making them more readily visible. These structures presumably represent assembled MxA wrapped around the liposome. This is the first evidence that an Mx protein cannot only associate with lipids but is able to deform and tubulate membranes in vitro. Emerging data from many laboratories indicate that dynamin family members function at distinct cytoplasmic locations, with the precise intracellular localization of each dynamin providing information about its function (5Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Despite intense investigation, however, MxA has not been localized to a specific intracellular site or structure. Previously, MxA has been reported as being spread throughout the cytoplasm in a granular or punctate pattern (41Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no organelle association has been described to date. Hep3B cells were treated with interferon, fixed, and labeled with anti-MxA antibodies. Immunofluorescence images revealed MxA was distributed in a linear punctate pattern, suggesting that it may be associated with an intracellular structure. After exploring markers for multiple organelles and cytoskeletal elements, we did not observe a significant colocalization with microtubules, actin, rough ER, endosomes, or mitochondria. We did observe, however, that a large portion of MxA colocalized with one organelle marker, the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMF-R; Fig. 4). This protein has been reported to cycle between the plasma membrane and the smooth ER (42Benlimame N. Simard D. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Benlimame N., Le, P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 44Wang H.J. Benlimame N. Nabi I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3043-3053PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the partial overlap between the immunofluorescence patterns of AMF-R and MxA in the human hepatocyte line, Hep3B. Crude subcellular fractionation (Fig. 4d) of these cells supports our immunofluorescence data as much of the MxA is in the cytosolic fraction (S100), in addition to the microsomal fraction (P100) where AMF-R is found. Based on these data, we hypothesize that MxA may interfere with viral replication at the smooth ER. In an attempt to characterize the function of MxA at the smooth ER, we constructed and expressed the GTPase-defective mutant, MxA K83A. The corresponding dominant negative mutation in other dynamin proteins has provided functional insights into how these enzymes participate in a variety of distinct cell processes, largely through the induction of gross morphological defects in specific organelle compartments such as coated pits, the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. As in other dynamin family members, substitution of a conserved lysine to an alanine leads to a lower affinity binding of GTP and a reduced rate of hydrolysis (41Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant is expected to differ from wild-type MxA protein incubated with GTPγS. The resulting protein, MxA K83A, also has no antiviral activity (41Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the conservation of the GTP binding elements is important for function. When we expressed the MxA K83A mutant in mammalian cells, we observed a distribution pattern similar to that of wild-type MxA by immunofluorescence, although the puncta tended to be slightly larger (41Pitossi F. Blank A. Schroder A. Schwarz A. Hussi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). To ascertain whether the expression of this mutant affects an intracellular structure, we examined the transfected HeLa cells by electron microscopy. The expression of MxA K83A resulted in a dramatic expansion of a membranous compartment (Fig.5, b–d) relative to control cells (Fig. 5a). The membranous structures were tubular and appeared to come into and out of the plane of section (Fig. 5, c and d), suggesting a highly reticular, fenestrated organelle spread throughout the cytoplasm. The morphology of the membranes is very similar to that of rough ER, yet they are devoid of ribosomes. Expression of the wild-type construct resulted in no obvious change in organelle morphology. These ultrastructural observations support our immunofluorescence data that MxA associates with the smooth ER, suggesting that MxA may somehow modulate the size and complexity of this organelle. In addition to these changes, we also observed an accumulation of caveola-like structures in HeLa cells expressing MxA K83A (Fig. 5e). It has been reported that this cell type has few caveolae (45Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred O. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and we have also found this to be true in control cells or in those expressing wild-type MxA. Expression of the mutant MxA K83A, however, appears to increase the number of caveolae without obviously increasing Cav1 levels (data not shown). The significance of this alteration is currently unclear. We also observed the expansion of the smooth ER and proliferation of caveolae in CV-1 cells expressing MxA K83A (data not shown), indicating this alteration in organelle morphology is not a cell type-specific phenomenon. The expansion of the smooth ER upon expression of an MxA mutant may suggest that wild-type MxA is involved in a constriction or fission event associated with this organelle. In the present study, we have demonstrated that MxA, despite limited sequence homology, shares several important properties with conventional dynamin. These characteristics include the propensity to self-assemble into defined structures and the ability to bind and tubulate lipids. This observation, and those of a very recent paper published as our manuscript was being reviewed (34Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is the first demonstration that MxA forms oligomeric structures having a morphology similar to other dynamin fami"

To investigate the molecular basis of oxidative stress-induced T cell hyporesponsiveness, we developed an in vitro system in which T lymphocytes are rendered hyporesponsive by exposure to an oxidative environment generated by activated neutrophils. Using this system we analyzed the effects of ROS on several TCR-dependent signaling pathways. Here we report that oxidative stress does not cause a generalized inhibition of TCR-signaling pathways and suggest that hyporesponsive T lymphocytes may have lost certain effector functions but retained or gained others. This observation may have important implications for the physiopathology of cancer, RA, and other pathologies in which oxidative stress causes “T cell hyporesponsiveness.” The following antibodies were used for cell isolation, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and immunoblotting: anti-TCR-ζ phycoerythrin mAb (TIA-2), anti-CD19 mAb J4.119, anti-CD66b mAb 80H3 (all from Immunotech, Marseille, France), anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, anti-LAT antiserum, anti-ZAP-70 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, New York, NY), anti-TCR-ζ mAb 6B10.2, anti-ERK2 mAb C-14, anti-diphosphorylated ERK1/2 mAb MAPK-YT, anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and anti-PLC-γ1 rabbit antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-caspase 3 rabbit antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. A. Alam, U395 INSERM, Toulouse, France), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). T lymphocytes and neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors or from peripheral blood and synovial fluid from RA patients. Briefly, mononuclear cells were collected upon centrifugation on Ficoll, washed three times, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm non essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. Enriched T lymphocyte populations (>90%) were obtained after macrophage depletion by adherence to plastic for 1 h at 37 °C and after B cell depletion with anti-CD19 mAb-coated magnetic beads. Neutrophils were separated from erythrocytes by dextran (T-500) sedimentation, and residual red blood cells were lysed with ice-cold 0.2% NaCl. T lymphocytes (2 × 106 cells/ml supplemented RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were cultured for 16 h with or without neutrophils at 1:1 ratio. Where stated, neutrophils were activated with 1 μm N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP) during the co-culture. Catalase (Sigma-Aldrich) and MnTBAP (Calbiochem) were added to cultures where indicated. T lymphocytes were subsequently isolated by neutrophil depletion with anti-CD66b mAb-coated magnetic beads. Where indicated T cells were subsequently cultured for 48 h in the presence of 5 mm N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). For caspase 3 activation, normal and hyporesponsive T cells were cultured for 38 h with or without plastic-bound anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3 before lysis. Round bottom 96-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3. After washing, 3 × 104 T cells/well were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C, pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well, harvested 16 h later, and counted with a Packard MatrixTM 9600 Beta Counter (Drowner Grove, IL). For cell surface staining, T lymphocytes were washed once in PBS containing 2.5% fetal calf serum and 0.02% NaN3 and incubated on ice for 20 min with saturating concentrations of the indicated antibodies. After three washes, the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary reagents for 20 min on ice. Stained cells were analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL cytometer (Coulter, Marseille, France), and the data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.8 software (facs.scripps.edu/software.html) or CellQuest (BD PharMingen). For intracellular staining, T lymphocytes were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 4 min with 2% paraformaldehyde. After 2 washes with PBS containing 2.5% fetal calf serum and 0.02% NaN3, cells were permeabilized in 1% saponin in PBS for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min with the indicated antibodies and washed three times with PBS, 2.5% fetal calf serum, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.1% saponin. Cells were subsequently incubated with the appropriate secondary reagents for 30 min, washed, and analyzed as described above. Lymphocytes were appropriately gated on forward and side scatter. For the detection of cell death, cells were stained with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Coulter-Immunotech, Marseille, France) according to the manufacture's instructions. Cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in supplemented RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.05 mmNa3VO4, and where indicated, stimulated for 3 min with 10 μg/ml soluble anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3. Subsequently, cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Upon centrifugation, postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated using mAbs previously bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. The eluted samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Blots were revealed with ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). For ERK detection, blots were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), washed intensively in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), and reprobed with anti-ERK2 mAb. The Western blot analysis of Fig. 3 was performed on detergent-soluble and -insoluble material resolved on SDS-PAGE. Neutrophils were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 and activated with 1 μm fMLP for 20 min at 37 °C. Superoxide anion generation was assessed spectrophotometrically by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c, as previously described (39Tauber A.I. Goetzl E.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5576-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RA synovial fluid (SF) is an oxidative environment (40McCord J.M. Science. 1974; 185: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) characterized by the presence of infiltrating leukocytes, of which activated neutrophils are the main constituents (41Davis M.J. Freemont A.J. Int. Med. Specialist. 1990; 11: 121-128Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that RA SF neutrophils could induce T cell hyporesponsiveness by producing ROS. To test this hypothesis T lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of RA patients and co-cultured for 16 h with autologous SF or PB neutrophils. Subsequently, neutrophils were eliminated, and T lymphocytes were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3. As shown in Table I, proliferative responses of T cells preincubated with SF neutrophils were lower than those of T lymphocytes alone. Proliferative responses of T cells cultured with PB neutrophils decreased as well, but to a lesser extent. T cell proliferation was partially recovered when catalase was added during the co-culture, indicating that hydrogen peroxide played a critical role in T cell hyporesponsiveness.Table ICD3-ɛ ligation-induced proliferative responses of PB T cells cultured with autologous PB or SF neutrophilsNeutrophils CatalaseProliferative response− −PB −PB +SF −SF +cpm% of controlcpm% of controlcpm% of controlcpm% of controlcpm% of controlPatient 17098(100)534375.361.186305843.1471166.4Patient 211,448(100)701061.242.037.5360431.5557048.6Patient 310,320(100)558254.172.070.0139013.510,938106.0Patient 415,053(100)12,37482.221,903145.510,84972.112,40882.4Peripheral blood T cells and synovial fluid neutrophils were obtained from RA patients. T cells were co-cultured for 16 h with or without syngenic SF or PB neutrophils in the presence or absence of catalase.

Data are expressed in cpm and percentage of control proliferation (T cells cultured without neutrophils and without catalase). Analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in oxidative stress-induced T cell hyporesponsiveness is severely hampered by the limited number of T cells that can be isolated from e.g. synovial fluid biopsies. We therefore developed a system in which hyporesponsive T lymphocytes are generated in vitro through co-culture of buffy coat-derived T cells and fMLP-activated neutrophils (Fig. 1). The level of induced T cell hyporesponsiveness directly correlated with the amount of O2⨪ produced in the different experiments (p < 0,01; Fig. 1 A). Moreover, treatment with three different anti-oxidants, NAC, MnTBAP, and catalase, before the anti-CD3ε mAb-mediated stimulation restored the proliferative response (Fig. 1 B). The same degree of hyporesponsiveness was seen with all the concentration of anti-CD3ε mAb tested (Fig. 1 C). These data show that fMLP-activated buffy coat-derived neutrophils can induce T cell hyporesponsiveness through the action of ROS. Because T lymphocytes exposed to high doses of H2O2 undergo apoptosis (42Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we wished to investigate if the hyporesponsiveness induced in our system was due to T cell apoptosis. Annexin V and propidium iodide staining of T cells indicated that activated neutrophils did not induce cell death of co-cultured T lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Furthermore, upon anti-CD3ε mAb-mediated stimulation of oxidative stress-exposed T cells, only limited cell death induction was observed (Fig. 2). In contrast, T lymphocytes shortly treated high concentrations of H2O2 were dead (Fig. 2). These data show that T cell hyporesponsiveness induced by co-culture with fMLP-activated neutrophils is not due to induction of cell death. T cells isolated from patients affected by different diseases as RA, cancer, and patients affected with AIDS express lower levels of the TCR-ζ chain and, in some cases, p56lck (7Stefanova I.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, T cells rendered hyporesponsive in vitro appeared to express slightly lower levels of p56lck, as detected using flow cytometry and Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). The expression level of TCR-ζ chain measured by flow cytometry with a monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of the molecule was strongly down-modulated (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, Western blot analysis using a monoclonal TCR-ζ-specific antibody specific for an epitope (amino acids 36–54) containing a part of the transmembrane region of the molecule revealed similar expression levels in normal versus hyporesponsive T cells (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that in hyporesponsive T cells, TCR-ζ could have undergone a conformational change. To analyze the role of ROS in the modulation of these signaling molecules, the expression level of p56lck and TCR-ζ was analyzed in T lymphocytes co-cultured with neutrophils in the presence of catalase. As shown in Fig. 3 C a normal expression level of p56lck and TCR-ζ is observed in the presence of this anti-oxidant. As detected by Western blot analysis, expression levels of p59fyn, ZAP-70, LAT, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were similar in the two T cell populations (Fig. 3 D). To analyze signaling events associated with TCR engagement, we examined changes in [Ca2+]i by flow cytometry. After stimulation with an anti-CD3ε mAb (OKT3), a rapid and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i flux was observed in normal T lymphocytes, whereas a decreased mobilization of [Ca2+]i was found in hyporesponsive T cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the TCR in hyporesponsive T cells is unable to efficiently couple to mechanisms responsible for increases in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that ROS exposure results in an impaired signal transduction through the TCR. To demonstrate that ROS were responsible for the alteration of TCR-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, T lymphocytes were co-cultured with neutrophils in the presence of catalase. As shown in Fig. 4, catalase was able to restore [Ca2+]i mobilization, directly implicating ROS in this signaling defect. To examine upstream events of the TCR-signaling pathway, we analyzed the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by anti-CD3ε stimulation in normal and hyporesponsive T cells (Fig. 5). Anti-CD3ε stimulation induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a high molecular mass protein in normal T lymphocytes (e.g. ∼150 kDa, Fig. 5), which was almost undetectable in oxidative stress-exposed T cells. Intriguingly, the TCR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of low molecular mass proteins (e.g. ∼23 kDa, Fig. 5) was less affected. A protein of around 40 kDa was already substantially tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated hyporesponsive T cells, probably due to the known effects of ROS on kinase and phosphatase activities (44Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-ζ chain (molecular mass, 21–23 kDa, phospho-ζ) is one of the first biochemical events detectable in T cells upon TCR ligation. To assess whether the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼23 kDa observed in our phosphotyrosine blot corresponded to phospho-ζ, lysates from unstimulated and stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with an mAb against the TCR-ζ chain. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-TCR-ζ mAb. In normal and hyporesponsive T lymphocytes, TCR engagement led to a similar increase in TCR-ζ phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the induction of the p21 and p23 forms of this subunit of the TCR complex. Blotting with anti-TCR-ζ chain antibody showed that comparable amounts of the protein were immunoprecipitated in all the lanes (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, ROS exposure does not profoundly alter the most proximal measurable TCR-signaling event in T lymphocytes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4–5-biphosphate to inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate generation induces a sustained increase in intracellular calcium, whereas diacylglycerol promotes the activation of protein kinase C. Because TCR ligation induced reduced Ca2+ flux in hyporesponsive T lymphocytes, we wondered whether PLC-γ1 activation was defective in these cells. Consistent with this possibility, an inducible tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼150 kDa, seen in activated T cells, is not observed in hyporesponsive T lymphocytes (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation of lysates of normal and hyporesponsive T cells with an anti-PLC-γ1 antibody followed by phosphotyrosine blotting indicated that upon TCR stimulation PLC-γ1 does not get phosphorylated in hyporesponsive T lymphocytes (Fig. 6 B). The same blot was reprobed with an anti-PLC-γ1 antibody to confirm that"

We observed a novel endogenous association of BRCA1 with Nmi (N-Myc-interacting protein) in breast cancer cells. Nmi was found to interact specifically with BRCA1, both in vitro and in vivo, by binding to two major domains in BRCA1, amino acid residues 298–683 and 1301–1863. Homodimerization of Nmi enhanced its association with BRCA1. Nmi functioned as an adaptor molecule to recruit c-Myc to a complex containing Nmi·c-Myc·BRCA1. Because c-Myc can activate transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT), we addressed the role of BRCA1 and Nmi in modulating c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity. Although Nmi or BRCA1 alone had no effect on c-Myc induced hTERT promoter activity, BRCA1 together with Nmi significantly inhibited this c-Myc induced hTERT promoter activity (∼75% inhibition). Two mutated forms of BRCA1, a missense (A1708E) and a nonsense (Y1853X) that have been identified in familial breast cancers, associated with Nmi and c-Myc but failed to suppress c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity. These results demonstrate a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby mutations in BRCA1, via a novel transcription factor complex containing BRCA1, c-Myc, and Nmi, impair inhibition of c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity, which allows sustained activation of telomerase, a key enzyme in carcinogenesis.

Germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor BRCA1 predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. Current evidence demonstrates that mutations in BRCA1 do not directly result in tumor formation but instead cause genetic instability, subjecting cells to a high risk of malignant transformation (1Chen Y.

However, the molecular mechanisms that activate this enzyme during neoplastic transformation are not well understood. To identify potential novel binding partner(s) of BRCA1, which may help to elucidate its role(s) in hereditary breast cancer, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal domain (1301–1853 aa) 1The abbreviations used are: aaamino acid(s)hTERThuman telomerase reverse transcriptase geneNmiN-Myc-interacting protein4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenIFN-γinterferon γSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseERestrogen receptorBRCTBRCA1 C terminus repeatMaxMyc-associating protein X of BRCA1 as a bait.

A Jurkat LexA cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened using LexA-BRCA1 (1301–1853 aa) as a bait. Among the 1 × 107 cDNA libraries screened, 15 clones were identified as LexA-BRCA1 (1301–1853 aa)-interacting partners in both the β-galactosidase reporter and leucine reporter assays.

HA-BRCA1 (1–683 aa) and HA-BRCA1 (1301–1863 aa) were constructed by inserting individual PCR fragments into a pcDNA3 vector (30Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All new constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The Flag-Nmi cDNA construct was generated by PCR. GST-BRCA1 fusion cDNA constructs were generated by cloning individual BRCA1 PCR products into a pGEX4T-1 plasmid vector. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11), anti-Flag antibody (M2), and anti-c-Myc antibodies (N-262 and 9E10) were purchased from Babco, Sigma, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. BRCA1 monoclonal antibodies (BR1N129.5 and BR1H945.2) were a gift from Dr. Tina Kuus Reichel (Beckman-Coulter). Nmi antibodies (R1373 and R1445) were obtained from Dr. W. J. Leonard (34Zhu M.H. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After a 48-h transfection, cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) and put on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 2 h using the indicated antibodies, and beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Association assays between the GST-c-Myc fusion protein and BRCA1 or Nmi were performed by incubating GST-beads with 293T total cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde/2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to BRCA1 (at 1:200) and polyclonal anti-sera to Nmi (at 1:500) in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% goat serum. After washing, appropriate species-specific, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were applied as recommended by the manufacturer, and fluorescence was visualized using a confocal microscope. For staining of c-Myc and Nmi, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with pRc-c-Myc plasmid followed by immunostaining with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-Nmi rabbit polyclonal antibody (R1445). Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed following the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Biosciences). The GST pull-down assay was performed by incubating 10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads with the total cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C. After four washes of the beads in lysis buffer, the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Transfections in T47D cells were performed by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg of the hTERT promoter (181 bp) plasmid, 0.5 μg of the pCMVβ-gal plasmid, 0.375 μg of the pRc-c-Myc plasmid, 0.75 μg of the wild-type or mutant HA-BRCA1 plasmids, and 0.5 μg of the Flag-Nmi plasmid following adjustment of total DNA amounts with a pcDNA3 vector in 6-well plates. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed. Transfection efficiency was assessed by determining β-galactosidase activity, and luciferase activities were normalized by β-galactosidase activities. NIH 3T3/c-Myc-ER cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the hTERT promoter (181 bp), 0.5 μg of HA-BRCA1, 0.25 μg of Flag-Nmi, and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ-gal plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After a 6-h transfection, cells were treated with 0.75 μm 4-OHT for 48 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. The BRCT domain (1301–1853 aa) of BRCA1 served as bait in the LexA yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). One gene identified in this analysis encoded amino acids (91–307 aa) of the known protein Nmi. Nmi was identified as an N-Myc/c-Myc-interacting protein (32Bao J. Zervos A.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of Nmi is unknown, its C terminus is similar to an interferon-induced leucine zipper protein, IFP 35 (35). Nmi binds to both c-Myc and N-Myc in cells and to other transcription factors in yeast. It is expressed at low levels in all fetal and adult human tissues (32Bao J. Zervos A.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar) except the brain and is seen at high levels in certain myeloid leukemias, which also express high levels of c-Myc (32Bao J. Zervos A.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar). Nmi protein can be induced by interleukin-2 or IFN-γ in lymphocytes (36Chun J. Shpall R.L. Meyerdierks A. Hagemeier M. Böttger E.C. Naumovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36278-36284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,37Zhou X. Liao J. Meyerdierks A. Feng L. Naumovski L. Bottger E.C. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21364-21371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nmi was also shown to interact with all STAT proteins except Stat2 to enhance the association of the CBP/p300 coactivator protein with Stat1 and Stat5, and together with CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300, to augment interleukin-2 and IFN-γ-dependent transcription (34Zhu M.H. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To test whether Nmi directly binds to the BRCT repeat, in vitro binding assays were performed using a GST-BRCA1 (1301–1863 aa) fusion protein. Bacterially expressed and purified GST-BRCA1 (1301–1863 aa), but not GST alone, bound to the in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled Nmi protein (data not shown). To confirm the BRCA1-Nmi interaction in mammalian cells, we co-transfected human 293T embryonic kidney cells with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged BRCA1 and Flag-tagged Nmi. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. The precipitated complex was then resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody. Flag-Nmi was co-precipitated with the full-length HA-BRCA1 (Fig. 1A). In reciprocal experiments of immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody, BRCA1 co-precipitated with Nmi (Fig. 1B).Figure 1BRCA1-Nmi interaction in vitro and in vivo. A and B, 293T cells were transfected with Flag-Nmi and HA-BRCA1 as indicated. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of HA-BRCA1 DNA plasmid and 0.375 μg of Flag-Nmi DNA plasmid. After 48 h, total cell lysates were collected and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody (A) or anti-Flag antibody (B). The immunocomplexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting (WB) using anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies as indicated. Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed for expression level of Flag-Nmi and HA-BRCA1 by Western blotting. Input, total transfected cell lysates. C and D, to demonstrate the endogenous association of BRCA1 and Nmi, total cell lysates from T47D cells were immunoprecipitated with BRCA1 antibody (C), Nmi antibody (D), or control antibody. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then detected by Western blotting using either Nmi (C) or BRCA1 (D) antibodies. In the lower panels, the blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-BRCA1 and anti-Nmi antibodies, respectively. E, Nmi and BRCA1 co-localized in nuclear dots in T47D cells, MCF-7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were dually stained with BRCA1 monoclonal antibody (green) and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Nmi (red) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Significant co-localization of BRCA1 and Nmi nuclear dots in cells is reflected by the presence of yellow nuclear dots in the merged images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The in vivo interaction between Nmi and BRCA1 was further examined in T47D breast cancer cells. Anti-BRCA1 or anti-Nmi immunoprecipitates of extracts from T47D cells and MCF-7 cells, independently performed with two BRCA1 monoclonal antibodies and two Nmi polyclonal antibodies, co-precipitated BRCA1 and Nmi. Anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibody, but not isotype control antibody, specifically immunoprecipitated the 220-kDa BRCA1 in T47D cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibody, but not the control antibody, resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nmi (Fig. 1C). BRCA1 was reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Nmi antibody (Fig. 1D). Similar data were obtained in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells (data not shown). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis using BRCA1 monoclonal antibody revealed BRCA1 localization in nuclear dots as reported previously (31Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). In the majority of T47D, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells, Nmi and BRCA1 are co-localized with one another in nuclear foci (Fig. 1E). The co-immunoprecipitation data and immunostaining results suggest that BRCA1 and Nmi interact directly in vivo. To map the regions required for BRCA1 interaction with Nmi, a series of GST-BRCA1 deletion mutants were constructed and precipitated with the total cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with Flag-Nmi. As shown in Fig. 2A, Nmi binds to two potential major domains in the BRCA1 protein corresponding to amino acid residues 298–683 and 1301–1863, respectively. In addition, when 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-Nmi and an HA-BRCA1 cDNA construct containing 1301–1863 aa, the binding of Flag-Nmi with BRCA1 (1301–1863 aa) was observed (Fig. 2B). When 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-Nmi and an HA-BRCA1 (1–683 aa) construct, the association of Flag-Nmi and HA-BRCA1 (1–683 aa) was also observed (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the binding of Nmi to BRCA1 is mediated through two BRCA1 domains containing 1301–1863- and 1–683-aa residues. Nmi shares 25% amino acid identity with the IFN-γ-inducible protein IFP 35, which was identified as an IFN-γ-inducible gene in HeLa cells (38Bange F.C. Vogel U. Flohr T. Kiekenbeck M. Denecke B. Bottger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homologous region (90–92 aa) between Nmi and IFP 35 is a novel Nmi/IFP 35 domain repeated in tandem in both proteins. This domain mediates Nmi-Nmi and Nmi-IFP 35 interactions as well as subcellular localization (35Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To analyze whether Nmi forms homodimers, two constructs (HA epitope-tagged Nmi and a Flag epitope-tagged Nmi) were used for the co-transfection assay in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitates using anti-Flag antibody were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. HA-Nmi was observed to bind to Flag-Nmi (Fig. 3A). Similar data were obtained when the samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that Nmi can homodimerize in vitro, as reported previously (35Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Next, to elucidate the effects of Nmi homodimerization on BRCA1 interaction with Nmi, 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-Nmi, HA-BRCA1, and increasing amounts of HA-Nmi. The samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. A dose-dependent increase in the association of HA-BRCA1 and Flag-Nmi was observed in the presence of increasing amounts of HA-Nmi (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Nmi homodimerization is involved in BRCA1 and Nmi interaction. Nmi has been shown to interact with c-Myc (32Bao J. Zervos A.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar), although the biological role of Nmi binding to c-Myc is not well defined. BRCA1 was reported to associate with c-Myc (16Wang Q. Zhang H. Kajino K. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because both Nmi and BRCA1 bind to c-Myc, we investigated the potential association of Nmi and BRCA1 with c-Myc and the formation of a BRCA1·c-Myc·Nmi complex. 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-BRCA1 and/or pEBG-c-Myc. Total cell lysates were prepared and precipitated with GST-beads, which specifically bind to the GST-c-Myc fusion protein. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. c-Myc was observed to associate with BRCA1 (Fig. 4A). When 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-Nmi and pEBG-c-Myc, Nmi was found to be associated with c-Myc (Fig. 4B). To characterize the complex formation of Nmi, BRCA1, and c-Myc, 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-BRCA1, pEBG-c-Myc, and various amounts of Flag-Nmi. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared and incubated with GST-beads. The precipitated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, increased amounts of Nmi resulted in an increase in the association of BRCA1 and c-Myc. Similar experiments were performed with increasing amounts of HA-BRCA1 to further elucidate the molecular interaction of c-Myc and Flag-Nmi. As shown in Fig. 4D, the association between c-Myc and Flag-Nmi was enhanced with increasing amounts of HA-BRCA1. When 293T cells and T47D breast cancer cells were co-transfected with HA-BRCA1, Flag-Nmi, and pRc-c-Myc expression constructs, c-Myc increased the interaction of BRCA1 and Nmi in T47D cells (Fig. 5A) as well as in 293T cells (data not shown), indicating that breast cancer cells expressed the tricomplex of Nmi·BRCA1·c-Myc.Figure 5Endogenous c-Myc·BRCA1· Nmi complex in T47D and MCF-10A cells. A, complex formation of Nmi·c-Myc·BRCA1 in T47D cells. T47D cells were co-transfected with HA-BRCA1 (1.0 μg), Flag-Nmi (0.75 μg), and/or pRc-c-Myc (1.0 μg). Total cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB) using anti-HA antibody. In addition, aliquots of these lysates were analyzed for expression of Nmi, c-Myc, and BRCA1 as indicated by Western blotting. B and C, endogenous c-Myc·BRCA1·Nmi complex in T47D cells and MCF-10A cells. 1 × 107 cells were grown in 5% (−) or 20% (+) fetal bovine serum medium overnight and then lysed. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads and normal rabbit IgG (C lane). Immunoprecipitations were performed for 4 h at 4 °C using anti-Nmi rabbit polyclonal antibody (R1445). Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting for c-Myc detection using c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and for BRCA1 detection using BRCA1 monoclonal antibody (H945.2), respectively. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Nmi antibody (R1373). D, Nmi and c-Myc co-localized in the nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with c-Myc construct. Cells were cultured for 2 days, and immunostained dually with Nmi polyclonal antibodies (green) and c-Myc monoclonal antibodies (red). Significant co-localization of Nmi and c-Myc in the nucleus was observed as indicated by the presence of the yellow color in the merged image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the presence of endogenous c-Myc·BRCA1·Nmi complexes in T47D breast cancer cells and in MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells. Cells were cultured in low serum (5%) or high serum (20%) medium as indicated, and total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Nmi antibody (R1445) and anti-c-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, in the presence of low serum, we observed Nmi and c-Myc association, whereas no association of Nmi with BRCA1 was observed. However, in the presence of high serum, we observed an endogenous association of Nmi with BRCA1, and the association between Nmi and c-Myc was also significantly increased (Fig. 5, B and C). To address Nmi and c-Myc nuclear co-localization, we transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with the c-Myc expression plasmid, pRc-c-Myc, followed by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-Nmi rabbit polyclonal antibody (R1445). As shown in Fig. 5D, nuclear staining of c-Myc (red) and endogenous Nmi (green), as well as co-localization of c-Myc and Nmi (yellow) were observed. These data indicate that Nmi, BRCA1, and c-Myc can form a complex under growth conditions and that Nmi functions as an adaptor molecule to recruit c-Myc with BRCA1. Telomerase maintenance has been proposed as an essential prerequisite to human tumor development. The telomerase reverse transcriptase component (TERT) is not expressed in most primary human cells and tissues but is up-regulated in the majority of immortalized cell lines and tumors (28Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar, 29Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 30Sedivy J.M. Proc.

Because Nmi, BRCA1, and c-Myc form a complex, we investigated the effects of BRCA1 and Nmi on c-Myc-induced human hTERT promoter activity in breast cancer cells. T47D breast cancer cells were co-transfected with Flag-Nmi, pRc-c-Myc, HA-BRCA1, and a reporter plasmid containing the core promoter of hTERT(pGL3 vector inserted with the 181-bp promoter region of hTERT) as described (33Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 40Takakura M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Hirano H. Takeda J. Yutsudo M. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity of the hTERT promoter was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Significant activation of the hTERT promoter in the presence of c-Myc was observed as expected in 293T cells (data not shown) as well as in T47D cells (Fig. 6,A and B), whereas no significant change in the basal activity of the hTERT promoter was observed with the introduction of Flag-Nmi or HA-BRCA1 alone. Furthermore, in T47D cells, HA-BRCA1 or Flag-Nmi alone had no significant effect on c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity (Fig. 6A), whereas c-Myc alone activated the hTERT promoter about 6-fold. c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity was blocked (∼75% inhibition) by the combination of Flag-Nmi and HA-BRCA1. Importantly, upon removal of Flag-Nmi, HA-BRCA1 failed to inhibit c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity (Fig. 6A). Two BRCA1 mutants identified in familial breast cancers, the missense mutation A1708E and the nonsense mutation Y1853X, bound c-Myc or Nmi but failed to reduce c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity in T47D cells (Fig. 6, D, E, and C, respectively). These results demonstrate that c-Myc led to significant activation of hTERT transcription, whereas Nmi together with wild-type BRCA1 significantly blocked hTERT promoter activity induced by c-Myc. However, Nmi together with mutated BRCA1 failed to block c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity, indicating that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 is important for its interaction with Nmi and in regulating the hTERT promoter activity induced by c-Myc. We further investigated the effects of Nmi and BRCA1 on hTERT promoter activity using the hormone inducible form of c-Myc in stable transfected NIH 3T3/c-Myc-ER cells (24Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C.

Upon treatment of these cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), c-Myc expression and activity are induced, resulting in c-Myc-enhanced hTERT promoter activity (24Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H.

As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of NIH 3T3/c-Myc-ER cells with 0.75 μm 4-OHT induced hTERT promoter activity by ∼5-fold. This induction was completely abolished in the presence of BRCA1 together with Nmi, whereas BRCA1 or Nmi alone had no effect on 4-OHT-induced hTERT promoter activity. Furthermore, mutated BRCA1 failed to inhibit hTERT promoter activity in the presence of 4-OHT and Nmi, indicating the involvement of intact BRCA1 in regulating hTERT promoter activity in the presence of Nmi. Thus, BRCA1 regulates c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity in the presence of Nmi. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancers can be caused by loss-of-function germ-line mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene BRCA1 (1Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Chew H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Deng C-X. Scott F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Wang Q. Zhang H. Fishel R. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6152-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Current evidence demonstrates that mutations in BRCA1 do not directly result in tumor formation, but instead cause genetic instability, subjecting cells to a high risk of malignant transformation. BRCA1 is in a class of caretaker genes, which function in maintaining genetic stability (1Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Chew H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Deng C-X. Scott F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Wang Q. Zhang H. Fishel R. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6152-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have shown a novel association of BRCA1 with Nmi in vitro and in vivo and have observed that Nmi homodimerization enhances Nmi association with BRCA1. Furthermore, BRCA1 and Nmi can form a complex with c-Myc in vitro and in vivo. This tricomplex results in inhibition of c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity in breast cancer cells. Mutated BRCA1 (A1708E and Y1853X) also associates with Nmi and c-Myc but fails to suppress c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that BRCA1 can play a novel role as a component of a transcription factor complex that contains Nmi and c-Myc. This complex may function as a tumor suppressor by regulating c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity. c-Myc is an important regulator of many cellular processes, including growth promotion, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying c-Myc biological activity remain elusive. The C-terminal domain of c-Myc mediates its interaction with Max and physiological recognition of DNA target sequences, events needed for all biological actions. Interactions between the C-terminal domain and other cellular proteins, including YY-1, AP-2, BRCA1, TFII-I, and Miz-1, suggest levels of regulatory complexity beyond Max in controlling DNA recognition by c-Myc (21Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Claassen G.F. Hann S.R.

An intact HLH region was required in c-Myc for efficient association with BRCA1 (16Wang Q. Zhang H. Kajino K. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). BRCA1 does not, however, bind to Max (16Wang Q. Zhang H. Kajino K. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). BRCA1-repressed c-Myc-mediated transcription adds another level of regulation to the c-Myc network. As observed in our study, BRCA1 and Nmi together down-regulate c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity, suggesting that the mechanism by which BRCA1 acts as a tumor suppressor might be through the down-modulation of some targets of c-Myc transcriptional activity. Based on our findings, Nmi acts as an adaptor and recruits BRCA1 to a complex with c-Myc under cell growth conditions. The presence of the endogenous c-Myc·BRCA1·Nmi complex in T47D and MCF-10A cells under growth conditions suggests that the interaction of these three components plays a role during proliferation, probably by inhibiting the c-Myc-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells. Consistent with its association in cells, overexpression of BRCA1 selectively repressed c-Myc-mediated transactivation and inhibited Ras co-transformation of embryonic fibroblasts by c-Myc but not by SV40T antigen. Thus, BRCA1 and Nmi may act in part by regulating the oncogenic potential of c-Myc. Because c-Myc can elevate telomerase activity in normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts to a level approximating that observed in tumor cell lines, increased c-Myc activity could account for the presence of telomerase in many late-stage tumors (28Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar, 29Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 30Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9078-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the c-myc oncogene may induce telomerase activity in a significant proportion of tumors, telomerase may also be regulated by other pathways that contribute to transformation (28Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar, 29Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 30Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9078-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, based on our observations, mutated BRCA1 alone or in the presence of Nmi had no effect on c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity. Thus, mutations in BRCA1 associated with hereditary breast cancer interfere with the suppression of c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity, leading to the sustained activation of telomerase, a prerequisite in carcinogenesis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a new cellular function of BRCA1 and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of breast cancer.

Our results indicate that RubA plays a specific role in the biogenesis of PS I. In oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, two photosystems (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PSphotosystemChlchlorophyllDMn-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranosideEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferaseMVmethyl viologenORFopen reading frameμEmicroeinsteins1The abbreviations used are: PSphotosystemChlchlorophyllDMn-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranosideEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferaseMVmethyl viologenORFopen reading frameμEmicroeinsteins cooperate in the utilization of light energy to produce the reducing power and chemical energy required for carbon dioxide fixation. PS II carries out the light-dependent oxidation of water and produces a weak reductant, plastoquinol. PS I catalyzes the light-dependent oxidation of plastocyanin (or cytochrome c6) and produces a strong reductant, reduced ferredoxin (or flavodoxin). The composition and general properties of PS I and II are rather well understood (for reviews, see Refs. 1Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. 16.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 213-247Google Scholar), although important functional details continue to be missing. Using PS I and II complexes purified from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, structural details for both photosystems have recently been obtained by x-ray crystallography (4Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 5Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar).The PS I reaction center is a large, multisubunit complex that forms trimers in cyanobacterial membranes. The structure of cyanobacterial PS I at 2.5-Å resolution shows that each monomer comprises 12 polypeptides (denoted PsaA–PsaF, PsaI–PsaM, and PsaX), 96 chlorophyll (Chl) a molecules, 22 β-carotene molecules, three [4Fe-4S] clusters, two phylloquinones, and five tightly bound lipids (5Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Six redox centers are involved in light-induced electron transfer in PS I (Fig. 1). The PsaA/PsaB heterodimer harbors the primary electron donor P700 (a Chl a dimer), A0 (a monomeric Chl a), A1(a phylloquinone), and FX (an interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster). Two terminal electron acceptors, FA and FB, are [4Fe-4S] clusters that are located on the extrinsic PsaC protein (6Vassiliev I.R. Antonkine M.L. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been achieved in elucidating of the structure and function of the PS I, many questions still remain concerning the biogenesis and regulation of PS I in the thylakoid membrane.The biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes in cyanobacteria and higher plant chloroplasts is a complex multistep process that includes apoprotein translation, protein folding and insertion into the thylakoid membrane, cofactor binding, iron-sulfur cluster assembly, and ordered association of the individual subunits to form multisubunit complexes. It has been demonstrated that all of these steps are highly regulated at the post-translational level, especially for the cofactor- and pigment-binding polypeptides. In recent years, several factors involved in either the assembly or the stability of PS I have been identified (e.g. Refs. 7Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6382-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux D. Turmel M. Rochaix J.-D.

Nevertheless, the detailed molecular mechanisms of assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus in the thylakoid membranes remain poorly understood. The identification of genes whose products function in the assembly of the photosystem complexes should greatly increase our understanding of biogenesis and regulation photosynthesis specifically and protein complexes generally.The search for proteins that function in the biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes has been greatly facilitated by sequencing of chloroplast genomes, cyanobacterial genomes, the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the genomes of diverse bacteria. These data, in combination with screens for mutants defective in photosystem assembly in cyanobacteria (10Vermaas W.F.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 457-481Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (12Togasaki R.K. Surzycki S.J. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 13-23Google Scholar), have identified genes whose products function in photosystem biogenesis. The relatively simple, small genomes of cyanobacteria and the facile ability to manipulate these organisms genetically have proven to be significant advantages in the search for such assembly or stabilizing proteins.In this study, a membrane-associated rubredoxin that is found in cyanobacteria and diverse eukaryotes is described. In contrast to the results of Wastl et al. (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30058-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), who concluded that a chloroplast-localized rubredoxin is associated with PS II, it is conclusively demonstrated here that this rubredoxin, denoted RubA, is absolutely required for assembly of functional PS I complexes in cyanobacteria. Mutants lacking RubA produce trimeric PS I complexes, which are inactive in electron transport to flavodoxin or the artificial acceptor methyl viologen. PS I complexes isolated from the rubA mutant contain all membrane-intrinsic subunits but are completely devoid of the stromal PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE subunits. A preliminary report of some of these results was presented at the XIth International Congress on Photosynthesis in Budapest, Hungary (14Shen G. Antonkine M.L. Vassiliev I.R. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A.

However, rubredoxins have also been found in a few aerobic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas oleovorans(46Kok M. Oldenhuis R. van der Linden M.P. Meulenberg C.H. Kingma J. Witholt B. J. Biol.

Rubredoxins have been spectroscopically, biophysically, and structurally well characterized for many years. The roles of these proteins in cellular metabolism and physiology remain poorly understood, although they have recently been implicated as electron donors or acceptors in diverse biochemical reactions. Reduced rubredoxins have been proposed or shown to serve as electron donors to nitrate reductase (48Seki Y. Seki S. Satoh M. Ikeda A. Ishimoto M. J. Biochem.

The product of the nucleomorph-encoded rubredoxin gene includes a long leader sequence that is presumed to direct the protein into the cryptomonad chloroplast. A water-soluble, recombinant form of the G. theta rubredoxin has the optical and EPR spectroscopic characteristics of typical rubredoxins (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T.

Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the structure of the water-soluble zinc-rubredoxin domain of the protein has been solved by NMR methods (59Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Wastl J. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Sticht H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This soluble domain of the recombinant rubredoxin is quite similar in structure to typical bacterial rubredoxins. The full-length rubredoxin of G. theta could be imported into pea chloroplasts (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30058-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and by using antibodies to the G. theta rubredoxin in immunoelectron microscopy studies, the protein was shown to be localized to thylakoids in G. theta and pea chloroplasts. Although rubredoxin was also detected in thin sections of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, labeling of both the thylakoids and the cytoplasm was observed in this case (see Ref. 13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30058-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 B). It was suggested that the rubredoxin might be associated with PS II, since the protein was detected immunologically in grana thylakoids and PS II core complexes isolated from spinach chloroplasts (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol.

However, no direct demonstration of a role for rubredoxin in PS II structure, function, or assembly was established in these studies.The biochemical and spectroscopic properties of the cyanobacterial rubredoxin RubA reported here agree well with those reported for the rubredoxin of G. theta described above (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The optical and EPR properties of the water-soluble recombinant rubredoxin domain from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were nearly identical to those reported for the recombinant G. theta protein. The presence of an immunologically related protein in spinach thylakoids was confirmed here with an antiserum to a cyanobacterial RubA, and these antibodies also detected a protein of similar mass in thylakoid membranes of the green alga C. reinhardtii. RubA was shown to be present in purified thylakoid but not plasma membranes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and the important role of the putative transmembrane α-helix at the C terminus of the protein was established by complementation studies using a truncated form of the protein.In typical rubredoxins, three β-strands are joined by two loops, each of which contains two cysteine residues (Cys-X-X-Cys) ligated to an iron atom to form a structure known as a “knuckle” (59Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Wastl J. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Sticht H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All structurally characterized rubredoxins and rubredoxin-like domains of more complex proteins share significant amino acid sequence identity (∼50%; see Fig. 3) and have essentially isostructural [Fe(S-Cys)4] sites with distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (48Seki Y. Seki S. Satoh M. Ikeda A. Ishimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 59Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Wastl J. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Sticht H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the redox potentials of rubredoxins and rubredoxin-like domains vary over a considerable range from about −150 mV to about +230 mV (53da Costa P.N. Romão C.V. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Melo E. Teixeira M. Saralva L.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the redox potential of the RubA protein was not determined in this study, the soluble domain of the G. theta protein was shown to have a midpoint potential of +125 mV (13Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30058-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The C-terminal extension found in RubA homologs from cyanobacteria and other oxygen-evolving organisms is also highly conserved. This suggests that the flexible hinge region and the membrane anchor are likely to be quite important in the function of the RubA protein. The N-terminal extensions of the cyanobacterial and the eukaryotic RubA homologs are somewhat variable in sequence, but all of these sequences are rather hydrophilic and highly charged. C. pasteurianum rubredoxin (midpoint potential ∼−55 mV (38Eidsness M.K. Burded A.E. Richie K.A. Kurtz D.M. Scott R.A. Smith E.T. Ichiye T. Beard B. Min T. Kang C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14803-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) was unable to complement the rubA mutation, even when fused to the C-terminal extension of a cyanobacterial RubA. This could indicate that the redox potential of this protein is inappropriate to replace RubA function, that the N-terminal extension is very important in the functionality of RubA, that highly specific protein-protein interactions are required for RubA function, or that insufficient expression of the fusion protein was achieved to effect complementation. Further studies will be required to determine which of these possibilities is correct.The results presented here clearly establish that the loss of the RubA rubredoxin causes the complete loss of PS I activity as well as the destabilization of the three peripheral polypeptides, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE, that are associated with the stromal surface of the PS I complex (5Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauß N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Complementation studies with the rubA genes of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed that no unexpected secondary mutations had occurred in the rubA mutant strain. PS II activities in the rubA mutant of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were only slightly reduced on a per cell basis relative to the wild-type (76% of wild-type level; Table I). Our observations suggest that RubA is transiently associated with monomeric PS I complexes. Trimerization of PS I complexes requires the PsaL subunit (60Schluchter W.M. Shen G. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and mutational studies indicate that trimerization is stabilized by the presence of the PsaK subunit. 4G. Shen, J. H. Golbeck, and D. A. Bryant, unpublished observations. It is likely that trimerization is one of the final steps in PS I biogenesis, since PS I monomers lacking PsaL and PsaK are fully active to perform electron transfer from cytochrome c6 to flavodoxin (61Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W. Zybailov B. Ganago A. Vassiliev I. Bryant D. Golbeck J. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of RubA in the monomer fraction suggests that it might normally exert its action prior to PS I trimerization. In the accompanying paper (58Shen G. Antonkine M.L. van der Est A. Vassiliev I.R. Brettel K. Bittl R. Zhao J. Stehlik D. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20355-20366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), trimeric PS I complexes from the rubA mutant strain are characterized in detail. These studies establish that the loss of PS I activity results from a specific defect: an inability to assemble the interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster FX. In oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, two photosystems (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PSphotosystemChlchlorophyllDMn-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranosideEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferaseMVmethyl viologenORFopen reading frameμEmicroeinsteins1The abbreviations used are: PSphotosystemChlchlorophyllDMn-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranosideEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferaseMVmethyl viologenORFopen reading frameμEmicroeinsteins cooperate in the utilization of light energy to produce the reducing power and chemical energy required for carbon dioxide fixation. PS II carries out the light-dependent oxidation of water and produces a weak reductant, plastoquinol. PS I catalyzes the light-dependent oxidation of plastocyanin (or cytochrome c6) and produces a strong reductant, reduced ferredoxin (or flavodoxin). The composition and general properties of PS I and II are rather well understood (for reviews, see Refs. 1Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. 16.

https://openalex.org/W2027062206,"In this study, we find that WNT7b is the only member of the WNT family of autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules whose expression in the lung is restricted to the airway epithelium during embryonic development. To study the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie this restricted pattern of WNT7b expression, we isolated the proximal 1.0-kb mouse WNT7b promoter and mapped the transcriptional start sites. Transfection of the lung epithelial cell line MLE-15, which expresses WNT7b, shows that the 1.0-kb mouse WNT7b promoter is highly active in lung epithelial cells. This region of the WNT7b promoter contains several DNA binding sites for the important lung-restricted transcription factors TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2 can bind to a specific subset of their consensus DNA binding sites within the WNT7b promoter. Using cotransfection assays, we demonstrate that TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2 can trans-activate the WNT7b promoter in NIH-3T3 cells. Truncation of GATA6 or Foxa2 binding sites reduced the ability of these transcriptional regulators to trans-activate the WNT7b promoter. Finally, the minimal 118-bp region of the mouse WNT7b promoter containing only TTF-1 binding sites was synergistically activated by TTF-1 and GATA6, and we show that TTF-1 and GATA6 physically interact in vivo. Together, these results suggest that WNT7b gene expression in the lung epithelium is regulated in a combinatorial fashion by TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2.

Together, these results suggest that WNT7b gene expression in the lung epithelium is regulated in a combinatorial fashion by TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2. The development and differentiation of lung epithelial cells requires the proper coordination of autocrine and paracrine signaling events initiated by several families of secreted factors including fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and the bone morphogenetic protein family members (1Warburton D. Schwarz M. Tefft D. Flores-Delgado G. Anderson K.D. Cardoso W.V. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 55-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). These signaling events regulate cell differentiation and proliferation by modifying gene expression programs via transcriptional activation and/or repression. One group of signaling molecules which plays an important role during embryonic development, but whose role during lung development has not been well characterized, is the WNT family of secreted glycoproteins. WNT proteins bind to cell surface receptors of the Frizzled family. Frizzled receptors are seven membrane-spanning transmembrane proteins that share some similarity to G protein-coupled receptors (2Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). WNTs signal through several different pathways to regulate cell fate, movement, or adhesion (2Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). In the best studied of these, the so-called canonical WNT signaling pathway, binding of WNT proteins to Frizzled receptors transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus by inhibiting the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, resulting in an unphosphorylated and stabilized form of β-catenin which accumulates and translocates into the nuclease, forming complexes with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, which regulate gene transcription (2Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the expression patterns and the roles of the various WNT genes in other tissues, the expression patterns of WNT genes and their role during lung morphogenesis are not well defined. In this report, we show that WNT7b is the only WNT gene tested which is expressed exclusively in the airway epithelium during lung organogenesis. This restricted pattern of expression suggests that WNT7b is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms restricted to the lung epithelial cell lineage. Gene expression in lung epithelium is thought to be regulated by members of several transcription factor families including the homeodomain (TTF-1), GATA zinc finger (GATA6), and the Fox family of winged helix transcription factors (Foxa2) (3Mendelson C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 875-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Many lung-specific gene promoters including those for surfactant proteins A and B (SP-A and SP-B, respectively) and the Clara cell 10 kDa protein CC10 contain binding sites for one or more of these transcription factors (4Margana R.K. Boggaram V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3083-3090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Sawaya P.L. Stripp B.R. Whitsett J.A. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell.

However, the mechanisms by which these three different transcription factor families functionally regulate lung-specific gene expression are not fully understood. To examine the mechanisms behind the restricted pattern of WNT7b expression in the lung, we isolated and analyzed the proximal promoter region of the mouse WNT7b gene. The proximal 1.0-kb mouse WNT7b promoter exhibits high levels of transcriptional activity in the lung epithelial cell line MLE-15 and contains multiple binding sites for the transcription factors TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2. We show that TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2 proteins bind to some, but not all, of their respective consensus DNA binding sites located within the WNT7b promoter. TTF-1 is able to trans-activate a minimal 118-bp region of this promoter, whereas GATA6 and Foxa2 can trans-activate larger regions containing their respective DNA binding sites. Moreover, we show that TTF-1 and GATA6 physically interact in vivo and synergistically activate transcription of the minimal 118-bp mouse WNT7b promoter, indicating that the mouse WNT7b gene is regulated through protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. In situ hybridization analysis was performed as described previously (8Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and a detailed description of the various protocols can be found at the Molecular Cardiology Research Center Web site (www.med.upenn.edu/mcrc/histology/histologyhome.html). Probes for WNT2, 3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10a, 10b, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 have been described previously (9Reddy S. Andl T. Bagasra A. Lu M.M. Epstein D.J. Morrisey E.E. Millar S.E. Mech.

Total RNA was extracted from MLE-15 cells and dissected E17.5 mouse lung tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 20 μg of RNA was resolved by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted to a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences). This membrane was probed using a portion of the WNT7b cDNA which corresponded to bp 1–1050 of the published mouse WNT7b sequence (10Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P.

A KpnI subclone from one of the BAC clones which encompassed the region surrounding the translational start site was cloned and sequenced. Primer extension analysis was performed using 5 μg of E17.5 mouse embryonic lung or adult mouse liver poly(A)+RNA and the end-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-GCCAGGGAGCTGCGGTAGGACC-3′. 50,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to RNA overnight at 60 °C. Primer extension was performed at 42 °C for 1 h using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Extended products were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading buffer, and loaded onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To determine the size of the extension products, a DNA sequencing ladder generated from a M13 control plasmid was run next to the extension products. 5′-RACE was performed using E17.5 mouse embryonic lung poly(A)+ RNA, a commercially available kit (Invitrogen), and the following primary and nested oligonucleotides: primary, 5′-CTGCGCCATAGACAGCTGCGGCC-3′; nested, 5′-GCCAGGGAGCTGCGGTAGGACCACGC-3′. PCR products from the 5′-RACE reaction were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The following oligonucleotides were used to amplify by PCR the 1.0-kb mouse WNT7b promoter luciferase reporter construct and shorter deletions from WNT7b BAC DNA: 1,005-bp promoter region sense, 5′-CACGGTACCCCATTTGATGCTGCTGTCCGG-3′; 829-bp region sense, 5′-CACGGTACCGGATGTGCCAGGCACCTAGG-3′; 444-bp region sense, 5′-CACGGTACCACTAGAAACTGGAAACCAAG-3′; 118-bp region sense, 5′-CACGGTACCCTCGCCTGCTCGCGGCTCGC-3′; and the 58-bp region sense, 5′-CACGGTACCGGACACATTGGCCGCCCCGG-3′. All PCRs used the 3′-antisense oligonucleotide 5′-cacctcgagggcacgcgttgccaccatggtgag-3′. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) to generate the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3/Wnt7b-1.0, pGL3/Wnt7b-0.83, pGL3/Wnt7b-0.44, pGL3/Wnt7b-0.12, and pGL3/Wnt7b-0.06, respectively. To generate TTF-1 and Foxa2 expression constructs, the following primers were used to amplify TTF-1 from E17.5 embryonic mouse lung cDNA and mouse Foxa2 from a plasmid described previously (11Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Luckow B. Schutz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar): TTF-1 sense, 5′-CACGGATCCATGTCGATGAGTCCAAAGCACACG-3′; antisense, 5′-CACAAGCTTTCACCAGGTCCGACCATAAAGCAAG-3′; Foxa2 sense, 5′-CACGGATCCATGCTGGGAGCCGTGAAGATGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CACAAGCTTTTAGGATGAGTTCATAATAGGCC-3′. Mouse TTF-1 and Foxa2 were then cloned into pCMVTag2B resulting in pCMVTTF-1 and pCMVFoxa2, respectively. The pcDNA3G6 GATA6 expression plasmid has been described previously (8Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). pCMVTagGATA6 was generated by cloning the GATA6 cDNA into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pCMVTag3B. Fidelity of both reporter and expression plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the cloned PCR inserts. To generate nuclear extracts containing TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2 proteins, 1 × 107 HEK-293 cells were transfected with 15 μg of pCMVTTF-1, pcDNA3G6, or pCMVFoxa2 expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to a protocol published previously (12Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C.N. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MLE-15 lung epithelial cell nuclear extracts were also used in some experiments as noted. 7.5 μg of nuclear extract and 20,000 cpm of labeled double stranded oligonucleotide (for a list of oligonucleotides used in this study, see Table I) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in binding buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2% Ficoll, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 37.5 mm KCl). The TTF-1 (clone 8G7G3/1) and Foxa2 (clone 4C7) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Neomarkers, Inc. and the University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, respectively. The GATA6 rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously (13Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S.

For trans-activation assays, 1 × 106 NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the pGL3/Wnt7b-1.0, pGL3/Wnt7b-0.44, or pGL3/Wnt7b-0.12 reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of the pCMVTTF-1, pcDNAG6, or pCMVFoxa2 expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 as described previously (14Shu W.

For the synergistic trans-activation assays, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pCMVTTF-1, 0.4 μg of pcDNA3G6, or both, and 0.5 μg of the pGL3/Wnt7b-0.12 reporter plasmid. All transfections contained 0.5 μg of the pMSVβgal plasmid to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and commercially available kits were used to measure luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (Promega). All values are the average of three experiments performed in duplicate ± S.E. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pCMVTag, pCMVTagTTF-1 (FLAG-tagged), pCMVTagGATA6 (Myc-tagged) or both pCMVTagTTF-1/pCMVTagGATA using FuGENE 6 as indicated. After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of insoluble cellular material by centrifugation, half of the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) for 2 h. A portion of the remaining lysate was used for immunoblotting to detect expression levels of GATA6 and TTF-1. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). To determine which WNT genes are expressed during mouse lung development, we performed in situ hybridization on E14.5 mouse embryonic lung tissue using radiolabeled riboprobes corresponding to mouse mRNAs for WNT2, 3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10a, 10b, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 (9). The results of this survey indicated that only WNT2, 7b, and 11 were expressed in the lung at this time (Fig. 1). To determine the developmental profile of expression of these WNTs in the lung, in situ hybridization was carried out on E12.5 and E16.5 embryonic sections. Expression of WNT2 throughout the mesenchyme of the developing lung has been demonstrated previously, and our data confirm this expression pattern (Fig. 1, A–C) (15Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WNT7b expression was observed in the developing airway epithelium from E12.5 through E16.5 both in the distal airways and in the larger mainstem bronchial airways (Fig. 1, D–F). WNT11 expression was observed in both the epithelium and mesenchymal tissue of the developing lung as has been reported previously (Fig. 1,G–I) (16Lako M. Strachan T. Bullen P. Wilson D.I. Robson S.C. Lindsay S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 219: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Sense riboprobes did not exhibit a detectable signal for any of these genes (data not shown). These data show that WNT7b is the only WNT gene analyzed which is expressed exclusively in the lung epithelium during this time of embryonic development. The restricted pattern of WNT7b gene expression in the lung airway epithelium suggests that transcription of this gene is regulated by lung epithelium-specific mechanisms. To begin the characterization of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying expression of WNT7b in lung epithelium, we performed primer extension and 5′-RACE analysis on mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA from E17.5 embryos and adult mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA. Primer extension analysis identified three major sites of transcriptional initiation for the mouse WNT7b gene in embryonic lung (Fig. 2 A). However, no extension products were obtained with adult liver poly(A)+ RNA, which correlates with an absence of WNT7b transcripts in this tissue (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) (10Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). One of these sites, site B, was consistently produced at higher levels than sites A and C (Fig. 2 A). 5′-RACE confirmed sites B and C (Fig. 2 B). However, we never obtained 5′-RACE products corresponding to site A. This either suggests that site A is an artifact of the primer extension assay or that analysis of the 5′-RACE products was incomplete. We compared the sequences obtained from the primer extension and 5′-RACE analysis with the proximal upstream genomic DNA sequences in two BACs containing the mouse WNT7b gene. These sequences were found to correspond exactly to those in the WNT7b BAC clones (Figs. 2 B and3). The proximal 1-kb mouse WNT7b proximal promoter region was sequenced and analyzed further.Figure 3The mouse WNT7b 1.0-kb promoter. The DNA sequence of the proximal mouse WNT7b promoter is shown. The three transcriptional start sites are denoted by arrows(A, B, and C). TTF-1 sites are indicated by boxes, GATA6 sites are indicated by brackets, and Foxa2 sites are indicated by underlines. Sp-1 sites are designated by dotted underlines. The start codon for the WNT7b open reading frame is shown in highlighted italics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the transcriptional start sites obtained from primer extension and 5′-RACE with the 1st kb of WNT7b BAC genomic DNA sequence upstream of these sites reveals a promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA box but contains numerous Sp-1 binding sites (Fig. 3). Interestingly, binding sites for TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2, all of which have been shown to play important roles in lung epithelial gene transcription, were found in the proximal 1-kb region (Fig. 3). The GATA6 and Foxa2 putative DNA binding sites were grouped together in a region extending from bp −870 to bp –560 (Fig. 3). In contrast, TTF-1 DNA binding sites were found distributed throughout the WNT7b proximal 1.0-kb promoter (Fig. 3). The abundance of DNA binding sites for transcription factors implicated in lung epithelial gene transcription in the proximal 1.0-kb WNT7b promoter suggests that this region may confer transcriptional activity in lung epithelial cell lines. Therefore, the MLE-15 mouse epithelial cell line, which expresses TTF-1, GATA6, and Foxa2, was tested for expression of WNT7b (17Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Liu C. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that MLE-15 cells express the WNT7b gene (Fig. 4 A). MLE-15 and NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the WNT7b 1.0-kb promoter (pGL3/Wnt7b-1.0) to test the activity of this promoter region in lung epithelial and non-lung cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, high levels of luciferase activity were obtained with the pGL3/Wnt7b-1.0 construct in MLE-15 cells, whereas NIH-3T3 cells displayed only low levels of activity (Fig. 4 C, column A). To analyze further which regions in the WNT7b promoter were essential for in vitro activity in MLE-15 cells, serially truncated fragments of the 1.0-kb region were generated, cloned into the pGL3basic luciferase reporter plasmid, and transfected into MLE-15 and NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 4 B). Truncation to bp −444 resulted in a net increase in transcriptional activity of the WNT7b promoter in MLE-15 cells of 73% (Fig. 4 C, column C). Further truncation to bp −118 resulted in more than 75% reduction in luciferase activity in these cells (compared with the 1.0-kb WNT7b promoter fragment) (Fig. 4 C, column D). However, truncation to bp −58 brought the luciferase activity down to almost background levels (Fig. 4 C, column E). Of note, none of the WNT7b promoter fragments exhibited high levels of activity in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 4 C). These data show that the 444-bp proximal region of the WNT7b promoter is sufficient to confer high levels of transcriptional activity in lung epithelial cells in vitro. The data from MLE-15 cell transfection experiments show that the 444-bp WNT7b promoter is capable of driving high levels of luciferase expression in lung epithelial cells in vitro. This region of the promoter lacks GATA6 and Foxa2 DNA binding sites but contains four putative TTF-1 DNA binding sites (Fig. 4 A). TTF-1 has been shown to regulate the transcription of several lung-specific genes including SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C as well as the Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein (6Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R.

Physiol. 2000; 278: L933-L945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether TTF-1 is able to bind to any or all of these four putative sites, EMSAs were performed using double stranded oligonucleotides analogous to these sites and nuclear extracts from HEK-293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing the mouse TTF-1 cDNA (Table I). In addition, a TTF-1-specific monoclonal antibody, along with non-immune antibody, was used to confirm the specificity of this binding. EMSAs of these sites show that sites T1, T2, and T3 were capable of strong binding to TTF-1 (Fig. 5, lanes 1–12). The TTF-1-specific antiserum supershifted the corresponding bands in each of these assays, whereas the non-immune sera had no effect (Fig. 5, lanes 1–16). Site T4 did bind a protein that was unique to the 293/TTF-1 extracts and comigrated with the TTF-1-specific bands in EMSAs performed with site T1-T3 oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, lanes 13–16). However, treatment of the site T4 EMSA reaction with the TTF-1 monoclonal antibody produced only a weak supershift/ablation of this band (Fig. 5,lane 16). This result suggests that TTF-1 binds only weakly to the site T4 oligonucleotide. To determine whether TTF-1 expressed in lung epithelial cells could bind to TTF-1 sites in the WNT7b promoter, MLE-15 nuclear extracts were used in EMSA. EMSAs with oligonucleotides T2 and T3 show a TTF-1-specific shift that was competed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the well characterized TTF-1 sites located in the human SP-B promoter but not by the Foxa2 binding site oligonucleotide F1 located in the mouse WNT7b promoter (Fig. 5,lanes 17–22, and Ref. 31Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Together, these data corroborate well the MLE-15 transfection data showing high levels of transcriptional activity in the proximal 444-bp WNT7b promoter region, suggesting that a significant proportion of this transcriptional activity is because of the binding of TTF-1 to sites T1–T4. The presence of two GATA6 binding sites between –871 bp and –845 bp in the 1.0-kb WNT7b promoter suggests that GATA6 may play a role in the regulation of the mouse WNT7b gene. GATA6 has been shown to regulate several lung-specific promoters including those for TTF-1 and SP-A (17Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Liu C. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,20Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether GATA6 is capable of binding to either of the GATA factor DNA binding sites in the WNT7b promoter, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from HEK-293 cells transfected with a GATA6 expression plasmid and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide that encompasses both of these sites (Table I, S1/S2). In addition, GATA6-specific polyclonal antiserum and preimmune antiserum were used to confirm the specificity of GATA6 binding (13Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, nuclear extracts from HEK-293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing the mouse GATA6 cDNA produced a band that was supershifted by GATA6-specific polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). Non-immune antiserum did not affect the shifted band (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). Of note, EMSAs using untransfected HEK-293 cells and the GATA6 wild-type oligonucleotide contain a faint background band that comigrates with the transfected GATA6 protein and is likely the result of an endogenous GATA factor expressed in these cells (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). These data show that GATA6 is able to bind to either one or both of the GATA6 DNA binding sites located in wild-type GATA6 oligonucleotide. To determine which site(s) GATA6 was able to bind in the GATA6 wild-type oligonucleotide, GATA6-containing nuclear extracts were used with radiolabeled GATA6 wild-type oligonucleotide (S1/S2) and competed with unlabeled oligonucleotides with mutations in either site 1 (mS1) or 2 (mS2) (Table I). As expected, increasing concentrations of S1/S2 oligonucleotide competed the GATA6-specific shifted band down to background levels (Fig. 6 B). Unlabeled mS1 oligonucleotide was not able to compete the GATA6-shifted band (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3–6) whereas unlabeled mS2 oligonucleotide competed the GATA6-shifted band as efficiently as the GATA6 wild-type oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B, lanes 10–12). The mS1/2 oligonucleotide, containing a mutation in both of the putative GATA6 DNA binding sites, did not compete for GATA6 binding to the wild-type oligonucleotide at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 6 B, lanes 13–15). These data show that GATA6 can bind to the S1 but not S2 site of the GATA6 DNA binding region located between –871 bp and –845 bp in the WNT7b promoter. To verify that GATA6 from lung epithelial cells could bind to the WNT7b GATA6 wild-type oligonucleotide, MLE-15 cell nuc"

https://openalex.org/W2093072827,"The formation of blood capillaries from preexisting vessels (angiogenesis) and vascular remodeling secondary to atherosclerosis or vessel injury are characterized by endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Numerous growth factors control these cell functions. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), a potent angiogenesis inducer, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and proteinase production in vitro and in vivo. However, mice genetically deficient in FGF-2 have no apparent vascular defects. We have observed that endothelial cell migration in response to mechanical damage in vitro is accompanied by activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which can be blocked by neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies. Endothelial cells from mice that are genetically deficient in FGF-2 neither migrate nor activate ERK in response to mechanical wounding. Addition of exogenous FGF-2 restores a normal cell response, which shows that impaired migration results from the genetic deficiency of this growth factor. Injury-induced ERK activation in endothelial cells occurs only at the edge of the wound. In addition, FGF-2-induced ERK activation mediates endothelial cell migration in response to wounding without a significant effect on proliferation. These data show that FGF-2 is a key regulator of endothelial cell migration during wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2095627868,"We examined the effects of chronic centrally administered leptin on the glucose metabolism of streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats, a model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. When 3 microg.rat(-1).day(-1) of leptin was infused into the third ventricle for 6 consecutive days (STZ-LEP), STZ-D rats became completely euglycemic. The effect was not seen when the same dosage was administered s.c. Centrally administered leptin did not affect peripheral insulin levels. The feeding volume of STZ-LEP rats was suppressed to the level of non-STZ-D control rats. No improvement of hyperglycemia was noted when STZ-D rats were pair-fed to match the feeding volume of STZ-LEP rats. Thus, the euglycemia of STZ-LEP rats cannot be due to the decreased feeding volume. In the STZ-D rat, glucokinase mRNA, a marker of glycolysis, is down-regulated whereas glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA, a marker of gluconeogenesis, and glucose transporter (GLUT) 2, which is implicated in the release of glucose from liver, are up-regulated. GLUT4, uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, and UCP3 were down-regulated in brown adipose tissue. These parameters returned to normal upon central infusion of leptin. GLUT4 was not down-regulated in the skeletal muscle of STZ-D rats; however, fatty acid binding protein and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, markers for utilization and beta-oxidation of fatty acids, were up-regulated and restored when the rats were treated with leptin. The increase and subsequent decrease of fatty acid utilization suggests a decrease of glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle of STZ-D rats, which was restored upon central leptin administration. We conclude that centrally infused leptin does not control serum glucose by regulating feeding volume or elevating peripheral insulin, but by regulating hepatic glucose production, peripheral glucose uptake, and energy expenditure. The present study indicates the possibility of future development of a new class of anti-diabetic agents that act centrally and independent of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2039251793,"Atherosclerotic arteries frequently become calcified, and these calcium deposits are associated with a high risk of adverse clinical events. Descriptive studies suggest calcification is an organized and regulated process with many similarities to osteogenesis, yet the mechanism and its relationship to atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. In bone development and homeostasis, mineral deposition by osteoblasts and mineral resorption by osteoclasts are delicately balanced such that there is no overall gain or loss in bone mass. We hypothesize that there exists in arteries a mechanism that similarly balances mineral deposition with resorption. We propose that the cellular mediators of arterial mineral resorption are osteoclast-like cells (OLCs) derived from hematopoietic precursors of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage. In arterial microenvironments, mononuclear precursors are induced to differentiate toward OLCs by macrophage-colony stimulating factor and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, both of which are necessary and sufficient for osteoclastogenesis and mineral resorption in bone. OLCs may participate in normal mineral homeostasis within the arterial wall or, alternatively, may be recruited to specific sites within developing plaque. Net calcium deposition occurs as a result of focal perturbation of the balance between the activity of osteoblast-like cells and OLCs. Our proposed mechanism thus views arterial mineral deposition not so much as an active pathological process, but as a localized failure of protective mechanisms that actively oppose mineral deposition within the disordered metabolic milieu of developing atherosclerotic plaque."
https://openalex.org/W1490344207,"During embryogenesis, the NG2 proteoglycan is expressed on immature capillary vessels, but as the vessels mature they lose this expression. NG2 is up-regulated in high-grade gliomas, but it is not clear to what extent it contributes to malignant progression. Using a combination of high spatial and temporal resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological analyses, we show here that overexpression of NG2 increases tumor initiation and growth rates, neovascularization, and cellular proliferation, which predisposes to a poorer survival outcome. By confocal microscopy and cDNA gene array expression profiles, we also show that NG2 tumors express lower levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1a, vascular endothelial growth factor, and endogenous angiostatin in vivo compared with wild-type tumors. Moreover, we demonstrate that NG2-positive cells bind, internalize, and coimmunoprecipitate with angiostatin. These results indicate a unique role for NG2 in regulating the transition from small, poorly vascularized tumors to large, highly vascular gliomas in situ by sequestering angiostatin."

The spin-polarized EPR signal at room temperature from PS I complexes also indicates that forward electron transfer does not occur beyond A1. In agreement, the spin-polarized X-band EPR spectrum of P700+ A1 − at low temperature shows that an electron cycle between A1 − and P700+ occurs in a much larger fraction of PS I complexes than in the wild-type, wherein a relatively large fraction of the electrons promoted are irreversibly transferred to [FA/FB]. The electron spin polarization pattern shows that the orientation of phylloquinone in the PS I complexes is identical to that of the wild type, and out-of-phase, spin-echo modulation spectroscopy shows the same P700+ to A1 − center-to-center distance in photosystem I complexes of wild type and the rubA mutant. In contrast to the loss of FX, FB, and FA, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and the non-heme iron in photosystem II are intact.

These include the primary electron donor, P700 (chlorophyll (Chl) a/a′ dimer); the primary electron acceptor, A0 (Chl a monomer); an intermediate acceptor, A1 (phylloquinone); and three iron-sulfur cofactors, FX, FA, and FB (each is a [4Fe-4S] cluster). The PsaA and PsaB proteins form a heterodimeric core that binds P700, A0, A1, and FX.

These in vitro reconstitution protocols are carried out under decidedly nonphysiological conditions, and due to the toxicity of Fe3+ and S2−, they are unlikely to resemble the process that occurs in living cells. All indications are that the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters involves enzyme-catalyzed metabolic steps (5Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific enzymes are likely to be required in various stages of iron-sulfur cluster metabolism, including cluster assembly, insertion, and stabilization. The FX cluster, as an interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster, may particularly have special requirements for its assembly and insertion due to its unique location between the PsaA and PsaB subunits and due to the unique constraint that it may need to be assembled in a partially assembled, photochemically active PS I core. In the accompanying paper (6Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it was shown that insertional inactivation of the rubA gene, that encodes a rubredoxin in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, results in the complete loss of PS I activity. Trimeric PS I complexes could be isolated from the rubA mutant, but the three extrinsic proteins, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE, of PS I were barely detectable. Although this implies that rubredoxin has a function in the assembly of PS I, it was uncertain whether the rubredoxin functions in cofactor assembly, insertion, and stabilization or in the assembly of the three extrinsic subunits. Using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, it is shown here that the FX iron-sulfur cluster is not assembled in PS I complexes from the rubA mutant. A preliminary report of some of these results was presented at the XIth International Congress on Photosynthesis in Budapest, Hungary (7Shen G. Antonkine M.L. Vassiliev I.R. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. IV. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 3147-3150Google Scholar). Conditions for the growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 wild-type and mutant strains as well as the biochemical and physiological properties of the strains employed in the studies reported here are described in detail in the accompanying paper (6Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The preparation of thylakoid membranes as well as monomeric and trimeric PS I fractions from isolated thylakoids was prepared as described in detail (6Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were prepared in buffer A (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.4 m sucrose, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl) at a concentration of 0.15 mg Chl ml−1. The oxygen evolution activities of isolated thylakoids from the ΔpsaAB and ΔpsaAB rubA mutants were 1100 μmol (mg of Chl h)−1, and 780 μmol (mg of Chl h)-1, respectively. The trimeric and monomeric PS I complexes were collected, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.03% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DM) and 15% (v/v) glycerol at a Chl concentration of 1.5–2 mg ml−1, and stored at −80 °C until required. The thylakoid membranes in buffer A at a Chl concentration of 0.15 mg ml−1 were solubilized with DM at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) from a stock solution of 20% (w/v). The solution was stirred gently on ice in the dark for 1 h. Solubilized complexes were loaded onto sucrose step gradients (40% (w/v) sucrose, 5 ml; 30% (w/v) sucrose, 5 ml; 25% (w/v) sucrose, 6 ml; 5 ml of the sample solution; the sucrose solutions were prepared with buffer A). The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW27 rotor at 26,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. The PS II complexes were identified as a green band at the interface between the 30 and 40% sucrose layers. The PS II complexes were removed and diluted with buffer B (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mmNaCl) to a sucrose concentration of ∼0.4 m. The solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g 1 h at 4 °C. The green pellet containing the PS II complexes was resuspended with buffer A 1.0 mg of Chl ml−1. The [4Fe-4S] cluster was inserted into the FX site in PS I trimers isolated from the rubA mutant according to published procedures (8Golbeck J.H. Song P.S. Horspools W. CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1407-1419Google Scholar). Briefly, the protocol relies on the ability of an inorganic [4Fe-4S] cluster to undergo a ligand exchange reaction with the cysteines on PsaA and PsaB to allow insertion of the cluster into the FX site. The inorganic iron-sulfur clusters are synthesized by adding 10 mm FeCl3 and 10 mm Na2S to a solution of 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in 25 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3. The 2-mercaptoethanol serves the added function of cleaving any potential Cys-So-So-Cys bonds that may be present in the FX site and makes free cysteine residues available for ligation to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The inorganic agents are removed by ultrafiltration or gel filtration chromatography, leaving a reconstituted P700-FX core. Transient absorbance changes at 820 nm were measured at room temperature with a laboratory-built dual beam spectrometer as described (9Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sample was contained in a 10 × 4-mm quartz cuvette positioned so that the optical path length was 10 mm. The measuring and reference beams were balanced using a variable density optical filter wheel; the difference signal was amplified with an 11A33 differential comparator and processed using a DSA 610 digital signal analyzer (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). The upper electrical bandwidth of the detection system was about 10 MHz. Transient absorbance changes in the blue region were measured with a laboratory-built, single beam spectrometer consisting of an Oriel 250-W quartz-tungsten source, two Jarrell-Ash ¼ meter monochromators (one located before and one after the sample cuvette), and a Schottky-barrier photodiode (PIN 8LC; UDT Sensors, Hawthorne, CA). The sample was contained in a 10 × 10-mm quartz cuvette. A shutter placed in the measuring beam in front of the sample was opened 10 ms before the excitation flash and closed 100 ms after the flash to minimize exposure of the sample to the measuring light. Intensity changes of the measuring light transmitted by the sample were detected by a reverse-biased silicon photodiode (PIN-10D; UDT Sensors), The detector photocurrent was converted to a voltage with a 5,000-Ohm load resistor, and the voltage was amplified (Princeton Applied Research model 113) and processed using a Nicolet 4094A digital oscilloscope. The DC offset from the measuring beam was nulled using a voltage injected into the inverting port of the digital oscilloscope. The upper electrical bandwidth of the detection system was about 100 KHz. The flash excitation for both spectrometers was provided by a frequency-doubled, Q-switched DCR-11 Nd-YAG laser. The flash energy was adjusted by changing the Q-switch delay and/or using neutral density filters. The kinetics were fitted to “sum of several exponentials with base line” using the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro (Lake Oswego, OR). Measurements were made with a laboratory-built spectrometer in the near-UV and blue spectral regions on PS I complexes from the rubA mutant, similar to Ref. 10Brettel K. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Excitation flashes of 300-ps pulse duration at 532 nm were provided with a Nd-YAG laser (Quantel, France). The measuring light source was a 100-W tungsten halogen lamp filtered by appropriate interference and colored glass filters. The sample was contained in a 4 × 10-mm quartz cuvette oriented with the longer side perpendicular to the direction of the measuring light and the shorter side perpendicular to the direction of the excitation flash. A shutter placed in the measuring light beam in front of the sample was opened 3 ms before the excitation flash and closed 10 ms after the flash to diminish exposure of the sample to the measuring light. Intensity changes of the measuring light transmitted by the sample were detected by a silicon photodiode (S3590 from Hamamatsu, Japan), The detector photocurrent was converted to a voltage with a 3,000-Ohm load resistor, and the voltage was amplified (AM502 from Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) and registered by a DSA 602A digitizing oscilloscope with plug-in 11A33 (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). The upper electric bandwidth limit of the detection system was about 200 kHz. A Marquardt least-squares algorithm program was used for fitting of the absorption change transients to a multiexponential decay. X-band (9.4-GHz) EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ECS 106 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer operating with an ER462ST resonator. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat and an ITC4 temperature controller. The microwave frequency was determined with a Hewlett-Packard 5340A frequency counter. Continuous actinic illumination of the sample was provided by a 150-W model 66057 xenon arc source (Oriel Corp., Stamford, CT), filtered through 2 cm of water, and passed through a heat-absorbing filter to remove the near-infrared wavelengths. Samples used for measurement of FA and FB in the wild-type and the rubA mutant contained 0.6 mg of Chl ml−1, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 30 μm DCPIP, 0.02% (v/v) DM, and 20% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3. For measurement of FX, the pH of the sample was adjusted to 10.0 by the addition of 1 m glycine buffer, prior to the addition of ∼1 mg of dithionite. Samples were frozen in darkness and illuminated inside the EPR cavity. For freezing under continuous illumination, a dry ice-methanol bath was used. Q-band (34 GHz) EPR studies were carried out using an ER 5106 QT-W1 resonator as described (11Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the spin-coupled [Q−Fe2+] signal in PS II was taken by subtracting the spectrum of the light-treated sample from the spectrum of a dark-frozen sample. The dark sample was prepared by adding potassium ferricyanide to a final concentration of 1 mm and duroquinone to a final concentration of 20 μm to 250 ml of PS II complexes isolated from the ΔpsaAB and ΔpsaAB rubA mutants. The sample was incubated in darkness for 20 min on ice and frozen in an EPR tube with liquid nitrogen under very dim green light. The light sample was prepared by adding 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea to a final concentration of 50 μm hydroxylamime to a final concentration of 5 mm and sodium acetate to a final concentration of 20 mm from a 4 m stock solution. The photoaccumulation protocol was carried out by illuminating the PS II complexes in an EPR tube for 10 min in an ice water bath. The sample was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and illuminated further for 5 min prior to measurement. Transient EPR spectroscopy at low temperature was carried out at X-band using a Bruker ER046 XK-T microwave bridge equipped with a dielectric resonator, at Q-band using a Bruker ER056 QMV bridge and a home-built cylindrical resonator (12Van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Setif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and at W-band using a Bruker E680 spectrometer. The temperature was controlled using an Oxford liquid helium gas-flow cryostat. For X-band experiments at room temperature, a Bruker ER041M microwave bridge modified for broadband detection was used with a rectangular resonator and a flat cell. The spin-polarized EPR data were collected in direct detection mode by accumulating the light-induced EPR transients at fixed magnetic field positions over an appropriate range. The samples were illuminated using a Nd-YAG/OPO laser system using either 623- or 532-nm excitation. At W-band, illumination was accomplished using an optical fiber fed into the sample capillary and ending directly above the PS I sample. The samples contained ∼1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μmphenazine methosulfate as external redox agents and were frozen in the dark for the low temperature experiments. Electron spin-echo (ESE) amplitude-modulation curves were obtained by collecting the amplitude of the echo detected at time T ≈ τ after the second microwave pulse as function of τ. The microwave pulse lengths were set to 8 ns for the first pulse and 16 ns for the second pulse, resulting in flip angles of about 65 and 130°, respectively, with a microwave field, B1, of 1.1 mT. The external magnetic field B0 and the detection time T were adjusted to yield maximum out-of-phase echo intensity. The echo mTmodulation was recorded at 512 points with 8-ns increments in τ, and 64 traces were averaged to increase the signal/noise ratio (see Ref. 13Bittl R. Zech S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 1429-1436Crossref Google Scholar for details). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting indicate that PsaC is missing in thylakoid membranes and trimeric PS I complexes from the rubA mutant (6Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It follows, therefore, that the FA and FB iron-sulfur clusters must also be missing. The presence or absence of FA and FBwas determined in PS I trimers isolated from the wild-type and the rubA mutant using low temperature EPR spectroscopy. The experimental protocols involved 1) freezing samples to 15 K in darkness in the presence of ascorbate and DCPIP and illumination inside the EPR cavity to promote one electron from P700 to the bound iron-sulfur clusters and 2) thawing the sample and refreezing to 15 K under continuous illumination to promote two (or more) electrons to the bound iron-sulfur clusters (4Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 107-149Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Under the one-electron reduction protocol, PS I trimers from the wild type showed g values of 2.0025 characteristic of P700+; 2.044, 1.942, and 1.855 characteristic of FA −; and 2.071, 1.931, and 1.878 characteristic of FB − (Fig. 1 top, dotted line). The FA −/FB − ratio of 3.1:1 is typical of cyanobacterial PS I trimers (2Vassiliev I.R. Antonkine M.L. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under the two-electron reduction protocol, PS I trimers isolated from the wild type showed resonances at g = 2.0025 characteristic of P700+ and at g = 2.05, 1.94, 1.92, and 1.87 characteristic of the interaction spectrum of FA −/FB − (Fig. 1 top, solid line). Under both the one-electron and two-electron reduction protocols, trimeric PS I complexes isolated from the rubA mutant showed a light-induced resonance at g = 2.0025 but no signals that could be attributed to the reduction of FA or FB (Fig. 1 bottom, dotted and solid lines). EPR measurements under the same experimental setup were performed on whole cells, thylakoid membranes, and PS I monomers from both the wild-type and rubA mutant, and the results obtained were identical to the results described above for PS I trimers (data not shown). This indicates that the loss of the FA and FB iron-sulfur clusters is not due to the loss of PsaC that might have incurred during the isolation and/or purification protocol. Thus, these findings are consistent with the previous SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting studies (6Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that showed little or no PsaC in thylakoid membranes or in PS I trimers isolated from the rubA mutant. The absence of FA and FB raises the question whether the FX iron-sulfur cluster is also missing in the rubA mutant. The experimental protocol to detect FX involves prereducing FA and FBwith sodium hydrosulfite and freezing the sample to 15 K under continuous illumination to additionally reduce FX. PS I trimers isolated from wild type showed resonances with g values of 2.15, 1.90, and 1.78 characteristic of FX − as well as g values of 2.05, 1.94, 1.92, and 1.86 characteristic of the interaction spectrum of reduced FA −/FB − (data not shown). In contrast, PS I trimers isolated from the rubA mutant contained no detectable FA, FB, or FX (data not shown). These data show that no chemically reducible FA or FB is present in the rubA mutant and that FX either cannot be reduced using light or is totally absent. The presence of the P700+ radical in the light-induced EPR study (Fig. 1 B) implies that an acceptor earlier than the iron-sulfur clusters is present and functional in the rubA mutant. To determine whether the A1 phylloquinone is present and functional, Q-band EPR photoaccumulation studies were carried out on the wild-type and the rubA mutant. Photoaccumulation of A1 − in PS I trimers from the wild type resulted in a spectrum with g values of 2.0064, 2.0034, and 2.0023 and four prominent hyperfine lines from the 2-methyl group characteristic of the phylloquinone semiquinone anion (data not shown; see Ref. 11Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar studies of PS I trimers from the rubA mutant resulted in a spectrum of photoaccumulated A1 −with a similar g anisotropy but with a less prominent contribution of the hyperfine couplings compared with the wild type (not shown). These data show that phylloquinone is present in the A1 site of the rubA mutant and that it is functional in accepting electrons from A0 −. If all three bound FeS clusters are missing in the rubA mutant, but A1 is present, then charge separation and recombination should occur between P700+ and A1 −after a single turnover flash. Fig. 2shows ΔA820 decay kinetics measured in PS I trimers isolated from the rubA mutant. Multiexponential deconvolution of the kinetic transients permits the relative contributions of different PS I acceptors to P700+reduction to be tentatively identified (9Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The kinetics of P700+ reduction in the wild type show contributions arising from components with (1/e) lifetimes (τ) of 23 and 144 ms, both of which are assigned to the back-reaction of P700+with [FA/FB]− (data not shown). A minor component with τ = 2.9 s arises from forward electron donation with reduced DCPIP in PS I trimers that have lost an electron from the bound iron-sulfur clusters. The kinetics of P700+ reduction in PS I complexes from the rubA mutant show a striking absence of components with lifetimes in the millisecond time range (Fig. 2). The major contributions arise only from components with τ = 13 and 86 μs, both of which are characteristic of charge recombination between P700+ and A1 − in PS I trimers devoid of the bound iron-sulfur clusters FX, FB, and FA(10Brettel K. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The initial amplitude of the ΔA820derived from the multiexponential fit corresponds to a Chl/P700 ratio of ∼100 and is similar to that measured in wild-type PS I complexes. The analysis of the kinetics of P700+ recombination therefore confirms the EPR evidence that electron transfer to the terminal iron-sulfur clusters, FX, FB, and FA, does not occur in the rubA mutant. Flash-induced P700+ reduction in freshly isolated thylakoid membranes of the rubA mutant revealed similar kinetics (data not shown). This indicates that the loss of components with lifetimes in the millisecond time range was not due to the loss of FX, FB, and FA in the isolation and/or purification procedure leading to the PS I trimers. If charge recombination occurs between P700+ and A1 − in the rubA mutant, then the kinetics of A1 − oxidation determined in the near-UV will match that of P700+ reduction determined at 820 nm. The kinetics of flash-induced absorbance changes at individual wavelengths between 335 and 500 nm were measured with a time resolution of about 2 μs. For example, at 380 nm, where A1 − should be the dominant contributor to absorbance changes in PS I (15Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar), 98% of the initial absorbance increase decayed biexponentially with 1/e lifetimes (τ) of 15 and 95 μs (Fig. 3 A). Global analysis of the complete data set (kinetic traces measured at 19 different wavelengths) showed that all transients could be fitted reasonably well with two major exponential phases of τ = 15 μs and τ = 95 μs, and a minor phase of τ = 2.6 ms. 2This minor phase was obtained from measurements on a longer time scale and detectable only around 430 nm. Because of the small amplitude (about 5% of the total initial absorbance change) and base-line fluctuations, 2.6 ms is only a rough estimate of the lifetime. No attempt was made to establish the origin of this small component. The amplitudes of the three phases obtained from the global analysis are shown as point-by-point spectra in Fig. 3 B. The two major components (τ = 15 and 95 μs) have very similar optical difference spectra from 335 to 500 nm. Both components display an absorbance increase from 350 to 400 nm, followed by a trough between 420 and 440 nm. The 420–440-nm trough is attributed primarily to the flash-induced P700+/P700 difference spectrum, and the absorbance increase between 350 and 400 nm is attributed primarily to the flash-induced A1 −/A1 difference spectrum (16Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fit with τ = 15 and 95 μs in the near-UV is very similar to the fit obtained from independent measurements at 820 nm (Fig. 2) and attributed solely to P700+/P700. The kinetics and spectra are also highly similar to those of a wild-type P700-A1 core stripped of the FX, FA, and FB iron-sulfur clusters (10Brettel K. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results confirm that the PS I complexes from the rubA mutant exhibit charge recombination between P700+ and A1 −, consistent with the absence of forward electron transfer to FX, FB, and FA. The cycling of electrons between P700 and A1 in the rubA mutant should be particularly evident in the electron spin-polarized transient EPR signal. In wild-type samples at room temperature, e"

This protein is evolutionarily conserved across species, including humans, although the function of each of these proteins remains unknown.

We propose that YOL002c encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that plays a key role in metabolic pathways that regulate lipid and phosphate metabolism. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to survive and grow on a wide range of media due to its ability to activate pathways that enable utilization of alternate carbon sources. This organism responds to a diverse array of signals, and many of the responses involve the regulation of gene expression. This transcriptional regulation results in a corresponding adjustment in signaling systems that are activated by the switch in carbon source supplied for growth. Thus, the ability of yeast to utilize various carbon sources is highly regulated, and the expression of genes required for the utilization of specific carbon sources has been a major topic of study for many years (1Oshima Y. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 159-180Google Scholar). Much is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms that occur when yeast is grown on glucose. Many proteins are dispensable under these conditions; therefore, the expression of genes encoding such proteins is transcriptionally repressed. These include genes required for the metabolism of carbon sources that are utilized less efficiently than glucose, such as glycerol (GUT (2Sprague G.F. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), galactose (GAL (3Adams B.G. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111: 308-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), ethanol (ADH2 (4Denis C.L. Ciriacy M. Young E.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), and fatty acids (POX1 (5Dmochowska A. Dignard D. Maleszka R. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). The expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the utilization of carbon sources other than glucose are often up-regulated in the presence of the appropriate nutrient. The shift from a glucose- to an oleate-containing medium leads to induction of a number of enzyme activities, including the peroxisomal enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway, and it also leads to peroxisome proliferation (6Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A sequence motif within the promoter region of genes encoding these proteins was demonstrated to be the binding site for protein(s), as then unidentified, responsible for oleate induction, and was termed the oleate-responseelement (ORE) 1The abbreviations used are: OREoleate-response elementORFopen reading frame (7Einerhand A.W.C.

Biochem. 1993; 314: 323-331Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). oleate-response element open reading frame In addition to fatty acid-dependent transcriptional activation of specific genes, other genes are transcriptionally repressed in response to a change in carbon source. The OLE1 gene encodes Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme involved in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids. OLE1 expression is repressed when certain unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate are added to the growth medium, but it is induced when cells are grown in the presence of a saturated fatty acid (8Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two genes,MGA2 and SPT23, were implicated in the transcription of several genes in S. cerevisiae, including OLE1. The loss of function of both MGA2 and SPT23 results in a 15-fold decrease in the level of the OLE1 transcript (10Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active Spt23p transcription factor is synthesized in the form of an inactive membrane-bound precursor, and the active form is generated by a processing step that is regulated by unsaturated fatty acids (11Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). POX1 encodes fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle. Previously, we extensively mapped the promoter region of POX1 and have demonstrated that there are at least three regulatory elements in this promoter (12Wang T.W. Lewin A.S. Small G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) subsequently identified two transcription factors, Oaf1p and Pip2p, that bind to the ORE and mediate oleate-dependent transcriptional activation. The completion of the yeast genome sequencing project in 1996 provided us with the possibility of finding additional genes that contain an ORE in their promoters. We demonstrated that more than 20 genes, encoding proteins with various subcellular locations, are regulated by the Oaf1p/Pip2p transcription factors (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to genes encoding known peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins, we found that several open reading frames (ORFs), encoding proteins of unknown location and function, are also regulated by Oaf1p and Pip2p. The gene YOL002c was among the ORFs that we found to contain an ORE (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a putative protein that is predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains. In this current study we demonstrate that the expression of YOL002c is highly induced in cells grown in the presence of a medium chain length saturated fatty acid, such as myristate. We further show that a strain in which the YOL002c gene is disrupted grows poorly in medium containing myristate as the main carbon source, and that yol002cΔ cells are resistant to the polyene antibiotic, nystatin. In addition, we found that high chain length inorganic polyphosphate accumulates to higher levels in the disruption strain when compared with the wild-type strain. Finally, we show that 32PO4 is taken up by yol002cΔ cells at a higher rate than in wild-type cells and that acid phosphatase activity is constitutively expressed in yol002cΔ cells, even in phosphate-rich medium. Phosphate is an essential nutrient for all organisms including yeast; thus a tight regulatory mechanism for acquisition, storage, and release of phosphate has evolved. When phosphate becomes limiting in the growth media, there is an increased production of a high affinity phosphate transporter and of secreted phosphatases that scavenge phosphate from the environment. The signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of phosphate-responsive genes is complex and involves over 20 genes (for review see Ref. 18Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We suggest that the YOL002c protein plays a role in this elaborate pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that cells lacking YOL002cp display multiple defects in lipid homeostasis as well as in the phosphate levels of the cell. The yeast strains used in this study are described in Table I. Yeast strains were grown in either YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose); SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose); or YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol). Liquid-rich media containing fatty acids (YPGFA) were composed of YPG supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) of the respective fatty acid and with 0.25% (v/v) Tween 40. In the case of very long chain fatty acids (C20 and longer), the Tween 40 was substituted with 0.25% Tergitol. YNCFA plates contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.3% casamino acids, 0.25% (v/v) Tween 40% or 0.25% (v/v) Tergitol, and 0.1% (w/v) of the respective fatty acid. In order to prepare low phosphate media (YPD − Pi), the method of Kaneko et al. (19Kaneko Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 g of peptone and 10 g of yeast extract were first dissolved in 800 ml of H2O, and 10 ml of 1 m MgSO4 and 10 ml of 30% ammonium hydroxide were then added. The resultant solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature to form a precipitate and was then filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper. The pH of the filtered solution was adjusted to pH 5.8 using 1 n HCl, and the volume was brought to 900 ml with H2O. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving, and 20% dextrose was added to a final concentration of 2%. To make YPD + Pi, 1 mKH2PO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. To obtain fatty acid-containing low phosphate media, low phosphate YPG was first prepared as described above, and fatty acids plus Tween 40 were then added. Auxotrophic supplements were included in the media at 20 μg/ml (40 μg/ml in the case of leucine) as needed. Nystatin, when used, was added at a concentration of 100 units/ml.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef.W3031AMATaleu2 ura3 trp1 ade2 his338Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.

The purified fragments were then subcloned into the PCR 2.1-TOPO TA vector, resulting in p002, p492, and p101.Table IIOligonucleotides used for primers in PCRsOligonucleotideDescriptionG15′ TCACCTACGGGTTAAAATCTGAC 3′G25′ TCCTCTGAGACGCTAAAGTCGTG 3′G35′ TTATCATGCAACCTTTAGGGTC 3′G45′ GCGTACCGAAAAATATAAGGAAGTC 3′G55′ GGCACATAAAAGCAAAGGC 3′G65′ GTTCTTTCAGCGGTGTATAACC 3′G75′ ATGAAGCTTTCTTCCCACAAAGGATCTGTGGTG 3′G85′ TCATCAGTACAGCCCGCCTTCTAG 3′G95′ GGGGATCCAAGAAGAGATCCTAGGATGAGT 3′G105′ GATTCTTCTCCAACATGCAGCAAGCTTCATAATTAAACGACGGG 3′G115′ GGGGATCCATTGCTATCAGCGATACTAACATTCGTG 3′ Open table in a new tab A YOL002c disruption strain was created as follows. First, p002 was digested with NdeI, blunt-ended, and dephosphorylated. A 1.7-kb fragment containing the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene was inserted into the digested plasmid, resulting in p002c::HIS3. The disruption construct was then digested with EcoRI, and the linear YOL002::HIS3 fragment was used for transformation into S. cerevisiae strain W3031A. Selected clones were screened for correct integration of the disruption cassette by PCR analysis of total DNA extracted from the transformants. The disrupted strain, named yol002cΔ, was selected for further studies. To prepare yol002cΔ strains that also carry a disruption in either YDR492w or YOL101c, we made use of a system that allows repeated use of URA3 selection in the construction of multiply disrupted genes (20Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we first digested p492 with ClaI and HincII, and p101 with BbsI and SspI. Both plasmids were then blunt-ended and dephosphorylated. The 3.8-kb BamHI /BglII fragment of pNKY274 (20Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) was blunt-ended and inserted into the digested p492 and p101, resulting in p492::hisG-URA3 and p101::hisG-URA3. Both constructs were digested with EcoRI, and the reaction mixtures were used for transformation of the released disruption cassettes into the yol002cΔ cells. URA+ transformants were screened for correct integration by Southern blot analysis of total DNA purified from individual clones. Further selection of URA− auxotrophs using 5-fluoroorotic acid was performed as described (20Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and the double disruption strains obtained were named yol002cΔydr492wΔ and yol002cΔyol101cΔ, respectively. YDR492w and YOL101c single disruption strains (ydr492wΔ and yol101cΔ, respectively) were created in the same manner as described above for double disruption strains, using W3031A as a host strain for yeast transformation. A triple disruption strain (yol002cΔydr492wΔyol101cΔ), in which YOL002c, YDR492w, and YOL101c were all disrupted, was constructed by transforming the yol002cΔydr492wΔ cells with the YOL101c disruption cassette followed by the selection procedure described above. All recombinant plasmids were created using a combination of PCR and subcloning techniques. The oligonucleotide primers are shown in Table II. In order to confirm the data obtained by Northern blot analysis for YOL002c expression, two constructs containing the lacZ sequence under the control of the YOL002c promoter were created. A pair of primers, G9 with G10, was used in a Pfu Turbo-driven PCR to amplify a fragment that contains the 1040-bp promoter region and the predicted initiation codon of YOL002c, immediately followed by a HindIII site. Following amplification, the DNA fragment was cleaved with BamHI and HindIII and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the vector YIp357 (21Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), producing YIp357-002c-ATG1. This construct failed to produce β-galactosidase activity when introduced into our wild-type strain W3031A (W002c-BG1). To create a fragment that contains the YOL002c promoter and the sequence 30 bp downstream from the predicted initiating ATG, which included a second ATG codon, also immediately followed by a HindIII site, a pair of primers, G9 with G11, was used. After amplification, the DNA fragment was subcloned into the YIp357 vector as described above, resulting in YIp357-002c-ATG2. The resultant plasmid was then introduced into our wild-type yeast strain creating strain W002c-BG2, and β-galactosidase activity was measured from these cells. The same construct was also introduced into our OAF1/PIP2 double-disruption strain (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), creating ΔO1ΔP2-BG2 (Table I). To create a construct that expresses the human gene CGI-45 under the control of the YOL002c promoter, YIp357-002c-ATG2 DNA was first digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the 1.1-kb fragment containing the promoter region and the second ATG codon of YOL002c was gel-purified. The fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRS306 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pRS306-002cp. A fragment encoding the CGI-45 sequence was amplified from a human fibroblast cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Chen, Mount Sinai Medical Center) using a pair of primers G7 with G8. The amplified product was then digested with HindIII and was subcloned into the HindIII and blunt-ended XhoI sites of pRS306-002cp. The resultant construct, designated pRS-002c-CGI-45, was used for transformation into yol002cΔ cells. Yeast strains were grown overnight on YPD, and the pre-cultures were then diluted 10-fold with fresh YPD and grown to mid-logarithmic phase. Cells collected from mid-logarithmic cultures were used to inoculate YPD, YPG, or YPGFA media to an absorbance of ≈0.1 at 600 nm and were grown to mid-logarithmic phase. For Northern blot analysis, total yeast RNA was purified according to a hot phenol extraction procedure as described (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A phenol/chloroform extraction procedure was used to isolate yeast total RNA for DNA Microarray Analysis. 2S. Sturley and L. Wilcox, personal communication.Poly(A)+ fractions were prepared from total yeast RNA using Oligotex milk as specified by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Yeast mRNA was resolved, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized as described previously (14Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast gene-specific probes were generated by PCR amplification with primers based on sequence from the yeast genome data base (Table II) and total yeast DNA. The PCR products were resolved on a standard 1% agarose gel, purified using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA), and labeled with a Prime-It RmT kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization and subsequent analyses were performed exactly as described previously (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To compare the gene expression patterns between SCY325 cells (Table I) and isogenic yol002cΔ (sΔ2) cells, the Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome S98 Arrays (YG-98) were used. Both yeast strains were grown on YPGM medium, and poly(A)+mRNA fractions were then prepared from total yeast RNA as described above. Double-stranded cDNA preparation, synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA target, hybridization, washing and staining, subsequent scanning of the hybridized array, and data processing were performed as specified in the Affymetrix Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Pre-cultures were grown at 30 °C in YPD − Pi media overnight as described (19Kaneko Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cells were collected, washed with water, and diluted 1:100 in YPD − Pi. After incubation for 6 h at 30 °C, KH2PO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Following a 2-h incubation, the cells were collected, washed with water, and resuspended in 1 ml of cold LETS buffer (0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.1m LiCl, 2% SDS). Glass beads (at approximately equal volume) and 700 μl of phenol/chloroform (saturated to pH 5.0) were added to the cells. The cells were vortexed 6 times for 10 s and were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The aqueous phase was collected and extracted twice with phenol/chloroform. The RNA, together with the polyphosphates, was precipitated in the presence of 0.2m LiCl and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Following centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. The concentration of total RNA was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Polyphosphate samples were separated in a 20% acrylamide-TBE gel (21 × 50 × 0.5 cm), using TBE buffer (90 mmTris borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA). 10 μg of total RNA, resuspended in 10 μl of sample buffer (10% sucrose, 0.05% bromphenol blue in 1× TBE), was loaded onto the gel. Following electrophoresis at 20 V/cm for 4–5 h, the gel was fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 15 min, and was then stained with toluidine O (0.5% toluidine blue O, 25% methanol, 5% glycerol, 5% acetic acid) and de-stained with several washes of 25% methanol, 5% acetic acid, 5% glycerol. In order to measure the uptake of Pi, cells were grown overnight in YPD − Pi or YPD + Pimedia. The cells were collected, washed with water, and resuspended in low phosphate synthetic complete medium (SC − Pi), or high phosphate synthetic complete medium (SC + Pi), to a final concentration of A600 = 0.1. Cells were shaken for 2 h at 30 °C, and then 1 μCi/ml32PO4 in KH2PO4 was added to give a final Pi concentration of 0.1 mm in the assay reaction. Samples were withdrawn at different time points and were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm). The filters were washed with 10 ml of SC − Pi medium and were then dried, and the radioactivity collected on each filter was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS1801). In order to measure the acid phosphatase activity, cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD − Pi or YPD + Pi media. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Glass beads (at approximately equal volume) were added, and the tubes were vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was recovered for phosphatase activity and protein assays. Acid phosphatase was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as a substrate, and the assay was performed using a citrate buffer (90 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 4.5). The absorbance at 405 nm was then measured, and the activity was calculated as described (19Kaneko Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activity was expressed as micromoles of p-nitrophenol liberated by 1 mg of protein in 1 ml of reaction mix. We demonstrated previously that YOL002c is expressed at high levels in glucose-grown cells, whereas the expression is low in cells grown in the presence of oleate (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression in each of these media is reduced in a strain in which the Oaf1p/Pip2p transcription factors are deleted (17Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the majority of genes that are regulated under the control of Oaf1p and Pip2p are induced in cells grown in the presence of oleate, this result was unexpected. Therefore, we proceeded to examine the expression of YOL002c in cells grown in additional unsaturated or saturated fatty acids. The levels of YOL002c were determined by Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from wild-type and oaf1Δpip2Δ cells grown in glucose, glycerol, or glycerol plus the following fatty acids: C18:1 (oleate), C18:2, C6:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0. Our results demonstrated that YOL002c is highly induced when cells are grown in the presence of C14:0 (myristate) and that this level of expression is dependent on the Oaf1p/Pip2p transcription factors (Fig. 1). In order to confirm the expression of YOL002c in the presence of different fatty acids, we studied the transcription using a YOL002c-lacZ reporter construct. The first construct that we prepared, based on the ORF provided by the yeast genome data base, failed to produce any β-galactosidase activity. However, when we prepared an alternative construct in which we fused the second ATG, which is 30 nucleotides downstream from the predicted initiating ATG, with the lacZ gene (Fig. 2a), we measured a high level of β-galactosidase activity in extracts from cells grown in the presence of myristate (Fig. 2b). Thus, the correct initiating ATG is downstream from that given in the yeast genome data base, and the YOL002c protein is 10 amino acids shorter than predicted. The protein contains 317 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 36.3 kDa. The β-galactosidase activity in extracts from wild-type cells was ∼5-fold higher from cells grown in the presence of myristate when compared with glycerol-grown cells (Fig. 2b, left panel). Furthermore, we found that this activity was ∼50-fold lower in extracts from cells in which the Oaf1p/Pip2p transcription factors were deleted (Fig. 2b, right panel). These results support the data obtained by Northern analysis and provide additional evidence that transcription of YOL002c is increased in cells grown in the presence of myristate and that this regulation is dependent on Oaf1p and Pip2p. The YOL002c gene is predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains using the Dense Alignment Surface program (39Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a search for proteins that share homology to YOL002c, we found that there are two ORFs in the S. cerevisiae data base, YDR492w and YOL101c, that encode proteins homologous to this protein especially in the membrane-spanning regions (Fig. 3A). This finding caused us to examine closely the promoter regions of these two genes, and we found that they contain ORE-like sequences at positions −302 to −328 (YDR492w) and −240 to −263 (YOL101c) upstream from their respective initiation codons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both of these genes are transcriptionally induced by saturated fatty acids. YDR492w shows highest expression in cells grown in the presence of C18:0, whereas YOL101c is highly expressed in both C18:0 and C20:0. Expression of both of these genes is reduced in the oaf1Δpip2Δ strain (Fig. 3B). Through an extended search for proteins homologous to YOL002c, we found genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and humans (CGI-45), each of which encode proteins that show a striking homology to this ORF (for example, YOL002cp and the human protein CGI-45 share 29% identity) (Fig. 4). Thus far, the function of each of these proteins remains unknown. However, the fact that the proteins are conserved from yeast to man suggests that the encoded proteins have an important role. In an attempt to gain insight into the function of the YOL002c protein, we prepared a strain in which the gene encoding this protein was disrupted (see “Materials and Methods”). Yol002cΔ cells appeared to grow at normal rates in YPD medium; however, they grow poorly on plates provided with myristate as the sole carbon source (data not shown). The disruption strain also grows poorly on non-fermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol or lactate (data not shown). We further found that the YOL002c deletion strain exhibits resistance to the polyene antibiotic, nystatin (data not shown). Nystatin forms a complex with sterols in the cell membrane of sensitive organisms, resulting in leakage of essential cellular metabolites (23Marini F. Arnow P. Lampen J.O. J. Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2080368249,"The phosphorylation state of Ser183 in the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 determines the binding affinity of the cytoplasmic tail to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the capacity of the tail to multimerize, and its ability to activate protein kinase C (PKC) α. We sought to identify the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation and to determine its downstream effects on PKCα activity and on endothelial cell function. Among several PKC isoenzymes tested, only PKCα and -δ were able to specifically phosphorylate Ser183 in vitro. However, studies in cultured endothelial cells showed that the phosphorylation level of syndecan-4 was significantly reduced in endothelial cells expressing a dominant negative (DN) PKCδ but not a DN PKCα mutant. Syndecan-4/PIP2-dependent PKCα activity was significantly increased in PKCδ DN cells, while PKCδ overexpression was accompanied by decreased PKCα activity. PKCδ-overexpressing cells exhibited a significantly lower proliferation rate and an impaired tube formation in response to FGF2, which were mirrored by similar observations in PKCα DN endothelial cells. These findings suggest that PKCδ is the kinase responsible for syndecan-4 phosphorylation, which, in turn, attenuates the cellular response to FGF2 by reducing PKCα activity. The reduced PKCα activity then leads to impaired endothelial cell function. We conclude that PKCδ regulates PKCα activity in a syndecan-4-dependent manner.

While sharing the ability of other syndecans to interact with heparin-binding proteins including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors, and numerous other partners, syndecan-4 has been specifically implicated in FGF2 signaling (9Volk R.

Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser183is carried out by a novel PKC (13Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This chain of events, therefore, raises the possibility that one PKC isoform controls the activity of another isoform via the regulation of syndecan-4 phosphorylation. The present study was designed to explore that possibility. We found that PKCδ is the PKC isoform responsible for syndecan-4 phosphorylation and that alterations in PKCδ activity result in biologically meaningful alterations in PKCα function. PIP2, phosphatidylserine, and diolein were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant PKCs were synthesized and prepared as described previously (14Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C.

Bernard Weinstein (Colombia University). These expression plasmids were generated by replacing the conserved lysine in the ATP binding domain with arginine. PKCδ cDNA containing a c-Myc tag sequence was subcloned into pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) between Hin dIII and XbaI sites. Dominant negative PKCδ constructs were created by in vitro mutagenesis replacing the conserved lysine in the ATP binding domain in position 376 with tryptophan. These constructs were stably transfected into RFPECs using LipofectAMINE Plus and the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Following neomycin (Geneticin, Invitrogen) selection, a number of clones were isolated and expanded. Expression of constructs was verified by Western blotting. At least two different clones were used for each construct-related experiment. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4), separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore).

The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 μmphosphatidylserine, 10 μm diolein, and 0.2 mmCaCl2 (for PKCα assay), 0.5 mm EGTA (for PKCδ, -ε, -η, -θ, and -ζ assays), and PKCβ1 optimal peptide substrate (100 μm) (for PKCα, -δ, -ε, -θ, and -ζ assays), PKCε peptide substrate (100 μm) (Calbiochem) (for PKCη assay), or syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail peptide (50 μm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl. In syndecan-4-associated PKCα assays, the reaction mixture was supplemented with either 50 μm PIP2 with 0.5 mm EGTA or 20 μm phosphatidylserine and 10 μm diolein with 0.2 mm CaCl2 as above. Reactions were started by addition of PKC or addition of reaction mixture to the immunoprecipitates and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by spotting onto P81 phosphocellulose paper or by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Confluent RFPECs were incubated for 24 h in methionine-, sulfate-, and phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium prepared from the MEM SELECT-AMINE kit (Invitrogen) with 1% bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) and radiolabeled for 2 h with 2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (EasyTag Express, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Syndecan-4 was immunoprecipitated and gel-resolved, and the ratio between its 32P and35S incorporation was measured by scintillation counting as described previously (13Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 2,000 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight in 10% FBS, M199 medium. After that cells were starved with 0.5% FBS for 24 h and then treated with 0, 5, or 25 ng/ml FGF2. For measurement of proliferation, 20 μl of CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader both before FGF2 application and 72 h later. Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) plates were prepared by adding 0.5 ml of thawed Matrigel to a 12-well tissue culture plate. The gel was allowed to solidify for 1 h at 37 °C. 100,000 cells were plated in each well with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 in 0.5% FBS. Cells were imaged after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Analysis of Matrigel results was carried out as described previously (9Volk R. Schwartz J.J., Li, J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To define the PKC isoform responsible for phosphorylation of Ser183 in the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain, we assayed the ability of all PKC isoforms expressed in RFPECs to phosphorylate Ser183 in vitro. To determine the PKC isozyme preferentially phosphorylating Ser183 over other potentially phosphorylatable residues in the syndecan-4 tail, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain with Ser183 replaced by Ala (SA peptide). While all PKC isoforms phosphorylated both the wild type and mutant peptides with similar efficiencies, only PKCα and PKCδ preferentially phosphorylated the Ser183 site (i.e. preferential phosphorylation of the wild type peptide compared with the SA peptide, Fig. 1 A). Since our previously published PKC inhibitor studies (13Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) strongly argue against PKCα as a biologically relevant PKC isoform phosphorylating syndecan-4, we compared the extent of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation in growth-arrested wild type RFPECs and in an RFPEC-derived cell line stably expressing dominant negative PKCδ, -ε, or -α constructs (Fig. 1 B). While PKCδ dominant negative expression resulted in a 2.5-fold reduction in the stoichiometry of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation, the expression of another non-calcium-dependent PKC (PKCε) or calcium-dependent PKCα had no effect on syndecan-4 phosphorylation stoichiometry. At the same time, overexpression of PKCδ increased the extent of Ser183 site phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Taken together with previously published observations (13Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), these results identify PKCδ as the PKC isoenzyme responsible for syndecan-4 phosphorylation. Since syndecan-4 phosphorylation affects its ability to activate PKCα in a PIP2-dependent manner, we reasoned that PKCδ may inhibit PKCα activity by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4. To examine the role of PKCδ in syndecan-4-dependent regulation of PKCα activity, we studied RFPEC-derived cell lines expressing PKCδ and PKCα dominant negative constructs as well as a wild type PKCδ construct. Since expression of dominant negative isoform-specific PKC constructs can potentially influence activities of PKCs other then the intended target (17Garcia-Paramio P. Cabrerizo Y. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we assayed the activity of all PKC isoforms present in RFPECs expressing PKCδ or PKCα dominant negative constructs. In both cases the dominant negative construct expression resulted in a significant inhibition of the intended target (Fig. 2 A) while not affecting activities of other present PKCs (Fig. 2 B). At the same time, overexpression of PKCδ resulted in a significant increase in PKCδ activity in cells (Fig. 2 C). Since the extent of syndecan-4 phosphorylation can affect PKCα activity, we measured Ca2+- and PIP2-activated PKCα activity in wild type RFPECs and in clones expressing wild type or dominant negative PKCδ. While the expression of both constructs had no effect on Ca2+-activated activity, overexpression of PKCδ significantly decreased syndecan-4/PIP2-activated PKCα activity, while expression of PKCδ dominant negative significantly increased syndecan-4/PIP2-activated PKCα activity (Fig. 3). To study whether these changes in PIP2-activated PKCα activity translate into functionally relevant changes in cell behavior, we measured the ability of FGF2 to induce proliferation of wild type RFPECs or RFPECs expressing either PKCα and PKCδ dominant negative constructs or unmodified PKCδ. In accord with previously published results (18Kent K.C. Mii S. Harrington E.O. Chang J.D. Mallette S. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), expression of the PKCα dominant negative construct significantly inhibited cell growth. PKCδ-overexpressing cells also had a significantly lower proliferation rate compared with vector-transfected RFPECs (Fig. 4 A). In fact, the proliferation rate of PKCδ overexpressors was close to that of cells expressing the PKCα dominant negative construct. At the same time, cells expressing the PKCδ dominant negative construct demonstrated enhanced proliferation compared with vector-transfected cells. One interesting finding was a high rate of growth of cells expressing the PKCδ dominant negative construct even in the absence of FGF2 presumably because FGF2-activated syndecan-4 phosphatase, in the absence of syndecan-4 phosphorylation, was no longer needed to activate PKCα (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained in an in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay with PKCδ overexpressors and cells expressing the PKCα dominant negative construct demonstrating reduced vascular structure formation compared with vector-transfected RFPECs (Fig. 4 B). To further link the effect of PKCδ on PKCα activity to changes in syndecan-4 Ser183 site phosphorylation, we determined the stoichiometry of this site in RFPEC-derived cell lines expressing the PKCδ construct. As expected, PKCδ overexpression increased base-line syndecan-4 phosphorylation (0.28 ± 0.05 versus 0.19 ± 0.03 mol of phosphate/mol of protein,p < 0.05; PKCδ overexpressor versus wild type syndecan-4). At the same time, FGF2 treatment had no appreciable effect on syndecan-4 phosphorylation in PKCδ-overexpressing cells (without FGF2, 0.28 ± 0.05, and with FGF2, 0.27 ± 0.06 mol of phosphate/mol of protein). The results of this study show that PKCδ is the kinase responsible for syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation and that PKCδ regulates PKCα activity via this mechanism. Several observations support these conclusions. The conclusion that PKCδ is the PKC isoenzyme responsible for Ser183 phosphorylation in the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain is supported by its ability to preferential phosphorylate the Ser183 site in vitro. While PKCα also preferentially phosphorylated this site in vitro, only PKCδ had this activity in vivo as demonstrated by a decrease in the extent of Ser183phosphorylation in vivo in cells expressing a PKCδ DN construct and an increase in cells overexpressing PKCδ. At the same time, expression of the PKCα dominant negative construct had no effect on syndecan-4 phosphorylation in vivo. It is not clear why the PKCα effect on syndecan-4 phosphorylation is different in in vitro versus in vivo settings. PKCα does not directly interact with syndecan-4 but rather binds to the syndecan-4-PIP2 complex (6Horowitz A. Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that when such a complex is formed, as would be the case in vivo, the 183Ser site is no longer accessible to PKCα. The modulation of the extent of syndecan-4 phosphorylation, achieved by expression of either PKCδ or PKCδ dominant negative constructs, affected its ability to activate PKCα in the PIP2-dependent manner. Interestingly the Ca2+-dependent PKCα activity in cells expressing the wild type PKCδ or the PKCδ dominant negative construct was not affected. These alterations in PKCδ or its dominant negative construct expression (and corresponding changes in syndecan-4 Ser183 phosphorylation) resulted in significant changes in cellular function as demonstrated by the proliferation and the in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assays. The changes in endothelial cell function induced by PKCδ overexpression in these experiments, inhibition of endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis, are consistent with prior publications including growth inhibition in smooth muscle cells (19Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (20Mischak H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20805-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the similarity of the functional effects between PKCα overexpression and the expression of a PKCδ dominant negative construct, accompanied by increased PKCα activity, is in agreement with the previously reported positive effects of PKCα and inhibitory effects of PKCδ on endothelial cell migration (21Harrington E.O. Loffler J. Nelson P.R. Kent K.C. Simons M. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7390-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that vascular endothelial growth factor-induced increase in endothelial cell migration and proliferation is accompanied by a decrease in PKCδ activity (23Shizukuda Y. Tang S. Yokota R. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The indirect modulation of the activity of one PKC isoform by another by means of regulation of the syndecan-4 phosphorylation state represents a novel mechanism of modulation of PKC activity. It is also interesting to note that changes in PIP2- but not Ca2+-dependent PKCα activation correlated with changes in cell function, suggesting that syndecan-4/PIP2-dependent regulation of PKCα activity reflects its physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W2130080004,"Although Gβγ is thought to mediate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in response to G protein-coupled receptor stimulation, the mechanisms involved in this pathway have not been clearly defined. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been proposed as an early intermediate in this process, but its role has remained elusive. We have observed that dominant negative mutants of p110β, but not of p110γ, inhibited MAPK stimulation in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The role of p110β was located upstream from Ras. To determine which of the lipid or protein kinase activities of p110β were important for Ras activation, we produced a mutant p110β lacking the lipid but not the protein kinase activity. This protein displayed a dominant negative activity similar to a kinase-dead mutant, indicating that p110β lipid kinase activity was essentially involved in Ras activation. In agreement, overexpression of the lipid phosphatase PTEN was found to specifically inhibit Ras stimulation induced by LPA. In addition, we have observed that the PH domain-containing adapter protein Gab1, which is involved in p110β activation during LPA stimulation, is also implicated in this pathway downstream of p110β. Indeed, both membrane redistribution and phosphorylation of Gab1 were reduced in the presence of PI3K inhibitors or dominant negative p110β. Downstream of Gab1, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 was found to mediate Ras activation in response to LPA and to be recruited through PI3K and Gab1, because transfection of Gab1 mutant deficient for SHP2 binding inhibited Ras activation without interfering with PI3K activation. We conclude that LPA-induced Ras activation is mediated by a p110β/Gab1/SHP2 pathway. Moreover, we present data indicating that p110β is effectively the target of βγ in this pathway, suggesting that the p110β/Gab1/SHP2 pathway provides a novel link between βγ and Ras by integrating two early events of LPA signaling, i.e. Gβγ release and tyrosine kinase receptor transactivation.

LPA is produced by activated cells, notably platelets, and promotes the proliferation or survival of a large number of cell types, similarly to a canonical growth factor. It is now well accepted that the biological activity of LPA is mediated by at least three different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), namely LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 (Edg 2, 4 and 7, respectively) which belong to a recently described family of receptors to bioactive lysophospholipids. These receptors can activate in concert the Gq, Gi and G12/13subfamilies of G proteins, even though the coupling specificity between each receptor and the different G proteins remains to be clearly established (6Chun J.

A number of studies have started to delineate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the biological activity of LPA. This lipid was first found to activate the so-called Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, which controls cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in response to numerous extracellular stimuli (see Refs. 1Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Nevertheless, the early mechanisms involved in MAPK activation in response to LPA are still incompletely defined. LPA can potentially activate this pathway through Gq-dependent Ca2+ mobilization leading to stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) that in turn can activate Raf or MEK (MAP kinase/ERK kinase) (10Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). However, pertussis toxin that inactivates Gi was found to inhibit MAPK stimulation induced by LPA or other Gi-coupled receptor agonists (9Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the role of Gi was located upstream from Ras, and the involvement of βγ subunits has been well documented (11vanBiesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E.

Since Ras is classically activated downstream of tyrosine kinases, various candidates, including Src, Pyk2 and growth factor receptors were shown to mediate MAPK activation in response to GPCR stimulation (14Lev S.

However, there is little evidence for a participation of βγ in the activation of these tyrosine kinases, and, in the case of Pyk2 or EGF receptor (EGFR), their recruitment has been shown to occur through Gq-dependent pathways (14Lev S.

Nevertheless, it has been proposed that βγ could participate in Src activation, leading to EGFR phosphorylation and MAPK stimulation (20Luttrell L.M. Dellarocca G.J. Vanbiesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins might be intermediates between βγ and Src (21Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), or even actors of the MAPK pathway (22Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W.

A. 2000; 98: 2449-2454Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar), but these models have been essentially described in cells overexpressing adrenergic receptors and their relevance to LPA signaling remains to be established. Besides tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been shown to be an early intermediate of MAPK activation in response to LPA (9Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. Vanbiesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). PI3K phosphorylates the 3′ position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides to produce lipids that are now considered as crucial spatio-temporal organizers of various signaling pathways. From a molecular point of view, three classes of PI3Ks have been defined, and mitogen signaling involves essentially class I enzymes that are subdivided into two subclasses (A and B) (24Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Class IAPI3Ks include the catalytic subunits p110α, β, and δ associated with a p85 regulatory subunit and activated by phosphotyrosine-containing motifs encountered on receptors or adapter proteins. In the case of p110β, G protein βγ subunits were shown to dramatically increase its activation by phosphotyrosine motifs, even though the molecular determinants of this synergism have to be further defined (26Kurosu H.

Class IB is represented by the catalytic subunit p110γ that has the unique feature to be directly activated by G protein βγ subunits. p110γ can be associated with a p101 regulatory subunit that has no homology with any known protein but contributes to the sensitivity of p110γ to Gβγ (28Stoyanov B.

From a mechanistic point of view, processes by which PI3Ks activate signaling pathways have been recently unraveled. Their lipid products interact with a number of signaling proteins, resulting in their membrane targeting and/or modulation of their enzyme activity. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) binds to a conserved protein motif called the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, thereby inducing the activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and its upstream activators, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (30Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 31Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that PI3K might participate in the MAPK pathway has emerged when blockade of PI3K was found to interfere with MAPK activation in response to LPA (9Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. Vanbiesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Further studies have suggested that p110γ was a strong candidate to mediate this effect (32Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 33Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M.

Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and to date it is commonly accepted that p110γ can link GPCR stimulation to MAPK activation (13Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this connection has been incompletely characterized. Although it has been initially reported that p110γ linked Gβγ to MAPK activation through an Shc-Grb2-Sos-Ras pathway (32Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), the putative tyrosine kinase activated downstream of p110γ remains to be identified. In addition, in a particular CHO cell line displaying a deficient activation of Ras, Takeda et al. (33Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have observed that LPA can activate MAPK at the level of MEK through a pathway involving p110γ upstream of PKCζ. PKCζ can be stimulated directly by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (35Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Scaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Legood J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). However this model has been challenged by the demonstration that the protein kinase activity of p110γ, but not its lipid kinase activity, was important for MAPK activation (34Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Indeed, PI3K catalytic subunits have an intrinsic protein kinase activity that was thought to simply regulate their lipid kinase activity (37Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 38Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but, at least in the case of p110γ, the protein kinase activity was shown to be critical for MAPK activation by promoting MEK phosphorylation (34Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the protein substrate of p110γ remains to be identified. Further studies are certainly required to complete these different models and define their physiological relevance, but the fact that p110γ seems essentially expressed in blood cells suggests that its role between Gβγ and MAPK might be that of a tissue-specific function. We and others have previously reported (39Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Laffargue M. Raynal P. Yart A. Peres C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that LPA can activate p110β in different non-hematopoietic cell lines. The mechanism is thought to implicate cooperation between βγ and a transactivation pathway involving the EGFR and the adapter protein Gab1 that provides the consensus phosphotyrosine motifs. Activation of p110β is essential for cell cycle progression of NIH-3T3 cells stimulated with LPA (39Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that this PI3K was an important actor of the signaling pathways involved in the mitogenic activity of LPA. We have thus searched for a role of p110β in the MAPK pathway in a non-transformed cell line stimulated through endogenous LPA receptors. By using a strategy based on the transfection of dominant negative mutants, p110β was found to contribute to MAPK activation upstream from Ras. In addition, the lipid kinase activity of p110β was found to be essential, pointing out a key element of Ras activation that involves sequentially PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the PH domain-containing adapter Gab1, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Moreover, we present data indicating that this pathway provides a novel connection between βγ and Ras. LPA, pertussis toxin, and wortmannin were from Sigma Chemical Co. LY294002 and AG1478 were from BIOMOL. Ro-31-8220 was from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-phosphoErk and anti-GST antibodies were from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against ERK2, Grb2, SHP2, and EGFR and monoclonal anti-myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody against Gab1 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal antibody against phosphoAkt/PKB (Ser-473) was from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal anti-pan Ras was from Oncogene Research. Monoclonal anti-His tag antibody was from Invitrogen, anti-HA tag was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and anti-T7 tag was from Novagen. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. A construct encoding C-terminal Myc/His-tagged ERK1 was obtained by subcloning ERK1 (kindly provided by Dr. E. vanObberghen, Nice, France) into pcDNA3.1-MycHis (Invitrogen). The pRK5 plasmid encoding wild type HA-tagged p110β was kindly provided by Drs. P. Hu and J. Schlessinger (New York University) (44Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The kinase-inactive K805R mutant of p110β was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primer: 5′-GTTGGAGTGATTTTTAGAAATGGTGATGATTTACG-3′ (the changed nucleotide is underlined). p110β “protein kinase only” mutant was obtained by deleting amino acids 946 to 955 using the following mutagenic primer: 5′-ATTCTTGGAAATTTCGTGCCTTTTATTCTT-3′. The mutations were verified by sequencing, and the integrity of the encoded proteins was controlled by immunoblotting and kinase assays following expression in COS cells. A construct encoding full-length p110β in antisense orientation was obtained by excising p110β from the pRK5 construct using EcoRI and HindIII. The insert was then subcloned through the same sites into pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France), and the construction was verified by restriction mapping.

Pellets were then processed for in vitrokinase assays or resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and semi-quantified using a Bio-Rad gel analysis device and the software IMAGE (National Institutes of Health). For immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates, cells were directly scrapped off in electrophoresis sample buffer, then boiled and processed for immunoblotting. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid encoding ERK1-His and the indicated effector protein. After stimulation, cells were harvested in lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mm NaCl. Soluble material was incubated with 30 μl of ProBond resin (Invitrogen) during 2 h at 4 °C then washed three times with lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mmimidazole. The pellets were then resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer and processed for anti-phosphoERK and anti-His immunoblotting. Vero cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of DNA encoding HA-tagged Akt/PKB and 1.5 μg of plasmid encoding the indicated dominant negative protein. In the case of Δp85, only 1 μg was used to avoid nonspecific effects, supplemented with 0.5 μg of empty vector. After stimulation, cells were scrapped off in lysis buffer then subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol.

To measure Ras activation in stimulated cells, Vero cells were scrapped off in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin. Cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 30 μg of GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer then boiled, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-pan Ras antibodies. To study Ras activation in transfected cells, the cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild type Ras (kindly provided by Dr. B. M.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed once in lysis buffer then dissolved in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The insoluble material was spun out, and the supernatant was taken as the solubilized membrane fraction. This study was performed essentially as described (42Motohashi K. Shibata S. Ozaki Y.

In this report, we demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the liver had symptoms of liver dysfunction such as high levels of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bile acids. In addition, these mice had physiological responses consistent with hypoglycemia including a low insulin:glucagon ratio in the serum and reduced adipose tissue mass. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that ATF3 bound to the ATF/cAMP-responsvie element site derived from the promoter of the gene encoding the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Furthermore, transient transfection assays indicated that ATF3 repressed the activity of the PEPCK promoter. Taken together, our results are consistent with the model that the expression of ATF3 in the liver results in defects in glucose homeostasis by repressing gluconeogenesis. Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene, these mice may provide a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of some stress-associated liver diseases.

Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene, these mice may provide a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of some stress-associated liver diseases. The liver is a critical organ for homeostasis. Two metabolic processes in the liver, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, help to maintain glucose homeostasis (1Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B.

In newborns, to adjust to the discontinued supply of glucose by maternal blood, glycogenolysis is turned on to degrade glycogen to glucose, and gluconeogenesis is turned on to synthesize glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. In adults, these two metabolic processes also function to maintain the glucose homeostasis of the body. During the fasting state, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are stimulated to produce glucose, whereas during the fed state these processes are inhibited. The main regulator of these processes is the ratio of two hormones secreted by the endocrine pancreas, insulin and glucagon. When the blood glucose level is low, the insulin:glucagon ratio is low, resulting in the activation of the intracellular cAMP signaling pathway that in turn stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, when the blood glucose level is high, the insulin:glucagon ratio is high and these metabolic processes are repressed. In addition to maintaining glucose homeostasis, the liver plays an important role in the other functions including (a) metabolism of xenobiotic toxins and endogenous substances such as heme, steroids, and biogenic amines, (b) synthesis of plasma proteins such as albumin and clotting factors, and (c) carrying out the acute phase responses upon inflammation, infection, or trauma (6Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). Because of its metabolic functions, the liver is the primary target for a variety of stress signals such as carcinogens and toxins. Therefore, to understand many liver diseases, it is important to understand the effects of stress signals on the liver. We have been investigating a stress-inducible gene, activating transcriptionfactor 3 (ATF3). 1The abbreviations used are: ATF3activating transcription factor 3CREcAMP-responsive elementCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinaseTTRtransthyretinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineTxgtransgenicNon-Txgnon-transgenicPpostnatal day ATF3, the corresponding protein product of this gene, is a member of the ATF/CREB family of basic region leucine zipper transcription factors (for reviews see Refs. 7Hai T.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), homologous cDNAs from rats and mice with ∼95% identity to ATF3 at the amino acid level have been identified as liver-regenerating factor-1 in the rat (12Hsu J.-C.

For the convenience of discussion, we use the ATF3 nomenclature in the rest of this report. activating transcription factor 3 cAMP-responsive element cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase transthyretin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase phosphate-buffered saline transgenic non-transgenic postnatal day Overwhelming evidence from many laboratories indicates that ATF3 is induced by a variety of stress signals in the liver (for review see Ref. 16Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). By in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that the mRNA level of ATF3 greatly increases in the liver after exposing the animals to chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, alcohol, acetaminophen, and cycloheximide (16Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar,17Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that ATF3 is induced in the liver by hepatic ischemia (18Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and partial hepatectomy (12Hsu J.-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, ATF3 is induced in cultured hepatocytes by cycloheximide, endothelial growth factor, and human growth factor (19Weir E. Chen Q. DeFrances M.C. Bell A. Taub R. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Importantly, ATF3 is also induced in many other tissues by stress signals (for reviews see Refs. 7Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar and 16Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar) such as the heart by ischemia coupled with reperfusion (ischemia reperfusion) (17Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the peripheral nerves by axotomy (20Tsujino H. Kondo E. Fukuoka T. Dai Y. Tokunaga A. Miki K. Yonenobu K. Ochi T. Noguchi K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and the pancreas by partial pancreatectomy, ischemia reperfusion, and streptozotocin treatment (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATF3 is induced in many tissues by a variety of stress signals, suggesting that it is a key regulator in cellular stress responses. Although the induction of ATF3 by stress signals is neither tissue-specific nor stimulus-specific, one common theme of all the signals that induce ATF3 is that they induce cellular damage (for reviews see Refs. 7Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar and 16Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). This correlation raises an important question. Is the induction of ATF3 a protective response for the cells to cope with stress or a part of the cellular response that leads to detrimental outcomes? To address this question, we took a gain-of-function approach and generated transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in selective tissues. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that the expression of ATF3 leads to detrimental outcomes. Transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the heart under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter exhibit conduction abnormality and contractile dysfunction (22Okamoto Y. Chaves A. Chen J. Kelley R. Jones K. Weed H.G. Gardner K.L. Gangi L. Yamaguchi M. Klomkleaw W. Nakayama T. Hamlin R.L. Carnes C.A. Altschuld R.A. Bauer J.A. Hai T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing ATF3 under the control of the transthyretin (TTR) promoter, a promoter that is predominantly active in the liver but could also be active in the pancreas (23Jacobsson B. Collins V.P. Grimelius L. Pettersson T. Sandstedt B. Carlstrom A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), have defects in glucose homeostasis and reduced expression of the gene encoding the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the rest of this report, we refer to these mice as the TTR-ATF3 mice. As described previously (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and under “Experimental Procedures,” the TTR-ATF3 transgenic founders did not express detectable levels of the ATF3 transgene, presumably due to mosaicism or silencing of the transgene. However, they could pass on the transgene to their progeny, and the F1 mice expressed the ATF3 transgene. These mice had growth retardation and died within hours after birth (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The analyses of phenotypes were facilitated by the generation of “F1 hybrid” between the transgenic founders (FVB/N mice) and wild type BALB/c mice. The F1 hybrid had the advantage of hybrid vigor and survived longer (for up to 7 days). Consistent with the observations that the TTR promoter is predominantly active in the liver (24Yan C. Costa R.H. Darnell J.E. Chen J.D. Van Dyke T.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Wu H. Wade M. Krall L. Grisham J. Xiong Y. Van Dyke T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), F1 transgenic mice derived from all 24 founders expressed the ATF3 transgene in the liver (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, F1 mice derived from some founders also expressed the transgene in the pancreas, presumably due to the differences in the integration sites and/or copy numbers of the transgene. Previously, we described that the expression of ATF3 in the pancreatic ductal epithelium impairs endocrine pancreas development (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the hepatic phenotypes of these mice. Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene and because expression of ATF3 leads to detrimental outcomes in other tissues (heart and pancreas as described above), we hypothesized that transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the liver have hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, because ATF3 is a transcriptional repressor and because the PEPCK promoter contains an ATF/CRE site, we hypothesized that ATF3 represses the PEPCK promoter, providing a mechanistic explanation for the reduced expression of PEPCK gene in the TTR-ATF3 transgenic mice. Below we present evidence supporting these hypotheses. The generation of these mice was described previously (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The human ATF3 open reading frame was cloned into the pTTRexV3 vector to make the transgene, and the transgenic mice were generated in the FVB/N background. The transgenic founders did not express the transgene, presumably because of mosaicism or silencing of the transgene but could pass on the transgene to their progeny. The F1 mice expressed the gene and died within hours after birth. Because of this perinatal lethality, it was not possible to establish transgenic lines. Repeated injections were carried out to generate 24 founders and thus sufficient F1 mice for analysis. To facilitate the analyses of F1 mice, we crossed FVB/N transgenic founders with BALB/c non-transgenic mice to generate F1 hybrid mice. These F1 mice had the advantage of hybrid vigor and survived longer. Most of them survived for 4 days, and some survived for up to 7 days. Because the F1 hybrid mice are genetically uniform except at the locus of the transgene, a comparison of the transgenic mice with the non-transgenic littermates allowed the assessments of phenotypes attributed to ATF3 expression. As described previously (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), F1 hybrids derived from all 24 founders expressed ATF3 transgene in the liver, but F1 hybrids derived from some founders also expressed ATF3 in the pancreas. The pancreatic phenotypes were described previously (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the hepatic phenotypes. To avoid hepatic phenotypes resulting from indirect effects of pancreatic expression of ATF3 (see “Discussion”), we only describe the phenotypes observed in mice with hepatic but not pancreatic expression of ATF3. Because not all founders gave rise to progeny efficiently, detailed analyses were limited to a subset of founders. The phenotypes described in this report were observed in F1 hybrid mice derived from >8 founders. This reproducibility strongly suggests that these phenotypes were not because of the artifacts of integration sites. Newborn mice between postnatal days (P) 1 and 7 were sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues were removed and rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For samples from embryos, the appearance of a vaginal plug was considered to be day 0.5 of gestation. Embryos at embryonic day 18.5 were dissected in ice-cold PBS. Tissues or embryos were fixed for 1–3 days in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific), pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Paraffin sections were prepared and stained by hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff stain according to established procedures by the Ohio State University Veterinary Histology Laboratory. Newborn mice were decapitated with scissors, and the blood was immediately collected in microhematocrit capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific) and transferred to MicrotainerTM serum-separator tubes (BD PharMingen). The tubes were centrifuged according to the instruction from the manufacturer, and the top layer (serum) was analyzed on the same day or after storage. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels were determined using the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase method (Sigma). All other serum tests were performed according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on an automated discrete random access multianalysis clinical chemistry analyzer (Hitachi 911 Analyzer, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All analyses described above were performed by the Ohio State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Clinical Chemistry Laboratory. Serum insulin and glucagon levels were measured by radioimmunoassay at Linco (St. Charles, MO). Because of the low body weight and low blood volume of the transgenic mice, sera from multiple mice were combined to generate each data point. Student's t test was used to analyze the data, and the p values are indicated in the figure legends. ATF3 protein was generated using the vaccinia virus expression system and isolated from HeLa cells as described previously (27Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ATF3 generated by this system specifically binds to an ATF/CRE site as demonstrated previously (27Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and by the competition and supershift experiments used in this study (see Fig. 5 A). DNA-binding reactions and gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (11Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) using32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ATF/CRE site derived from the PEPCK promoter, 5′-AGGGCCCCTTACGTCAGGGCGAGA-3′ (ATF/CRE site is underlined). CAT reporter driven by the PEPCK promoter (−600 to +69 region) was transfected into HepG2 cells with effector DNAs (pCG, PCG-ATF3, or pCG-ATF4) using the calcium phosphate method with modifications. 350 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered saline (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min to form DNA precipitates before being added to the cell suspension prepared as follows. The cells from two 10-cm plates at 70% confluency were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 800 μl of medium. The cell suspension with the DNA mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and divided into three 6-cm plates containing 2 ml of medium. These plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 16 h later, cells were shocked with 20% glycerol for 2 min, washed with PBS three times, and incubated with media containing 1 μm dexamethasone (0.5 mm stock prepared in ethanol, Sigma) and 20 μm forskolin (10 mm stock prepared in ethanol, Sigma) to induce the PEPCK promoter. 48 h later, cells were washed with PBS, and the CAT activity was measured by a phase extraction method (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 9.7.5-9.7.6Google Scholar). A mock transfection was carried out using 12 μg of pGEM3 to make the DNA mixture. Because F1 mice derived from some TTR-ATF3 founders also expressed ATF3 in the pancreas, we only describe phenotypes obtained from mice with hepatic but not pancreatic expression of ATF3 to exclude hepatic phenotypes resulting from indirect effects of pancreatic expression of ATF3. Importantly, the phenotypes described below were observed in F1 hybrid mice derived from >8 founders. This reproducibility strongly suggests that these phenotypes were not attributed to the artifacts of integration sites. Because the liver is the major organ that maintains homeostasis of many endogenous substances (6Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar), we carried out a serum profile analysis to address whether the expression of ATF3 in the liver affects its functions. As shown in Figs. 1 and2, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, bile acids, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the transgenic mice than in the non-transgenic mice, indicating general liver dysfunction. An analysis of conjugated versus non-conjugated bilirubin indicated that both forms of bilirubin were increased (p < 0.001) in transgenic mice (Fig. 2,B and C), suggesting defects in the uptake or conjugation of bilirubin by the liver and the release of bilirubin via the biliary ducts. Because of the low body weight of the transgenic mice, the volumes of blood collected from the newborn transgenic mice were very low. Therefore, we combined sera from several mice for each assay, and the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were derived from multiple samples (from 12 to 35) with each sample containing sera combined from 3 to 10 mice as indicated in the legends. We also examined the serum for other compounds and found no significant differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic mice in the concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, creatine kinase, serum urea nitrogen, cholesterol, lipase, albumin, and total protein (Table I).Figure 2Transgenic mice had defects in the conjugation and release of bilirubin. Total bilirubin (A), conjugated bilirubin (Con.) (B), and unconjugated bilirubin (Uncon.) (C) were determined from mice at ages of P1–P7.

Radioimmunoassays showed that these mice had lower insulin but higher glucagon levels than the non-transgenic littermates (Table II), indicating that the transgenic mice had a proper hormonal response to low serum glucose levels (low insulin:glucagon ratio). To assay insulin, glucagon, and glucose in parallel from each sample, we combined sera from several mice to obtain enough sera for all three assays. The results shown in Table II were derived from five samples with each sample containing combined sera from multiple mice as described in the legend.Table IISerum insulin and glucagon levelsParameterNon-TxgTxgInsulin (ng/ml)1.45 ± 0.190.53 ± 0.22-150, p < 0.001 versus Non-Txg.Glucagon (pg/ml)191 ± 21247 ± 92-150, p < 0.001 versus Non-Txg.Serum insulin and glucagon levels were determined from Txg and Non-Txg mice at P1–P5.

To determine whether the mice could respond to these hormonal changes, we examined the adipose tissue and serum ketone bodies. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the transgenic mice had lower adipose tissue mass than the non-transgenic mice. This result was reproduced in multiple mice; however, the relative degree of decrease in white adipose tissue versus brown adipose tissue varied among the mice. Despite this variation, the combined white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue was consistently lower in the transgenic mice than that in the non-transgenic mice. The serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels were slightly higher in the transgenic mice than that in the non-transgenic mice; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3 B). The presence of β-hydroxybutyrate indicates that the transgenic mice could carry out β-oxidation to produce ketone bodies. Because of the low blood volume described above, the results of β-hydroxybutyrate were derived from samples with combined sera as detailed in the figure legends. Taken together, these results indicate that the transgenic mice had a proper hormonal response to low serum glucose levels (low insulin:glucagon ratio) and could respond to the hormonal change by mobilizing fat or reduced adipose tissue mass and carrying out β-oxidation. As described in the Introduction, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are activated in the liver during the perinatal period to maintain glucose homeostasis. To investigate the glycogen stores in the transgenic livers, we examined them by periodic acid-Schiff stain. As shown in Fig. 4, transgenic livers had high levels of magenta stain before birth at embryonic day 18.5 but low levels after birth at P7, supporting the notion that the transgenic newborns could use their glycogen stores via glycogenolysis. We note two caveats in the interpretation of these results. First, periodic acid-Schiff stains glycogen and other substances such as mucopolysaccharides and glycolipids; therefore, it is not absolutely specific for glycogen. Second, this assay does not directly detect the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme that degrades glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate. Therefore, additional experiments are required to make a definitive conclusion on glycogenolysis. The lack of magenta stain in the transgenic livers at P7 also suggests that the mice could not replenish their glycogen store, consistent with the reduced gluconeogenesis in these mice. As described previously (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the transgenic livers had a low level of PEPCK mRNA, which encodes a key enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway. Because the PEPCK promoter contains an ATF/CRE site (29Quinn P.G. Wong T.W. Magnuson M.A. Shabb J.B. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because ATF3 is a transcriptional repressor (31Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that ATF3 represses the expression of PEPCK gene, resulting in reduced PEPCK mRNA levels. To test this possibility, we analyzed the ability of ATF3 to bind to the ATF/CRE site derived from the PEPCK promoter (PEPCK ATF/CRE site). As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, recombinant ATF3 isolated from a vaccinia virus expression system bound to the PEPCK ATF/CRE site (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). The specificity of the binding is demonstrated by the observation that an ATF3-specific antiserum shifted the mobility in the DNA-protein complex (lane 3), but a nonspecific antiserum did not (lane 4). Furthermore, the formation of the DNA-protein complex was inhibited by a DNA fragment containing the ATF/CRE sequence (lane 5). To determine whether ATF3 represses the PEPCK promoter, we transfected HepG2 hepatocytes with DNA expressing ATF3 and a CAT reporter driven by the−600 to +69 region of the PEPCK promoter. This region of the PEPCK promoter contains the ATF/CRE site and has been demonstrated to mediate the up-regulation of PEPCK gene expression by the cAMP pathway (29Quinn P.G. Wong T.W. Magnuson M.A. Shabb J.B. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

To address transcriptional repression, we activated the PEPCK promoter with dexamethasone and forskolin and asked whether ATF3 could repress the promoter. As shown in Fig. 5 B, ATF3 repressed the PEPCK promoter. However, ATF4, a transactivator that also binds to the ATF/CRE site (33Liang G. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24088-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), further activated the promoter. Therefore, not all members of the ATF/CREB family could repress the PEPCK promoter. In this report, we demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the liver have decreased adipose tissue mass, disturbed glucose homeostasis, and show signs of hepatic dysfunction (i.e. elevated levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bile acids, and bilirubin). Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene and because many of the hepatic phenotypes observed in the TTR-ATF3 mice resemble those observed in stress-associated liver diseases, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 may provide a good model to investigate how stress-induced gene expression affects hepatic functions. Because of the perinatal lethality and the small size of the transgenic mice, repeated transgenic injections were necessary to obtain the results described in this report. Therefore, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in an inducible manner would greatly facilitate further mechanistic studies. As an example, one could investigate the expression of genes encoding bile acid transporters and bilirubin-conjugating enzymes to elucidate the mechanism for elevated serum bile acids and bilirubin, two commonly observed changes in liver diseases. In addition, one could make primary hepatocytes or nuclear extracts from the mice to investigate the transcriptional programs in the transgenic livers with ATF3 expression versus those without ATF3 expression. In this context, we note the differences between induction of ATF3 and release of epinephrine and norepinephrine during a stress response. We showed in this report that ATF3 represses PEPCK gene expression, which would result in reduced gluconeogenesis. However, epinephrine and norepinephrine release under acute stress response activates the cAMP pathways and leads to increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (5Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1995: 569-602Google Scholar). Therefore, different types of stress response have different physiological significance. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine increases the blood glucose level that is critical for the organism to fight or flee in an acute response. The induction of ATF3 affects the transcriptional programs at the cellular level, which in turn sets things in motion and contributes to the long term detrimental consequences observed in many stress-associated diseases. Previously, we showed by Northern blot analysis that the PEPCK mRNA level is lower in the livers of the TTR-ATF3 transgenic mice than those in the non-transgenic mice (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that ATF3 binds to the CRE site derived from the PEPCK promoter in an in vitro assay and represses the PEPCK promoter in a transient transfection assay. Taken together, these results support a model in which ectopic expression of ATF3 in the transgenic livers represses the expression of PEPCK, providing an explanation for the disturbed glucose homeostasis observed in these mice. The PEPCK promoter has a consensus ATF/CRE site, which plays a key role in the up-regulation of PEPCK by the cAMP pathway (for review see Refs. 34Nizielski S.E. Lechner P.S. Croniger C.M. Wang N.-D.

Res. 1991; 47: 319-346PubMed Google Scholarand references therein). When a PEPCK promoter with a mutated ATF/CRE site was used in the assay, ATF3 did not repress the promoter (data not shown), suggesting that ATF3 represses the PEPCK promoter via the ATF/CRE site. However, we can not rule out the possibility that ATF3 may repress the PEPCK promoter by other mechanisms such as forming dimers with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein or activating protein-1, which has been demonstrated to play important roles in the regulation of the PEPCK promoter (for reviews see Refs. 34Nizielski S.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31629-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene, our results are consistent with a previous report by Granner and colleagues (38Sutherland C. Tebbey P.W. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the expression of PEPCK gene is repressed by stress signals in cultured hepatocytes. It is possible that stress signals inhibit PEPCK expression, at least in part, by inducing ATF3. However, more work is required to determine the validity of this speculation. Recently, Magnuson and colleagues (39She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) generated liver-specific PEPCK knock-out mice and demonstrated that PEPCK plays a critical role in the integration of multiple pathways in energy metabolism, a previously unidentified function for PEPCK. Therefore, the decrease in PEPCK gene expression in our transgenic mice may also contribute to impairments in other metabolic pathways not examined in the current study. In this study, we used transgenic mice expressing ATF3, a stress-inducible transcription factor gene, in the liver to investigate how disturbance in transcriptional programs may affect liver function. As described earlier, there are two groups of TTR-ATF3 mice: group 1 had expression of ATF3 in the liver, and group 2 had expression in the liver and pancreas. The difference was “founder-specific.” Founders giving rise to F1 mice with the group 1 expression pattern always gave rise to F1 mice with the group 1 expression pattern, and the same was true for the group 2 expression pattern. Presumably, the difference between groups 1 and 2 mice was because of the differences in the sites of integration and/or copy numbers of the transgene. The hepatic phenotypes presented under “Results” were all derived from the group 1 mice, which did not express ATF3 in the pancreas. Therefore, they are not because of the indirect effects of pancreatic defects. As an example of this indirect phenotype, osmium tetroxide stain for lipid indicated that the group 2 mice had fatty liver, 2A. E. Jennings, G. J. Kociba, and T. Hai, unpublished results. but the group 1 mice did not. We suspect that the fatty liver phenotype in the group 2 mice was because of the deficiency of insulin, an important regulator of lipid metabolism, in these mice (21Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other genetically altered mice have been used to elucidate how disturbance in transcriptional programs may affect liver function. Examples are knock-out mice deficient in C/EBPa (40Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J.

Friedman J.E. Poli V. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the disturbance in transcriptional program impairs liver function and affects glucose homeostasis. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous findings. However, our results add a dimension of stress. Because ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene, our results indicate that stress signals may affect hepatic functions, at least in part, by inducing ATF3 and perturbing the normal hepatic gene expression patterns. We thank Dr. R. Hanson for insightful suggestions, Dr. P. Quinn for the reporters driven by the PEPCK promoter, protocols, and helpful suggestions, and Drs. G. Darlington, R. Costa, and C. Croniger for comments and discussions."

Using L cells coexpressing E-cadherin constructs with different epitope tags, we examined the lateral dimerization of E-cadherin and its adhesive activity by co-immunoprecipitation and aggregation assays, respectively. Although the transmembrane domain is required for dimerization, tail-less constructs possessing the transmembrane domain of either N-cadherin or CD45 show dimerization and are active in aggregation assays. Two mutant constructs having either of two amino acid substitutions, W2A or substitutions that disrupt the recognition sequence for endoproteolytic enzymes involved in removal of the precursor segment, cannot form dimers and are inactive in aggregation. These monomeric proteins, like their wild-type dimerizing counterparts, retain their Ca2+-dependent resistance to trypsin digestion, suggesting that dimerization per se does not induce a large conformational change. Two other constructs, having either an amino acid substitution, D134A, or a C-terminal deletion of 70 amino acid residues, retain the ability to associate laterally but are inactive in aggregation assays. Staurosporine treatment of cells expressing the latter construct increases aggregation but does not increase the extent of lateral dimerization. Thus, lateral dimerization is necessary, but not sufficient for adhesive activity. Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins involved in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion.

Thus, lateral dimerization is necessary, but not sufficient for adhesive activity. The classic cadherins (e.g. E-, N-, and P-cadherins) are single transmembrane domain proteins involved in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion (1Takeichi M.

Ca2+ protects the extracellular domains of cadherins from proteolytic degradation and is necessary for their function. They share a common primary structure, with five tandemly repeated extracellular domains of ∼110 amino acids each, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain. Their cytoplasmic domain interacts with intracellular proteins termed catenins, which mediate connections between the cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton (4Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), two cadherin molecules extending from the same cell surface laterally interact through hydrophobic interactions, i.e. the mutual incorporation of a conserved Trp residue, localized at the second position of mature classic cadherins, Trp-2, into the hydrophobic core of the paired molecule. In an alternative model (15Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 21Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A. Fauser W.C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), lateral cadherin dimers are stabilized by mutually coordinating Ca2+. The second model is consistent with the observation that, at high concentrations, recombinantly expressed extracellular regions of E-cadherin dimerize in a Ca2+-dependent manner (22Alattia J.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of a recombinant E-cadherin ectodomain pentamerized by the assembly domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein showed that the artificially assembled recombinant protein self-associates in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas the ectodomain alone does not (21Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A. Fauser W.C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 24Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The protein also showed Ca2+-dependent adhesive interactions. Mutation of the Trp-2 to alanine (W2A) abolishes the adhesive interactions, but not the lateral interactions in the recombinant E-cadherin construct (21Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A. Fauser W.C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This work is consistent with other studies (15Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M.

Hirohashi S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) used chemical cross-linking studies at the cell surface to show that Ca2+ions are required for lateral E-cadherin dimer formation. Regardless of the mechanism that governs cadherin lateral dimerization, these dimeric structures are thought to represent the functional units required for adhesion. Adhesive bonds between cadherins of interacting cell membranes are predicted to result from binding between EC1 domains of oppositely oriented cis-dimers to form trans-interacting anti-parallel tetramers, which are termed adhesion dimers. The necessity for lateral dimers is supported by experiments with recombinant cadherin extracellular segments (24Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that show that only the dimeric form can mediate adhesion. Furthermore, artificially induced multimerization of a chimeric tail-less C-cadherin strengthened adhesion in cells expressing this molecule (28Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears likely that lateral dimers are a fundamental unit for cadherin function, at least for the classical cadherins. Chitaev and Troyanovsky (29Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed, however, that a relatively small pool of E-cadherin exists as lateral homodimers. This result raises the possibility that, by controlling the number of lateral dimers versus monomers on the cell surface, cells can regulate cadherin activity. In the present study, we show several lines of evidence that dimerization of the cadherin extracellular domain is not the sole critical step in regulating cadherin adhesion activity, and that a post-dimerization event is also important in this regulation. A cDNA encoding full-length mouse E-cadherin was described previously (4Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). All the following constructs were cloned into an expression vector, pCAGGSneo (30Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. K. Yamamura, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). The cDNA encoding a mutant E-cadherin protein with an aspartate-to-alanine substitution at position 134 in the extracellular Ca2+-binding motif (D134A) was described previously (16Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding a mutant E-cadherin protein with amino acid substitutions (Arg-Arg-Gln-Lys-Arg to Arg-Thr-Gln-Thr-Arg) in the endoproteolytic cleavage site for removal of the precursor segment, was described previously (31Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To detect co-immunoprecipitation by immunoblotting, the E-cadherin construct was fused to either a GFP or HA epitope at its C terminus (Fig. 1). An EcoRV site was created by PCR at the C-terminal site of the E-cadherin construct, using the following primers for full-length E-cadherin (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCGTCGTCCTCGCCACCGC), the tail-less EC0 construct (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCTAGAAACAGTAGGAGCAGC), the partially truncated EC81 construct (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCGATGAAGTTTCCAATTTCAT), and the soluble and secreted Ex construct (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCGATGGCAGGAACTTGCAAT). The EcoRV site was used for ligation of the cDNA for the E-cadherin constructs with the unique EcoRV site upstream of the GFP or HA epitope sequence in the pCAGGSneo vector. cDNAs encoding two E-cadherin constructs whose transmembrane domains were replaced by that of either N-cadherin or human CD45 (EC0TMN or EC0TMC, respectively) (Fig. 1) were constructed by PCR (13Ozawa M. Ohkubo T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar). For this, the following two combinations of primers were used: EN (5′-CGGCACTTGCAATCCTGCTGCCA) and NTM-1 (GCCATCATTGCCATCCTGCTCTG), and EC (GATCGCAGGAACTTGCAATCCTGC) and CTM-1 (GCACTGATAGCATTTCTGGCATTTC). These constructs were tagged with either a GFP or HA epitope as described above, using the following combinations of primers (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCCATCCATACCACAAACATCA) and (5′-TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCGG and 5′-ATCGTAGAGAACAACAAGCAGG). cDNAs encoding human N-cadherin and CD45 were kindly provided by Drs. S. T. Suzuki (Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center, Aichi, Japan) and H. Saito (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EC1 domain of E-cadherin was performed as described above using the following primer pair (5′-CGGTCATCCCTCCCATCAGCTG and 5′-CGTCTCGTTTCTGTCTTCTGAGACC) to generate a W2A mutation, which causes dissociation of E-cadherin dimer and loss of adhesive activity. All PCR products were sequenced and cloned into expression vectors. Mouse fibroblast L-tk−cells and their transfectants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To obtain single or double transfectants, appropriate expression vectors (5 μg each) were introduced into L cells (5 × 105) by the calcium phosphate method (4Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). After selection in medium containing G418, single colonies were isolated and analyzed for expression of the constructs by immunoblot analysis using anti-E-cadherin (DECMA-1), anti-GFP, and anti-HA (12CA5 or 3F10) antibodies. Immunofluorescence staining of cells was performed as described previously (11Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.01% trypsin (type XI, Sigma) and 2 mm CaCl2. After the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), the cells were washed, resuspended, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with constant rotation at 70 rpm. DECMA-1, a rat mAb to E-cadherin, was used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, and rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. A mouse mAb (12CA5) directed against HA was kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura (Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). A rat mAb against HA (3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit anti-GFP antisera were purchased from Molecular Probes and were used for immunoprecipitation. A mouse mAb against GFP was purchased from CLONTECH and used for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (11Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol.

In brief, cells (2 × 106) were cultured in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 24 h and lysed in PI lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin). In coculture experiments, 2 × 106 cells expressing EC0-GFP and EC0-HA mixed in a 1:1 ratio were cultured for 24 h. To analyze E-cadherin constructs secreted into the medium (Ex-GFP and Ex-HA), cells expressing these constructs were cultured for 3 days. The medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and then subjected to analysis. The E-cadherin proteins were collected with rabbit anti-GFP or anti-E-cadherin antibodies, which had been preabsorbed to protein G-agarose (Sigma). The immune complex was washed with the same buffer three times and then boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysis and washing of the immunoprecipitates were done with the following buffers or a combination of buffers: 1) 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmNa3VO4; 2) cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm PMSF, and the immunoprecipitates were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm PMSF; 3) RIPA (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF). Using an immunoprecipitation approach, lateral dimers of E-cadherin that are soluble in nonionic detergents were detected in epithelial cells (29Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This approach was also used successfully to identify lateral heterodimerization between N-cadherin and R-cadherin (32Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We expressed tail-less E-cadherin protein (EC0) constructs tagged with either a GFP or HA epitope (EC0-GFP and EC0-HA, respectively) (Fig. 1) in L cells and established stable single and double cadherin expressors. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of EC0-GFPL (L cells expressing EC0-GFP), EC0-HAL (L cells expressing EC0-HA), and EC0-GFP/EC0-HAL (L cells expressing both EC0-GFP and EC0-HA) with antibodies against GFP, HA, and E-cadherin showed that each transfectant produces its respective protein (Fig. 2, upper panel, Total), but that the amount of EC0-HA detected is much higher than that of EC0-GFP. The latter finding suggests that EC0-HA is more stable than EC0-GFP in L cells. When total cell lysates from EC0-GFPL, EC0-HAL, and EC0-GFP/EC0HAL were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies, EC0-HA protein was detected in immunoprecipitates isolated from EC0-GFP/EC0HAL cell lysates but not in those from EC0-GFPL or EC0-HAL cell lysates (Fig. 2, lower panel, IP: GFP), suggesting a lateral interaction between EC0-GFP and EC0-HA expressed on the same cells. These results were consistent with a previous report (29Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and suggest that lateral dimerization does not depend on association with catenins or p120. Because cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, divalent cations, including Ca2+, are not required for dimer formation. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with E-cadherin antibodies that recognize both EC0-GFP and EC0-HA revealed that the amount of EC0-HA coprecipitated was similar to that of EC0-GFP, indicating that most, if not all, of the EC0-GFP is in a dimer with EC0-HA. The results are in contrast with a previous report (29Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showing that a relatively small pool of E-cadherin forms lateral dimers. Although a soluble, secreted extracellular segment of C-cadherin has been shown to form lateral dimers (27Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the ability of E-cadherin is not definitely known (24Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To address this issue, constructs encoding the extracellular domain of E-cadherin tagged with GFP or the HA epitope (Ex-GFP or Ex-HA, respectively; see Fig. 1) were expressed in L cells. Immunoblot analysis of culture media collected from these transfectants revealed that these proteins were expressed and secreted into the medium as soluble proteins (Fig. 3, upper panel, Total). When immunoprecipitates collected from media of Ex-GFP and Ex-HA coexpressors (Ex-GFP/Ex-HAL cells) with anti-GFP antibodies were blotted with anti-HA or E-cadherin antibodies, no Ex-HA band was detected (Fig. 3, lower panel, IP: GFP). Lack of the coprecipitation of Ex-HA with Ex-GFP indicates that the transmembrane domain is required for the lateral association. To determine whether a specific amino acid sequence in the transmembrane domain is required, the transmembrane domains of EC0-GFP and EC0-HA were replaced by that of N-cadherin (EC0TMN-GFP and EC0TMN-HA) or CD45 (EC0TMC-GFP and EC0TMC-HA) (Fig. 4A). These constructs were introduced into L cells in various combinations to determine whether the transmembrane domain of N-cadherin or CD45 can substitute for the role of the E-cadherin transmembrane domain and whether heterodimerization between EC0 molecules with different transmembrane domains can occur. HA-tagged chimeric constructs consisting of the E-cadherin extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain of either N-cadherin (EC0TMN-HA) or CD45 (EC0TMC-HA) associated laterally with GFP constructs containing the cognate transmembrane domain (EC0TMN-GFP or EC0TMC-GFP, respectively), as well as with those containing the native E-cadherin transmembrane domain (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing these constructs showed aggregation activity (Fig. 5). These results argue that the specific sequence of the transmembrane domain is not critical for lateral association and adhesion.Figure 5Aggregation of L cells expressing E-cadherin constructs. L cells expressing different E-cadherin constructs shown in Fig. 1 were allowed to aggregate for 30 min. Error bars represent S.D. values. Cells were dissociated by trypsinization (0.01%) in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2, except for pEC0-GFP/pEC0-HAL cells, which were dissociated either with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and 2% chicken serum ((−) trypsin/Ca2+), or 0.01% trypsin and 2 mmCaCl2, ((+) trypsin/Ca2+).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) According to one model (19Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Als-Neilsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), two cadherin molecules extending from the same cell surface laterally interact through hydrophobic interactions. A major feature of this interaction is the mutual incorporation of a conserved Trp-2 residue into the hydrophobic core of the paired molecule. The importance of this interaction was suggested by studies in which mutating Trp-2 in N-cadherin (20Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) or Trp-2 and Val-3 in E-cadherin (29Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) completely abolished dimerization. In contrast to these observations, it was found that a Trp-2 mutation in E-cadherin abolished cell-cell adhesion, but not lateral interactions (21Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A. Fauser W.C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Trp-2 mutation abolishes dimerization of the tail-less E-cadherin, an EC0 construct with a W2A substitution (EC0WA-HA) was transfected into L cells together with GFP-tagged constructs with or without the same mutation (EC0WA-GFP or EC0-GFP, respectively) (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis of GFP immunoprecipitates with anti-HA and E-cadherin antibodies revealed that EC0WA-HA does not coprecipitate with EC0WA-GFP or EC0-GFP (Fig. 6A, lower panel), indicating that Trp-2 is critical for lateral dimerization of the EC0 protein. Addition of 2 mm Ca2+, instead of 2 mm EDTA, in the cell lysis and immunoprecipitation buffers did not change the results (Fig. 6B). Lack of coprecipitation does not seem to be caused by differential localization of the constructs, because immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that they are both expressed on the cell surface (data not shown). Trypsin digestion (0.01%) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, which would remove all Ca2+ from the system, revealed that significant portions of the constructs were expressed on cell surfaces (Fig. 7A). In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, these constructs remained on the surface after digestion. Thus, the typical Ca2+-dependent trypsin resistance does not appear to rely upon lateral dimerization. Incubation of cells expressing E-cadherin in a high concentration of trypsin (0.1%) in the presence of Ca2+ results in release of an 84-kDa E-cadherin fragment from the cells (Fig. 7B). Incubation of cells expressing both EC0WA-GFP and EC0WA-HA protein under the same conditions also yielded the same 84-kDa fragment (Fig. 7B). Therefore, the monomeric as well as the dimeric E-cadherin extracellular domains show the same trypsin resistance in the presence of Ca2+. These constructs are deficient in adhesion, because cells expressing them on their surface (EC0WA-HAL and EC0WA-GFP/EC0WA-HAL) showed no activity in aggregation assays (Fig. 5). Cells coexpressing EC0-GFP and EC0WA-HAL do not aggregate either, indicating that the mere presence of EC0WA-HA seems to disrupt the potential homodimeric association of EC0-GFP molecules between cells in a dominant-negative fashion. At present we do not know the reason for this.Figure 7Dimerization and Ca2+-dependent resistance to trypsin digestion.A, dimerization is not necessary for Ca2+-dependent resistance to trypsin digestion. The double transfectants (EC0-GFP/EC0-HAL, EC0DA-GFP/EC0DA-HAL, and EC0WA-GFP/EC0WA-HAL) were incubated with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+(TC) or 1 mm EGTA (TE).

https://openalex.org/W2021160311,"In HIV-infected patients, production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a highly immunosuppressive cytokine, is associated with the disease progression toward AIDS. We have previously shown that HIV-1 Tat induces IL-10 production by human monocytes via a protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent pathway. Here we show that PKC activation by Tat is essential for IL-10 induction. Among the eight PKC isoforms present in human monocytes, we investigated which isoform(s) plays this crucial role in Tat-mediated IL-10 production and show that 1) Tat can activate PKC-alpha, PKC-betaII, PKC-delta, and PKC-epsilon, 2) of these four potential candidates, only PKC-betaII, PKC-delta, and PKC-epsilon are activated by the active domain Tat 1-45, which is responsible for IL-10 production and depleted by long-term exposure to PMA, which abolishes Tat-mediated IL-10 production, 3) whereas selective inhibition of PKC-alpha and PKC-epsilon by specific antisense oligonucleotides has no effect on Tat-mediated IL-10 induction, inhibition of either PKC-betaII or PKC-delta partially inhibits IL-10 production; and 4) the simultaneous inhibition of PKC-betaII and PKC-delta totally inhibits Tat-mediated IL-10. Altogether, these results suggest that the induction of IL-10 by Tat is strictly dependent on the PKC-delta and -betaII isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1992776653,"Thrombin and proteinase-activated receptors (PAR) specifically regulate several functions that markedly enhance the transformation phenotype such as inflammation, cell proliferation, tumor growth, and metastasis. We recently reported that thrombin inhibits cellular invasion induced by src, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and leptin in kidney and colonic epithelial cells via predominant activation of the pertussis toxin (PTx) -sensitive G-proteins Galphao/Galphai. We provide pharmacological and biochemical evidence that in the presence of PTx, PAR-1 induced cellular invasion through Galpha12/Galpha13- and RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) -dependent signaling. However, inhibition of the endogenous small GTPase RhoA by the C3 exoenzyme, dominant-negative N19-RhoA, activated G26V-RhoD, and activators of the nitric oxide/cGMP pathways conferred invasive activity to PAR-1 via a signaling cascade using Galphaq, phospholipase C (PLC), Ca(2+)/calmodulin myosin light chain kinase (CaM-MLCK), and phosphorylation of MLC. We found that cellular invasion induced by the src oncogene is abrogated by inhibitors of the RhoA/ROCK pathway and is independent of PLC/CaM-MLCK signaling. Our data demonstrate that the RhoA and RhoD small GTPases are acting as a molecular switch of cellular invasion and reveal a novel critical mechanism by which PAR-1 bypass Galphao/i and RhoA inhibition via differential coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins linked to divergent or convergent biological responses. Our data also indicate that Rho GTPases and ROCK mediate a src-dependent invasion signal in kidney and colonic cancer cells. We conclude that dynamic regulation of Rho GTPases activation and inactivation by oncogenes, growth factors, cGMP-inducing agents, and adhesion molecules can initiate convergent invasion signals controlled by the thrombin PAR-1 in cancer cells.-Nguyen, Q.-D., Faivre, S., Bruyneel, E., Rivat, C., Seto, M., Endo, T., Mareel, M., Emami, S., Gespach, C.

https://openalex.org/W2147073426,"The Rit, Rin, and Ric proteins comprise a distinct and evolutionarily conserved subfamily of the Ras-like small G-proteins. Although these proteins share the majority of core effector domain residues with Ras, recent studies suggest that Rit uses novel effector pathways to regulate NIH3T3 cell proliferation and transformation, while the functions of Rin and Ric remain largely unknown. Since we demonstrate that Rit is expressed in neurons, we investigated the role of Rit signaling in promoting the differentiation and survival of pheochromocytoma cells. In this study, we show that expression of constitutively active Rit (RitL79) in PC6 cells results in neuronal differentiation, characterized by the elaboration of an extensive network of neurite-like processes that are morphologically distinct from those mediated by the expression of oncogenic Ras. Although activated Rit fails to stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathways in COS cells, RitL79 induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PC6 cells. We also find that Rit-mediated effects on neurite outgrowth can be blocked by co-expression of dominant-negative mutants of C-Raf1 or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Moreover, expression of dominant-negative Rit is sufficient to inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Expression of active Rit inhibits growth factor-withdrawal mediated apoptosis of PC6 cells, but does not induce phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B, suggesting that survival does not utilize the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Instead, pharmacological inhibitors of MEK block Rit-stimulated cell survival. Taken together, these studies suggest that Rit represents a distinct regulatory protein, capable of mediating differentiation and cell survival in PC6 cells using a MEK-dependent signaling pathway to achieve its effects.

The Ras subfamily consists of the classical Ras (H-, K-, and N-), R-Ras, Ral, Rheb, TC21/R-Ras2, M-Ras/R-Ras3, and the newest members of the family Rit, Rin, and Ric (1Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). As molecular switches, the Ras-related GTPases respond to external signals by exchanging GTP for bound GDP, and the GTP-bound active proteins interact with specific downstream effectors thereby triggering intracellular signaling cascades through their interaction with a variety of target proteins (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar).

Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This is particularly true for the Rit (Ras-like protein in all tissues), Rin (Ras-like protein in neurons), and Drosophila Ric (Ras-related protein that interacted with calmodulin) proteins whose cellular functions are only beginning to be characterized (5Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C.

These proteins share more than 50% sequence identity with Ras, including highly conserved core effector domains, and their GTP binding and hydrolysis activities has been confirmed (5Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike Ras, the C termini of Rit and Rin lacks a typical prenylation motif (CAA X, XXCC, or C XC) required for the association of Ras proteins with the plasma membrane. However, both proteins contain a well conserved series of basic amino acids at the C terminus, but the significance of this basic domain in their subcellular localization is not clear (6Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have investigated the ability of Rit and Rin to regulate cell growth, transformation, and several signaling pathways used by other Ras family proteins (8Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that Rit signals to Ras-responsive elements and transforms NIH3T3 cells to tumorigenicity, but fails to activate the ERK, JNK, p38, or PI3K/Akt kinases, indicating that Rit regulates growth control by different effector pathways than other transforming members of the Ras family (8Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These biological activities may, at least in part, result from activation of the RalGEF/Ral signaling cascade. In support of this notion, we have demonstrated that Rit binds and activates the novel RalGEF, RGL3, to activate cellular Ral GTPases (9Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while Rit and Rin interact with the same putative effectors in the two-hybrid system (5Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), constitutively active Rin does not demonstrate these same biological effects (8Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that Rin activation is regulated by growth factor-dependent signaling in neuronal cells, suggesting that Rin serves to regulate signaling cascades within the mature nervous system (10Spencer M.L.

A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). When treated with NGF these cells acquire a phenotype resembling sympathetic neurons, including the extension of neurites, cessation of cell division, electrical excitability, and expression of genes encoding specific neuronal markers (11Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Using neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells as a measure of differentiation, studies have implicated the Ras/ERK pathway in NGF signaling. Ras activation results in activation of the protein kinases Raf-1, B-Raf, and MAP-ERK kinase kinase (MEKK) (12Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L.

In this study, we investigated the ability of the Rit GTPase to induce neurite outgrowth and protect pheochromocytoma cells from serum withdrawal-mediated cell death. To this end, we developed a recombinant adenovirus expressing constitutively active and dominant-negative mutants of Rit. Using these constructs we demonstrate that activated Rit supports robust neurite outgrowth and suppresses serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in PC6 cells. Rit activates ERK1/2 but not Akt kinase activity and promotes cell survival and neuritogenesis through a MEK-dependent signaling cascade. These studies indicate that Rit functions as a potent inducer of cell survival and differentiation in neural tumor cells and suggest a role for Rit in regulating these same processes in neurons. PC6 is a subline of PC-12 cells that produces neurites in response to NGF but grows as well isolated cells rather than in clumps (26Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (the generous gift of Thomas Vanaman, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Mammalian expression vectors for wild type and mutant H-Ras and Rit have been described previously (5Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem.

To confirm the specificity of the anti-Rit antibody, monolayers of HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged expression vectors encoding wild type Rit, Rin, or H-Ras as described previously (9Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 48-h incubation, whole-cell lysates were prepared in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm KF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Calbiochem) and the protein concentration determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein from each lysate was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, using a standard SDS-PAGE protocol. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with either 1 μg/ml anti-HA or 2 μg/ml of anti-Rit antibody and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and chemiluminescence as described previously (9Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze endogenous Rit expression in a variety of cell lines, whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using 2 μg/ml of anti-Rit monoclonal antibody (R003U) as described above. To examine the activation of ERK and Akt kinases, PC6 cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-RitL79/GFP at m.o.i. values of 200 for 16 h. 48 h after infection, cells were serum-starved overnight and either harvested or pretreated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 10 min as indicated, before lysis in buffer A. Immunoblots were probed with anti-P-ERK (Promega), anti-P-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology). Stripping and reprobing of membranes were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfection of PC6 cells was performed using Effectene (Qiagen). For the Ras activation assay, PC6 cells (7.5 × 104 cells/60-mm plate) were transfected with the indicated mammalian expression plasmids mixed with 8 ml of Effectene enhancer and 10 μl of Effectene reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. PC6 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells on coverslips placed in six-well dishes. Coverslips were precoated with 5 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h. PC6 cells were transiently transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) with one of the following plasmids: pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-Rit, pEGFP-RitL79, pEGFP-H-RasL61, pEGFP-RitWT, pEGFP-H-RasWT, pEGFP-RitN35, pEGFP-RasN17, and pKH3-RitL79 either alone or in pairs. Protein expression was examined by epifluorescence microscopy for the GFP fusion proteins or by immunohistochemistry for the HA-tagged proteins. Counting the day of transfection as day 0, cells were either not subject to growth factor stimulation or were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) on day 2 and then fixed on day 5. Cells were then washed three times in CM-PBS (1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.91 mm MgSO4) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in CM-PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeablized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in CM-PBS for 5 min, blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in CM-PBS, incubated with Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min, and washed extensively prior to mounting. For studies using HA-tagged proteins (Rit effector domain studies), slips were fixed and blocked as above, incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody for 20 min, washed with CM-PBS, and incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories). Fixed and stained slips were mounted on glass slides with 12 μl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined under the appropriate illumination with a ×40 objective lens on an E600 microscope (Nikon). Cells were scored positive for neurite outgrowth if one or more neurites exceeded 1 cell body diameter in length. For studies using recombinant adenovirus, PC6 cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of virus, after which the medium was changed. To examine inhibition of RitL79-mediated neurite outgrowth by dominant-negative MAPK cascade intermediates, PC6 cells were co-infected with Ad-RitL79/GFP and either Ad-DN-Raf or Ad-DN-MEK each at a m.o.i. of 100 (total virus m.o.i. of 200) and neurite length determined in GFP expressing cells. To examine the ability of dominant-negative Rit (RitN35) to inhibit constitutively active C-Raf-mediated neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were co-infected with Ad-CA-Raf/Ad-GFP (each at an m.o.i. of 50) and either Ad-GFP, Ad-RitN35, or Ad-DN-MEK (m.o.i. of 100). Three days following infection GFP expressing PC6 cells with neurites longer than one cell body in length were counted as positive. At least 250 cells were counted per experiment with each experiment performed in triplicate. The expression of Rit protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis for the duration of the longest experiment. Primary dissociated cultures of sympathetic neurons were prepared from the superior cervical ganglia of embryonic day-21 rats as described previously (30Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 31Estus S. Tucker H.M. van Rooyen C. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the nonneuronal cells were minimized by incubating the dissociated ganglia for 3 h on plastic culture dishes prior to plating onto collagen-coated 35-mm dishes (∼5,000 cells/dish). Cultures were maintained in culture medium containing 90% minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 20 μm uridine, and 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine in the presence of 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF for either 1 (young) or 4 weeks (old). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from the cultured neurons, converted to cDNA, and specific cDNAs (Rit or NFM) were amplified by subjecting 2% of the cDNA to 25 PCR cycles, which is well within the linear range of PCR amplification for these specific genes and primer pairs as described previously (30Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 31Estus S. Tucker H.M. van Rooyen C. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After amplification, cDNAs were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels, stained with SYBR® Gold (Molecular Probes), and visualized by phosphoimaging technology (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). The identity of the amplified cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant adenovirus co-expressing Rit79L and GFP (Ad-RitL79/GFP), Rit35N and GFP (Ad-RitN35/GFP), or GFP alone (Ad-GFP) were generated as described previously (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant adenoviruses were generated through homologous recombination using the Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. pAdTrack constructs were linearized with PmeI and electroporated into BJ5183 bacteria along with the adenoviral plasmid pAdEasy-1 (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Since, the human Rit cDNA contains an internal PmeI site, QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to destroy this restriction site, and each cDNA was subsequently cloned directionally into KpnI/XbaI-digested pAdTrack. All cDNAs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The resulting recombinant adenoviral vector DNAs were digested with PacI and transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were monitored for GFP expression. GFP-positive plaques formed after ∼10 days in culture and nearly all cells expressed GFP by 14–16 days, at which time the adenovirus was harvested by scrapping the cells from the plate and pelleting them along with all floating cells in the culture. After three cycles of freezing in a methanol/dry ice bath and rapid thawing at 37 °C, 1 ml of viral lysate was used to infect 1 × 106 HEK-293 cells. Virus was allowed to amplify until complete lysis of the cells, usually 4–5 days. The viral lysate was collected and divided between 5- and 10-cm plates each containing 1–3 × 106 HEK-293 cells. The efficiency of infection was followed with GFP, and viruses were harvested following complete lysis as described above. At this point, viral titers were often high enough to use for gene expression studies in PC6 cells. Higher titer stocks were generated as described, and CsCl banding purified the resultant viruses; final yields were generally 1011 to 1012 plaque-forming units (32He T.C.

Infectious titer was determined by limiting dilution plaque assay on HEK-293 cells. All recombinant adenoviruses were screened for the presence of the wild type E1A gene by PCR in a nonpermissive cell line such as PC6 cells with HEK-293 cell DNA serving as a positive control for the E1A gene. Viruses were used at m.o.i. values of ∼100–200. Adenovirus constructs with dominant-negative C-Raf1 (truncated at amino acid 257), MEK1 (Ser217 deleted), and constitutively active C-Raf1 (deletion of amino acids 26–302) and constitutively active Ras (Arg17 to Val) have been described previously (kind gift of Drs. L. Kleese and L. Parada, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and Dr. Yibin Wang, University of Maryland) (21Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F.

Cell survival was determined by assaying viable cell numbers using the Cell Counting Kit-8 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Ad-GFP-, Ad-RasV12-, and Ad-RitL79/GFP-infected naive PC6 cells were washed three times in serum-free DMEM, plated at 15,000 cells/well in polylysine-treated 96-well microtiter plates, and cell viability determined at the indicated times. To examine the survival adenovirus-infected differentiated cells, PC6 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 7 days prior to viral infection and survival determined as described above. For pharmacological inhibition of PI3K or MEK, 50 μm LY 294002 (New England Biolabs), or 50 μm PD-98059 (New England BioLabs) were added to cells prior to plating to 96-well dishes, and additional drug was added with serum-free medium following 48 h of incubation. Viable cell counts were performed as above at the indicated times. Each experiment was repeated at least three times in triplicate. Although we, and others, have demonstrated that Rit mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, including expression within neuronal tissues, it is not known whether Rit is expressed in neurons (5Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C.

To this end, primary cultures of superior cervical ganglia were prepared from embryonic day 21 rats and incubated in the presence of NGF for 6 days (immature sympathetic neurons) or 30 days (mature neurons) and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, Rit mRNA was detected in both mature and immature cultures. To extend these results, and to identify a cultured cell system in which to examine the biological function of Rit, we examined Rit expression in a variety of cultured cell lines by Western blot analysis. Using an anti-Rit monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B), a protein of ∼28 kDa was detected in a variety of cultured cell lines (Fig. 1C). Endogenous Rit protein was abundantly expressed in both NIH3T3 and PC6 cells, and at much lower levels in C2C12 cells, but not in SH-SY5Y or MIN6 cells. Pheochromocytoma cells respond to the expression of activated Ras proteins by the cessation of cell growth and the extension of neurites (16Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R.

Both XD and XO undergo limited cleavage by chymotrypsin and trypsin. Trypsin selectively cleaved both enzyme forms at Lys184, while chymotrypsin cleaved XD primarily at Met181 but cleaved XO at Met181and at Phe560. Chymotrypsin, but not trypsin, cleavage also prevented the reductive conversion of XO to XD; thus the region surrounding Phe560 appears to be important in the interconversion of the two forms. Size exclusion chromatography showed that disulfide bond formation reduced the hydrodynamic volume of the enzyme, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of chymotrypsin-digested XO showed significant, disulfide bond-mediated, conformational heterogeneity in the N-terminal third of the enzyme but no evidence of disulfide bonds between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions or between XOR subunits. These results indicate that intrasubunit disulfide bond formation leads to a global conformational change in XOR that results in the exposure of the region surrounding Phe560. Conformational changes within this region in turn appear to play a critical role in the interconversion between the XD and XO forms of the enzyme.

Each subunit consist of 1333–1358 amino acids, depending on the species, and contains binding sites for molybdopterin, iron, and flavin co-factors (2Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, XII. Third Ed.

Analysis of these cDNAs has shown that the amino acid sequence of XOR is highly conserved across the phylogenetic spectrum. The enzymes from rats, mice, humans, and cattle exhibit ∼90% identity, while the chicken and Drosophila enzymes exhibit, respectively, 70 and 52% identity with mammalian enzymes (3Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In mammals, XOR can exist in two enzymatic forms: a dehydrogenase (XD; EC 1.1.3.204) which utilizes NAD+ as an electron acceptor and an oxidase (XO; EC 1.1.3.22) which utilizes O2 as an electron acceptor (11Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

Both enzymatic forms are the product of the same gene and are identical in size, subunit composition, and co-factor requirements (2Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, XII. Third Ed.

Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar). It is unclear if XD and XO serve distinct biological roles. High levels of the XO have been associated with tissue injury and certain diseases (14Cross C.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 526-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 15Southorn P.A.

Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 526-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The XD form, on the other hand, may be an important component in the defense against oxygen radical damage through its role in the synthesis of uric acid, a potent antioxidant (16Becker B.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanism(s) that regulate the relative tissue levels of the XD and XO forms of XOR are poorly defined. XD can be converted to XO in a reversible process by heating or oxidation of cysteine thiols to form disulfide bonds (11Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The oxidative conversion of XD to XO has been shown to be associated with the oxidation of selected cysteines (17Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

However, specific protein domains involved in these changes have not been identified, and the underlying molecular basis of the redox-mediated XD to XO conversion is still uncertain. In addition, it is unclear to what extent conformational changes within the flavin-binding site reflect larger changes in the global conformation of XOR and whether such changes are necessary for the conversion of XD to XO. XD can also be irreversibly converted to XO by proteolysis (6Amaya Y. Yamazaki K-I. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol.

Recent crystallographic studies have shown that proteolysis of XD leads to structural alterations near the flavin cofactor domain (22Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). However, the crystallographic structure of intact XO generated by cysteine oxidation has not been solved, and thus it is unclear how similar the structure of disulfide-bonded XO is to proteolyzed XO. In the present study we have used peptide mapping, chromatography, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify differences in the solution conformations of XD and XO and to investigate the role conformation changes play in the XD to XO conversion. XOR (2.5–3.1 IU/mg) isolated from bovine milk in the oxidase form (XO) according to Waud et al. (23Waud W.R. Brady F.O. Wiley R.D. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Joseph McCord (Webb-Waring Antioxidant Research Institute, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Sequencing grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Boehringer-Ingleheim Inc. BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate) was purchased from Pierce. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hyperbond) were purchased from Beckman Instruments Inc. Centricon ultrafiltration membranes were purchased from Amicon Inc. Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from either Sigma or Fischer Scientific. Purified XO was converted to XD by incubation with 5–10 mm DTT at room temperature for 1–2 h (17Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The enzyme was then cooled to 4 °C and subjected to ultrafiltration at 4 °C using Centricon 10,000-Da cut-off membranes to remove DTT. Enzymatic activity specifically associated with either XD (xanthine:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity) or XO (xanthine:O2 oxidoreductase activity) was calculated as the allopurinol-sensitive rates of aerobic formation of uric acid from xanthine in the presence (XD) or absence (XO) of 0.6 mmNAD+, and the ratio of XD to XO activities (D/O) was calculated according to Waud and Rajagopolan (12Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as described previously (24McManaman J.L. Shellman V. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Total XOR activity (both XD and XO activities) was routinely assayed by the reduction of dichloroindophenol using xanthine as a substrate (xanthine/dichloroindophenol assay) as described previously (24McManaman J.L. Shellman V. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Total protein was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hemanson G.T. Mallial A.K. Gartner J.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). XOR (5–20 μg) in the XD or XO form was incubated at room temperature (25 °C) with 1/20 (w/w) chymotrypsin or trypsin in 50 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, pH 8, for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then assayed for enzyme activity and/or processed for SDS-PAGE analysis as described below. Electrophoresis was performed using a mini-Protean II gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) with 0.75-mm spacers. For one-dimensional electrophoresis samples were diluted with an equal volumes of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.125 m Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5), heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and separated by electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature. For two-dimensional electrophoresis samples were diluted with equal volumes of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and subjected to electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide gels as described above. When the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel, electrophoresis was stopped and the protein-containing lanes were excised and prepared for electrophoresis in the second dimension by incubation in 3 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 60 °C. After reduction the lanes were layered on top of the second dimension gel (10% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS) perpendicular to the direction of electrophoresis. Gaps were sealed with melted agarose (1%) containing 2% SDS, 50 mm DTT. After electrophoresis protein bands were detected by silver staining (26Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). XO was cross-linked by reaction with a 50-fold molar excess of BS3 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, according to the manufacturer's instructions. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed by automated Edman degradation of proteins electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 477A automated protein sequencing instrument equipped with an in-line model 120 HPLC. HLPC-size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC) analysis was performed on a Beckman System Gold Instrument using a 7.8 × 600-mm SEC-3000 column (Phenomenex Inc.) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Chromatography was performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of protein and enzyme activity were monitored at 220 nm using an online UV detector and (where indicated by collecting fractions) using an electronically activated fraction collector (Gilson, FC 203B) that was synchronously integrated to sample injection. Determination of XD and XO retention times was performed using a 25-μl injection loop and sample protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml. XO was converted to XD by incubation with 10 mm DTT at room temperature for at least 1 h prior to analysis. Mean retention times of each enzyme form were determined from a minimum of five HPLC-SEC analyses. The SEC properties of cross-linked XO were determined using a 100-μl injection loop. Eluted protein was collected into 0.3-ml fractions. XO activity was determined using the xanthine/dichloroindophenol assay. The electrophoretic characteristics of the cross-linked protein were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining as described above. Differences in the environment surrounding the flavin co-factor binding regions of XD and XO have been reported previously (20Massey V. Schopfer L.M. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10567-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Saito T. Nishino T. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15930-15935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these differences reflect broader structural changes we investigated the trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion patterns of both catalytic forms (Fig.1). Chymotrypsin cleavage of XO (D/O = 0.1; 90% XO form) generated three major cleavage products with estimated molecular weights on SDS-PAGE of 85,000 (band 1), 64,000 (band 2), and 44,000 fragments (band 3). In contrast, chymotrypsin cleavage of XD (D/O = 7.1; 88% XD form) yielded a single major product with an estimated molecular weight of 125,000 (band 5) and minor amounts of a 44,000 fragment (band 6). Trypsin cleavage of either isozyme of XOR generated a single 125-kDa fragment (Fig. 1B, bands 7 and 8). In agreement with earlier studies (6Amaya Y. Yamazaki K-I. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) neither chymotrypsin nor trypsin digestion affected total XOR activity or altered the apparent molecular weights of the isozymes (data not shown). The identities of the cleavage sites were determined by N-terminal sequencing and comparing the experimentally determined sequences to the deduced sequence of bovine XD cDNA (7Bergland L. Rasmussen J.T. Andersen M.D. Rasmussen M.S. Petersen T.E. J. Dairy Sci. 1996; 79: 198-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Table I shows the sequences of the first 7 amino acids of the major XD and XO cleavage products, the position of these sequences within the enzyme, and the corresponding cleavage site. The N-terminal sequences of the 125-kDa fragments (bands 7 and 8) generated by trypsin digestion of XD or XO correspond to Lys185–Leu191 and are consistent with cleavage of both enzyme forms at Lys184. The sequence of the 125-kDa fragment (band 5) generated by chymotrypsin digestion of XD corresponds to Asn182–Thr188 and is consistent with cleavage at Met181. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of bovine XD the calculated molecular mass values for peptide fragments from Asn182 to Val1331 (the C terminus of bovine XD) and Lys185–Val1331 are 127,225 and 126,854 kDa, respectively (28Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These values are in good agreement with SDS-PAGE size estimates (∼125 kDa) for the major fragments generated by trypsin digestion of XD or XO and chymotrypsin digestion of XD, and indicate that these fragments contain the C terminus of XOR.Table IIdentification of trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage sitesEnzyme formProteaseFragment sizeN-terminal sequenceCorresponding position in XORCleavage positionXOTrypsin125 kDa (Band 7)KDHTVTLLys185-Leu191 Lys185XOChymotrypsin85 kDa (Band 1)QEVPNGQGln561-Gln567 Phe560XOChymotrypsin64 kDa (Band 2)TADELVFFThr2-Phe9 NAXOChymotrypsin44 kDa (Band 3)NQKKDHTAsn182-Thr188 Met181XDTrypsin125 kDa (Band 8)KDHTVTLLys185-Leu191 Lys184XDChymotrypsin125 kDa (Band 5)NQKKDHTAsn182-Thr188 Met181 Open table in a new tab The N-terminal sequence of the 85-kDa fragment (band 1) generated by chymotrypsin digestion of XO corresponds to Gln561–Gln567 and is consistent with cleavage at Phe560. The sequence of the 64-kDa fragment (band 2) corresponds to the N terminus of purified XOR (Thr2–Phe7). The sizes of the 64- and 85-kDa fragments by SDS-PAGE agree reasonably well with the predicted molecular masses of the N-terminal (Thr2-Phe560; 61,678 daltons) and C-terminal (Gln561–Val1331; 84,829 daltons) peptide fragments generated by cleavage at Phe560. These results suggest that the 64- and 85-kDa fragments are primary products of chymotrypsin digestion of XO. The sequence of the first 7 amino acids of the 44-kDa fragment (band 3) corresponds to Asn182–Thr188 and is consistent with cleavage at Met181. The size of this fragment agrees with that predicted for a peptide fragment from Asn182 to Phe560 (42,413 daltons) and suggests that the 44-kDa fragment is generated by cleavage of the 64-kDa fragment at Met181. Hydropathy analysis (28Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (512) Google Scholar) of the amino acid sequences surrounding the cleavage sites (Fig.2) shows that Met181 and Lys184 lie in a hydrophilic region, while Phe560 is in a relatively hydrophobic region of XOR. These results demonstrate that native XD and XO possess distinct solution conformations characterized, in part, by exposure of a hydrophobic region containing Phe560 in the XO form. To determine whether the conformational differences in XD and XO represented global changes in their conformations we investigated their hydrodynamic properties by size exclusion chromatography. Fig.3 shows the elution properties of XD (D/O = 6.2) and XO (D/O < 0.1) during HPLC-SEC at pH 7.5. Both forms of the enzyme eluted as single peaks (the small amount of absorbance at later retention times in the XD sample is due to DTT used to prepare XD) and appeared to be homogenous in composition. However, the average retention time of XO (17.52 ± 0.11 min;n = 6) was longer than that of XD (17.13 ± 0.07 min; n = 5). These results indicate that disulfide bond reduction leads to a significant change in the frictional coefficient of XOR and is consistent with an increase in the hydrodynamic volume of the enzyme. The nature of the disulfide bonds within XO was investigated by two-dimensional peptide mapping of chymotrypsin-digested XO under nonreduced and reduced conditions. A representative two-dimensional peptide map of chymotrypsin-digested XO is shown in Fig. 4A. The digested enzyme was denatured in SDS in the absence of reducing agents and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (first dimension) and reducing (second dimension) conditions. In addition to residual intact XO at 145 kDa, prominent bands at 85, 64, and 44 kDa were observed to lie on the diagonal indicated by arrowheads. Additional bands were also observed to the right of the diagonal at 64 and 44 kDa. The lack of significant staining to the left of the diagonal indicates that there are few, if any, disulfide bridges between undigested XO subunits or between the 85-, 64-, and 44-kDa fragments generated by chymotrypsin digestion. The presence of groups of bands spreading horizontally to the right of the 64- and 44-kDa bands indicates the existence of electrophoretic heterogeneity within these fragments. Since the first dimension was carried out in SDS under nonreducing conditions and fragments within each group have the same size, this observation suggests that this heterogeneity is due to disulfide bond-mediated conformational differences within these fragments. To verify that the electrophoretic heterogeneity within the 64- and 44-kDa fragments is the result of disulfide bonding, XO was first digested with chymotrypsin and then incubated with 5 mm DTT prior to two-dimensional peptide mapping. Fig. 4B shows that under these conditions the 85-, 64-, and 44-kDa fragments appear as tight bands on the diagonal (arrowheads), and there is no evidence of electrophoretic heterogeneity associated with these fragments. To determine whether a conformational switch is required for the conversion of XO to XD we investigate the effects of cross-linking on the conversion process. Table II shows the effects of cross-linking XO with the amine-specific reagent BS3 on the ability of DTT to convert XO to XD as indicated by an increase in the D/O ratio. The initial D/O values of cross-linked and non-cross-linked (control) enzyme were <0.1. After incubating with 10 mm DTT for 2 h the D/O of control XO increased to nearly 4, whereas the D/O value of the cross-linked enzyme was still less than 0.1. BS3 did not react with cysteine thiols or interfere with the ability of DTT to reduce XO cysteine thiols (data not shown). Moreover it did not interfere with the XD activity of enzyme that was reduced prior to adding cross-linking reagent (Table II). Thus, the inability of DTT to convert BS3 cross-linked XO to XD does not appear to be due to a specific interference of BS3 with XD enzymatic activity or its reaction with cysteine thiols.Table IIThe effect of cross-linking on the conversion of XO to XD by DTTTreatmentRate (−) NAD (A295 × 1000/min)Rate (+) NAD (A295 × 1000/min)D/ODTT reduced XO5.5273.9BS3 x-linked XO reduced with DTT1011.3<0.1DTT reduced XO X-linked with BS31.510.96.2 Open table in a new tab The nature of the BS3 cross-linked enzyme was characterized by HPLC-SEC and SDS-PAGE. The majority of the cross-linked enzyme eluted with the same retention time as native XO (Fig.5). SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-linked XO (Fig. 5, inset) showed that it was composed of bands between 180 and 200 kDa as well as bands near the top of the gel and at ∼150 kDa. The results demonstrate that cross-linking primarily occurs within, and/or between, individual XO subunits and that there is relatively little cross-linking between enzyme molecules or formation of large cross-linked enzyme aggregates. Therefore, cross-linking also does not appear to influence the assembly state of the enzyme. Together these results suggest that cross-linking with BS3 prevents a conformational change that is necessary for the reductive conversion of XO to XD. Since exposure of the region containing Phe560 is a distinct feature of the XO conformation we tested the possibility that alterations to this region by proteolytic cleavage would interfere with conversion to XD by thiol reduction. Fig.6 shows the effects of trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion on the ability of DTT to convert XO to XD (Fig.6A) and on the conversion of XD to XO (Fig. 6B). XO digested with trypsin for up to 2 h could still be converted to XD by incubation with 5 mm DTT for 1 h; however, digestion with chymotrypsin for as little as 30 min completely prevented conversion. In contrast, neither chymotrypsin nor trypsin digestion led to significant conversion of XD to XO. Since chymotrypsin and trypsin cleave XO and XD at proximal sites (Met181 and Lys184, respectively) within their N-terminal regions it is unlikely that cleavage within this region is responsible for the failure of DTT to convert chymotrypsin-cleaved XO to XD. Conversely, the selective cleavage at XO at Phe560 by chymotrypsin suggests that structural alterations within this region are responsible for the inability of XO to be converted to XD by DTT reduction. It is well established that mammalian XOR can be reversibly converted from an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase to an O2-dependent oxidase by oxidation of cysteine thiols to disulfide bonds (11Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the conversion of XD to XO involves a global conformational change that is coupled to a reduction in the apparent hydrodynamic size of XOR. The conformational change was mapped to a specific region surrounding Phe560 and was shown to be a necessary step in the conversion process. Although the specific activities of our preparations indicate that 30–50% of the purified enzyme is catalytically inactive (2Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, XII. Third Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar), evidence from the literature and from the present studies suggests that active and inactive XOR molecules possess similar structures and undergo equivalent conformational changes. First, catalytically inactive forms are present in many highly purified and physically homogenous XOR preparations (2Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, XII. Third Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar). The inactive forms appear to result from specific alterations of the molybdopterin cofactor (2Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, XII. Third Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar) and not from alterations in the structural properties of the protein. Second, the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic properties of our purified XOR preparations demonstrate that the enzyme is intact and is composed of a relatively homogenous population of molecules. Size exclusion chromatography of the XD and XO isoforms also indicates that there is a uniform response to thiol reduction of XO. Third, the precise proteolytic patterns observed for both the XD and XO isoforms indicate that within a given isoform population the overall conformations are relatively homogenous. The limited and highly selective cleavage of XD and XO by trypsin and chymotrypsin is consistent with previous proteolysis studies of rat and bovine XOR (6Amaya Y. Yamazaki K-I. Sato M. Noda K.

https://openalex.org/W1986532077,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a sulfated polysaccharide present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. Accumulating evidence shows that HS plays key roles in many biological systems by interacting with various proteins in a structural-specific manner. Due to technical difficulties, however, the understanding of critical functional groups on HS for protein interaction is vague. We report a rapid, convenient, sensitive, and inexpensive strategy using in vitro modification with pure enzymes and gel mobility shift assay to study the subject. We demonstrated the requirements of 3-O, 6-O sulfates and the minimal length of oligosaccharide for antithrombin III (AT-III) binding. We regenerated the binding sites for AT-III on completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin and revealed the critical modification enzymes. This new strategy could be used to identify critical functional groups on HS and to generate HS library and biologically active HS, providing information applicable to the design of HS drugs, such as anticoagulant reagents and viral infection blockers. The binding assay with fibroblast growth factors and receptors confirmed the general usefulness of this approach."

A sialic acid-dependent binding of H. pylori to large complex glycosphingolipids (polyglycosylceramides) has also been documented (13Miller-Podraza H. Abul Milh M. Bergström J. Karlsson K.-A. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, only one H. pylori adhesin, the Leb binding BabA adhesin, has been identified to date (14Ilver D. Arnqvist A.

In the present study a number of different H. pylori strains were labeled with [35S]methionine and examined for binding to a panel of different naturally occurring glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer plates. Two distinct binding specificities were repeatedly detected by autoradiography. As previously described in detail, H. pylori bound to lactosylceramide, gangliotriaosylceramide, and gangliotetraosylceramide (12Ångström J. Teneberg S. Abul Milh M. Larsson T. Leonardsson I.

The only binding activity initially detected in human gastrointestinal material was to a compound in the tetraglycosylceramide region of the non-acid fraction of human meconium. The isolation and structural characterization of this H. pylori binding glycosphingolipid and the identification of the same compound in human gastric epithelial cells are described in the present paper. The bacteria used and their sources are described in Table I. In most of the experiments four strains, the type strains CCUG 17874 and 17875 (obtained from Culture Collection, University of Göteborg, (CCUG), Sweden, and the clinical isolates S-002, and S-032, were used in parallel.Table IHelicobacter pylori isolates used in binding assaysBacterial strainsI. 15816, 17135, 17874, 17875, 18430, 18943, 20649, 30985, 30986, 30988, 30990, 30991, 30993, 41936II.

Chemical detection was accomplished by anisaldehyde (15Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar). The chromatogram binding assays were done as described (16Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Strömberg N. Thurin J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (20–80 μg/lane) or pure compounds (1–4 μg/lane) were separated on aluminum-backed silica gel plates. The dried chromatograms were soaked for 1 min in diethyl ether/n-hexane (1:5, by volume) containing 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutylmethacrylate (Aldrich). After drying, the chromatograms were coated to block unspecific binding sites. Initially different coating conditions were tested,e.g. 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (w/v) in PBS (Solution 1), 2% gelatin (w/v) in PBS (Solution 2), 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS (Solution 3), 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 in PBS (Solution 4), or 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.2% (w/v) deoxycholic acid in PBS (Solution 5). The most consistent results were obtained with Solution 4, which subsequently was used as the standard condition. Coating was done for 2 h at room temperature. Thereafter, a suspension of 35S-labeled bacteria (diluted in PBS to 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml and 1–5 × 106 cpm/ml) was gently sprinkled over the chromatograms and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing six times with PBS and drying, the thin-layer plates were autoradiographed for 3–120 h using XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions from the sources given in the legend of Fig. 1 and in Table III were obtained by standard procedures (17Karlsson K.-A.

The individual glycosphingolipids were isolated by acetylation of the total glycosphingolipid fractions and repeated chromatography on silicic acid columns. The identity of the purified glycosphingolipids was confirmed by mass spectrometry (18Samuelsson B.E. Pimlott W. Karlsson K.-A.

Open table in a new tab A total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction (262 mg) was obtained from 17 pooled meconia by standard methods (17Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The non-acid glycosphingolipids (240 mg) were first separated by HPLC on a 2.2 × 30-cm silica column (YMC SH-044–10, 10 μm particles; Skandinaviska Genetec, Kungsbacka, Sweden) eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/water 65:25:4 to 40:40:12 (by volume) for 180 min and with a flow of 2 ml/min. Aliquots of each 2-ml fraction were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, and the fractions positive for anisaldehyde staining were further tested for binding of H. pylori using the chromatogram binding assay. The H. pylori binding fractions were collected in tubes 78–88, and after pooling of these fractions, 14.2 mg were obtained. This material was acetylated and further separated by HPLC on a YMC SH-044-10 column eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol (95:5, by volume) in chloroform for 90 min and with a flow of 2 ml/min. After deacetylation, aliquots from each 1-ml fraction were analyzed by anisaldehyde staining on thin-layer chromatograms, and the glycosphingolipid-containing fractions were examined for H. pylori binding activity. Most of the H. pylori binding glycosphingolipid was collected in tube 62, and this fraction (2.4 mg) was used for structural characterization. Stomach tissue (10 × 10-cm pieces) were obtained from the fundus region from patients undergoing elective surgery for morbid obesity. After washing with 0.9% NaCl (w/v), the mucosal cells were gently scraped off and kept at −70 °C. The material was lyophilized, and acid and non-acid glycosphingolipids were isolated as described (17Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In two cases glycosphingolipids were also isolated from the non-mucosal residues.

Open table in a new tab The non-acid glycosphingolipids from case 4 (2.9 mg) were separated by HPLC on a 1.0 × 25-cm silica column (Kromasil-Sil, 10-μm particles, Skandinaviska Genetec) using a gradient of chloroform/methanol/water 65:25:4 to 40:40:12 (by volume) over 180 min with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Aliquots from each fraction were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using anisaldehyde as the staining reagent. The tetraglycosylceramides were collected in tubes 12–17. Tubes 12–14 also contained a compound with mobility in the triglycosylceramide region on thin-layer chromatograms and, after pooling of these three fractions, 0.2 mg was obtained (designated fraction 4-I). The fractions in tubes 15–17 were pooled separately, giving 0.5 mg of tetraglycosylceramides (designated fraction 4-II). Separation of 10.0 mg of the non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction from case 5 was done using the same system as above, with a gradient of chloroform/methanol/water 60:35:8 to 40:40:12 (by volume). The fraction collected in tube 11 (designated fraction 5-I) contained triglycosylceramides and tetraglycosylceramides (0.1 mg), whereas only tetraglycosylceramides were obtained in tube 12 and 13. Pooling of the latter two fractions resulted in 0.3 mg (designated fraction 5-II). Before mass spectrometry, the glycosphingolipids were permethylated, as described (22Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The tetraglycosylceramide isolated from human meconium was analyzed on a VG ZAB 2F/HF mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) using the in-beam technique (23Breimer M. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Leffler H. Pascher I. Pimlott W. Samuelsson B.E. Quayle A. Advances in Mass Spectrometry. 8. Heyden & Son, London1980: 1097-1108Google Scholar). Analytical conditions were electron energy 45 eV, trap current 500 μA, and acceleration voltage 8 kV. Starting at 250 °C, the temperature was elevated by 6 °C/min. The tetraglycosylceramides from the mucosal cells of human stomach were analyzed by the same technique on a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Analytical conditions were electron energy 70 eV, trap current 300 μA, and acceleration voltage 10 kV. The temperature was raised by 15 °C/min, starting at 150 °C. The permethylated glycosphingolipid from human meconium was hydrolyzed, reduced, and acetylated (20Yang H. Hakomori S.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1192-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stellner K. Saito H. Hakomori S.-i. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), and the partially methylated alditol and hexosaminitol acetates obtained were analyzed by gas chromatography-EI mass spectrometry on a Trio-2 quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Masslab, Altrincham, UK). The Hewlett Packard 5890A gas chromatograph was equipped with an on-column injector and a 15 m × 0.25-mm fused silica capillary column, DB-5 (J&W Scientific, Ranco Cordova, CA), with 0.25-μm film thickness. The samples were injected on-column at 70 °C (1 min), and the oven temperature was increased from 70 to 170 °C at 50 °C/min and from 170 °C to 260 °C at 8 °C/min. Conditions for mass spectrometry were electron energy 40 eV and trap current 200 μA. The components were identified by comparison of retention times and mass spectra of partially methylated alditol acetates obtained from reference glycosphingolipids. Proton NMR spectra were acquired at 7.05 Tesla (300 MHz) on a Varian VXR 300 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and at 11.75 Tesla (500 MHz) on a JEOL Alpha-500 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Data were processed off-line using NMR1 (NMRi, Syracuse, NY). The deuterium-exchanged glycosphingolipid fractions were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6/D2O (98:2, by volume), and spectra were recorded at 30 °C with a 0.4-Hz digital resolution. Chemical shifts are given relative to tetramethylsilane. The procedure of Hansson et al.(24Hansson G.C., Li, Y.-T. Karlsson H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6672-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for the enzymatic hydrolysis. Briefly, 100 μg of fraction 4-II from case 4, fraction 5-II from case 5, reference globoside from human erythrocytes (25Hakomori S.-i. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S.-i. Sphingolipid Biochemistry. 3. Plenum Press, New York1983: 1-165Crossref Google Scholar), reference lactotetraosylceramide from human meconium, and reference lactoneotetraosylceramide (obtained by sialidase treatment of sialyl-lactoneotetraosylceramide from human erythrocytes; Ref. 26Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Res. Methods Neurochem. 1978; 4: 371-410Crossref Google Scholar) were dissolved in 100 μl of 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 120 μg sodium cholate and sonicated briefly. Thereafter, 1 milliunit of ceramide glycanase from the leech,Macrobdella decora (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol/water to the final proportions 8:4:3 (by volume). The oligosaccharide-containing upper phase thus obtained was separated from ceramides and detergent on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The eluant containing the oligosaccharides was dried under nitrogen and under vacuum and thereafter permethylated as described (22Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The analytical conditions were essentially the same as described in Karlsson et al. (27Karlsson H. Karlsson N. Hansson G.C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1994; 1: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Capillary gas chromatography was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890A gas chromatograph using a fused silica column (10 m x 0.25-mm internal diameter) coated with 0.03 μm of cross-linked PS 264 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and with hydrogen as carrier gas. The permethylated oligosaccharides were dissolved in ethyl acetate, and 1 μl of sample was injected on-column at 70 °C (1 min). A two-step temperature program was used, 70 °C to 200 °C at 50 °C/min followed by 10 °C/min up to 350 °C. Gas Chromatography-EI mass spectrometry was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890-II gas chromatograph coupled to a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer. The chromatographic conditions as well as the capillary column were the same as for the analyses by gas chromatography, and the conditions for mass spectrometry were interface temperature 350 °C, ion source temperature 330 °C, electron energy 70 eV, trap current 300 μA, and acceleration voltage 10 kV. As a test for possible inhibition of binding by soluble sugars35S-labeled H. pylori strains S-002 and S-032 were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml) of lactotetraose (Accurate Chem. and Sci. Corp., Westbury, NY) or lactose (J. T. Baker Inc.) in PBS. Thereafter the chromatogram binding assay was performed as described above. Minimum energy conformations of the various glycosphingolipids listed in Table III were calculated within the Biograf molecular modeling program (Molecular Simulations Inc., Waltham, MA) using the Dreiding-II force field (28Mayo S.L. Olafson B.D. Goddard III, W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8897-8909Crossref Scopus (5285) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics4D/35TG work station. Charges were generated using the charge equilibration method (29Rappé A.K. Goddard III, W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 95: 3358-3363Crossref Scopus (2741) Google Scholar), and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 3.5 was used for the Coulomb interactions. In addition, a special hydrogen bonding term was used in which Dhb was set to −4 kcal/mol (28Mayo S.L. Olafson B.D. Goddard III, W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8897-8909Crossref Scopus (5285) Google Scholar). A number of well characterized glycosphingolipid mixtures representing a large variety of carbohydrate sequences were separated by thin-layer chromatography. One chromatogram was stained with anisaldehyde, and duplicate chromatograms were used for binding of35S-labeled H. pylori. By subsequent autoradiography only a few bands were visualized, as shown in Fig. 1 B. The binding in lane 4 (gangliotriaosylceramide) and lane 7(gangliotetraosylceramide) was judged to correspond to the “ganglio binding specificity” of H. pylori described previously in detail (12Ångström J. Teneberg S. Abul Milh M. Larsson T. Leonardsson I. Olsson B.-M. Ölwegård Halvarsson M. Danielsson D. Näslund I. Ljungh Å. Wadström T. Karlsson K.-A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, selective binding of H. pylori to a compound migrating in the tetraglycosylceramide region in the non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction of human meconium was detected (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). This binding was only obtained when detergent (Tween 20 or deoxycholic acid) was present in the coating buffer. Solution 4 (2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) was therefore subsequently utilized as standard coating procedure. The binding-active tetraglycosylceramide from human meconium was isolated by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry, proton NMR, and gas chromatography-EI mass spectrometry after degradation as follows. The binding-active tetraglycosylceramide was is"
https://openalex.org/W2036367556,"Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis. Self-glucosylation leads to the formation of an oligosaccharide chain, which, when long enough, supports the action of glycogen synthase to elongate it and form a mature glycogen molecule. To identify possible regulators of glycogenin, the yeast two-hybrid strategy was employed. By using rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin as a bait, cDNAs encoding three different proteins were isolated from the human skeletal muscle cDNA library. Two of the cDNAs encoded glycogenin and glycogen synthase, respectively, proteins known to be interactors. The third cDNA encoded a polypeptide of unknown function and was designated GNIP (glycogenininteractingprotein). Northern blot analysis revealed that GNIP mRNA is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. The gene for GNIP generates at least four isoforms by alternative splicing. The largest isoform GNIP1 contains, from NH2- to COOH-terminal, a RING finger, a B box, a putative coiled-coil region, and a B30.2-like motif. The previously identified protein TRIM7 (tripartitemotif containing protein 7) is also derived from the GNIP gene and is composed of the RING finger, B box, and coiled-coil regions. The GNIP2 and GNIP3 isoforms consist of the coiled-coil region and B30.2-like domain. Physical interaction between GNIP2 and glycogenin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, and in addition GNIP2 was shown to stimulate glycogenin self-glucosylation 3–4-fold. GNIPs may represent a novel participant in the initiation of glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis.

The previously identified protein TRIM7 (tripartitemotif containing protein 7) is also derived from the GNIP gene and is composed of the RING finger, B box, and coiled-coil regions. The GNIP2 and GNIP3 isoforms consist of the coiled-coil region and B30.2-like domain. Physical interaction between GNIP2 and glycogenin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, and in addition GNIP2 was shown to stimulate glycogenin self-glucosylation 3–4-fold. GNIPs may represent a novel participant in the initiation of glycogen synthesis. The biosynthesis of glycogen involves two distinguishable stages. The initiation step involves the formation of a glycoprotein primer, by self-glucosylation of glycogenin to form a covalently linked oligosaccharide. Elongation involves the bulk synthesis of glycogen through the reactions catalyzed by glycogen synthase and branching enzyme (for reviews see Refs. 1Alonso M.D. Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of the most important properties of glycogenin is its ability to self-glucosylate, using UDP-glucose as a glucose donor (6Mu J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27589-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Pitcher J. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In rabbit glycogenin-1, self-glucosylation results in the formation of a C-1-O-tyrosyl linkage between glucose and Tyr194(8Rodrigues I.R. Whelan W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Smythe C. Caudwell F.B. Ferguson M. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2681-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Self-glucosylation continues with the formation of α-1,4-glycosidic linkages, until a chain of 8–12 residues has formed. This form of glycogenin serves as a substrate for glycogen synthase (1Alonso M.D. Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Smythe C.

Several lines of evidence suggest an important role of protein-protein interactions for the function of glycogenin. First, glycogenin is capable of forming dimers (10Smythe C. Watt P. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Lin A., Mu, J. Yang J. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), resulting in self-glucosylation via an inter-subunit mechanism (12Lin A., Mu, J. Yang J. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Alonso M.D. Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15315-15319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was proposed that interaction between subunits of glycogenin is relatively weak (12Lin A., Mu, J. Yang J. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, there are protein-protein interactions between glycogenin and glycogen synthase. For example, glycogenin co-purified with glycogen synthase from rabbit skeletal muscle in a stoichiometric 1:1 complex, indicating a relatively strong interaction (7Pitcher J. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, two-hybrid analysis revealed the interaction between yeast glycogenin, Glg2p, and yeast glycogen synthase, Gsy2p (14Cheng C., Mu, J. Farkas I. Huang D. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6632-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Third, protein-protein interactions may be involved in the subcellular distribution of glycogen. For example, glycogenin expressed in mammalian cells as a green fluorescent fusion protein was partly co-localized with actin (15Baque S. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding to actin is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal part of glycogenin. Additionally, glycogenin was found in the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus (15Baque S. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Miozzo M.C. Maldonado C. Curtino J.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar, 17Skurat A.V. Lim S.S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In order to identify other proteins that interact with glycogenin, we used the yeast two-hybrid system with rabbit glycogenin-1 as bait. We identified an as yet undescribed protein, which we named glycogenin-interacting protein (GNIP), 1The abbreviations used are: GNIPglycogenin-interacting proteinRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsUTRuntranslated regionORFopen reading frame that activates glycogenin in vitro. glycogenin-interacting protein rapid amplification of cDNA ends untranslated region open reading frame The cDNA for rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin was generated by cutting pET15b-GN (11Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with NdeI, blunting with Klenow fragment, and subsequent digestion with SalI. The cDNA was ligated into pGBDU-C2 (18James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was cut with EcoRI, blunted, and digested with SalI. The resulting plasmid, which contains the glycogenin coding sequence in-frame with the DNA binding domain of Gal4p, was designated pGBDU-GN. The plasmid containing a cDNA fragment for GNIP, GNIPt-h, flanked by EcoRI-NotI-SalI adapter sequences (pGAD-GNIPt-h) was isolated from the two-hybrid library and used to create several GNIPt-h expression vectors. To construct pET28-GNIPt-h, pGAD-GNIPt-h was digested with NotI and blunt-ended, and the 1.6-kb fragment encoding GNIPt-h was ligated into pET28a (Novagen), which had been previously cut with NheI and blunt-ended. To construct pFLAG-GNIPt-h, pGAD-GNIPt-h was digested with NotI, and the 1.6-kb fragment was inserted into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma), which was digested with NotI. To construct the vectors expressing GNIP1, the 0.4-kb fragment encoding the 5′ end of GNIP1 was generated by BglII and NotI digestion of DNA from EST clone AI 492496 (Fig. 1). The middle fragment of GNIP1 was amplified from a human skeletal muscle library by PCR using GNIP1- and library adapter-specific primers, as described below. This PCR product was digested with NotI and EcoRI to generate a 0.5-kb fragment. Both the 0.4- and 0.5-kb fragments were ligated with BglII- and EcoRI-cut pET32a to construct pET32-GNIP-N. The 1.2-kb fragment encoding the 3′-terminal part of GNIP1 was obtained by digestion of pGAD-GNIPt-h with EcoRI and SalI. The 1.2-kb fragment was ligated into EcoRI- and SalI-cut pET32-GNIP-N to produce pET32-GNIP1. To construct pGADT7-GNIP1, pET32-GNIP1 was digested with BglII and XhoI, and the 2.1 fragment was inserted into BamHI- and XhoI-cut pGADT7 (CLONTECH). To generate GNIP2, the 0.3-kb fragment of GNIP2 encoding amino acid residues from Met1 to Glu98 and carrying an NdeI site at the 5′ end was generated by PCR. This product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI to produce the 0.2-kb fragment. The 1.2-kb fragment encoding the 3′-terminal part of GNIP2 was obtained by digestion of pGAD-GNIPt-h with EcoRI and XhoI. Both the 0.2-kb and the 1.2-kb fragments were ligated with NdeI- and XhoI-cut pGADT7 to construct pGADT7-GNIP2. To construct pET28-GNIP2, pGADT7-GNIP2 was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and the 0.2-kb fragment was used to substitute the 0.3-kb NdeI/EcoRI fragment in pET28-GNIPt-h. The yeast strain PJ69-4A (18James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was sequentially transformed with pGBDU-GN and the human skeletal muscle matchmaker cDNA library in pGAD10 plasmid (CLONTECH) using the lithium-acetate method. The transformants were plated on synthetic medium lacking uracil, leucine, and adenine. Colonies were picked from 4 to 12 days and re-plated on the second generation plates with synthetic medium deficient in uracil, leucine, and histidine. Library plasmids from the second generation colonies were rescued into Escherichia coli RRI cells plated on M9 medium lacking leucine and were analyzed by yeast two-hybrid tests and DNA sequencing. The purified pGAD plasmids were retransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying pGBDU-GN, and quantitative β-galactosidase solution assays (19Platt T. Muller-Hill B. Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Experiments in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) were performed. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a32P-labeled 1.6-kb GNIP fragment excised from pGAD-GNIPt-h by NotI digestion. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) prepared from human skeletal muscle was used as template for 5′-RACE. Two sets of nested primers were designed to extend from exon six: SAS14, CTTAAGATCCAGAGAGAGGATGAGG; SAS12, CTCAGAAGAGACTGTGGTTGGCTTG; and from exon eight: SAS19, ACATGTGACCTCAGGAAGGGAACACC; SAS20, CCTCAAGGCCAGATTCGCAAGTAGG. Two approaches were used to amplify and identify the 5′ end of GNIP1. In the first approach, the primary amplification was performed on 5 μl of cDNA template with 0.2 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol of adapter primer (AP1, CLONTECH), 10 pmol of the gene-specific primer (SAS14), 10× reaction buffer containing 15 mmMgCl2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 unit of Expand High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 50 μl. Hot start cycling conditions were used with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min followed by addition of the enzyme at 85 °C. This was followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 65 °C for 45 s and a final extension step 68 °C for 5 min. The last cycle was at 68 °C for 8 min. For secondary amplification, components and conditions were identical except that nested AP2 (CLONTECH) and gene-specific (SAS12) primers were used; 1 μl of the primary product was used as template and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min were performed. Cloning of amplified products was carried out using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified using Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Bio-Rad), and PCR products were identified by automated DNA sequencing. By using this protocol, the 5′ end of original two-hybrid clone (GNIPt-h) was extended (PCR 403, Fig. 1). Search of the human EST data base in GenBankTM using the sequence of clone PCR 403 as a query identified one EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AI 492496) with sequence that partially overlaps the sequence of clone PCR 5-61. This clone was obtained from the ATCC collection and analyzed by automated DNA sequencing. Combining the sequences from EST clone AI 492496, PCR 403 and GNIPt-h would generate a cDNA sequence for an isoform designated GNIP1 (GenBankTM accession number AF396651). The original two-hybrid clone, GNIPt-h, represents the 3′ fragment of GNIP1 (Fig. 1). The cDNA for GNIP1 was assembled in pET32a and pCMV-Tag-3B vectors using the BglII/NotI fragment of EST clone AI 492496, the NotI/EcoRI fragment of PCR 403, and the EcoRI/SalI fragment GNIPt-h (see above). Another clone identified in this screen, PCR GP9 (Fig. 1), has a 5′ end sequence that does not match the sequence of GNIP1. In this clone, two codons for methionine precede and are in-frame with the initiating ATG of GNIPt-h. At the 5′ end, clone PCR-GP9 contains a stop codon, which precedes and is in-frame with new ATG codons. This clone predicts the isoform designated GNIP3 (GenBankTM accession number AF396655). To confirm that the entire coding sequence for GNIP1 is present in human skeletal muscle, a second PCR approach was applied. In this method, the same template and nested primers SAS19/SAS20 were used with Advantage-GC 2 PCR Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol for amplification of DNA with target size <5 kb. The amplified products were inserted into the pCR4 Blunt-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) followed by transformation of One Shot TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The resulting clones were analyzed by colony hybridization using a 32P-labeled 0.4-kb BglII/NotI fragment from EST clone AI 492496 as a probe. Plasmid DNAs from positive clones were isolated, and the PCR fragments were analyzed by automated DNA sequencing. One of the clones (PCR 18, Fig. 1) contained the entire open reading frame for GNIP1. This new clone extends the 5′ end of cDNA for GNIP1 by 43 bp, as compared with the EST clone AI 492496, and contains a stop codon, in-frame with and preceding the initiating ATG codon. In another effort to extend the 5′ end of GNIP, 5′-RACE was performed on a human skeletal muscle 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) using GNIP-specific and λTriplEx-specific nested primers. The largest PCR fragments were selected for sequence analysis. Three clones, PCR38D, PCR38E, and PCR39H, have an identical 3′-terminal region that is indistinguishable from the corresponding sequence in GNIP1. However, sequences in the 5′ ends of these clones are different. All three clones contain in-frame stop codons preceding the initiating ATG codon. Despite differences in 5′-UTR sequences, these clones encode the same protein product, which was designated GNIP2. Later the sequences from the 5′ regions of three clones were found in the GNIP gene corresponding to the alternatively spliced gene transcripts GNIP2a (GenBankTM accession number AF396653), GNIP2b (GenBankTM accession number AF396652), and GNIP2c (GenBankTM accession number AF396654). These products include the sequences from clones PCR38D (GNIP2a), PCR38E (GNIP2b), and PCR39H (GNIP2c). The existence of three alternatively spliced mRNA products for GNIP2 was confirmed by sequencing of several clones obtained from human skeletal muscle Marathon-Ready cDNA as a result of 5′-RACE analysis. COS-M9 cells were transiently transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen protocol). Briefly, 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA per 6 μl of LipofectAMINE was used to transfect cells in a 35-mm dish. Cells were grown for 2 days and subsequently harvested. COS cells expressing the protein(s) of interest were homogenized in 0.2 ml of buffer B, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. The supernatants were isolated after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer B. The supernatants were subsequently incubated with antibodies and protein A-agarose in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, and proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatants, the pellet fractions, and the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Expression of His-tagged GNIP2 was performed in E.coli BL21/DE3 from the plasmid pET28-GNIP2. Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C until the A600reached 0.4 and then incubated at 18 °C for ∼20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended with lysis buffer (10 ml per 1 g of cell pellet) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 2 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μmleupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 20 mm imidazole. The cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 1,000 pounds/inch2. After centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the resin was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer, washed with lysis buffer containing 65 mm imidazole, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Fractions were collected and dialyzed against the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. NH2-terminally His-tagged rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin was expressed and purified as described previously (12Lin A., Mu, J. Yang J. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The assay measures the amount of [14C]glucose incorporated into glycogenin essentially as described previously (20Cao Y. Mahrenholtz A.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14687-14693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was typically carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MnCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 4.5% glycerol, and 38.5 μm UDP-[14C]glucose at 30 °C for 5 min or as indicated. Two methods were applied to quantitate glycogenin glucosylation. In one, aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto P81 chromatography paper which was washed three times with 5% phosphoric acid for 20 min each. The paper was dried and subjected to scintillation counting. In the second method, an aliquot was added to 0.25 volume of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To search for cDNA clones encoding proteins that interact with glycogenin-1, we fused the coding sequence for rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin with the Gal4p DNA binding domain and screened a human skeletal muscle library expressed from the pGAD-10 vector. From 3.1 × 106 transformants harboring bait and library cDNA, five clones were isolated representing three different cDNAs as judged by cDNA sequencing. One clone contained a 3.2-kb cDNA for glycogen synthase including 157 bp of the 5′-untranslated region (clone GN-11). Two clones contained a 1.5-kb cDNA for glycogenin-1 with 82 (clone GN-6) or 91 bp (clone GN-10) of 5′-untranslated region. The sizes of the isolated cDNAs exceed the lengths of coding regions for glycogen synthase and glycogenin indicating that both polypeptides are expressed in yeast as full-length proteins, with a segment of the fusion protein coded by the 5′-UTR. Two other clones contained identical 1.6-kb fragments encoding a 340-residue polypeptide of an unknown protein (clones GN-1 and GN-7). This protein was designated glycogenin-interacting protein (GNIP), and the entire protein sequence encoded by two-hybrid library plasmid was designated GNIPt-h (see Fig. 1). To confirm the interactions, the plasmids isolated from two-hybrid clones were introduced into yeast that had been pre-transformed with pGBDU-GN. The resulting transformants were able to express both ADE2 and HIS3 genes, which are under control of the GAL4 upstream-activating sequence in PJ69-4A yeast strain (data not shown). Based on quantitative β-galactosidase assays the interaction between GNIPt-h and glycogenin-1 was relatively strong compared with the interaction between glycogen synthase and glycogenin-1 (Fig. 2). The glycogenin-1 inter-subunit interaction was weak, in agreement with previous data (12Lin A., Mu, J. Yang J. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GNIPt-h interacts with human glycogenin-1 as judged by using ADE2, HIS3, and β-galactosidase expression as reporter genes (data not shown). To determine whether GNIP interacts with glycogenin in mammalian cells, we expressed NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged protein together with glycogenin in COSM9 cells. GNIPt-h was detected as a polypeptide of ∼39 kDa in both the soluble and the pellet fractions of the transfected cells (Fig. 3A). The soluble fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, FLAG-GNIPt-h protein was detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with FLAG-GNIPt-h or cells co-transfected with both FLAG-GNIPt-h and glycogenin. With a specific anti-glycogenin-1 antibody, glycogenin was only detected in immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with glycogenin and FLAG-GNIPt-h (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that the interaction between glycogenin and GNIP occurs in mammalian cells. The nucleotide sequence of the 1579-bp GNIPt-h insert predicted an open reading frame (ORF) encompassing nucleotides 1–1021, in-frame with the GAL-4 activation domain of pGAD-10. The ORF was followed by a TGA stop codon at nucleotides 1022–1024. Near the 5′ end, there was a putative ATG start codon at nucleotide 113. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF (bp 113–1021) encodes a protein of 303 amino acids with theoretical molecular mass of 34213 Da. GenBankTM searches of the protein data base using the BLASTP algorithm indicated several homologous proteins including butyrophylin, RET finger protein (RFP), pyrin/marenostrin (the Mediterranean fever protein), 52-kDa Ro/SSA autoantigen, and several RING finger and zinc finger proteins of unknown function. The homologous region was at the COOH terminus of these proteins and contained a B30.2-like domain (21Vernet C. Boretto J. Mattei M. Takashi M. Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. Rouquier S. Pontarotti P. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 37: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Analysis of the GNIPt-h protein sequence with the Simple Modular Research Tool (SMART) (22Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) indicated that 114 residues of COOH terminus contain a SPRY domain, which is a subdomain of the B30.2 region (23Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 24Sato M.H. Liu H.-L. C. Zajchowski D.A. Whitlow M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Toward the NH2terminus of GNIPt-h, the SMART program identified a stretch of 28 residues with the potential of forming an α-helical coiled-coil structure. The B30.2-like domain and coiled-coil region occur in some members of the protein family known as RBCC. Members of this family contain a tripartite motif of a RING finger, one or two B boxes, and a predicted coiled-coil domain (25Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 344-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Because we had not unequivocally identified the start codon, it was possible that the cloned GNIPt-h was not full length and that it lacked NH2-terminal sequence corresponding to the RING finger and B box domains. This hypothesis was initially supported by searching the human EST data base in GenBankTM where we found several EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AI139356, AI290319, and AI347404) containing sequences identical to 105 bp in the 5′-terminal region of the GNIPt-h cDNA, allowing us to extend the 5′ region of GNIPt-h. However, the extended region did not contain an in-frame ATG. From extensive 5′-RACE analyses, described in detail under “Experimental Procedures,” we were able to establish the existence of multiple GNIP transcripts that correspond to at least three different isoforms, which we designate GNIP1, GNIP2, and GNIP3. The cDNA for GNIP1, the longest isoform, encodes a 511-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 56,630 Da that contains, according to SMART analysis, an NH2-terminal RING finger domain followed by a B box domain in addition to the coiled-coil region and B30.2-like domain of the initial GNIPt-h clone (Fig. 4). GNIP2 is a truncated version of GNIP1, which lacks the NH2-terminal RING finger and B box domains. GNIP3 would have a unique NH2-terminal sequence, not present in GNIP1, and the COOH terminus that is identical in all three isoforms (Fig. 4). Note that we are predicting the GNIP3 transcript based only on amplification of the unique 5′ end and not the entire sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Also, we are assuming that the first ATG is the initiating codon, rather then one of two downstream ATGs. If the third ATG were the initiating codon, the product of translation would be the same as GNIP2. Searching GenBankTM with the GNIP1 protein sequence as query, we retrieved the sequence of the tripartite motif protein TRIM7 (GenBankTM accession number AF220032). The NH2-terminal 206 residues of TRIM7 are identical to the NH2 terminus of GNIP1 and contain RING finger and B box domains (Fig. 4). The COOH terminus of TRIM7 is short and contains 15 residues unique to TRIM7. From the mouse EST data bank, we identified three homologous mouse clones. Two of these EST clones were obtained from ATCC (GenBankTM accession numbers AA517788and AW012184) and sequenced. We found several sequencing errors in the published sequence of clone AA517788 and resubmitted the corrected 1,454-bp sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF396656). This sequence contains an ORF encoding a polypeptide of 303 residues, corresponding to GNIP2. The initiating ATG codon for the ORF is preceded by an in-frame stop codon suggesting that it corresponds to a full-length protein. The mouse GNIP2 is 93% identical to its human counterpart. The sequence of the second EST clone, AW012184, is identical to AF396656 only in the 3′ part that encodes GNIP2. The 5′ end of this clone is different and does not contain an in-frame terminating codon, suggesting that a larger isoform of mouse GNIP might exist. We identified a clone of 183 kb in the unfinished high throughput genomic sequences that contained matches to GNIP. The clone (GenBankTM accession number AC008620) is derived from chromosome 5. Later, we found the GNIP gene in contig NT 006854.3, a working draft sequence segment of human chromosome 5. Exon-intron boundaries were established by comparison of the genomic sequences with GNIP and TRIM7 cDNA sequences. All the exon-intron boundaries conformed to the expected GT and AG sequences (Table I). The gene for GNIP contains eight exons and seven introns (Fig. 5). The transcripts that we have identified can be explained by alternative splicing, by skipping exons,"

In this study, we examined the interactions of rat and human SP-D with the human pathogen, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Rat and human SP-D bound the organism with high affinity in a reaction that required Ca2+ and was inhibited by EGTA. Membranes derived from the organism bound the proteins in a similar manner, except the rat SP-D also exhibited a significant level of Ca2+-independent binding. Pretreatment of membranes with proteases did not alter the Ca2+-dependent SP-D binding of membranes by either protein. Mannose, glucose, maltose, and inositol, at millimolar concentrations, competed for human SP-D binding to the bacterial membrane. Lipids extracted from membranes and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography bound human SP-D with high affinity in a Ca2+-dependent reaction. A tandem mutant of SP-D with E321Q and N323D substitutions, failed to bind M. pneumoniae lipids, directly implicating the carbohydrate recognition domain in the interaction. The interaction of rat and human SP-D with M. pneumoniae was unaffected by the presence of surfactant lipids and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins. These findings demonstrate that M. pneumoniae is likely to be recognized by SP-D in the alveolar environment and that primary determinants recognized on the organism are lipid components of the cell membrane.

Our findings indicate that SP-D binds M. pneumoniae with high affinity and the principal ligands are lipids. Both the specificity and avidity of the SP-D binding indicate that microbial recognition by the protein is likely to occur in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the binding of SP-D to M. pneumoniae, a pathogen that accounts for 20–30% of all pneumonias, causes airway inflammation (32Krause D.C.

The actions of SP-D and the closely related SP-A are multifaceted and involve recognition of both pathogens and immune effector cells. The recognition of pathogens may cause aggregation and facilitate phagocytosis, or enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines (15Restrepo C.I. Dong Q. Savov J. Mariencheck W.I. Wright J.R.

The recognition of macrophages and other phagocytes by surfactant proteins can either enhance or depress the inflammatory response, depending both on the microbial agent and the state of activation of the immune cell (36Sano K. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomwra S.-I. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar, 37McIntosh J.C. Mervin-Blake S. Conner E. Wright J.R. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 274: L270-L277PubMed Google Scholar).This report provides clear evidence that the binding of SP-D to M. pneumoniae is a specific and high affinity interaction. Saturable binding of SP-D to the mycoplasma occurs at levels of the collectin that are well within the physiological range, estimated at 50–90 μg/ml (100–180 nm) (39Honda Y. Kuroki Y. Matsuura E. Nagae H. Takahashi H. Akino T. Abe S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd′ values for the rat and human proteins are in the range of 5–20 nm and the calculated binding sites are 2–3 × 103/cell. Several features of the binding reaction implicate the CRD of the protein in the attachment to the bacteria. The requirement for Ca2+ in collectin binding is a hallmark of CRD involvement. In addition, the binding of human SP-D to mycoplasma membranes is effectively inhibited by carbohydrates that are recognized by the protein. Finally, the loss of rat SP-D binding to intact cells occurs with the tandem mutation (E321Q/N323D) that confers loss of carbohydrate binding specificity. Our interpretation of these findings is that the CRD domain of SP-D primarily interacts with a glycoconjugate expressed on the surface of M. pneumoniae.Examination of the binding between intact M. pneumoniae and the collagen deletion mutant of rat SP-D also reveals additional important characteristics of the interaction. The ΔL27-P202 mutant lacks the entire collagen domain but still retains 50% of the binding found for the wild type protein. This indicates that the collagen domain is not required for the binding reaction. The loss of some of the binding is likely to be a consequence of the loss of higher order oligomerization of the protein, and consequent reduction of affinity. In previous work we have shown that the collagen deletion mutant behaves as a trimer in solution (23Ogasawara Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19052-19058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, mature wild type SP-D is a cruciform dodecamer. In principle, 2 trimeric CRDs of the wild type dodecamer can interact with a single surface. Since the collagen deletion mutant behaves as a single trimer, the avidity of binding will be reduced relative to the wild type protein. The N-linked oligosaccharide of SP-D is also located within the collagen domain (40Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently this post-translational modification is lost in the ΔL27-P202 mutant. Thus, the data also demonstrate that the oligosaccharide of SP-D is not essential for mycoplasma binding.We were able to simplify the binding assay by adapting the method for intact cells to membranes isolated from M. pneumoniae. For human SP-D, the binding characteristics between intact cells and solid phase membranes appear nearly identical. The binding of human SP-D was completely resistant to protease treatment of the membranes. Examination of the lipid components of the membranes demonstrated that essentially all of the human SP-D binding activity resided in this fraction. In addition, liposomes prepared from the lipid extract of mycoplasma were very effective inhibitors of human SP-D binding to solid phase membranes. In contrast to the mycoplasma lipids, the interaction between human SP-D and its mycoplasma membrane ligand is unaffected by the lipid components of pulmonary surfactant. This latter situation indicates that the lipids present in the alveolar environment are unlikely to interfere with human SP-D recognition of the microorganism. The lipids isolated from mycoplasma were further subfractionated to examine their interaction with human SP-D. After separating the lipid components of mycoplasma by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, we were able to show that the major ligands for SP-D comigrate with 3 prominent glycolipids with characteristics of di- and trihexosyldiacylglycerol. These finding are consistent with glycolipid components of M. pneumoniae functioning as the predominant bacterial receptors for SP-D. We are currently working to definitively identify the structures of these glycolipids.Analysis of the mycoplasma membrane binding by rat SP-D presents a more complicated picture of the interaction. Unlike the rat SP-D binding observed for the intact bacterial cells, the membranes exhibit both Ca2+-dependent and -independent interactions. The Ca2+-independent binding is also protease sensitive. Furthermore, in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of EGTA, rat SP-D shows specific binding to a 20-kDa protein present in mycoplasma membranes. Our interpretation of this data is that the Ca2+-independent ligand for rat SP-D is unavailable in the intact cell, but becomes accessible in the membrane preparation. We favor an explanation in which the ligand is restricted to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane and (subsequently becomes accessible to SP-D when membranes are prepared). The access of rat SP-D to both sides of the bilayer could occur as a consequence of the bacterial membranes forming either randomly oriented vesicles or open sheets. As described in earlier parts of the “Discussion,” the Ca2+ dependent binding activity for rat SP-D has all the properties of a lipid glycoconjugate expressed on the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane. The utility of the recognition by rat SP-D, of exposed and cryptic ligands present in M. pneumoniae is not clear at present. It is possible that the recognition of multiple classes of ligands by rat SP-D confers greater resistance to the organism than that exhibited in humans.In summary, our findings demonstrate high affinity interactions between SP-D and M. pneumoniae. The properties of the binding reaction implicate the CRD as the protein domain that interacts with the organism. Glycolipids constitute a major class of microbial ligand that interacts with the protein. Together these findings identify SP-D as an important component of host recognition of this significant human pathogen.

The recognition of macrophages and other phagocytes by surfactant proteins can either enhance or depress the inflammatory response, depending both on the microbial agent and the state of activation of the immune cell (36Sano K.

Saturable binding of SP-D to the mycoplasma occurs at levels of the collectin that are well within the physiological range, estimated at 50–90 μg/ml (100–180 nm) (39Honda Y. Kuroki Y. Matsuura E. Nagae H. Takahashi H. Akino T. Abe S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd′ values for the rat and human proteins are in the range of 5–20 nm and the calculated binding sites are 2–3 × 103/cell. Several features of the binding reaction implicate the CRD of the protein in the attachment to the bacteria. The requirement for Ca2+ in collectin binding is a hallmark of CRD involvement. In addition, the binding of human SP-D to mycoplasma membranes is effectively inhibited by carbohydrates that are recognized by the protein. Finally, the loss of rat SP-D binding to intact cells occurs with the tandem mutation (E321Q/N323D) that confers loss of carbohydrate binding specificity. Our interpretation of these findings is that the CRD domain of SP-D primarily interacts with a glycoconjugate expressed on the surface of M. pneumoniae.Examination of the binding between intact M. pneumoniae and the collagen deletion mutant of rat SP-D also reveals additional important characteristics of the interaction. The ΔL27-P202 mutant lacks the entire collagen domain but still retains 50% of the binding found for the wild type protein. This indicates that the collagen domain is not required for the binding reaction. The loss of some of the binding is likely to be a consequence of the loss of higher order oligomerization of the protein, and consequent reduction of affinity. In previous work we have shown that the collagen deletion mutant behaves as a trimer in solution (23Ogasawara Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19052-19058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, mature wild type SP-D is a cruciform dodecamer. In principle, 2 trimeric CRDs of the wild type dodecamer can interact with a single surface. Since the collagen deletion mutant behaves as a single trimer, the avidity of binding will be reduced relative to the wild type protein. The N-linked oligosaccharide of SP-D is also located within the collagen domain (40Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently this post-translational modification is lost in the ΔL27-P202 mutant. Thus, the data also demonstrate that the oligosaccharide of SP-D is not essential for mycoplasma binding.We were able to simplify the binding assay by adapting the method for intact cells to membranes isolated from M. pneumoniae. For human SP-D, the binding characteristics between intact cells and solid phase membranes appear nearly identical. The binding of human SP-D was completely resistant to protease treatment of the membranes. Examination of the lipid components of the membranes demonstrated that essentially all of the human SP-D binding activity resided in this fraction. In addition, liposomes prepared from the lipid extract of mycoplasma were very effective inhibitors of human SP-D binding to solid phase membranes. In contrast to the mycoplasma lipids, the interaction between human SP-D and its mycoplasma membrane ligand is unaffected by the lipid components of pulmonary surfactant. This latter situation indicates that the lipids present in the alveolar environment are unlikely to interfere with human SP-D recognition of the microorganism. The lipids isolated from mycoplasma were further subfractionated to examine their interaction with human SP-D. After separating the lipid components of mycoplasma by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, we were able to show that the major ligands for SP-D comigrate with 3 prominent glycolipids with characteristics of di- and trihexosyldiacylglycerol. These finding are consistent with glycolipid components of M. pneumoniae functioning as the predominant bacterial receptors for SP-D. We are currently working to definitively identify the structures of these glycolipids.Analysis of the mycoplasma membrane binding by rat SP-D presents a more complicated picture of the interaction. Unlike the rat SP-D binding observed for the intact bacterial cells, the membranes exhibit both Ca2+-dependent and -independent interactions. The Ca2+-independent binding is also protease sensitive. Furthermore, in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of EGTA, rat SP-D shows specific binding to a 20-kDa protein present in mycoplasma membranes. Our interpretation of this data is that the Ca2+-independent ligand for rat SP-D is unavailable in the intact cell, but becomes accessible in the membrane preparation. We favor an explanation in which the ligand is restricted to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane and (subsequently becomes accessible to SP-D when membranes are prepared). The access of rat SP-D to both sides of the bilayer could occur as a consequence of the bacterial membranes forming either randomly oriented vesicles or open sheets. As described in earlier parts of the “Discussion,” the Ca2+ dependent binding activity for rat SP-D has all the properties of a lipid glycoconjugate expressed on the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane. The utility of the recognition by rat SP-D, of exposed and cryptic ligands present in M. pneumoniae is not clear at present. It is possible that the recognition of multiple classes of ligands by rat SP-D confers greater resistance to the organism than that exhibited in humans.In summary, our findings demonstrate high affinity interactions between SP-D and M. pneumoniae. The properties of the binding reaction implicate the CRD as the protein domain that interacts with the organism. Glycolipids constitute a major class of microbial ligand that interacts with the protein. Together these findings identify SP-D as an important component of host recognition of this significant human pathogen. In this study, we investigated the binding of SP-D to M. pneumoniae, a pathogen that accounts for 20–30% of all pneumonias, causes airway inflammation (32Krause D.C. Taylor-Robinson D. Mycoplasmas: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1992: 417-444Google Scholar), and exacerbates other respiratory disorders such as asthma (1Gil J.C.

To study the role of unsaturated fatty acids in cellular lipid and energy metabolism we generated a null allelic mouse, deficient in 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) (eci−/− mouse). ECI is the link in mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and essential for the complete degradation and for maximal energy yield. Mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids is interrupted in eci−/−mice at the level of their respective 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates. Fasting eci−/− mice accumulate unsaturated fatty acyl groups in ester lipids and deposit large amounts of triglycerides in hepatocytes (steatosis). Gene expression studies revealed the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activation in eci−/− mice together with peroxisomal β- and microsomal ω-oxidation enzymes. Combined peroxisomal β- and microsomal ω-oxidation of the 3-enoyl-CoA intermediates leads to a specific pattern of medium chain unsaturated dicarboxylic acids excreted in the urine in high concentration (dicarboxylic aciduria). The urinary dicarboxylate pattern is a reliable diagnostic marker of the ECI genetic defect.

The eci−/− mouse might be a model of a yet undefined inborn mitochondrial β-oxidation disorder lacking the enzyme link that channels the intermediates of unsaturated fatty acids into the β-oxidation spiral of saturated fatty acids. Long chain saturated and unsaturated (mono- and polyunsaturated) fatty acids comprising members of the ω-3 (α-linolenic), ω-6 (linoleic), and ω-9 (oleic acid) families occur almost equally as acyl groups of phospholipids and triglycerides. In phospholipids they are essential in the regulation of the fluidity of biological membranes. ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are the precursors in eicosanoid synthesis (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes). As constituents of triglycerides, unsaturated fatty acids are a main energy source for muscle work.Following the classical pathway of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds at odd-numbered C atoms, e.g. of oleic acid (18:19), linoleic acid (18:19,12), and α-linolenic acid (18:19,12,15), yields 3-cis-enoyl-CoA-intermediates. They are isomerized by the mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) 1The abbreviations used are: ECI3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerasepTFEperoxisomal trifunctional enzymePPARperoxisomal proliferator-activating receptorSCADshort chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseCYP 4A1cytochrome P450 IVA1RTreverse transcription1The abbreviations used are: ECI3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerasepTFEperoxisomal trifunctional enzymePPARperoxisomal proliferator-activating receptorSCADshort chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseCYP 4A1cytochrome P450 IVA1RTreverse transcription (EC 5.3.3.8) to their respective 2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomers, common substrates of enoyl-CoA hydratase of the β-oxidation cycle of saturated fatty acyl-CoA esters (1Stoffel W.

Hydration to thed(−)-3-hydroxy derivative followed by epimerization by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.2.3) is apparently an alternative but minor pathway. Likewise, another alternative pathway has been proposed, according to which a cis-5 double bond when encountered in the β-oxidation of an odd-numbered double bond in unsaturated fatty acids is removed through an NADPH-dependent reduction of 5-enoyl-CoA, possibly mediated by a 5-enoyl-CoA reductase (5Tserng K., Y. Jin S., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme, however, has neither been characterized on the protein level, nor has it been cloned. Its contribution to the overall mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids awaits further clarification.According to the classical pathway of mitochondrial β-oxidation, all unsaturated fatty acids are channeled via their 3-cis- and/or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA isomers to their respective 2-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates, which are regular intermediates of the β-oxidation spiral. Mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase is the essential link between saturated and unsaturated β-oxidation. The peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme (pTFE) contains an isomerase subunit, which carries out the equivalent reaction when peroxisomal β-oxidation is challenged,e.g. by lipid-lowering drugs (6Novikov D.K.

Starvation or increased energy requirement, particularly of newborns and children, causes severe hypoketotic hyperglycemia, elevated cellular and serum fatty acid concentrations, and enhanced ω-oxidation with medium chain length dicarboxylic acids as end products that are excreted in the urine.We studied the function of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in cellular energy metabolism in a null allelic mouse model in which the key enzyme of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, ECI, has been disrupted by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells.The complete ablation of eci in the mouse severely perturbs the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly on short interval starvation. The fatty acid pattern of complex phospholipids is strongly altered. Saturated fatty acids become substituted by unsaturated fatty acids, and triglycerides massively accumulate in hepatocytes (steatosis). The lack of 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase interrupts β-oxidation at the level of their 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates. They are further processed to specific medium chain saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid end products and excreted into the urine. The urinary dicarboxylate pattern may serve as an unambiguous and valuable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of the ECI genetic defect.DISCUSSIONThis report describes the generation and characterization of the first mouse model that addresses the catabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. ECI is the enzyme that links unsaturated and saturated fatty acid mitochondrial β-oxidation essential for the complete degradation of unsaturated fatty acids for optimal energy yield. In the eci−/− mouse, mitochondrial unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation is interrupted at the stage of their 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates.eci−/− mice show no obvious phenotypic differences under normal physiological conditions. However, like patients affected by mitochondrial β-oxidation defects of saturated fatty acids (15Di Mauro S. Di Mauro P.M. Science. 1973; 182: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the eci−/−mouse develops pathological symptoms as soon as energy supply becomes dependent on mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation, e.g. in hypoglycemic state during fasting periods.In general two independent β-oxidation systems, a mitochondrial and a peroxisomal, are involved in the degradation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Peroxisomes catalyze fatty acid oxidation in a reaction sequence similar to the mitochondrial β-oxidation spiral, although only through two to five cycles for fatty acyl chain shortening. Unlike in mitochondria the reduction equivalents released in the peroxisomal β-oxidation cannot be utilized by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, the energy production is only minor and contributes under prolonged fasting conditions to total cellular fatty acid oxidation no more than 20% (25Krahling J.B. Gee R. Murphy P.A. Kirk J.R. Tolbert N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Therefore, ECI is essential for the energy supply by mitochondrial β-oxidation from unsaturated fatty acids. Their abundance defines them as essential metabolic fuel for the energy supply by mitochondrial β-oxidation. The important function of 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase in the complete mitochondrial degradation of unsaturated fatty acids to acetyl-CoA is obvious.Mitochondrial ECI and the isomerase subunit of pTFE are equivalent in their catalytic function. The mouse and human ECI gene organization (11Muller-Newen G. Stoffel W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11405-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Janssen U. Fink T. Lichter P. Stoffel W.

Exon I–V of ptfe encode the peroxisomal isomerase-hydratase activity with 25% identity to the heci (27Ishii N. Hijikata M. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8144-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exon/intron positions of mitochondrial eci and peroxisomal rn tfe show no similarity, which indicates the independent evolutionary development of the mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation to acetyl-CoA.The important question arose of whether in the eci−/− mouse mutant peroxisomal β-oxidation can compensate for the deficiency of mitochondrial β-oxidation and carry out the complete degradation of the accumulating 3-cis- and 3-trans-isomeric intermediates of unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation.Surprisingly, eci−/− mice are viable, fertile, and phenotypically indistinguishable from wt mice as long as they are unchallenged by metabolic stress. The genotypes of the siblings of heterozygous crosses (eci+/−mice) followed the Mendelian law and excluded an influence of ECI deficiency on embryonic development.Most human mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme defects described thus far are involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation of saturated fatty acids. Affected individuals develop a pathological phenotype only when an enhanced energy requirement must be covered by mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, e.g. during prolonged fasting (29Wood P.A. Amendt B.A. Rhead W.J. Millington D.S. Inoue F. Armstrong D. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 25: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Our ECI-deficient mice show three characteristic features. 1) A massive accumulation of neutral lipids, mainly triglycerides, occurs in liver and kidney upon short fasting conditions (Fig. 3). 2) Starvation induces hormonal activation of adipose tissue triglyceride lipase, elevates free fatty acid concentration in serum, and enhances mitochondrial and extra mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The activation of the hormone-sensitive adipose tissue triglyceride lipase releases long chain unsaturated fatty acids selectively from fat cell triglycerides (28Raclot T. Groscolas R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2164-2173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver of eci−/− mice is supplied with these unsaturated long chain fatty acids. They are utilized for the synthesis of ester lipids (triglyceride and phospholipids). Because of their impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation, they are mainly stored as cytosolic triglycerides in hepatocytes, as documented in the TLC analysis of eci−/− liver and kidney lipids (Fig. 3).Triglyceride storage in the liver described here for the eci−/− mouse has also been observed in SCAD-deficient mice (29Wood P.A. Amendt B.A. Rhead W.J. Millington D.S. Inoue F. Armstrong D. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 25: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both the unchallenged eci−/− and the scad−/− mouse are clinically asymptomatic, different from the SCAD deficiency in human, characterized by severe clinical symptoms.3) PPAR isoforms are activated by free fatty acids and accumulating metabolites (30Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 31Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A., Hu, E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Upon starvation the eci−/− mouse rapidly develops a disrupted lipid metabolism. PPARα expression is up-regulated within the first 24 h, associated with a strongly enhanced expression of microsomal cytochrome P450 A1 and the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes, as documented here for the gene expression of CYP 4A1 and pTFE in the liver (Fig. 5).In eci−/− mice unsaturated fatty acid intermediates become substrates of these enzymes. As a consequence large amounts of saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids are excreted in the urine, leading to a characteristic urinary dicarboxylate pattern in which hex-3-cis-ene-1,6-dioic acid is a dominant end product exceeding that of wild type control mice 30-fold. Because of the abundance of oleic acid among unsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids and triglycerides, ECI deficiency leads to a halt of the regular β-oxidation of oleic acid on the dodec-3-cis-enoyl-CoA level, which becomes the substrate of the P450-dependent microsomal ω-oxidation. Dodec-3- and 9-cis-ene-1,6-dioic acid is then activated by the microsomal dicarboxylyl-CoA synthase (32Vamecq J. de Hoffmann E. Van Hoof F. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and further degraded either in mitochondria or in peroxisomes to hex-3-cis-ene-1,6-dicarboxylic acid. Octadi-2,5-cis-ene-1,8-dioic acid is another characteristic and abundant degradation product, which is derived from linoleic acid (18:29,12). Degradation of octadi-2,5-cis-ene-1,8-dioic acids via peroxisomal β-oxidation complex (hydratase to the d-3-hydroxy- and epimerase to the l-3-hydroxy-intermediate, dehydrogenase, and thiolase) might further increase the hex-3-cis-ene-1,6-dioic acid concentration in the urinary dicarboxylic acid pattern.All isomeric hexene, octene, octadiene, and decadiene dioic acids have been identified and characterized by gas liquid chromatography except the cis-/trans-isomerism of the latter. Triglyceride storage and dicarboxylic aciduria upon fasting as described above is a phenotypic sign, which is shared between the eci−/− mouse and the human inborn error SCAD deficiency. In SCAD deficiency starvation also causes a massive increase in urinary ethylmalonate and methylsuccinate as specific dicarboxylate metabolites, which results from ω-oxidation of incompletely β-oxidized saturated fatty acids.The eci−/− mouse model deficient in the 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase, which links mitochondrial β-oxidation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, furthers our understanding of the role of unsaturated fatty acids in energy metabolism in response to normal and fasting conditions. The molecular pathology and the analysis of its phenotype has provided specific diagnostic tools. The eci−/− mouse mutant might prove to be a valuable mimicry of human ECI deficiency and facilitate the discovery of the equivalent human inherited disease in the pool of hitherto unknown mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation defects observed in new born and infants. The mouse model might also be useful in the development of dietary therapeutic strategies. Long chain saturated and unsaturated (mono- and polyunsaturated) fatty acids comprising members of the ω-3 (α-linolenic), ω-6 (linoleic), and ω-9 (oleic acid) families occur almost equally as acyl groups of phospholipids and triglycerides. In phospholipids they are essential in the regulation of the fluidity of biological membranes. ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are the precursors in eicosanoid synthesis (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes). As constituents of triglycerides, unsaturated fatty acids are a main energy source for muscle work. Following the classical pathway of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds at odd-numbered C atoms, e.g. of oleic acid (18:19), linoleic acid (18:19,12), and α-linolenic acid (18:19,12,15), yields 3-cis-enoyl-CoA-intermediates. They are isomerized by the mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) 1The abbreviations used are: ECI3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerasepTFEperoxisomal trifunctional enzymePPARperoxisomal proliferator-activating receptorSCADshort chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseCYP 4A1cytochrome P450 IVA1RTreverse transcription1The abbreviations used are: ECI3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerasepTFEperoxisomal trifunctional enzymePPARperoxisomal proliferator-activating receptorSCADshort chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseCYP 4A1cytochrome P450 IVA1RTreverse transcription (EC 5.3.3.8) to their respective 2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomers, common substrates of enoyl-CoA hydratase of the β-oxidation cycle of saturated fatty acyl-CoA esters (1Stoffel W.

Hydration to thed(−)-3-hydroxy derivative followed by epimerization by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.2.3) is apparently an alternative but minor pathway. Likewise, another alternative pathway has been proposed, according to which a cis-5 double bond when encountered in the β-oxidation of an odd-numbered double bond in unsaturated fatty acids is removed through an NADPH-dependent reduction of 5-enoyl-CoA, possibly mediated by a 5-enoyl-CoA reductase (5Tserng K., Y. Jin S., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme, however, has neither been characterized on the protein level, nor has it been cloned.

Mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase is the essential link between saturated and unsaturated β-oxidation. The peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme (pTFE) contains an isomerase subunit, which carries out the equivalent reaction when peroxisomal β-oxidation is challenged,e.g. by lipid-lowering drugs (6Novikov D.K.

A growing number of inborn errors of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes form a new class of metabolic diseases following the first description of the carnitine-palmitoyl transferase deficiency (14Bennett M.J.

Common to these genetic defects is an impaired utilization of fatty acids as primary energy source. Starvation or increased energy requirement, particularly of newborns and children, causes severe hypoketotic hyperglycemia, elevated cellular and serum fatty acid concentrations, and enhanced ω-oxidation with medium chain length dicarboxylic acids as end products that are excreted in the urine. We studied the function of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in cellular energy metabolism in a null allelic mouse model in which the key enzyme of mitochondrial β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, ECI, has been disrupted by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells. The complete ablation of eci in the mouse severely perturbs the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly on short interval starvation. The fatty acid pattern of complex phospholipids is strongly altered. Saturated fatty acids become substituted by unsaturated fatty acids, and triglycerides massively accumulate in hepatocytes (steatosis). The lack of 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase interrupts β-oxidation at the level of their 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates. They are further processed to specific medium chain saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid end products and excreted into the urine. The urinary dicarboxylate pattern may serve as an unambiguous and valuable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of the ECI genetic defect. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the generation and characterization of the first mouse model that addresses the catabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. ECI is the enzyme that links unsaturated and saturated fatty acid mitochondrial β-oxidation essential for the complete degradation of unsaturated fatty acids for optimal energy yield. In the eci−/− mouse, mitochondrial unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation is interrupted at the stage of their 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-CoA intermediates.eci−/− mice show no obvious phenotypic differences under normal physiological conditions. However, like patients affected by mitochondrial β-oxidation defects of saturated fatty acids (15Di Mauro S. Di Mauro P.M. Science. 1973; 182: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the eci−/−mouse develops pathological symptoms as soon as energy supply becomes dependent on mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation, e.g. in hypoglycemic state during fasting periods.In general two independent β-oxidation systems, a mitochondrial and a peroxisomal, are involved in the degradation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Peroxisomes catalyze fatty acid oxidation in a reaction sequence similar to the mitochondrial β-oxidation spiral, although only through two to five cycles for fatty acyl chain shortening. Unlike in mitochondria the reduction equivalents released in the peroxisomal β-oxidation cannot be utilized by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, the energy production is only minor and contributes under prolonged fasting conditions to total cellular fatty acid oxidation no more than 20% (25Krahling J.B. Gee R. Murphy P.A. Kirk J.R. Tolbert N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Therefore, ECI is essential for the energy supply by mitochondrial β-oxidation from unsaturated fatty acids. Their abundance defines them as essential metabolic fuel for the energy supply by mitochondrial β-oxidation. The important function of 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase in the complete mitochondrial degradation of unsaturated fatty acids to acetyl-CoA is obvious.Mitochondrial ECI and the isomerase subunit of pTFE are equivalent in their catalytic function. The mouse and human ECI gene organization (11Muller-Newen G. Stoffel W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11405-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Janssen U. Fink T. Lichter P. Stoffel W. Genomics. 1994; 23: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and of pTFE consist of seven exons. Exon I–V of ptfe encode the peroxisomal isomerase-hydratase activity with 25% identity to the heci (27Ishii N. Hijikata M. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

Affected individuals develop a pathological phenotype only when an enhanced energy requirement must be covered by mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, e.g. during prolonged fasting (29Wood P.A.

J. 1985; 230: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and further degraded either in mitochondria or in peroxisomes to hex-3-cis-ene-1,6-dicarboxylic acid. Octadi-2,5-cis-ene-1,8-dioic acid is another characteristic and abundant degradation product, which is derived from linoleic acid (18:29,12). Degradation of octadi-2,5-cis-ene-1,8-dioic acids via peroxisomal β-oxidation complex (hydratase to the d-3-hydroxy- and epimerase to the l-3-hydroxy-intermediate, dehydrogenase, and thiolase) might further increase the hex-3-cis-ene-1,6-dioic acid concentration in the urinary dicarboxylic acid pattern. All isomeric hexene, octene, octadiene, and decadiene dioic acids have been identified and characterized by gas liquid chromatography except the cis-/trans-isomerism of the latter. Triglyceride storage and dicarboxylic aciduria upon fasting as described above is a phenotypic sign, which is shared between the eci−/− mouse and the human inborn error SCAD deficiency. In SCAD deficiency starvation also causes a massive increase in urinary ethylmalonate and methylsuccinate as specific dicarboxylate metabolites, which results from ω-oxidation of incompletely β-oxidized saturated fatty acids. The eci−/− mouse model deficient in the 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase, which links mitochondrial β-oxidation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, furthers our understanding of the role of unsaturated fatty acids in energy metabolism in response to normal and fasting conditions. The molecular pathology and the analysis of its phenotype has provided specific diagnostic tools. The eci−/− mouse mutant might prove to be a valuable mimicry of human ECI deficiency and facilitate the discovery of the equivalent human inherited disease in the pool of hitherto unknown mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation defects observed in new born and infants. The mouse model might also be useful in the development of dietary therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1991831526,"The resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid is commonly linked to inactivation of a catalase-peroxidase, KatG, that converts isoniazid to its biologically active form. Loss of KatG is associated with elevated expression of the alkylhydroperoxidases AhpC and AhpD. AhpD has no sequence identity with AhpC or other proteins but has alkylhydroperoxidase activity and possibly additional physiological activities. The alkylhydroperoxidase activity, in the absence of KatG, provides an important antioxidant defense. We have determined the M. tuberculosis AhpD structure to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The protein is a trimer in a symmetrical cloverleaf arrangement. Each subunit exhibits a new all-helical protein fold in which the two catalytic sulfhydryl groups, Cys-130 and Cys-133, are located near a central cavity in the trimer. The structure supports a mechanism for the alkylhydroperoxidase activity in which Cys-133 is deprotonated by a distant glutamic acid via the relay action of His-137 and a water molecule. The cysteine then reacts with the peroxide to give a sulfenic acid that subsequently forms a disulfide bond with Cys-130. The crystal structure of AhpD identifies a new protein fold relevant to members of this protein family in other organisms. The structural details constitute a potential platform for the design of inhibitors of potential utility as antitubercular agents and suggest that AhpD may have disulfide exchange properties of importance in other areas of M. tuberculosis biology.

Tuberculosis is a leading pathogen worldwide, infecting an estimated 8 million and killing 2–3 million people each year (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is estimated that ∼2 billion people have been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and thus are at risk of developing the active disease. Although most of the infected individuals reside in less industrialized countries, the rates of infection in areas undergoing rapid social change, such as the countries of the former Soviet Union, are also increasing at an alarming rate (2Keshavjee S. Becerra M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1201Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In part because of the symbiotic relationship between human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis, and the increasingly rapid displacement of populations, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is an important worldwide concern. Thus, in a recent survey of 35 countries, 12.6% of M. tuberculosis isolates were found to be resistant to at least one drug, and 2.2% were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, the two primary drugs used to treat tuberculosis (3Pablos-Méndez A. Rafiglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Labregts-Van Weezenbeek C.S.B. Kim S.J. Chaulet P. Nunn P. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). This resurgence of tuberculosis has led to renewed efforts to find new drugs for the treatment of this dread disease, particularly agents that exhibit activity against drug-resistant strains, completely sterilize the infection, or shorten the duration of drug therapy and thus promote drug compliance. One of the primary drugs used to treat tuberculosis is isoniazid, a prodrug that is oxidized by the KatG catalase-peroxidase to an activated form that inhibits cell wall synthesis (4Zhang Y. Dhandayuthapani S. Deretic V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13212-13216Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Slayden R.A. Barry 3rd, C.E. Microbes and Infection. 2000; 2: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Isoniazid resistance commonly results from mutation of the KatG to a protein that is either inactive or has an impaired ability to activate isoniazid (6Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 7Johnson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Wengenack N.L. Rusnak F.

Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The physiological function of the KatG catalase-peroxidase has not been completely defined, but includes protection of the mycobacterium against H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species produced by the microbe and its host (10Manca C. Paul S. Barry III, C.E. Freedman V.H. Kaplan G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The attenuated virulence of KatG null strains of M. tuberculosis has been definitively established by experiments in which resistance to H2O2, and virulence, are restored by transfection with plasmid-encoded KatG (12Morse W.C. Weiser O.L. Kuhns D.M. Fusillo M. Dail M.C. Evans J.R. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1954; 69: 464-468PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mitchison D.A. Selkon J.B. Lloyd J. J. Path.

Dis. 1998; 177: 1030-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A conundrum therefore exists, in that loss or attenuation of KatG activity, an activity important for virulence, is required for resistance to isoniazid. A possible solution to this conundrum is offered by the finding that suppression of KatG activity is paralleled by increased expression of the alkylhydroperoxidase AhpC (4Zhang Y. Dhandayuthapani S.

AhpC is a member of the widespread non-heme peroxiredoxin family that catalyzes the reduction of alkylhydroperoxides to alcohols (19Schröder E. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although additional functions have been ascribed to individual members of this protein family. For example, human peroxiredoxins, in addition to their alkylhydroperoxidase activity, have phospholipase A2 activity (20Chen J.-W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol.

In microorganisms, the ahpC gene is usually under control of the oxyR locus, but this locus in M. tuberculosis is not functional (22Sherman D.R. Sabo P.J. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Mahairas G.G. Yuan Y.

Heym B. Via L.E. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of AhpC in M. tuberculosis involves elevated expression of the protein due to mutations in its promoter region (11Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Wilson T.M. Collins D.M. Mol.

The position immediately downstream of ahpC in the S. typhimurium genome is occupied by ahpF, but in the M. tuberculosis genome this position is taken by a gene termed ahpD because of its position relative to ahpC rather than because of any sequence or functional evidence. Homologous ahpD genes have so far been found in a few other organisms, including other mycobacteria, Streptomyces viridosporus, 2S. Ramachandran, T. S. Magnuson, and D. L.

Boucher (2001) GenBankTM accession number NP519766. We recently expressed the M. tuberculosis AhpD and demonstrated that, despite the absence of any sequence identity between AhpD and the AhpC family of proteins, it also exhibits alkylhydroperoxidase activity with the same surrogate electron transfer partners as utilized by AhpC (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The specific role of AhpD in detoxifying peroxides and other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and any possible additional functions of the protein, remain undetermined. Unlike ahpC, ahpD appears not to have been among the genes examined in microarray studies of changes in M. tuberculosis gene expression caused by drugs and hypoxia (18Wilson M. DeRisi J.

However, its position relative to ahpC suggests that AhpD expression may be enhanced under the same conditions that enhance AhpC expression. The ahpD (Rv2429) gene encodes a protein of 177 amino acids and a molecular mass of 18,781 Da. 4Available at www. sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/yeastpub/get_tb_orf_working.perl. Size-exclusion chromatography of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli indicates that AhpD is present as an oligomeric, possibly dimeric, species (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The AhpD sequence reveals the presence of two cysteines (Cys-129 and Cys-132, or Cys-130 and Cys-133 if the initial methionine that is absent in the heterologously expressed protein is counted). The two cysteines are separated by a serine and a histidine. Site-specific mutagenesis of the cysteines has shown that both, but particularly Cys-133, are important for alkylhydroperoxidase activity. We report here crystallization of M. tuberculosis AhpD and determination of its crystal structure to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The crystal structure reveals a homotrimeric protein in which each of the subunits has an identical but novel protein fold. The structure suggests a mechanism for the alkylhydroperoxidase activity of AhpD. M. tuberculosis AhpD was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified as previously reported (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). E. coli strain DL41, auxotrophic in methionine biosynthesis due to a metA disruption (32Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), was obtained from the Yale University E. coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC). Selenomethionine was from Acros. Trisodium citrate was from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). LB and agar were from Difco. Acetic acid, chloramphenicol, NaCl, NaOH, SDS, and MOPS were from Fisher. Protein molecular weight standards were from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Thymine, guanosine, and adenine hemisulfate dihydrate were from ICN Biomedical (Aurora, OH). Purified proteins were concentrated using Millipore YM10-regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes. Q-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Peapack, NJ). IPTG was from Promega (Madison, WI). SC-Met was from Qbiogene (Carlsbad, CA). Polyethyleneimine (10% solution) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Ammonium sulfate, SigmaUltra dithiothreitol, EDTA, KCl, glycerol, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, d-(+)-glucose, potassium phosphate (mono- and di-basic), uracil, d-biotin, thiamine hydrochloride, and amino acids (Phe, Thr, Val, Leu, Ile, Lys, and Met) were from Sigma Chemical Co. Attempts to express the selenomethionine-labeled protein in the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain DL41 (32Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. The labeled protein was therefore expressed in BL21 cells under conditions that minimize methionine biosynthesis. Thus, two 5-ml LB/chloramphenicol cultures were inoculated with a single colony from a freshly streaked plate and grown at 37 °C for 8 h or less. Cells spun down at 2500 rpm for 15 min were resuspended in A medium to minimize the addition of methionine from the rich LB medium. The A600 of the resuspension was measured, and cells were diluted to A600 ∼ 0.001 into 1 liter of A medium in a 3-liter Fernbach flask. Each liter of growth medium was supplemented with 2 g of glucose (10 ml of 20% glucose) and 34 mg of chloramphenicol. Growth at 37 °C, 250 rpm, was performed until the A600 was 0.7, a process that took at least 10–12 h. To each liter of culture was added 100 mg each of Phe, Lys·HCl, and Thr and 50 mg each of Ile, Leu, and Val. For native or SeMet expression, 30 mg/liter l-methionine or l-selenomethionine also was added, respectively. After 15 min of further growth, IPTG was added to 0.2 mm (200 μl of 1 m IPTG), expression was continued for 6–8 h, and the cells were harvested and stored frozen at −70 °C overnight. If desired, expression can be done for as long as 14 h to increase cell yield. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified according to the protocol of Hillas et al. (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), except that 5 mmdithiothreitol and 0.2 mm EDTA were added to all the buffers, and all the buffers used in protein purification were degassed. The degassing, EDTA, and high concentration of dithiothreitol were employed to minimize the oxidation of selenomethionine to the selenoxide (33Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The buffers were degassed by subjecting them, with stirring, to a minimum of three 15-min cycles of house-line vacuum followed by 2 min of bubbling with nitrogen using a bubbler with a fine frit to optimize mixing of the gas into the buffer. In the case of buffers to be applied to chromatography columns, the final cycle should be done sufficiently in advance to allow dispersion of the gas bubbles, because this prevents the introduction of bubbles into the column. Per each gram of cells was added 5 ml of buffer B (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The suspended cells were incubated on ice for 60 min and then, while still on ice, were sonicated with a Branson sonifier 1/2"" tip on setting 3 (∼20-watt output) for 4 cycles of alternating 30-s continuous pulses followed by 30 s of rest. To the supernatant obtained by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 ×g (4 °C) was added polyethyleneimine to a concentration of 0.005%. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min to precipitate the nucleic acids, and the mixture was then centrifuged as above to produce the crude lysate supernatant. The crude lysate was loaded onto a 2.5- × 17-cm (∼80 ml) Q-Sepharose column at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10–20 column volumes of buffer B at 1 ml/min, and the protein was then eluted at 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 375 ml of buffer B and 375 ml of buffer B containing 100 mm KCl. Fractions of 7.5 ml resulted in elution of the AhpD protein in fractions 1–45. Every other fraction from 1 through 43 was analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml or greater using a Millipore concentrator equipped with a YM10 (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membrane. The concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,720m −1 cm−1 (24Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For volumes of 0.5–3.0 ml, the concentrated solution was loaded into a Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer cassette and dialyzed three times against 1 liter of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The protein was then aliquoted into 25- or 100-μl volumes, frozen on dry ice, and stored until used at −80 °C. The protein was subjected to analysis on 20% homogeneous gels using the PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The protein molecular weight standards (Invitrogen) were prestained insulin (α and β chains, usually unresolvable), bovine trypsin inhibitor, lysozyme, β-lactoglobulin, carbonic anhydrase, and ovalbumin, which have apparent molecular weights of 3,145, 6,060, 14,840, 19,875, 29,435, and 45,695 g/mol. Crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop method. To each well in a 24-well plate was added 1.0 ml of 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 200 mm ammonium acetate, and 26% polyethylene glycol 4000. A freshly thawed solution of AhpD (4.5 mg/ml) in 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, stored at −80 °C, was brought to a concentration of 5.0 mm dithiothreitol with an ice-cold stock solution of the reducing agent. The final solution was kept at 4 °C, and the crystallization drops were laid down as quickly as possible. In the case of the selenomethionine-labeled protein, the protein stock solution already contained 5.0 mmdithiothreitol but a further 5 mm was added. A 2-μl aliquot of the well solution was placed on each coverslip followed by a 2-μl aliquot of the protein solution. The coverslip was then inverted over the well and the plate was allowed to stand at room temperature (between 17 and 21 °C) until appropriate crystals appeared. Crystallization usually occurred within a period of 3–4 days. The crystals appeared as large, rhombohedral prisms. The crystals were of space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 186.38 Å, b = 117.28 Å, c = 88.99 Å, β = 113.97°. Multi-wavelength x-ray data were collected at the beamline BM14, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. An x-ray fluorescence spectrum was recorded and used to select the wavelength optima for the subsequent MAD data collections. All data sets were collected using the same single, flash-frozen crystal of SeMet-AhpD of size 0.35 × 0.45 × 0.2 mm. The four data sets were collected at λ = 0.97877 Å (f"" maximum), λ = 0.97890 Å (inflection point), λ = 0.91840 Å (remote high energy wavelength), and at λ = 0.8855 Å.

Open table in a new tab Within the smaller C2 cell a protein trimer exists within the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Selenium sites were located from Patterson search procedures using the program CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Six selenium sites were located with two selenium sites in each AhpD protein, at positions 78 and 80 of the protein sequence. After density modification in CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

G., Knoops-Mouthuy, E., and Cambillau, C. (2000) TURBO manual, AFMB-IFRC1, Marseille, France.Google Scholar). ARP/wARP (38Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) was run in parallel and located some of the α-helical regions of the structure (approximately one-third of the structure was located using ARP/wARP). 10% of the reflections were used for cross-validation analysis (39Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar), and the behavior of Rfree was used to monitor the refinement strategy. For the structure building and subsequent refinement, data to 1.9 Å were used. Model building was carried out using programs O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowans S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and Turbo, and refinement was achieved using CNS. Refinement included simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics, anisotropic scaling, energy minimization, individual isotropic B-factor refinement, and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood target. The structure refinement proceeded well until the later stages when it became clear that some parts of the structure (loops primarily) were poorly fitted. A re-inspection of the data frames and re-indexing displayed a larger unit cell to be the correct unit cell for this structure with a volume four times the size of the initial cell. This cell was not identified in the first instance due to weak diffraction for the additional reflections and could only be seen fully using the synchrotron source. After reprocessing of the data molecular replacement was carried out using co-ordinates of the refined AhpD trimer within CNS. The cross-rotation function produced three distinct peaks, and the translation functions identified the positions for three further AhpD trimers. The trimers are related by translation only. Following molecular replacement, refinement of the four independent trimers was carried out using CNS, with a similar protocol to that described above. Because the starting trimer was already reasonably well refined in the smaller cell, at this point use of the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints or restraints did not lead to improvement of the model and, therefore, the refinement was continued without NCS. Refitting of the previously poorly fitting regions of the protein showed significant improvement as the refinement proceeded. During the final stages of the refinement well-defined residual electron density peaks in difference Fourier maps were assigned as solvent water molecules and included in the model. At the end of the refinement four residues were omitted from the model due to a lack of electron density in these regions (residues 61 from chains B and E, and residue 99 from chains G and L), and no residual electron density was unaccounted for. Root mean square deviations between the trimer-comprising protein chains ABC and the other three protein trimers is 0.58 Å (ABC/DEF), 1.12 Å (ABC/GHI), and 0.91 Å (ABC/JKL). Higher Rfactor values reflect the non-crystallographic symmetry that gave rise to systematically weaker reflections that were not clearly detectable until the crystals were diffracted by a stronger x-ray source (synchrotron radiation). These weaker reflections are associated with the larger unit cell. It has been recently noted that these types of structures do not refine to give low Rfactors (41Tame J.R.H. Namba K. Dodson E.J.

The results indicate that the G protein γ subunit plays a direct role in the modulation of effector function by the βγ complex.

The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the activation or inhibition of an effector by the G protein βγ complex is not clear. Regions on the β subunit and effectors important for interaction between Gβγ and effector molecules have been identified. A domain on the G protein β subunit was initially shown to contact domains on several effector molecules (2Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17597-17600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Later studies have identified several regions on the β subunit that interact with effectors divided into regions that are involved in stabilizing interaction and others involved in modulating effector activity (3Weng G., Li, J.

Although there is increasing evidence that the G protein γ subunits specify contact with receptors (9Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41742-41747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), their role in effector regulation has been less clear. Early evidence indicated that the prenyl modification at the C terminus of the γ subunit is a requirement for the βγ complex action on effectors (11Katz A., Wu, D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that if the type of prenylation on γ subunits, farnesyl (C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20), is altered through mutational alteration of the protein, the ability of the mutant βγ complex to act on effectors is altered (12Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results confirmed the role for the prenyl moiety in effector activation. The reasons for the requirement of the prenyl modification were, however, not clear. It was unclear whether the prenyl group was required because it assisted the βγ complex association with membranes, and as a consequence, brought the βγ complex in close proximity to membrane-bound effector molecules or whether the prenyl group actually interacted with effectors and stabilized this critical protein-protein interaction event. Recent evidence supports the latter mechanism, indicating that the prenyl moiety physically contacts at least one effector, PLCβ, 1The abbreviations used are: PLCβphospholipase Cβ isozymeHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGTPγ35Sguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatewtwild type and facilitates βγ interaction with PLCβ (13Fogg V.C.

These mutant γ subunits are predicted to yield γ subunit prenyl modifications that will be in an altered position on the three-dimensional structure of the βγ complex as compared with the wild type. Two of these mutants extend the C-terminal tail of the γ subunit by inserting Gly residues immediately upstream of the Cys that is geranylgeranylated. Gly residues will also increase the conformational flexibility of the attached prenyl moiety. A third mutant has 10 residues upstream of the Cys residue deleted, thus shortening the C-terminal tail domain. Ten residues were removed because this domain has previously been shown to be the minimum sequence critical for receptor interaction of the G protein heterotrimer (9Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A fourth mutant contains an Ala substituted for Phe at position 59. This Phe residue interacts with six residues on the β subunit (15Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In the absence of this interaction, the C-terminal domain of the mutant γ subunit is expected to occupy a distinctly different position with reference to the β subunit when compared with the wild type. The mutant βγ complexes were purified, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with mass spectrometry was used to determine whether these C-terminal domain mutants were still appropriately prenylated with geranylgeranyl. All mutants were prenylated. The mutants were compared with the wild type for their relative abilities to activate PLCβ. All the mutants activated PLCβ2 less effectively in comparison with the wild type with the deletion being completely ineffective. The mutations did not have an impact, however, on the ability of the βγ complexes to interact with the α subunit. Subtle alterations in the position of the prenyl moiety on the βγ complex thus have a strong impact on the ability of the βγ complex to interact effectively with an effector, PLCβ. This result indicates that the γ subunit prenyl moiety directly interacts with an effector and not with membranes. Second, it supports the notion that the particular position of the prenyl moiety with reference to the β subunit domains that interact with the effector is critical for effective regulatory contact between the G protein βγ complex and PLCβ. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. [3H]PIP2 (specific activity: 6.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]NAD (specific activity: 22 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Biomedicals. All other compounds were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The mutant γ5 subunits were created by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on pFast-BAC vector (Invitrogen) carrying the γ5 subunit with a His tag at the N-terminal region. GATEWAY system (Invitrogen) was used to generate recombinant γ5 and β1 wild type baculoviruses. Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with β1-wt and γ5-wt or γ5-mutant baculoviruses according to the manufacturer's protocols. The expressed β1γ5-wt or β1γ5-mutant proteins were expressed, solubilized from the membrane fractions, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) as described (13Fogg V.C.

Before eluting the βγ complex, endogenous α subunits that might be bound to the βγ complex were removed with the addition of aluminum fluoride in the final washing step. The elution buffer contains 1% CHAPS, 250 mm imidazole, 20 mm Na-Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm GDP. At the final step, 200-μl fractions were collected, and the peak fraction was determined using Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). The proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The proteins were separated on 15% SDS gels with bovine serum albumin standards, and the concentrations of the proteins were determined after scanning and analyzing them with IMAGEJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The purity of the purified protein was always more than 95%, and the yield was 0.5 mg/liter of Sf9 cell culture. Wild type αo subunit was purified from bacteria co-expressing N-methyl transferase as described before (18Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein purity was determined by SDS gel electrophoresis with appropriate standards of known concentration. The active αo protein concentration was estimated based on GTPγ35S binding. The prenylation of the γ5 subunits was confirmed with HPLC (Beckman System GOLD). The βγ subunits were run on a C18 300-Å column (diameter, 4.6 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 μm; Jupiter, Phenomenex) with a linear acetonitrile gradient (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from 30 to 80% in 50 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The absorbance was recorded at 205 nm. The purified βγ complexes or some of the peak fractions from the HPLC eluate were collected and analyzed with MALDI-mass spectrometry. Tryptic digestion protocol of the βγ complex was modified from a previous method (19Yi F. Denker B.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3900-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, about 1.2 μg of βγ complex and 50 ng of trypsin were mixed in trypsin buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 75 mm sucrose, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To assess the heterotrimerization efficiency of G protein subunits, pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of α subunit was used as described (20Casey P.J. Pang I.H. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Heterotrimerization of purified αo (1.6 pmol) and purified βγ subunits (0.4–0.025 pmol) was performed in 5 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether) on ice for 20 min. At the same time, 15 μl of pertussis toxin (100 mg/ml) was activated at 30 °C for 20 min with the addition of 3 μl of ATP (15 mm), 3 μl of dithiothreitol (1 m), and 3 μl of CHAPS (2.5%). Then, 3 μl of [3H]NAD (2.0 × 106 counts/min), 6 μl of NAD (100 μm), 6 μl of dithiothreitol (100 mm), 6 μl of MgCl2 (100 mm), 3 μl of GDP (10 mm), 6 μl of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (30 mm; sonicated 5 min), and 66 μl of water were added to the activated toxin mixture. Then, 3 μl of the final pertussis toxin mixture was added to the 5 μl of αβγ heterotrimer mixture on ice and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (50 nm NAD and 2% SDS) and 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid solution. After 5 min, 300 μl of 6% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was filtered through the nitrocellulose filter (Millipore, 0.45 μm) and washed with 14 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were homogenized in scintillation liquid overnight and counted with a scintillation counter. Phospholipase C assays were conducted as described previously (16Romoser V. Ball R. A V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that cholate was omitted in the βγ complex dilution buffer. In each reaction tube, phospholipid vesicles (50 μm PIP2, 200 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, and [3H]PIP2 giving 10,000 cpm) and 2 ng of PLCβ2 (a kind gift from Dr. A. Smrcka) were mixed in varying concentrations of βγ complex as shown in the figures. The final incubation was performed for 7 min at 30 °C. Student's t tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Four different mutant forms of the γ5 subunit type were synthesized. Baculovirus vectors containing the β1 subunit and various γ5subunit forms were co-expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and the expressed proteins were purified. The alterations introduced at the C terminus of the γ5 subunit were expected to reposition the prenyl moiety with reference to the β subunit domains known to contact the effector, PLCβ. These changes in the various mutant forms in comparison with the wild type are represented diagrammatically on a model of the crystal structure of the G protein βγ complex in Fig. 1. In the wild type, the γ subunit is bound to one side of the β subunit torus-like structure. The γ subunit C-terminal tail domain is positioned in apposition to the β sheets traditionally referred to as “blades 6, 7, and 1.” G protein βγ complexes crystallized initially did not contain the prenyl moiety (15Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 21Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal residues of the γ subunit did not resolve in these structures. The precise orientation of the prenylated tail could not therefore be inferred. The crystal structure of Gβ1γ1 containing the prenylated γ1 subunit was later obtained as a complex of β1γ1 with phosducin (22Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this crystal structure, the C-terminal region of the γ subunit was again disordered. It is not possible, therefore, to predict the precise orientation of the C-terminal γ subunit domain in the wild type Gβγ complex. However, it is possible to visualize overall changes in the mutants designed for these experiments, as shown in Fig. 1. The removal of the last 10 residues upstream of the prenylated Cys residue will result in a shortened γ subunit with the prenyl moiety repositioned in apposition to the β sheet blades in the β subunit. The addition of 3G or 6G residues will (i) extend the C-terminal domain upstream of the prenyl moiety and (ii) increase the mobility of the prenyl moiety with reference to the γ subunit as compared with the wild type due to the addition of Gly residues that are conformationally flexible. Together this should result in the prenyl moiety occupying positions in three-dimensional space that are distinct from the wild type. In the γ5-F59A mutant, the Phe residue at position 59 was substituted with Ala to disrupt the binding of the C-terminal domain to the β subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, the corresponding Phe residue (Phe-64) in the γ1 subunit interacts with six different residues in the cleft between blades 7 and 1 of the β1 subunit. This Phe residue is conserved in all mammalian γ subunits (9Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutating the hydrophobic Phe residue to Ala is expected to result in the C-terminal domain of the γ subunit loosing its anchor on the β subunit and repositioning itself (Fig. 1).Figure 2Interaction of the Phe-64 residue of the γ1 subunit with the β subunit. The model depicts residues on the β subunit that interact with the Phe-64 residue on the γ1 subunit. An enlarged view of the surfaces between blades 7 and 1 in the folded β1 subunit structure is shown. The model shown is based on the crystal structure of β1γ1 (30Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) where the Phe-64 residue contacts six different residues, anchoring the C-terminal γ subunit domain to the β subunit. The model was generated as discussed in the legend for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The wild type γ5 and the four C-terminal mutants were purified as described and analyzed on an HPLC hydrophobic column using an acetonitrile gradient (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Under the chromatography conditions used here, the β subunit separates from the γ subunit. Fig. 3 shows the chromatograms of the γ5 subunit forms examined. Chromatograms of the wild type and the point mutant γ5-F59A showed a single peak, whereas the others showed two. Proteins corresponding to each of these peaks were isolated, and the masses of the corresponding proteins were determined using mass spectrometry. The results from this analysis are shown in Table I. In the chromatogram for each γ5 form (Fig. 3), protein corresponding to the peak that appeared earlier was prenylated, proteolyzed, and carboxyl-methylated. Protein corresponding to the peak that appeared later was prenylated but not proteolyzed. Similar to other proteins that are prenylated, the G protein γ subunits undergo three distinct post-translational processing steps (23Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). First, they are prenylated, and then the last three residues are proteolytically removed. Finally, the protein is carboxyl-methylated. Consistent with earlier reports that the only determinant of prenylation is the CAA X box sequence, all the mutants are appropriately prenylated with the geranylgeranyl moiety. However, the protease does not seem to recognize the mutant sequences effectively, and a fraction of the γ5−3G, γ5-6G, and γ5-Δ mutants retain the last three residues (Ser-Phe-Leu). Previous evidence indicates that the retention of the last three residues does not significantly alter the properties of the γ subunit (24Dietrich A. Brazil D. Jensen O.N. Meister M. Schrader M. Moomaw J.F. Mann M. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15174-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The relative positions of the chromatographic peaks corresponding to the various γ5 subunit forms are consistent with their expected hydrophobic properties (Fig. 3). γ5-6G appears earliest followed by γ5-3G. The additional Gly residues would be expected to reduce the overall hydrophobicity of these two proteins in that order. The point mutant contains an Ala residue in place of the hydrophobic Phe residue at position 59 and runs faster than the wild type. The deletion appears last, consistent with the removal of 10 residues from the relatively small γ5 subunit, which would increase the overall hydrophobicity of the prenylated protein. The geranylgeranylated forms that retain the last three residues appear after the geranylgeranylated and proteolyzed forms consistent with the retention of the hydrophobic Phe and Leu residues.Table IMasses of purified γ5 subunit formsProteinMass—expectedMass—observed (MALDI-MS)1-cMS, mass spectrometry.GP1-aMass of γ5 when geranylgeranylated, with the last three residues proteolytically removed and carboxyl-methylated.G1-bMass of γ5geranylgeranylated but not proteolytically processed.γ5-wt8123.728123.281-dMass spectrometry was performed on the whole β1γ5 complex.

Open table in a new tab First, we examined these βγ complexes using an assay that can detect gross changes in the conformation of the β subunit. The wild type βγ complex, when digested with trypsin, yields two fragments of ∼24 and 13 kDa as demonstrated before (31Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 482-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Significant changes in the three-dimensional structure of the β subunit would be expected to generate other fragments on trypsin digestion due to the exposure of masked Lys and Arg residues. All the mutants yielded the same fragments as the wild type (Fig. 4). The deletion mutant yielded an additional smaller fragment, which is not unexpected since the deletion of 10 residues at the C terminus of the γ subunit would expose previously masked residues on the β subunit surface (Fig. 4). Together these results indicated that the mutant βγ complexes were not significantly altered in their structure. Next we examined the βγ complexes containing the wild type and the mutant γ subunit forms for their ability to interact with the α subunit using the ADP-ribosylation assay. This test was performed to determine whether more subtle alterations in the structure of the βγ complex forms had occurred as a result of the mutations. Pertussis toxin catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribosyl group from NAD to the C-terminal Cys residue in several α subunit types. This transfer is considerably enhanced by the G protein βγ complex. The assay has therefore been traditionally used to measure the interaction between the α subunit and the βγ complex. Fig. 5 shows the results of ADP-ribosylation assays performed with the different γ5 subunit mutants. The dependence of αo ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin on increasing concentrations of βγ complexes was examined. None of the mutants showed significant differences from the activity of the wild type at any of the concentrations tested (with the exception of γ5-3G at 50 nm concentration,p ≤ 0.05). The alteration of the amino acid sequence at the C terminus and the repositioning of the prenyl moiety with reference to the β subunit therefore had no effect on the interaction of the mutant βγ complexes with the α subunit. These results also indicate that the γ5-3G, γ5-6G, and γ5−Δ forms that retain the last three residues have no significant impact on interaction with the α subunit. The phospholipase Cβ isozymes break PIP2to inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. These isozymes are activated by the G protein subunits, αq and the βγ complex (25Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, we examined the ability of the various mutants as well as the wild type βγ complex to activate the phospholipase Cβ2 isozyme. The recombinant form of PLCβ2 purified after expression using the baculovirus and Sf9 insect cell system was used (16Romoser V. Ball R. A V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Sankaran B. Osterhout J., Wu, D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). βγ concentration-dependent activation of PLCβ was measured in vitro. The wild type β1γ5complex stimulated the basal PLCβ2 activity about 20-fold. The β1γ5-3G, β1γ5-6G, and β1γ5-F59A mutants were significantly less active in stimulating the enzyme activity at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm βγ complex (Fig. 5). The deletion was not active at all concentrations tested. It is highly unlikely that the inability of γ5-Δ to activate PLCβ is due to the fraction of the processed form that retains the C-terminal three residues because the geranylgeranylated, proteolyzed form is about 40% of the geranylgeranylated form (Fig. 3), but even at a concentration of 400 nm β1γ5−Δ complex, no detectable activity is elicited from PLCβ2. Two different models can account for the unexpectedly dramatic effect of these mutants on their ability to regulate PLCβ activity. The attenuation of βγ function is especially striking in the case of the deletion and also in the case of the F59A mutant since this alters only one residue at the C terminus of the γ subunit. One model is based on the proposal that the prenyl moiety is buried in a cavity between blades 6 and 7 of the β subunit when it interacts with effectors, thus altering the conformation of the β subunit and exposing the appropriate residues for interaction with the effector molecule (7Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). With regard to this model, it should be noted that the crystallographic basis for the presence of the prenyl moiety is not conclusive since the electron density in the cavity was surmised to be the prenyl moiety and the last several residues of the γ subunit were unresolved (22Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of β subunit mutants that were altered at residues potentially in contact with the prenyl moiety or residues that showed conformational changes between free βγ complex and phosducin-bound βγ demonstrated that they were significantly affected in their ability to activate PLCβ (7Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the proposal that the prenyl moiety resides in the cavity between blades 6/7 when interacting with an effector, thus bringing about a conformational change in residues in the β subunit required for binding the effector. However, the crystal structure of an unprenylated βγ complex with phosducin deduced by another group (27Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) shows that the cavity between β subunit blades 6 and 7 still occurs even in the absence of the prenyl moiety. This result is not entirely consistent with the notion that the positioning of the prenyl moiety in the β subunit cavity is important for inducing the β subunit conformation required for interaction with an effector. Despite this concern, it is to be noted that some of the results obtained here from the analysis of the mutant β1γ5complexes are consistent with the above model. The γ5-Δ would be expected to shorten the C-terminal tail of the γ subunit significantly, thus preventing the prenyl moiety from reaching the pocket between blades 6 and 7 of the β subunit. The γ5-F59A mutant may not similarly have the prenyl moiety located appropriately in the β subunit pocket because an important anchoring site for the γ subunit C-terminal domain on the β subunit has been removed. The increasingly stronger effects of the 3G and 6G mutants on their ability to activate PLCβ is less clear within the context of this model. The addition of the Gly residues would be expected to extend the C-terminal tail but also to increase the conformational flexibility of this region. These mutants can also affect the positioning of the prenyl moiety in the β subunit pocket. An alternative model invokes the direct interaction of the prenyl moiety with PLCβ. Recent results indicate that PLCβ has a site that binds the prenyl moiety (13Fogg V.C. Azpiazu I. Linder M.E. Smrcka A. Scarlata S. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41797-41802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A prenylated peptide potently inhibits Gβγ stimulation of PLCβ. Fluorescence-based assays indicate direct interaction between the prenylated peptide and PLCβ. These results are consistent with the location of the prenyl moiety in a pocket present in PLCβ during βγ complex interaction with the effector enzyme. This role for the γ subunit prenyl moiety is also supported by the evidence from the crystal structure of the of Cdc42/RhoGDI complex (28Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The prenyl moiety at the C terminus of Cdc42 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket present in the protein partner RhoGDI. In this model for the interaction of the Gβγ complex with PLCβ, interaction is facilitated by the γ subunit prenyl moiety as well as several domains on the β subunit. Two-hybrid interaction, peptide studies, and mutational analyses have implicated several such domains on the β subunit in interaction with PLCβ and other effectors (2Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2056-2059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The prenyl moiety is predicted to stabilize these interactions of PLCβ with β subunit domains by directly anchoring itself in a hydrophobic pocket in PLCβ. The interaction between the βγ complex and PLCβ can be disrupted due to mutations that alter the β subunit binding sites, removal of the prenyl moiety, or most relevant to the results here, altering the position of the prenyl moiety with reference to the other binding sites on the β subunits. All mutants designed here are expected to alter the relative position of the prenyl moiety with reference to the β subunit surfaces postulated to contact the PLCβ and result in impaired interaction between the βγ complex and effector. The decreased ability of Gβγ containing the γ subunit mutants to activate PLCβ (Fig. 5) is consistent with this expectation. Finally, it cannot be discounted that the two different mechanisms outlined above are both involved in Gβγ regulation of PLCβ. The prenyl moiety may reside in the β subunit cavity transiently and then locate itself in a pocket in the PLCβ enzyme, stabilizing the interaction between the two proteins at different points of time during PLC activation.

In addition, the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges through a cysteine present in the linker peptide was observed. In contrast, transient expression in tobacco protoplasts resulted in a cytosolic scFv lacking disulfide bridges, which had a substantially reduced affinity for the antigen. This indicates that functionality rather than stability is determined by the presence of disulfide bridges in the in planta-expressed scFv antibody.

Disulfide bond formation and disulfide rearrangements are reversible processes and are kinetically and thermodynamically affected by the redox state of the environment (1Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev.

In eukaryotic cells, subcellular compartmentation plays an important role in the regulation of these reversible thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol in eukaryotic cells, and the preferential transport of the disulfide form (GSSG) compared with the reduced form (GSH) into the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumscFvsingle-chain FvNEMN-ethylmaleimideDTTdithiothreitolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinePBSTPBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumscFvsingle-chain FvNEMN-ethylmaleimideDTTdithiothreitolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinePBSTPBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween lumen is thought to be responsible in maintaining redox compartmentation between the ER and cytosol. For murine hybridoma cells, it was shown that in the secretory pathway the ratio of reduced glutathione to the disulfide form (GSH/GSSG) ranged from 1 to 3, whereas the overall cellular GSH/GSSG ratio ranged from 30 to 100 (3Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar).In vitro studies show that the redox environment of the ER corresponds with the optimum for refolding of disulfide-bonded proteins (3Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). In the ER, disulfide formation and rearrangements are further enhanced by protein disulfide isomerase (4Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.

Failure of disulfide formation has an adverse effect on various processes ranging from protein folding, oligomerization, and intracellular transport to secretion (5Alberini C.M. Bet P. Milstein C.

In extracellular proteins containing cysteine residues, there is rarely more than one free thiol group (11Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Free thiols are considered extremely reactive in the oxidizing extracellular environment and may lead to disastrous polymerization or make folding more complex (11Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The extracellular protein albumin carries a reactive free cysteine, but when not buried in the tertiary structure, this residue performs a specific physiological function (12Sengupta S. Chen H.

The general idea is that the typical glutathione redox state of the cytosol in eukaryotic cells does not favor the formation of protein disulfide bonds (2Gilbert H.F. Adv.

Also in prokaryotic organisms, intracellular disulfide bond formation seems to be hindered by the redox potential. Many recombinant proteins with disulfide bonds cannot fold properly in Escherichia coli, where the intracellular GSH-GSSG ratio ranges from 50 to 200 (3Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been suggested that the redox state of the cytosol in eukaryotes is not constant and may change in response to e.g. physiological and metabolic stimuli. Also specialized intracellular compartmentation may provide localized environments within the cell where the thiol-disulfide redox state may be very different from that of the bulk cytoplasm. However, apart from the comparison of the redox state of the ER with the intracellular environment as a whole, techniques to monitor changes or subtle subcellular redox compartmentation are nonexistent. Nevertheless, various lines of evidence indicate that redox modulation for some specific cytosolic proteins is an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic organisms (14Hérouart D. van Montagu M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrate that various cytosolic enzymes are reversibly activated or inactivated upon incubation with disulfides or thiols (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T.

These observations are consistent with metabolic changes in cell cultures, perfused organs, and whole animals induced by manipulating the cellular thiol to disulfide balance by applying reducing agents (7Tatu U.

Although the biological significance of reversible thiol-disulfide exchange reactions for the cytosol remains controversial, in chloroplasts there is little question about the role of redox modulation in regulating the activity of key enzymes (2Gilbert H.F.

Also, for nuclei, evidence has been obtained that redox modulation influences the activity of transcription factors (2Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). In this report the redox states of scFv antibodies located in either the ER or the cytosol of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) were compared. We establish that in transgenic plants intramolecular disulfide bridges are present in both the cytosolic scFv and the scFv located in the ER. The cytosolic scFv has binding properties that are similar to the scFv located in the ER. Furthermore, the scFvs present in the cytosol are, like the scFvs in the ER, capable of forming intermolecular disulfides through a cysteine present in the linker peptide. Transient expression of the scFv in the ER of tobacco protoplasts also shows intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges. Remarkably, no disulfide bridges are present when the scFv gene is expressed transiently in the cytosol. Although the expression levels are comparable with those in transgenic plants, the binding properties of this cytosolic scFv are very poor. The relationships between transformation system, subcellular location, redox potential, and disulfide bridge formation of heterologous proteins in the plant cytosol and the possible consequences are discussed.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and as a control, the empty transient expression vector pUCAP35S (26van Engelen F.A. Molthoff J.W. Conner A.J. Nap J.P. Pereira A. Stiekema W.J. Transgenic Res. 1995; 4: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) was used. To replace the cysteine residue in the linker of the anti-cutinase scFv 21C5 by a serine residue, the XhoI/PvuII fragment in pNEM-scFv was replaced by a suitable adapter (5′-TCGAGTCTGAGGTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGACCTCAGAC-3′), resulting in the pNEM-scFvser (Fig. 1). The scFv constructs were cloned as SalI/NotI fragments from pNEM-scFvserinto pRAP-scFv-SK, creating and pNEM-scFvser-SK. All modifications were verified by sequencing (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were obtained from transformed tobacco plants expressing scFv antibodies in the ER and cytosol at a level of 1 and 0.2% of total soluble protein (23Schouten A. Roosien J. van Engelen F.A. de Jong G.A.M. Borst-Vrenssen A.W.M. Zilverentant J.F. Bosch D. Stiekema W.J. Gommers F.J. Schots A. Bakker J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) by the method described (28Denecke J. Gosselé V. Botterman J. Cornelissen M. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 19-27Google Scholar). As a control, protoplasts were isolated from untransformed tobacco leaves (N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN). For transient gene expression assays the same procedure was used to obtain protoplasts from tobacco leaves (N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN). Then plasmid DNA was transfected to the protoplasts according to the polyethylene glycol procedure as described (28Denecke J. Gosselé V. Botterman J. Cornelissen M. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 19-27Google Scholar). The protoplasts from stable transformants or from a transfection assay expressing both scFv-SK and scFv-CK proteins were separated from the incubation medium and lysed by adding an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 80 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and subsequent vortexing. The suspension was kept at 0 °C for 5 min and at room temperature for 10 min. The chloroplasts were removed from the lysate by centrifugation, and the supernatant was split into two portions. The first portion received one-third volume of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 244 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% (w/v) SDS, 50% (w/v) glycerol, and the second portion received one-third volume of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 55 mm. Both samples were boiled for 5 min. To the DTT-containing portion NEM was added to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The proteins were pelleted by ethanol precipitation and subsequent centrifugation. After drying, the pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 0.008% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Protein samples were loaded on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad mini-protean system). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. For immunodetection, the membranes were incubated with 1:1000-diluted anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) (30Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) followed by a 1:5000-diluted rat-anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were stained in 0.1 methanolamine-HCl, pH 9.6, supplemented with 4 mmMgCl2, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.06 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.1 mg/ml). The relative molecular weights of the proteins were estimated with pre-stained low range molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). Protoplasts transfected with scFv-SK and scFvser-SK were separated from the incubation medium and lysed by adding an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequent vortexing. The chloroplasts were removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min. For Western analysis one-third volume 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to an aliquot of the supernatant, equaling 3 × 104protoplasts. DTT and bromphenol blue were added to final concentrations of 40 mm and 0.008% (w/v), respectively, and the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. For non-reducing gel electrophoresis, DTT was omitted during sample preparation. The protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electroblotting and immunodetection as described above. The affinity of the oxidized and reduced scFv for cutinase was determined by quantitative ELISA. To prevent disulfide bridge formation during sample preparation, alkylated protein samples were prepared as followed. The proteins from transgenic plants were extracted by grinding 0.2–0.4 g of tobacco leaves in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder. The powder was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and mixed 1:2 (w/v) with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 60 mm NEM, 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequent vortexing. As a control, extracts were prepared in the presence of 4% ethanol (the solvent of NEM) instead of NEM. The suspension was kept at 0 °C for 5 min and at room temperature for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13.000 × g. To the supernatant, 25% (v/v) 5× PBS, 0.5% (v/v) Tween, 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder was added. Serial dilutions were made in 1× PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween (PBST), 1% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, and loaded on an ELISA plate. Proteins from the protoplasts, transfected with pRAP-scFv-CK, pRAP-scFv-SK, and pUCAP35S, were obtained as follows. The cells were separated from the incubation medium and lysed by adding an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequent vortexing. The lysate was kept at 0 °C for 5 min and at room temperature for 10 min, and the chloroplasts were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was diluted with 5 volumes of PBST-1.25% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and loaded on a 96-well ELISA plate that had been coated overnight with 2.5 μg/ml cutinase in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6 (100 μl/well). After blocking for 30 min with 200 μl of PBST, 5% skimmed milk powder per well, the plates were washed, and 100 μl of protein extract per well was added. The plate was incubated for 2 h. After washing with PBST, each well was incubated for another 2 h with 100 μl of anti-c-Myc tag antibody 9E10 (1 ng/μl) in PBST, 1% skimmed milk powder. Then, after washing 3 times with PBST, the wells were incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rat-anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:5000 in PBST, 1% skimmed milk powder. Finally the wells were washed five times with PBST. 100 μl of substrate (0.75 mg/ml p- nitrophenylphosphate in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8) was added, and the A405 was monitored. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. We previously generated transgenic tobacco plants expressing functional scFv-CK and scFv-SK antibodies, which were located in the cytosol and ER, respectively (23Schouten A. Roosien J. van Engelen F.A. de Jong G.A.M. Borst-Vrenssen A.W.M. Zilverentant J.F. Bosch D. Stiekema W.J. Gommers F.J. Schots A. Bakker J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 25Schouten A. Roosien J. de Boer J.M. Wilmink A. Rosso M.-N. Bosch D. Stiekema W.J. Gommers F.J. Bakker J. Schots A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The scFv-SK antibody contains a signal sequence for translocation into the ER combined with the ER retention signal KDEL (31Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3171-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The scFv-CK, located in the cytosol, lacks the ER translocation signal. All scFv antibodies carry the c -Myc tag sequence for detection purposes. To compare the in vivo redox state of the disulfide bridges in the cytosolic scFv-CK and ER-located scFv-SK in both transgenic plants and transfected protoplasts, we isolated protoplasts from transgenic tobacco leaves according to the procedure used for a transient expression assay. The protoplasts were cooled and immediately lysed in the presence of the sulfhydryl alkylating agent NEM to block free thiols and prevent rearrangements of disulfide bonds. The scFv proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and immuno-detection using the anti-c-Myc antibody, 9E10 (Fig. 2). This showed under non-reducing conditions for both scFv-CK and scFv-SK, a protein band at 32 kDa, the estimated molecular mass of the scFv antibodies, and at ∼65 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). In the presence of the reducing agent DTT only a protein band at 33 kDa was detected (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). No protein bands were detected in protoplasts obtained from the plants transformed with the empty transformation vector pCPO33T (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Apparently, as reported before (32Biocca S. Cattaneo A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 248-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the reduction of the two intramolecular disulfide bridges in a scFv antibody results in the shift in migration from 32 to 33 kDa. The 65-kDa band present in both the scFv-CK and scFv-SK is only present under oxidizing conditions (i.e. in the absence of DTT) and, as reported before (23Schouten A. Roosien J. van Engelen F.A. de Jong G.A.M. Borst-Vrenssen A.W.M. Zilverentant J.F. Bosch D. Stiekema W.J. Gommers F.J. Schots A. Bakker J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), shows antigen binding capabilities. This suggests it to be a scFv dimer, formed through intermolecular disulfide bridge formation by the cysteine residue present in the linker peptide (Fig. 1). Thus, in transgenic tobacco, both the cytosolic scFv-CK and ER-located scFv-SK are present in an oxidized state. The transfected protoplasts synthesizing scFv-SK also showed the 32- and 65-kDa protein bands under non-reducing conditions and the 33-kDa band under reducing conditions (Fig 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Both under non-reducing and reducing conditions the protoplasts transfected with scFv-CK showed only the 33-kDa band (Fig2B, lanes 1 and 2). Only a weak background was detected in the transient expression assay when the empty expression vector pUCAP35S was transfected (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Therefore, in contrast to scFv-SK, the transiently expressed scFv-CK lacks the intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges and, thus, is present in a reduced state. This situation deviates from the oxidized scFv-CK present in stable transformed plants. To ascertain that the 65-kDa protein observed in the transgenic plants is formed through disulfide bridge formation using the cysteine present in the linker, we modified the linker region in the scFv-SK gene (Fig. 1). The cysteine-coding triplet (TGT) was changed into a serine-coding triplet (TCT), creating the scFvser-SK gene. We anticipated that, if the cysteine residue in the linker peptide was involved in dimer formation, scFvser-SK expression would not result in the formation of the disulfide band under non-reducing conditions. We only modified the scFv-SK gene because we wanted to analyze the 65-kDa band through a transient expression assay. Because as mentioned before the scFv-CK synthesized in a transfection assay does not form disulfide bridges, a transient expression assay with a modified scFv-CK would be useless to obtain the required information. The scFv-SK and scFvser-SK genes were both transfected to tobacco protoplasts, and the synthesized scFv proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and immuno-detection using the anti-c-Myc antibody, 9E10 (Fig. 3). Under non-reducing conditions scFv-SK expression resulted in a weak 32-kDa and relatively strong 65-kDa protein band, and the scFvser-SK expression resulted only in a 32-kDa protein band (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Under reducing conditions both scFv-SK and scFvser-SK expression resulted in 33-kDa protein bands (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). Under both conditions, only a weak background was detected in the transient expression assay with the empty expression vector pUCAP35S (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). The 65-kDa band is only formed under non-reducing conditions when the cysteine is present in the linker peptide, indicating that the 65-kDa protein represents a dimerized scFv. We were interested in whether the redox state of the 21C5 anti-cutinase scFv affected binding to the antigen cutinase. To determine the affinity by ELISA, we first prepared samples from transgenic tobacco leaves expressing scFv-CK, scFv-SK, and as a control, untransformed tobacco (N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN) in the presence of NEM. To exclude possible negative effects on the affinity by NEM (33Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem. 1979; 86: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we also prepared samples in the absence of NEM. The concentration of the scFv in these crude protein homogenates (Fig. 4A, inset) was calculated by comparison on Western blots with different concentrations of purified Ec-scFv, which is the 21C5 anti-cutinase scFv expressed in the periplasm of E. coli (23Schouten A. Roosien J. van Engelen F.A. de Jong G.A.M. Borst-Vrenssen A.W.M. Zilverentant J.F. Bosch D. Stiekema W.J. Gommers F.J. Schots A. Bakker J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions in duplicate of the scFv-SK and scFv-CK and untransformed tobacco samples were loaded on an ELISA plate coated with cutinase. As a reference duplicate serial dilutions of NEM-treated purified Ec-scFv were included in the assay. Fig. 4A shows the comparison of the antigen binding activity of scFv-CK and scFv-SK, both in the crude transgenic plant extracts, and purified Ec-scFv. Apparently, the binding properties are very similar. The plant proteins in the crude homogenates did not affect the A405values, as determined for the control samples, prepared from untransformed plants (not shown). Treatment with NEM does not affect the antigen binding properties of the anti-cutinase scFv since the samples prepared in the absence of NEM also show no significant difference in antigen binding activity in the same experiment (Fig. 4B). Next NEM-treated samples were prepared from the protoplasts transfected with the scFv-CK and scFv-SK expression vectors and the empty vector pUCAP35S as described before. As shown, the migration rate and the presence of the 65-kDa protein band indicates the redox state of the scFv antibody. Western analysis of the protoplasts showed 32- and 65-kDa bands for scFv-SK, indicating the oxidized nature, and a 33-kDa protein band for scFv-CK, indicating the reduced nature (Fig. 5A). The concentration of the scFv in these crude protein homogenates was calculated at 8 ng/μl for both scFv-SK and scFv-CK by comparison with different concentrations of Ec-scFv on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and immuno-detection using the anti-c-Myc antibody, 9E10. An ELISA binding assay was performed in triplicate using 150 ng of scFv-CK and scFv-SK. To calculate the binding, duplicate serial dilutions of NEM-treated Ec-scFv were included in the assay. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the antigen binding activity of scFv-CK and scFv-SK, both obtained from transfected protoplasts. Because the antigen binding activity of the Ec-scFv was similar to oxidized scFv-SK and scFv-CK (see Fig. 4), we calculated from the Ec-scFv reference that t"

Inhibition of CD8 binding to pMHC therefore inhibits T cell activation (2Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A-L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K. Dawson S.J. Phillips R.E. Jakobsen B.K.

Therefore, by mutating the CD8 contact site on β2m, and exchanging the mutant β2m into the native MHC, it should be possible to inhibit CTL activation. Initial coordinates were taken from the crystal structure of the complex between human MHC class I HLA-A2 and the T cell coreceptor CD8αα solved at 2.65-Å resolution and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (4Berman H.M.

Molecular dynamics and free energy perturbations were performed using CHARMM (version 27) (5Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp.

Water molecules were added to the complex by superimposing a 16-Å sphere of TIP3P water molecules centered at the β2m Lys58 Nζ atom. The solvent atoms were minimized by 500 steps of steepest descents followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient. At the next step, the entire system was relaxed with 500 steps of steepest descents that were switched to conjugate gradient until convergence criteria of r.m.s. gradient of the potential energy lower than 0.3 Kcal/mol·Å has been achieved. A 14-Å nonbonded cutoff was employed. The dielectric constant was unity. The system was simulated using a stochastic boundary molecular dynamics (7Brooks III, C.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The reference point for partitioning the system was the β2m Lys58Nζ atom. The system was divided into a 12-Å reaction region, a 4-Å buffer region, and a reservoir. The frictional coefficients for water oxygen and heavy atoms in the protein were 62 and 200 ps−1, respectively (8Brunger A.T. Huber R. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5153-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The relaxed system was equilibrated at 300 K for 150 ps with a time step of 1 fs followed by 1 ns performed for data collection with coordinates and energies saved to a disc every 1 ps. The β2m Lys58 was mutated using the Biopolymer and Homology modules in the MSI software package. For each mutation the procedure described above has been repeated. Relative binding Helmholtz free energies were calculated by the perturbation method (9Kollman P. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2395-2417Crossref Scopus (1870) Google Scholar) as follows: ΔG3 = HLA-A2/β2m(native) complex → HLA-A2/β2m(Lys→Glu) complex and ΔG4 = HLA-A2/β2m(native)/CD8αα complex → HLA-A2/β2m(Lys→Glu)/CD8αα complex. Since free energy is a state function, it is path-independent, and the free energy difference: ΔG4-ΔG3 is equal to the difference ΔG2-ΔG1 (see “Results”). Each perturbation was performed in two steps using a total number of 26 windows. At the first 16 windows the lysine Hδ1, Hε1, Hε2, Nζ, Hζ1, Hζ2, and Hζ3 atoms (including their charges) were deleted. Cδ atom type was modified to sp2carbonyl carbon. Hδ2 and Cε atom types were modified to carboxylate oxygens. At the last 10 windows, the charges of the remaining side chain were adjusted to asp side chain. Trajectories were produced by MD simulations at the same conditions to these described above with 150 ps of equilibration and 100 ps of data collection at every window. The extracellular fragment of soluble CD8αα (residues 1–120) was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded and purified as described previously (1Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J.

DNA constructs encoding the β2m mutants (Lys58 to Arg, Asp, Glu, Ser, Val, Tyr, Cys, SES, Trp, and GRG) were produced using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and checked by DNA sequencing of the entire coding fragment. The mutant proteins were expressed and the inclusion bodies purified as for the wild type.

Streptavidin (Sigma) was covalently coupled to Research Grade CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) via primary amines using the Amine Coupling kit (BIAcore). For coupling, the streptavidin was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and injected at 0.2 mg ml−1. Immobilization level was 6000 response units on average. Biotinylated HLA-A2/β2m (wild type and mutants) complexes were immobilized at 12,000–12,500 Response units by injection of 5–35 μl at 40–100 μg ml−1, at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. The injections of the different CD8αα (sCD8) and JM22-TCRαβ (sTCR) solutions were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. Kd values were obtained either by Scatchard plots or by nonlinear fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm (A + B ↔AB) equation [AB = B× ABmax/(Kd +B)] (where B is sCD8 (or sTCR) concentration and ABmax is maximum sCD8 (or sTCR) binding) to the data using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in the Windows 98 application Origin (version 6.1; Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). pBMC were isolated from fresh blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation.

Target cells in cytotoxicity assays were HLA-matched immortalized T cell hybridomas or Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) incubated with peptide as shown, or infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV), and labeled with51Cr (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and were >90% pure as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Vaccinia infections were effected at 3–5 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h and followed by a 6-h incubation period to allow expression prior to 51Cr labeling. The rVV expressing HIV-1 Nef was constructed from a full-length proviral clone isolated from donor SC1 according to standard protocols; wild type WR rVV was used to infect control target cells (16Broder C.C.

Stained cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson Calibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software. We employed 1-ns MD simulations to study the interactions between CD8αα, HLA-A2, and β2m molecules. We focused on the β2m Lys58 residue, which forms two key hydrogen bonds with CD8α-1 Asp75 Οδ2 and Val24 O (1Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y.

Five classes of Lys58mutations were studied: a mutation that preserves the positive charge (Lys58 → Arg), mutations to short polar side chains (Lys58 → Ser, Lys58 → C), mutations introducing steric hindrances via bulky side chains (Lys58→ Tyr, Lys58 → Trp) or insertions (Lys58→ SES, Lys58 → GRG), a mutation to a medium length hydrophobic side chain (Lys58 → Val), mutations to negatively charged side chains (Lys58 → Asp, Lys58 → Glu). We studied the hydrogen bond network formed between the wild type Lys58, or mutations of this residue, to CD8α-1 as shown in Table I. The perturbation to the conformation of the contact residues (CD8α-1:Arg4 , Asp75, Val24–Val26, β2m:Trp60, Lys58) (1Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I.

Open table in a new tab Neutralizing the Lys58 positive charge in silico leads to the loss of two H-bonds to CD8α-1 Asp75 Οδ2 and Val24 O atoms, as illustrated in Fig1 a and Table I, and formation of alternative hydrogen bonds with water molecules in the cavity of the HLA-A2/CD8αα/β2m complex. A mutation that preserves the positive charge (Lys58 → Arg) has a less dramatic effect: the H-bond to CD8α-1 Asp75 Οδ2 is preserved, and the r.m.s. value is similar to that of the wild type structure and smaller than that of the neutral Lys58 side chain. Therefore, eliminating the positive charge on the side chain is likely to reduce the binding affinity to the CD8αα. In short polar side chain mutants, Lys58 → Ser and Lys58 → Cys, the interaction with CD8αα is mediated through a water molecule as shown in Fig. 1 b and Table I. The side chain donates its hydroxyl or thiol hydrogen to a water molecule, which donates its hydrogen to CD8αα Val24 O. Unlike Lys58 → Ser, where the H-bond network is stable, the H-bond between the thiol moiety and the water molecule in the Lys58 → Cys mutant fluctuates during the simulation. This has an impact on the r.m.s. values shown in Table I, which increase from 0.70 for Lys58 → Ser to 0.93 for Lys58→ Cys. These results suggest that removing the H-donor group from the side chain at position 58 should reduce the binding affinity to CD8αα. Mutations introducing steric hindrance via a bulky side chain, Lys58 → Tyr and Lys58 → Trp, are illustrated in Fig. 1 c. The bulky side chain fills the cavity between HLA-A2/β2m and CD8αα, and the interaction with CD8αα is impaired by the lack of H-bonding, resulting in high r.m.s. values (Table I). Lys58 → GRG and Lys58 → SES insertions (Fig. 1 d) perturb the tertiary structure and lead to increased r.m.s. values of 1.21 and 1.78, respectively. The higher r.m.s. value of the Lys58 → SES insertion is due to reversal of the positive charge and the fact that serine has a side chain that contributes to the overall steric hindrance. The Lys58 → Val mutation yielded a higher r.m.s. value than all other single substitution mutations. In bulkier mutations, such as Lys58 → Trp, the side chain can orient itself toward the HLA-A2/β2m-CD8αα cavity, whereas the valine side chain is not long enough to have this effect. As a result, the hydrophobic side chain repels the polar CD8α-1 Asp75(Fig. 1 e). Fig. 1 f shows mutations to a negatively charged side chain (Lys58 → Asp, Lys58 → Glu). Repulsion between the carboxylates leads to an average distance of 6.27 Å between the CD8α-1 Asp75 Oδ2 and Lys58 → Asp Oδ1 oxygens. Strikingly, the distance between CD8α-1 Asp75 Oδ2 and Glu58 Oε1 oxygens in the Lys58 → Glu is only 4.09 Å. Both Lys58→ Asp and Lys58 → Glu are attracted to the positive charge on HLA-A2 Arg6 heavy chain: in 52.9% of the frames taken from the MD simulation, the distance between the mutated Glu58 Oε2 and HLA-A2 Arg6 Nη1 atoms was lower than 5 Å, fluctuating to a minimum of 3.18 Å. This interaction stabilizes the HLA-A2/β2m complex and orients the Lys58 → Glu side chain toward CD8α-1 Asp75. HLA-A2 Arg6 heavy chain attracts the Lys58 → Asp carboxylate as well; however since Lys58 → Asp side chain is shorter, it is distant from Asp75 Oδ2. We defined the free energies for the association reactions as following: ΔG1 = HLA-A2/β2m(native) complex + CD8αα→ HLA-A2/β2m(native)/CD8αα complex and ΔG2 = HLA-A2/ β2m(Lys→Glu) complex + CD8αα → HLA-A2/β2m(K→E)/CD8αα complex. We employed free energy perturbations to calculate the relative association free energy: ΔG2 − ΔG1 = +14.95 Kcal/mol. These results show that the complex containing β2m(Lys→E) has a considerable lower affinity for CD8αα than the wild type complex. The theoretical results show that, although the contribution of the β2m Lys58 to CD8αα binding is relatively small (1Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), its mutation should have a marked effect upon CD8αα binding. To test these predictions, we used SPR to measure the binding of soluble CD8αα (sCD8) and soluble JM22 T cell receptor (sTCR) to HLA-A2-influenza matrix peptide complex, containing wild type or mutant β2m (Fig. 2). The affinity of sTCR for pMHC was similar for all of the complexes studied (Table II), indicating that the active material on the chip surface was correctly folded. However, the absolute measurements of response varied markedly between the different complexes, indicating varying proportions of active material on the chip surface. This implies that some mutant β2m complexes are more stable than others. In particular, HLA complexes containing Lys58 to Tyr, Trp, SES, and GRG mutations show reduced stability (data not shown). These observations correlate with refolding efficiency, with yields of Lys58 → Arg and Lys58 → Glu complexes being several times higher than those for Lys58 → SES and Lys58 → GRG complexes (data not shown). This difference agrees with the MD simulations, which predict that the mutant Lys58 → Arg complex structure is closest to that of the wild type (Table I), and that the complex containing the β2m Lys58 → Glu mutant is stabilized by the interaction with HLA-A2 heavy chain R6.Table IISummary of affinity constantsImmobilized complexSoluble CD8αα binding (Kd in μm)2-aMean ± deviation from n independent determinations at 25 °C.Soluble JM22-TCRαβ binding (Kd in μm)2-aMean ± deviation from n independent determinations at 25 °C.Flu-HLA-A2/β2m wild type165 ± 35 (n= 9)8.6 ± 2 (n = 7)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → Arg300 (n = 1)2-bSimilar results were obtained with another peptide.10.6 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → Ser301 ± 1 (n = 2)10.5 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → Cys558 (n = 1)2-bSimilar results were obtained with another peptide.10.4 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → Val1084 (n = 1)7.1 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → GluNB (n = 4)2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).8.8 ± 0.8 (n = 4)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → AspNB (n = 1)2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).7.9 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → TyrNB (n = 2)2-bSimilar results were obtained with another peptide.2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).8.6 ± 1 (n = 2)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → TrpNB (n = 1)2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).4.9 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → SESNB (n = 1)2-bSimilar results were obtained with another peptide.2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).8.5 (n = 1)Flu-HLA-A2/β2m mutant Lys58 → GRGNB (n = 1)2-cNo binding (response too low to determine a Kd).6.2 (n = 1)2-a Mean ± deviation from n independent determinations at 25 °C.2-b Similar results were obtained with another peptide.2-c No binding (response too low to determine a Kd). Open table in a new tab There is a strong correlation between the measured sCD8 binding (Table II) and the predicted H-bonds network formed between Lys58and Asp75Οδ2 or Val24O (Table I). The wild type structure forms two hydrogen bonds and shows the highest affinity for sCD8. Complexes containing β2m mutants Lys58 → Arg, Ser, or Cys are predicted to form only a single H-bond (mediated through a water molecule for Lys58 → Ser and Lys58 → Cys) and show decreased binding affinity for sCD8 (Fig. 2, Table II). In complexes containing other β2m mutants (Lys58 mutations to Val, Asp, Tyr, Trp, GRG, SES, and Glu), where no H-bond was predicted, the sCD8 binding was negligible (Kd > 1 mm). Similarly, mutations of Asp59 and Trp60 also greatly reduced sCD8 binding (data not shown). The BIAcore binding data showed that sCD8 binding is undetectable in HLA complexes containing β2m in which Lys58is mutated to Glu (Fig. 2, Table II), yet this complex behaves identically to complexes containing wildtype β2m in terms of sTCR binding, refolding yield, and stability. The strong correlation between the predictions of the molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and biophysical measurements of sCD8 binding led us to conclude that the β2m mutant containing a glutamate residue at position 58 (Lys58 → Glu) was the most promising candidate for further investigation. The impact of mutating β2m on the interaction between soluble antigen and TCR expressed on the cell surface was investigated using tetrameric pMHC I complexes. Fluorochrome-labeled tetramers containing either wild type or Lys58 → Glu forms of β2m-stained CD8+ CTL at equivalent levels across a range of concentrations (Fig. 3 a). However, tetrameric complexes containing the Lys58 → Glu form of β2m were substantially impaired in their ability to activate CTL. This effect was titratable and most apparent at lower concentrations (Fig. 3 b). These data indicate that, at similar levels of interaction with cell surface TCR, the impaired ability of complexes containing the Lys58 → Glu form of β2m to engage the CD8 coreceptor translates into a biologically significant effect. This is consistent with previous work demonstrating that the major role of the CD8 coreceptor is the provision of signaling moieties that allow an enhanced sensitivity to antigen (2Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A-L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K. Dawson S.J. Phillips R.E. Jakobsen B.K. Bell J.I. Sewell A.K. J. Biol.

The effects of soluble exogenous wild type and mutant β2m proteins on CTL interactions with target cells expressing pMHC I antigenic complexes were assessed using standard 51Cr release cytolytic assays. At concentrations of pMHC on the target cell surface insufficient to saturate the maximal lytic capacity of the CTL, exogenous wild type β2m, and those mutants that efficiently refold with soluble MHC class I heavy chain to form stable complexes, consistently enhanced CTL-mediated lysis and interferon-γ production (data not shown). This effect likely relates to the ability of these proteins to stabilize pMHC class I on the target cell surface in a TCR-cognate form and is consistent with previous work (3Rock K.L. Rothstein L.E.

At higher concentrations of pMHC class I on the target cell surface, exogenous mutant forms of β2m that impair CD8 binding to pMHC class I were found to inhibit CTL-mediated lysis (Fig. 3 c). In all experiments with CD8-dependent CTL, the Lys58 → Glu mutant was the most potent inhibitor of CTL activation. These results indicate that mutant forms of β2m can, through inhibition of CD8 binding to complexed pMHC I, antagonize CTL activation. The potential use of such reagents in a therapeutic setting requires an effect on whole blood antigen-specific responses mounted by polyclonal unmanipulated CTL. We examined this using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from donor SC21, an HIV-1-infected individual with a potent CTL response to the viral Nef protein that maps predominantly to the HLA B7-restricted epitope RPMTYKGAL (residues 75–83). The Lys58 → Glu mutant was found to inhibit this fresh PBMC lytic response to endogenously presented pMHC class I antigen in comparison to equimolar levels of wild type β2m (Fig. 3 d). In conclusion, we have developed stable β2m mutants that inhibit CD8 coreceptor binding to pMHC I and exert an inhibitory effect on CTL activation. These data suggest that such mutant forms of β2m could be used to selectively modulate the CD8+ cellular immune response, a principle that could be applied therapeutically (21Xu X.

https://openalex.org/W1981880189,"Structural features underlying retention of the SERCA pump in intracellular compartments and the sorting of the PMCA pump to the plasma membrane are not known. The biochemical properties of the two pumps suggest that their differential localization may respond to specific functional demands. The two pumps may control Ca(2+) gradients of different magnitude and dynamic properties. For instance, it has recently become clear that the Ca(2+) gradient across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is smaller than that across the plasma membrane. Previous experiments with chimerical constructs of the SERCA and PMCA pumps had suggested a role for the amino-terminal domain in the ER retention of the SERCA pump. Experiments aimed at narrowing down the region responsible for the retention now indicate that the first 28 amino acids of the SERCA pump may play a role in membrane localization. Results also suggest that the formation of oligomers (possibly through the first 28 amino acids) might be critical to the retention mechanism."

Four sites of alternative splicing have been reported, extra domain A, extra domain B, the variable (V or IIICS) region, and a cartilage-specific (C) region composed of nucleotides that encode protein segments III-15 and I-10. In adult canine and equine articular cartilage, 50–80% of the FN transcripts have an unique splicing pattern, designated (V + C)−, that deletes both the V and C regions (12MacLeod J.N.

Dimerization patterns of the (V + C)− isoform were studied under native conditions within canine articular cartilage and experimentally in COS-7, NIH-3T3, and CHO-K1 cell cultures (13Burton-Wurster N.

In all systems, the (V + C)−isoform exists predominantly in a homodimeric configuration. Heterodimers composed of (V + C)− and the other V-region splice variants (V+C+ or V−C+) are either not observed or detected at only low levels. The homodimeric configuration of (V + C)−FN does not reflect the laws of random assortment (14Schwarzbauer J.E. Mulligan R.C. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By using isoform-specific constructs, it was shown that this pattern results from a problem with heterodimer formation involving the (V + C)− isoform, rather than secretion (13Burton-Wurster N.

FN dimers containing the extra domain A and extra domain B domains are incorporated more efficiently into pre-existing matrices (18Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. J.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the segments III-15 and I-10 through I-12 are actively involved in FN matrix assembly, and deletion of even one of the type I modules reduces the matrix assembly activities. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that the restricted dimerization pattern of (V + C)− FN is related to the absence of III-15 and/or I-10 protein segments, and we study the matrix structure of this naturally occurring isoform. Deminectins (DNs) are amino-terminal truncations of rat FN extending from within segment III-8 to the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). Construction of DN1, DN2, and DN3 have been described previously, and they have been shown to model accurately the dimerization profiles of native full-length FN isoforms (13Burton-Wurster N.

The first fragment extended from a 5′ PstI site in the region encoding III-12 to a targeted junction site defined by the desired construct. The 5′ end of the second fragment started from the same targeted junction site and extended to a 3′ SalI site downstream of nucleotides encoding the carboxyl terminus. Oligonucleotide primers used to generate the two PCR fragments were designed with overlaps in the targeted junction region between 18 and 24 nucleotides in length (Table I). This overlap allowed fusion of the two fragments in a third PCR that used only the 5′ (TGG TTC AGA CTG CAG TGA)- and 3′ (TCT AGA GTC GAC CCG G)-flanking primers. The resulting fusion product was digested with PstI and SalI and substituted for the corresponding PstI/SalI fragment of DN1. The only exception was construction of DN14, which required two independent PCR-SOEing steps (DN14a and DN14b in Table I). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and PCR amplifications were carried out with Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

The only exception was construction of DN14, which required two independent PCR-SOEing steps (DN14a and DN14b). Each DN construct, both singly and in combination with the other DNs, was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection number 1651-CRL, Manassas, VA) using Superfect transfection reagents following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The amount of DNA used for each co-transfection was adjusted empirically to achieve approximately equal expression levels. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were re-fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Conditioned media were collected another 24 h later, clarified by centrifugation (175 × g), stabilized with protease inhibitors (0.3 mm benzamidine, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm N- ethylmaleimide, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, final concentrations), and frozen at −20 °C pending analysis of dimerization patterns. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) SDS without β-mercaptoethanol. Heterodimers, homodimers, and monomers of recombinant DNs were separated according to size on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in Tris glycine buffer at pH 8.6 (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205492) Google Scholar), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (24Towbin H.

Schwarzbauer J.E. Wright R.L. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3827-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer at Princeton University), followed by either a peroxidase-linked (Sigma) or a 35S-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The binding epitope of IC-3 has been localized to the cell binding region within III-8 to III-11, 2J. Schwarzbauer, personal communication. which is common to all FN isoforms. Relative binding affinities of IC-3 to the DN constructs are equivalent to anti-human FN polyclonal IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aurora, OH; data not shown). Peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection system, Amersham Biosciences), and 35S decay events were measured by a PhosphorImager (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). Band intensities on radiograph films or PhosphorImager plates were quantified using MacBas software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Quantitative data obtained with the two protein detection strategies (ECL versus 35S-labeled secondary antibody) yielded comparable results (data not shown). Therefore, for DNs with higher level of expression, band intensities were quantified with the35S-labeled secondary antibody. The increased sensitivity of the ECL system was useful in samples where DN expression was reduced. Relative homodimer and heterodimer percentages were calculated with total band intensity of DN set at 100%. All quantitative data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate co-transfection experiments. Construction of recombinant baculovirus containing the rat V+C+ construct has been described previously (26Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Full-length (V + C)− FN cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus vector PVL 1392 (BD PharMingen). Recombinant viruses were generated according to established procedures (27O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 124-138Google Scholar). To produce recombinant protein, 50% confluent T175 flasks of Sf21 cells that had been adapted for growth under serum-free conditions (gift from Dr. Ping Wang at Cornell University) were incubated with recombinant viruses for 2 h in Excell-400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). After re-feeding, conditioned media from infected cells were collected 48 h later and clarified by centrifugation (175 × g). The mixture of protease inhibitors (above) was added to inhibit proteolysis. Recombinant FN proteins were purified using affinity chromatography columns of gelatin-agarose (Amersham Biosciences), followed by heparin-agarose (Pierce) as described by Poulouin et al. (28Poulouin L. Gallet O. Rouahi M. Imhoff J.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified FN was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a polyclonal (goat) antiserum to human FN, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) as described previously (29Wurster N.B. Lust G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). FN null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (30Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K.

A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison). The fibroblasts were plated into the wells (3 × 104cells/well) of immunofluorescence slides (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FN-depleted fetal bovine serum (31Engavall E. Ruoslathi E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), glutamine (0.29 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). After a 3-h period for cell attachment and spreading, media were removed, and the cells were re-fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30 μg/ml of either rat plasma FN (pFN, Sigma), recombinant V+C+ FN, or recombinant (V + C)−FN. The cellular assembly of a FN matrix was allowed to proceed for 24 h. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated sequentially with a monoclonal antibody against rat FN (IC-3) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) overnight at 4 °C. After rinses, the slides were covered with prolong anti-fade mounting media (Molecular Probe). The pattern of fluorescence was assessed with an Olympus IX70 confocal microscope using an argon laser with 488 nm excitation and bandpass filters for collecting green fluorescence. Unlike the V+C+ and V−C+ FN isoforms that can heterodimerize efficiently with each other, the cartilage-specific (V + C)− FN isoform exists predominantly as homodimers within canine articular cartilage (13Burton-Wurster N. Gendelman R. Chen H., Gu, D.-N. Tetreault J.W. Lust G. Schwarzbauer J.E. MacLeod J.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This dimerization pattern of (V + C)− FN is retained in experimental cell culture models (13Burton-Wurster N. Gendelman R. Chen H., Gu, D.-N. Tetreault J.W. Lust G. Schwarzbauer J.E. MacLeod J.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and led to the hypothesis that absence of the III-15 and/or I-10 protein segments restricts heterodimerization with the other two V-region splice variants (V+C+ or V−C+). To test the hypothesis, an experimental system using truncated versions of FN, termed DNs, was utilized. In addition to DN1 representing the V+C+ isoform, DN2 representing the V−C+ isoform, and DN3 representing the (V + C)− isoform, five new DN constructs, DN4 to DN8, were made with various combinations of the V, III-15, and I-10 segments deleted (Fig. 1). Either DN1 or DN3 was transiently co-transfected into COS-7 cells with one of the other seven DNs. Homodimers, heterodimers, and monomers of expressed DNs in conditioned medium were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and detected using immunoblots. Culture media from cells transfected with only single DNs were run in parallel to confirm the identity of homodimers. As illustrated in Fig. 2, there are two dimerization patterns observed following co-transfection of DN1 with other DNs. They either have the potential to form a heterodimer or remain only as their corresponding homodimers. For example, DN1 does not form heterodimers with DN6 (Fig. 2, panel a). When they are co-transfected into COS-7 cells, only bands corresponding to DN1 and DN6 homodimers are formed (Fig. 2, lane 2). In contrast, DN1 heterodimerizes efficiently with DN7 (Fig. 2, panel b). Co-transfection of these two DNs results in a large amount of heterodimers (Fig. 2, lane 5) that have an intermediate size between DN1 (Fig. 2, lane 4) and DN7 homodimers (Fig. 2,lane 6). Since DN1, DN4, and DN5 are very similar in size, DN1/DN4 and DN1/DN5 heterodimers could not be resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE. Therefore, full-length rat V+C+ FN (FN1) was co-transfected with DN4 or DN5. FN1 heterodimerizes with DN5 (Fig. 2,panel c) but not DN4 (not shown). Fig. 2 B summarizes the quantitative ratios of homodimer/heterodimer formation in each co-transfection combination with DN1 (or FN1). DN1 (or FN1) does not heterodimerize well with DN3, DN4, DN6, and DN8, whereas it heterodimerizes efficiently with DN2, DN5, and DN7. A similar experimental strategy was used to analyze the heterodimerization potential of DN3. Again, two general dimerization patterns are observed (Fig. 3). For example, DN3 heterodimerizes with DN4 (Fig. 3, panel a) and with DN6 (Fig. 3, panel c). Co-transfection of DN3 with either DN4 or DN6 results in a high level of intermediate-sized heterodimers. In contrast, DN3 does not heterodimerize with DN5 (Fig. 3, panel b). Co-transfected cells express only DN3 and DN5 homodimers (Fig. 3, lane 5). Fig. 3 B lists the relative percentages of DN3 homodimers, DN3/DN X heterodimers, and DN X homodimers. DN3 does not heterodimerize with DN1 and DN5 but heterodimerizes with the other DNs to varying degrees. Comparative heterodimerization patterns of DN1 and DN3 are summarized in Table II. The percentages of DN1/DN X and DN3/DN X heterodimers are scored in deciles by asterisks (≤10%, *; 11–20%, **; 21–30%, ***; 31–40%, ****; ≥41%, *****). The data indicate that isoforms that include segment I-10 heterodimerize preferentially with DN1, which also includes the I-10 segment. Similarly, isoforms that lack protein segment I-10 heterodimerize preferentially with DN3, which also lacks the I-10 segment. For each DN X, the level of DN1/DN X heterodimerization is significantly different (p < 0.05) than the level of DN3/DN X heterodimerization. The data also indicate that the presence or absence of protein segments V and III-15 does not influence substantially whether heterodimerization is favored with DN3 or DN1.Table IISummary of the dimerization patterns of DN1 and DN3 with co-transfected DNsDN XProtein segmentsDimerizationVIII-15I-10DN1/DN XDN3/DN XDN1+++******DN3−−−******DN2−++*******DN4++−* 2-aFull-length FN-1 was substituted for DN-1 to enable band resolution by SDS-PAGE.****DN5+−+***** 2-aFull-length FN-1 was substituted for DN-1 to enable band resolution by SDS-PAGE.*DN6−+−*****DN7−−+*********DN8+−−****The presence or absence of V, III-15, and I-10 protein segments in the various DN constructs is indicated by the + or − sign.

Is there something specific about protein segment I-10 that regulates the heterodimerization patterns of DN1 and DN3, or is it simply necessary to have a balanced number of type I repeats at the carboxyl terminus? For example, it could be necessary to have the same number of carboxyl-terminal type I repeats on each monomeric FN subunit for efficient interchain association or as structural elements for proper alignment. To answer this question, DN9 and DN10, which delete I-11 and I-12 protein segments, respectively, were prepared (Figs. 1and 4 B). DN4, DN9, and DN10 all contain V and III-15, but each has a different combination of two type I repeats at the carboxyl terminus. These constructs were co-transfected individually with DN3 into COS-7 cells. The results are shown in Fig. 4. If a balanced number of type I repeats at the carboxyl terminus determines heterodimerization efficiency, then DN3 would be expected to form similar amounts of heterodimers with DN4, DN9, and DN10. Although DN3 does heterodimerize with all three (Fig. 4 A), the levels of heterodimer formation are significantly different (Fig. 4 B). DN3 heterodimerizes most efficiently with DN4, both of which lack protein segment I-10. DN13 and DN14 were constructed to enable a parallel analysis with DN1. They are structurally similar to DN7, all three lacking V and III-15, but segment I-10 is removed and substituted with duplications of either I-11 (DN13) or I-12 (DN14) (Figs. 1 and5 B). As reported in Fig. 5, these changes greatly reduce the formation of DN1 heterodimers. Once again, efficient heterodimerization of different DN isoforms requires that both subunits have the same I-10 status. In this case, both DN1 and DN7 contain protein segment I-10 and heterodimerize most efficiently. The unique primary structure and restricted heterodimerization of (V + C)− FN raise the potential that this isoform may have different matrix assembly characteristics that influence the matrix organization and biomechanical properties of cartilage. To explore this possibility and compare FN matrix structure, pFN, recombinant V+C+ FN, and recombinant (V + C)−FN (30 μg/ml) were added to mouse embryo"
https://openalex.org/W2092383666,"In a variety of <i>Drosophila</i> TATA-less promoters, transcription is directed by initiator (Inr) sequences, which are faithfully and efficiently recognized only when flanked 3′ by the downstream promoter element (DPE). This motif, which is conserved at ∼30 bp from the RNA start site, is viewed as a downstream counterpart to the TATA box, and is recognized by the general transcription factor (TF) IID. By transient expression assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we show that DE1 (distal element 1), a DNA motif located at residues +23 to +29, sustains faithful Inr-dependent transcription as efficiently as the DPE. Transcription significantly increased when DE1 and DPE sequences were adjacently placed on the same template. Results emerging from <i>in vivo</i> RNA analyses matched electrophoretic mobility shift assay data. In agarose-electrophoretic mobility shift assays, retarded DNA-protein complexes resulting from the interaction of human holo-TFIID with either Inr<sup>+</sup>/DPE<sup>+</sup> or Inr<sup>+</sup>/DE1<sup>+</sup> promoters were formed at comparable levels, whereas binding of TFIID to both DE1 and DPE motifs was 2-fold increased. The strict requirement for spacing between the Inr and DPE was not observed for DE1, as locating the motif 4 bp away from the +1 site did not impair transcriptional enhancement. DE1 sequences may be common to many promoters and be overlooked because of their poor sequence homology."
