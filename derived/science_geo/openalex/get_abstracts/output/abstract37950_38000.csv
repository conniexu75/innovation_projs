https://openalex.org/W1992682395,"The clonal composition of human colorectal tumors was studied by means of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). First, X-linked RFLPs were used to examine the pattern of X chromosome inactivation in colorectal tumors of females. All 50 tumors examined showed monoclonal patterns of X chromosome inactivation; these tumors included 20 carcinomas as well as 30 adenomas of either familial or spontaneous type. Second, RFLPs of autosomes were used as clonal markers to detect the somatic loss or gain of specific chromosomal sequences in colorectal tumors. Among other changes, it was found that somatic loss of chromosome 17p sequences occurred in over 75 percent of the carcinomas examined, but such loss was rare in adenomas. These data support a monoclonal origin for colorectal neoplasms, and suggest that a gene on the short arm of chromosome 17 may be associated with progression from the benign to the malignant state."
https://openalex.org/W2020002174,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a suspected causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia. One of the viral genes encodes a protein (tat) that not only results in transactivation of viral gene expression but may also regulate the expression of certain cellular genes that are important for cell growth. Transgenic mice that expressed the authentic tat protein under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat were generated, and cell types that are permissive for the viral promoter and the effects of the tat gene on these cells were studied. Three of eight founder mice with high levels of expression of the transgene in muscle were bred and then analyzed. All developed soft tissue tumors at multiple sites between 13 to 17 weeks of age. This phenotype was transmitted to nine of nine offspring that inherited the tat gene and were available for analysis. The remaining five founders expressed the transgene in the thymus, as well as in muscle. This second group of mice all exhibited extensive thymic depletion and growth retardation; in all of these mice, death occurred between 3 to 6 weeks of age before tumors became macroscopically visible. The tat gene under the control of the HTLV-1 regulatory region showed tissue-specific expression and the tat protein efficiently induced mesenchymal tumors. The data establish tat as an oncogenic protein and HTLV-1 as a transforming virus."

https://openalex.org/W1984441851,"Using in vivo dimethylsulfate footprinting, we have analyzed protein-DNA interactions within two regions upstream of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene that are characterized by an altered chromatin structure in TAT-expressing as compared to nonexpressing cells. All the identified protein contacts to DNA are found exclusively in the TAT-expressing hepatoma cells. In vitro analyses of specific DNA-binding factors in crude nuclear extracts yield DNAase I footprints that correlate well with the binding sites in vivo. Surprisingly, all DNA-binding activities are present in nuclei of TAT-expressing and nonexpressing cells, indicating that the mere presence of factors is not sufficient for their interaction with a binding site in vivo. Genomic sequencing reveals methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the regions analyzed in nonexpressing cells, whereas no methylation is found in TAT-expressing cells. In vitro methylation at a cytosine residue within a footprint region prevents the interaction of a factor with its binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2054778208,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been associated with the neurologic disorder tropical spastic paraparesis and possibly with multiple sclerosis. The tat gene of HTLV-1 under control of its own long terminal repeat is capable of inducing tumors in transgenic mice. The morphologic and biologic properties of these tumors indicate their close resemblance to human neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease), the most common single gene disorder to affect the nervous system. The high spontaneous incidence of this disease, together with the diverse clinical and pathologic features associated with it, suggests that environmental factors may account for some of the observed cases. Multiple tumors developed simultaneously in the transgenic tat mice at approximately 3 months of age, and the phenotype was successfully passed through three generations. The tumors arise from the nerve sheaths of peripheral nerves and are composed of perineural cells and fibroblasts. Tumor cells from these mice adapt easily to propagation in culture and continue to express the tat protein in significant amounts. When transplanted into nude mice, these cultured cells efficiently induce tumors. Evidence of HTLV-1 infection in patients with neural and other soft tissue tumors is needed in order to establish a link between infection by this human retrovirus and von Recklinghausen's disease and other nonlymphoid tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2003403328,"Efforts to solve the epidemiologic puzzle of AIDS in Africa are complicated by the presence of multiple human retroviruses. Simple serologic tests that unambiguously distinguish among infections by these retroviruses are essential. To that end, a partially conserved immunoreactive epitope was identified in the transmembrane glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2. Synthetic peptides derived from these conserved domains were used in sensitive and specific immunoassays that detect antibodies in sera from patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2. By making single amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 peptide, it was possible to demonstrate HIV-1 strain-specific antibody responses to this epitope. Such custom-designed peptides synthesized from this domain are likely to detect newly discovered HIV types, define infection with specific HIV strains, and allow detection of group-common antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2081133904,"The long-term effects of excitotoxic lesions in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis of the rat were found to mimic several neuropathological and chemical changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Neuritic plaque-like structures, neurofibrillary changes, and neuronal atrophy or loss were observed in the frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex 14 months after the lesions were made. Cholinergic markers in neocortex were reduced, while catecholamine and indoleamine metabolism was largely unaffected at this time. Bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis increased somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in the cortex of the rat by at least 138 and 284 percent, respectively, suggesting a functional interaction between cholinergic and peptidergic neurons that may differ from that in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1993473929,Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding portions of the amyloid beta protein were used to investigate possible amyloid gene duplication in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. A strategy employing two Eco RI restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by the amyloid cDNAs was used. RFLPs allow the detection of a 2:1 gene dosage in the DNA of any individual who is heterozygous for a particular RFLP. The amyloid gene regions homologous to the cDNAs used were not duplicated in the DNA from brains of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Similar results were also obtained with a strategy employing a test for 3:2 gene dosage.
https://openalex.org/W2091911262,"The possibility that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by overexpression or duplication of one or more genes on chromosome 21 has been raised by the observation of AD-like neuropathologic changes in individuals with Down syndrome and by the mapping of both the defect for familial AD and the amyloid beta protein gene to this autosome. Possible duplication on chromosome 21 was investigated in both familial and sporadic AD by means of restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the amyloid and SODI loci, as well as for DNA markers in the vicinity of the familial AD defect and in the critical Down syndrome region of chromosome 21. No evidence of increased DNA dosage was observed in either brain or leukocytes of patients with inherited or sporadic forms of AD. Duplication of these regions is therefore not a frequent event in either form of AD. Furthermore, no significant allelic association was detected between AD and any of the loci, including the amyloid and SODI genes, providing no support for the hypothesis that defects in these specific genes are the primary cause of AD."
https://openalex.org/W1604493583,"Activation of platelet adenylate cyclase by prostaglandin E1 or prostacyclin is initiated through the interaction of the agonists with the same receptors on membrane. Prostaglandin E1/prostacyclin receptors of human platelets were solubilized in buffer, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The soluble membrane protein was chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column and assayed by a microfiber filter by equilibrium binding technique. The active fractions eluted at 0.7 M KCl were pooled, and the receptors were purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration with an overall recovery of 30%. The isolated receptor was 2,200-fold purified over the starting platelets. As evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the receptor showed a molecular mass of 190,000 daltons and is composed of two nonidentical subunits with molecular masses of 85,000 and 95,000 daltons. The interaction of prostaglandin E1 with the purified receptor was rapid, saturable, reversible, and highly specific. Among all prostaglandins tested, only prostacyclin was capable of displacing [3H]prostaglandin E1 bound to the receptor. Scatchard analysis of [3H]prostaglandin E1 binding to the purified receptor suggested the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites (Kd = 9.8 nM) and a second population of low affinity binding sites (Kd = 0.7 microM) in the same protein molecule. Incubation of the purified receptor with platelets stripped of the receptor by washing with low concentrations of Triton X-100 efficiently restored the ability of prostaglandin E1 and prostacyclin to activate adenylate cyclase in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985665337,"Two mutagenic events are required to make null mutations of polyhomeotic (ph), which suggests that the locus is complex. Amorphic mutations (ph°) die in mid-embryogenesis and completely lack ventral thoracic and abdominal epidermal derivatives, whereas single-event mutations lead to transformations similar to those of known dominant gain of function mutants in the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes. After a chromosomal walk, the ph gene was localized using deficiencies and ph mutations that result from DNA rearrangements. Hybridization analyses show that there are two large, duplicated sequences in the ph region, and DNA lesions affecting either one of these repeats alter the function of the ph locus. We propose a model that may account for this unusual functional organization."

Y., Bentz, H., Rosen, D. M., McPherson, J. M., Conti, A., Siegel, N. R., Galluppi, G. R., and Piez, K. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem., 261, 5693-5695) and a unique protein homologous to TGF-beta (Seyedin S. M., Segarini, P. R., Rosen, D. M., Thompson, A. Y., Bentz, H., and Graycar, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem., 262, 1946-1949), respectively. Although the biological activities of TGF-beta and CIF-B are similar, the divergence of CIF-B from the highly conserved amino acid sequence of TGF-beta prompted an investigation of its receptor binding properties. Three classes of cell surface binding components were identified. Class A has exclusive affinity for TGF-beta; class B has greater affinity for CIF-B; and class C has equal affinity for both proteins. A high molecular weight component, the predominant binding species, was further characterized and shown to consist of two components that are either class B or class C. The differential binding properties of TGF-beta and CIF-B to cell surface components suggest that there are biological activities unique to each of the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1501857460,A liver microsomal enzyme catalyzes the vitamin K-dependent posttranslational carboxylation of specific glutamyl residues of a limited number of plasma proteins to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. The intracellular precursor forms of these proteins are known to contain a homologous basic amino acid-rich propeptide region between the signal peptide region and the amino terminus of the mature protein. This region of the precursor protein has been implicated as a possible recognition site for the carboxylase enzyme. A 20-residue peptide containing the octadecapropeptide of human clotting factor X has now been shown to strongly stimulate the activity of the enzyme toward a noncovalently linked substrate. This stimulatory effect is seen at less than micromolar concentrations and is accompanied by a decrease in the Km of the glutamic acid substrate. These observations raise the possibility that the catalytic activity of other enzymes involved in protein processing may be regulated by a portion of their normal substrates.
https://openalex.org/W1528457987,"The peptide network of Streptococcus pneumoniae cell walls was solubilized using the pneumococcal autolytic amidase (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, EC 3.5.1.28). The peptide material was fractionated into size classes by gel filtration followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography which resolved the peptide population into over 40 fractions. About 40% of the lysines present participate in cross-links between stem peptides. The main components (3 monomers, 5 dimers, and 2 trimers), accounting for 77% of all the wall peptides, were purified. Their structures were determined using a combination of amino acid and end-group analysis, mass spectrometry, and gas-phase sequencing. Two different types of cross-links between stem peptides were found. In the most abundant type there is an alanylserine cross-bridge between the alanine in position 4 of the donor stem peptide and the lysine at position 3 of the acceptor peptide, as in type A3 peptidoglycan. In the second type of cross-link there is no intervening cross-bridge, as in the type A1 peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria. The data indicate that pneumococcal peptidoglycan has a structural complexity comparable to that recently shown in some Gram-negative species."
https://openalex.org/W1546636541,"Thyroid hormone regulates the expression of ventricular myosin isoenzymes by causing an accumulation of alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA and inhibiting expression of beta-MHC mRNA. However, the mechanism of thyroid hormone action has been difficult to examine in vivo because of its diverse actions. Accordingly, hormonal control of expression of six MHC isoform mRNAs and cardiac and skeletal alpha-actin mRNAs was studied in primary cultures of fetal rat heart myocytes grown in defined medium. The results indicate that in the absence of thyroid hormone, cultured heart cells express predominantly beta-MHC and cardiac alpha-actin mRNAs. Addition of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) caused a rapid induction of alpha-MHC mRNA and decreased beta-MHC mRNA levels without affecting the skeletal muscle MHC mRNAs. There was an almost parallel change in the myosin isoenzymes. Cardiac alpha-actin mRNA levels were transiently increased by T3 treatment, but skeletal alpha-actin was unaffected. Elimination of insulin and epithelial growth factor from the medium did not alter the effects of T3 on cardiac MHC mRNA expression. Addition of various adrenergic agents to the medium had no appreciable effect on cardiac MHC mRNA expression despite the presence of functionally coupled alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Addition of steroid hormones, muscarinic agents, and glucagon to the medium also had no effect. Thus, under defined conditions, T3 is able to regulate MHC gene expression at a pretranslational level without the need for other exogenous factors."
https://openalex.org/W1489725659,"Abstract To examine the potential mechanisms by which somatostatin inhibits gastric acid secretion we studied its effects on isolated canine gastric parietal cells. Using 125I-[Leu8-D-Trp22-Tyr25]somatostatin-28 as ligand, we identified somatostatin-binding sites in parietal cell-enriched fractions of fundic mucosa. Two binding sites with respective dissociation constants of 3.2 X 10(-9) and 2.1 X 10(-7) M were identified. Somatostatin-14 and -28 were equally potent both in displacing bound ligand and in inhibiting parietal cell activity as measured by [14C]aminopyrine uptake. Pertussis toxin reversed the ability of somatostatin to inhibit the uptake of [14C]aminopyrine and production of cAMP by parietal cells stimulated with histamine and forskolin but not with dibutyryl cAMP or pentagastrin. Furthermore, somatostatin had no effect on parietal cell membrane inositol phospholipid turnover or changes in protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activity induced by carbachol or pentagastrin. These data indicate that somatostatin directly inhibits parietal cell activity via mechanisms both dependent on and independent of the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1572634765,"A cDNA sequence encoding a nodule-specific protein, nodulin-100, was identified among the abundant transcripts of poly(A)+ RNA from soybean nodules. Purification of nodulin-100 from the soluble fraction of nodule extract yielded an abundant protein with a subunit of approximately 90 kDa having properties of sucrose synthase (UDP-glucose:D-fructose 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.13). Nodule sucrose synthase of soybean is a tetrameric enzyme. Antibodies raised against this protein cross-reacted with the hybrid-released translation product of nodulin-100 cDNA, suggesting that nodulin-100 is the subunit of this enzyme. This was confirmed by partial DNA sequence analysis which showed 73% sequence homology at the amino acid level with maize sucrose synthase. Nodule sucrose synthase was found to dissociate rapidly into monomers in the presence of heme, suggesting that the availability of free heme may regulate the activity of this enzyme. Sucrose synthase activity increases rapidly during nodule development and declines during senescence. A model is presented which suggests that this enzyme plays a key role in maintaining the carbon economy of the nodules and the free heme may be involved in the flow of carbon to the bacteroids. As the degradation of leghemoglobin occurs during senescence, a concomitant decrease in sucrose synthase activity is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2052950286,"The discovery of D4S10, an anonymous DNA marker genetically linked to Huntington's disease (HD), introduced the capacity for limited presymptomatic diagnosis in this late-onset neurodegenerative disorder and raised the hope of cloning and characterizing the defect based on its chromosomal location. Progress on both fronts has been limited by the absence of additional DNA markers closer to the HD gene. An anonymous DNA locus, D4S43, has now been found that shows extremely tight linkage to HD. Like the disease gene, D4S43 is located in the most distal region of the chromosome 4 short arm, flanked by D4S10 and the telomere. In three extended HD kindreds, D4S43 displays no recombination with HD, placing it within 0 to 1.5 centimorgans of the genetic defect. Expansion of the D4S43 region to include 108 kilobases of cloned DNA has allowed identification of eight restriction fragment length polymorphisms and at least two independent coding segments. In the absence of crossovers, these genes must be considered candidates for the site of the HD defect, although the D4S43 restriction fragment length polymorphisms do not display linkage disequilibrium with the disease gene."
https://openalex.org/W1580841831,"The clathrin-coated vesicle proton translocating complex is composed of a maximum of eight polypeptides. The function of the components of this system have not been defined. Proton pumping catalyzed by the reconstituted, 200-fold purified proton translocating complex of clathrin-coated vesicles is inhibited 50% at a dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)/protein ratio of 0.66 mumol of DCCD/mg of protein. At an identical DCCD/protein ratio, the 17-kDa component of the proton pump is labeled by [14C]DCCD. Through toluene extraction, the 17-kDa subunit has been isolated from the holoenzyme. The 17-kDa polypeptide diminished proteoliposome acidification when coreconstituted with either bacteriorhodopsin or the intact clathrin-coated vesicle proton translocating ATPase. In both instances, treatment of the 17-kDa polypeptide with DCCD restored proteoliposome acidification. Moreover, the proton-conducting activity of the 17-kDa polypeptide is abolished by trypsin digestion. These results demonstrate that the 17-kDa polypeptide present in the isolated proton ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles is a subunit which functions as a transmembranous proton pore."
https://openalex.org/W1560326407,"Multidrug-resistant J774.2 mouse macrophage-like cells, selected for resistance to colchicine, vinblastine, or taxol, overexpress antigenically related glycoproteins with distinct electrophoretic mobilities. These plasma membrane glycoproteins are likely to play a pivotal role in the expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype. To determine how these multidrug resistance-associated glycoproteins differ, the biosynthesis and N-linked carbohydrate composition of these proteins were examined and compared. Vinblastineor colchicine-selected cells made a 125-kDa precursor that was rapidly processed (t1/2 approximately equal to 20 min) to mature forms of 135 and 140 kDa, respectively. Heterogeneity between the 135- and 140-kDa forms of the molecule can be attributed to N-linked carbohydrate. In contrast, taxol-selected cells made two precursors, 125 and 120 kDa, which appeared within 5 and 15 min after the onset of pulse labeling, respectively. They were processed to mature forms of 140 and 130 kDa. Since a single deglycosylated precursor or mature form was not observed after enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, other differences, besides N-linked glycosylation, which occur in early processing compartments, are likely to account for the two multidrug resistance-associated glycoproteins in taxol-selected cells. These results demonstrate that a family of multidrug resistance-associated glycoproteins can be differentially expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1503829526,"The purified proton ATPase of chromaffin granules contains five different polypeptides denoted as subunits I to V in the order of decreasing molecular weights of 115,000, 72,000, 57,000, 39,000, and 17,000, respectively. The purified enzyme was reconstituted as a highly active proton pump, and the binding of N-ethylmaleimide and nucleotides to individual subunits was studied. N-Ethylmaleimide binds to subunits I, II, and IV, but inhibition of both ATPase and proton pumping activity correlated with binding to subunit II. In the presence of ADP, the saturation curve of ATP changed from hyperbolic to a sigmoid shape, suggesting that the proton ATPase is an allosteric enzyme. Upon illumination of the purified enzyme in the presence of micromolar concentrations of 8-azido-ATP, alpha-[35S]ATP, or alpha-[32P]ATP subunits I, II, and IV were labeled. However, at concentrations of alpha-[32P]ATP below 0.1 microM, subunit II was exclusively labeled in both the purified and reconstituted enzyme. This labeling was absolutely dependent on the presence of divalent cations, like Mg2+ and Mn2+, while Ca2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ had little or no effect. About 0.2 mM Mg2+ was required to saturate the reaction even in the presence of 50 nM alpha-[32P]ATP, suggesting a specific and separate Mg2+ binding site on the enzyme. Nitrate, sulfate, and thiocyanate at 100 mM or N-ethylmaleimide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole at 100 microM prevented the binding of the nucleotide to subunit II. The labeling of this subunit was effectively prevented by micromolar concentrations of three phosphonucleotides including those that cannot serve as substrate for the enzyme. It is concluded that a tightly bound ADP on subunit II is necessary for the activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1584559727,"The binding and assembly of clathrin triskelions on vesicle membranes seem to be mediated by certain assembly polypeptides (Keen, J.H., Willingham, M.C., and Pastau, I.H. (1979) Cell 16, 303-312). These assembly polypeptides were further purified into two distinct complexes using hydroxylapatite chromatography. Peak 1 consists of two major bands of 98 and 112 kDa, two minor bands of 103 and 118 kDa, and a polypeptide of 46 kDa. Peak 2 consists of one major band of 100 kDa, two minor bands of 103 and 115 kDa, and a polypeptide of 50 kDa. Both complexes have a native molecular mass of 290 kDa as determined by gel filtration. Each 290-kDa complex contains two polypeptides of 98-118/100-115 kDa and two polypeptides of 46/50 kDa. The 46-kDa polypeptide is not phosphorylated, whereas the 50-kDa polypeptide is. Both peaks contain 50-kDa kinase-like activity. Time courses of the 50-kDa phosphorylation show that the activity in peak 1 saturates much faster than the activity in peak 2; there may be two 50-kDa kinase activities in coated vesicles. A kinase that phosphorylates the polypeptides in 98-118-kDa group is present in peak 1 but not in peak 2. Both peaks assemble clathrin triskelions into cages under conditions in which the clathrin alone would not assemble. Both rotary shadowed and negatively stained preparations of these reassembled cages as well as the purified complexes were examined by electron microscopy. Thus, two complexes have been identified that differ in their polypeptide composition and kinase activities, but are similar in their ability to assemble clathrin triskelions into cages."
https://openalex.org/W1601800931,"Rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is an acute phase reactant which shows a marked elevation in mRNA level following inflammatory induction. It has been proposed that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the induction of the gene. We have studied the processing of the primary transcript of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The preferred pathway of intron removal was determined by Northern blot analysis and was found to be unaltered after inflammatory stimulation. The final nuclear precursor did exhibit size alterations, manifest as a quantitative shift from the final precursor at 6 h to a second progressively shorter form at 18 and 24 h. Deadenylation of nuclear RNA showed that the difference in size of the precursor is due to a change in poly(A) tail length, which occurs after the splicing out of the last intron. Nuclear run-on transcription assays measured a 2.5-fold increase in transcriptional activity, with a peak at 12 h. The highest level of cytoplasmic RNA with a long poly(A) tail, however, occurs before 12 h. Our data suggest that the reduction in poly(A) tail size is due to a rapid trimming of the tail in the nucleus and that this process is modified upon inflammatory induction."
https://openalex.org/W1544184252,"We have obtained a complete set of 20 variants of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase of Escherichia coli at position 49 in order to extend our previous studies on the effects of single amino acid replacements at position 49 on structure and function. Thirteen mutant alpha subunits have been newly constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides. Six mutants were available from previous studies. We find that the wild type and all of the mutant alpha subunits form alpha 2 beta 2 complexes with the beta 2 subunit of tryptophan synthase with similar association constants and similarly stimulate the activity of the beta 2 subunit in the synthesis of L-tryptophan from L-serine and indole. Thus none of the changes at position 49 produces a change in the conformation of the alpha subunit which significantly interferes with normal subunit interaction. However, the 19 mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complexes are completely devoid of activity in reactions normally catalyzed by the active site of the alpha subunit. This is the first time that these several activities have been measured with a series of highly purified alpha subunits altered by mutation at a single site. Our finding that the mutant in which glutamic acid 49 is substituted by aspartic acid is totally devoid of alpha activity is especially significant and is strong evidence that glutamic acid 49 is an essential catalytic base in the reaction catalyzed by the alpha subunit. This result is consistent with the results of previous genetic studies, with evolutionary comparisons using sequence analysis, and with recent results from x-ray crystallography of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1576858785,"Toxin-resistant polypeptide chain elongation factor 2 cDNA has been cloned from a mutant hamster cell line with only non-ADP-ribosylatable elongation factor 2. The mutation conferring resistance to diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A is a G-to-A transition in the first nucleotide of codon 717. Codon 715 encodes a histidine residue that is modified post-translationally to diphthamide, which is the target amino acid for ADP-ribosylation by both toxins. Transfection of mouse L cells with a recombinant elongation factor 2 cDNA differing from the wild-type only by this G-to-A transition confers resistance to P. aeruginosa exotoxin A. The degrees of toxin-resistant protein synthesis of stable transfectants are dependent on the ratio of non-ADP-ribosylated elongation factor 2 to wild-type elongation factor 2, not the amount of non-ADP-ribosylated elongation factor 2. The mutation creates a new Mbo II restriction site in the elongation factor 2 gene. Several independently isolated diphtheria toxin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines show the same alteration in the Mbo II restriction pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2139414897,"The Thy-1 antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein of unknown function expressed on mouse T lymphocytes, neurons, and hematopoietic stem cells. To alter the normal pattern of Thy-1 expression during hematopoietic differentiation, we created transgenic mice using a hybrid Thy-1 gene containing a transcriptional enhancer of the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (E mu). Strains of mice bearing the Thy-1.2/E mu gene express the Thy-1.2 antigen on mature B lymphocytes and their progenitors, and develop a heritable lymphoid hyperplasia characterized by massive expression of the Thy-1.2 antigen in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. The phenotype associated with inappropriate developmental regulation of the Thy-1 gene suggests that the Thy-1 antigen may play a role in inducing activation or differentiation events on early lymphocyte progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1680404916,"The H+-ATPase of Beta vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) comprises at least three functionally distinct subunits of Mr = 67,000, 57,000, and 16,000, respectively (Manolson, M. F., Rea, P. A., and Poole, R. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12273-12279). The hydrophobic carboxyl reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inactivates the enzyme with pseudo-first order kinetics, and the concentration dependence of the reaction indicates that DCCD interacts with a single site on the enzyme to exert its inhibitory effect. The apparent pseudo-first order rate constant (k0) is reciprocally dependent on membrane protein concentration, which is expected if a large fraction of the DCCD partitions into the lipid phase. k0 has a nominal value of 1000 M-1 min-1 at a protein concentration of 250 micrograms/ml, although when phase partitioning is taken into account, the true, protein concentration-independent value of k0 is calculated to be about an order of magnitude lower. [14C]DCCD primarily labels the Mr = 16,000 polypeptide of native tonoplast vesicles. Binding is venturicidin-insensitive and occurs at a rate similar to the rate of enzyme inactivation, implying that inhibition is a direct result of covalent modification of the Mr = 16,000 polypeptide. Labeling of the containing Mr = 8,000 subunit of mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase is, on the other hand, faster by a factor of 5 and totally abolished by venturicidin. These results confirm that the Mr = 16,000 polypeptide which copurifies with tonoplast H+-ATPase activity is a subunit of the enzyme. Most of the DCCD-reactive Mr = 16,000 subunit is extracted from acetone:ethanol-washed tonoplast vesicles by chloroform:methanol. [14C]DCCD bound to the Mr = 16,000 polypeptide is enriched in the chloroform:methanol extract by 5-fold compared with native tonoplast and the specific activity (nmol of [14C]DCCD/mg of protein) can be increased a further 37-fold by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. It is concluded that the Mr = 16,000 subunit of the tonoplast H+-ATPase is a proteolipid."

Moreover, the ATPase activity was inhibited only 61% by addition of oligomycin. Treatment of mitochondria from ethanol-fed rats with the detergent, Lubrol-WX, caused the release of 36% of the F1 from the resulting inner membrane particles. In comparison, only 5% of the F1 was dissociated when control mitochondria were subjected to the Lubrol treatment. However, when the units of ATPase activity from the supernatant and particles obtained after Lubrol treatment were added together, their sums were equivalent in preparations from control and ethanol-fed animals. Moreover, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses indicated equal amounts of the alpha + beta subunits of F1 in mitochondria from control and ethanol-fed rats. Reconstitution experiments with urea particles and F1 prepared from both control and ethanol mitochondria revealed a decrease in oligomycin sensitivity which could be attributed to an alteration in the functioning of either the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein or a membrane sector subunit that interacts with oligomycin. Analysis by reconstitution also demonstrated that there were no ethanol-elicited alterations in the properties of the F1 portion of the ATP synthase complex. These observations indicate that the activity of the ATP synthase complex is altered significantly by ethanol-elicited changes in the functioning of those polypeptides involved in modulating both oligomycin sensitivity and the association of F1 with membrane sector subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1602951909,"A series of proteins containing defined internal and presequence deletions in the F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor have been synthesized in vitro using a linked transcription-translation system. These different forms of the protein have been analyzed by the combination of gel filtration and in vitro mitochondrial import studies. These studies reveal that the soluble F1 beta-subunit precursor (55 kDa) forms a homooligomeric assembly of apparent molecular weight 230,000 on gel filtration analysis. The formation of this tetrameric beta-protein was dependent on the sequence between residues 122 and 144 of the precursor and was independent of the presence of a mitochondrial presequence within the first 19 residues of the precursor. When the tetrameric F1 beta-precursor was partially purified from the translation reaction it was incompetent for import into mitochondria. However, import of the partially purified beta-subunit could be restored by addition of reticulocyte lysate protein. In the absence of the tetramer-forming sequence, the protein behaved as an aggregate complex approximately 400 kDa in size. Formation of the high molecular weight aggregate and import into mitochondria was dependent upon a functional presequence at the amino terminus of the precursor. These studies are discussed in terms of the maintenance of an import competent structure for mitochondrial precursors and role of soluble factors in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1569327355,"The effect of tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced synthesis of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage (SCC) enzyme complex was studied in rat ovarian granulosa cells cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell proteins were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450SCC) as well as the iron-sulfur protein adrenodoxin. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of the immunoprecipitates showed that TPA, when added in combination with FSH (50 ng/ml) or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP; 1 mM), suppressed the stimulatory effects of these compounds on the synthesis of the SCC components in a concentration-dependent fashion. The effect of TPA was accompanied by decreased progesterone formation and decreased cAMP accumulation. The structural analog of TPA, phorbol-4 alpha-didecanoate, which does not activate protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), had no effect on the FSH- or Bt2cAMP-stimulated synthesis of SCC and progesterone or on cAMP formation. In addition to inhibiting the synthesis of these proteins, TPA greatly reduced the FSH- and Bt2cAMP-induced increase in levels of mRNA encoding the precursor form of P-450SCC. It is concluded that the effect of the phorbol ester TPA to inhibit FSH-stimulated progesterone formation in cultured ovarian granulosa cells of the rat involves decreased synthesis of the components of the SCC enzyme complex due to reduced levels of mRNA encoding the precursor forms of these proteins. The results are indicative that TPA not only inhibits FSH-mediated stimulation of cAMP formation but also may block cAMP-mediated induction of SCC synthesis. It is postulated that the effects of TPA may reflect the physiological role of protein kinase C in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1588095621,"There are two separate aspects to the energetic control over the initiation of ATP formation by chloroplast thylakoid membranes: (i) the free energy requirement for the phosphorylation of ADP and (ii) the energy-dependent transformation of the coupling factor into a catalytically active state. Using flash excitation, we have been able to distinguish between limitations imposed on ATP formation by the energetics of coupling factor activation from limitations imposed by the thermodynamics of ADP phosphorylation. We have placed particular emphasis on the effects of coupling factor reduction. ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and the release of tightly bound [14C]ADP were initiated by fewer flashes in thylakoid membranes in which the coupling factors were prereduced than in membrane samples in which the coupling factor remained oxidized. Only under conditions in which ATP synthesis occurred against a large chemical potential (i.e. delta GATP) did the onset of net ATP synthesis require a larger electrochemical potential than did the activation of the coupling factor. Thus, only at delta GATP values greater than about 51 kJ.mol-1 for thylakoid membranes with oxidized coupling factors and about 45 kJ.mol-1 when the coupling factors are reduced was the onset of ATP synthesis dictated by the thermodynamic equilibrium between ATP and ADP. At lower delta GATP values, the electrochemical potential became energetically adequate to phosphorylate ADP prior to becoming adequate to activate the coupling factor. These data indicate that reduction of the coupling factor lowers the delta pH necessary for activation from approximately 2.9 to approximately 2.6 units. Accompanying the lower energetic requirement for the activation of the reduced coupling factor was an increase in the efficiency of ATP synthesis under conditions of limiting energization."
https://openalex.org/W1604308651,"Abstract Photolabeling of nucleotide binding sites in nucleotide-depleted mitochondrial F1 has been explored with 2-azido [alpha-32P]adenosine diphosphate (2-N3[alpha-32P] ADP). Control experiments carried out in the absence of photoirradiation in a Mg2+-supplemented medium indicated the presence of one high affinity binding site and five lower affinity binding sites per F1. Similar titration curves were obtained with [3H]ADP and the photoprobe 3'-arylazido-[3H]butyryl ADP [( 3H]NAP4-ADP). Photolabeling of nucleotide-depleted F1 with 2-N3[alpha-32P]ADP resulted in ATPase inactivation, half inactivation corresponding to 0.6-0.7 mol of photoprobe covalently bound per mol F1. Only the beta subunit was photolabeled, even under conditions of high loading with 2-N3[alpha-32P]ADP. The identification of the sequences labeled with the photoprobe was achieved by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide and enzymatic cleavage by trypsin. Under conditions of low loading with 2-N3[alpha-32P]ADP, resulting in photolabeling of only one vacant site in F1, covalently bound radioactivity was located in a peptide fragment of the beta subunit spanning Pro-320-Met-358 identical to the fragment photolabeled in native F1 (Garin, J., Boulay, F., Issartel, J.-P., Lunardi, J., and Vignais, P. V. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4431-4437). With a heavier load of photoprobe, leading to nearly 4 mol of photoprobe covalently bound per mol F1, an additional region of the beta subunit was specifically labeled, corresponding to a sequence extending from Gly-72 to Arg-83. The isolated beta subunit also displayed two binding sites for 2-N3-[alpha-32P]ADP. When F1 was first photolabeled with a low concentration of NAP4-ADP, leading to the covalent binding of 1.5 mol of NAP4-ADP/mol F1, with the bound NAP4-ADP distributed equally between the alpha and beta subunits, a subsequent photoirradiation in the presence of 2-N3[alpha-32P]ADP resulted in covalent binding of the 2-N3[alpha-32P]ADP to both alpha and beta subunits. It is concluded that each beta subunit in mitochondrial F1 contains two nucleotide binding regions, one of which belongs to the beta subunit per se, and the other to a subsite shared with a subsite located on a juxtaposed alpha subunit. Depending on the experimental conditions, the subsite located on the alpha subunit is either accessible or masked. Unmasking of the subsite in the three alpha subunits of mitochondrial F1 appears to proceed by a concerted mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1553140893,"Abstract 2-(4-Bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)-1,N(6)-ethenoadenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP) is an affinity label for the coenzyme-binding site of pig heart NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Specific reaction occurs at the coenzyme site with an incorporation of 0.5 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit (i.e. modification of only one subunit of the dimeric enzyme) (Bailey, J.M., and Colman, R.F. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 5367-5377). Modified enzyme, prepared by incubating 1 mg/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase with 75 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP in the absence and presence of substrate or coenzyme, was reduced with NaBH4, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Nucleotidyl peptides were isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, followed by treatment with acid phosphatase (to decrease the negative charge by removing the phosphate groups from covalently bound reagent) and rechromatography on the same DEAE-cellulose column. The isolated peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis, dansylation, and gas-phase sequencing. A single triskaidekapeptide corresponding to modification of the coenzyme site by 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP was identified as: Asp-Leu-Ala-Gly-X-Ile-His-Gly-Leu-Ser-Asn-Val-Lys. Additional evidence indicated that X is a glutamate residue derivatized by 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP."
https://openalex.org/W1557230800,"Abstract We have constructed a cDNA library from the highly hydroxyurea-resistant hamster cell line 600H in which the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is elevated more than 80-fold. Using the technique of differential hybridization, we have isolated a number of cDNA clones from this library which are homologous to genomic DNA sequences amplified in the 600H cell line compared to the V79 parental line. One of these cDNA clones by sequence analysis was found to code for ornithine decarboxylase. This was confirmed by in vitro translation of poly(A+) RNA isolated by hybridization-selection followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum specific for mouse ornithine decarboxylase. Genomic sequences homologous to the cDNA clone were shown to be sequentially amplified 6-20-fold in hamster cell lines selected stepwise for resistance to increasing concentrations of hydroxyurea. Genomic sequences homologous to a cDNA for the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase were also amplified in these cell lines, and the degree of M2 sequence amplification corresponded to the degree of amplification of ornithine decarboxylase sequences, suggesting that the two genes had been co-amplified during the selection of the hydroxyurea-resistant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2160293783,"We have studied the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase by cell-cell contact in primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Preparation of dissociated chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medullae or the harvesting of cultured cells resulted in a rapid decrease of the specific mRNA(TH) (defined as the amount of mRNA(TH) (where TH represents tyrosine hydroxylase) per microgram of total RNA). The decrease in mRNA(TH) levels appears to be stimulated by the loss of cell contact, as it occurs much more rapidly than would be expected from the turnover rate of mRNA(TH) in cultured cells. Similarly an enhanced rate of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme degradation was observed in chromaffin cells when brought into low contact cultures. In contrast to the decrease in mRNA(TH) levels, however, the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme levels was not so rapid and could be prevented in high contact cultures. The mRNA(TH) increased 4-fold in high contact cultures relative to dissociated cells within 1 day after plating. Similarly the rate of synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme molecules was maximal after 1 day, although the increase in the absolute amount of tyrosine hydroxylase occurred only slowly. The increase in specific mRNA(TH) by cell contact was inhibited by alpha-amanitin, indicating that cell contact evokes an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase levels by increasing the transcription of mRNA(TH), in addition to inhibiting the degradation of tyrosine hydroxylase molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1539348837,"The products and an intermediate of preprosomatostatin-II processing in the anglerfish islet were purified and subjected to structural analysis. The peptides isolated identify the site of signal cleavage (between Ser-24 and Gln-25). The prohormone is further processed at Arg-97 and, to a lesser extent, at the two adjacent basic amino acid residues Lys-61 and Arg-62. A 28-residue somatostatin is also generated which can be hydroxylated at Lys-23. A proteolytic processing site which would form the 14-residue somatostatin does not appear to be used to a significant degree. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) was used to demonstrate that the amino-terminal residues of peptides 25-60, and 25-90 are pyroglutamic acid, a modification which precludes Edman degradation of these peptides. Analysis of the peptides and tryptic peptide maps by FABMS allowed confirmation of the sites of prohormone conversion and indicated that terminal basic residues were removed during processing. Three amino acid residues were also found to differ from the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA and were localized to specific regions by FABMS analysis. Residues found to differ from the cDNA (cDNA in parentheses) were: Asp-77 (Thr), Val-78 (Phe), and Gly-90 (Glu). Mass assignments were confirmed by running a single cycle of Edman degradation prior to FABMS. The peptides noted above were also examined by Edman sequence analysis. The sequence of a cDNA clone to preprosomatostatin-II was re-examined in light of the observed differences at the protein level. This study emphasizes the utility of FABMS in prohormone processing studies and in identification of post-translational processing events."
https://openalex.org/W1575742325,"Beef heart mitochondrial F1 possesses three pyrophosphate-binding sites, which comprises one high affinity binding site (Kd approximately equal to 1 microM) and two lower affinity sites (Kd approximately equal to 20 microM). High affinity pyrophosphate binding required the presence of Mg2+ in the incubation medium. Pyrophosphate competed with ADP, but not with Pi for binding to mitochondrial F1. Upon binding of 3 mol of pyrophosphate/mol of F1, one of the three tightly bound nucleotides present in native F1 was released. Like ADP and in contrast to Pi, pyrophosphate enhanced the fluorescence intensity of F1-bound aurovertin, and it prevented the photolabeling of F1 by 2-azido-ADP. As aurovertin and 2-azido-ADP are ligands of the beta subunit of F1, it is likely that pyrophosphate binds preferentially to the beta subunit. Whereas the binding affinity of F1 for Pi was increased by concentrations of pyrophosphate lower than 100 microM, it was decreased by a higher concentration of pyrophosphate. This biphasic effect of pyrophosphate on Pi binding was not observed with ADP, which, at all concentrations tested, inhibited Pi binding. Except for the effect of pyrophosphate on Pi binding to F1, for all the other effects, pyrophosphate mimicked ADP. It is suggested that pyrophosphate and ADP share the same binding site on F1 and that pyrophosphate interacts with the same amino acid residues as those interacting with the alpha and beta phosphate groups of ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1612029458,"Abstract The uncD gene for the beta subunit of Escherichia coli H+-ATPase was cloned downstream of the lac promoter and mutagenized (Glu-185----Gln or Lys) by an oligonucleotide-directed procedure. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into a strain in which the unc operon for subunits of H+-ATPase was deleted. The wild-type or mutant beta subunit synthesized amounted to about 10% total cell protein and was mainly found in the cytoplasmic fraction. These subunits could be purified to almost homogeneity by conventional procedures. The wild-type and two mutant beta subunits had essentially the same Kd values for 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate, aurovertin, and ATP, although the fluorescence intensities of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate and aurovertin were significantly less when bound to the two mutant beta subunits than when bound to the wild-type subunit. The three beta subunits showed essentially the same circular dichroism spectra, indicating alpha-helical contents of about 16-18%. Thus, the mutations did not cause marked change of the secondary structure of the subunit. However, measurements of theta 208 during linear increase in temperature suggested that replacement of Glu-185 by Gln or Lys slightly changed the stability of the secondary structure. Only trace amounts of alpha beta gamma complexes could be reconstituted using the two mutant beta subunits. These results suggest that Glu-185 or the region in its vicinity may be essential for subunit assembly. The methods developed in this study should be useful for further studies on the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1584515244,"The photoaffinity analog of ATP, 3'-O-(4-benzoyl) benzoyl ATP (BzATP), was used to covalently modify the catalytic sites on the beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase. In the absence of actinic illumination, BzATP was a slow substrate for the enzyme (Vmax = 0.19 mumol min-1 mg-1; kcat/Km = 2.2 X 10(6) M-1s-1) and behaved as a classical competitive inhibitor versus ATP (Ki = 0.85 microM). Under photolytic conditions, BzATP inactivated F1 with pseudo first-order kinetics, and the photoinactivation reaction showed rate saturation suggesting specific, reversible binding of BzATP to F1 prior to covalent bond formation. ATP protected against F1 photoinactivation (Kprotect = 0.3 microM) and partially covalently modified F1 yielded the same Km for ATP as unmodified enzyme. These results strongly suggested that BzATP was bound to catalytic sites on the enzyme. In the absence of photolysis, BzATP saturated two binding sites on the F1 (KD = 1.6 microM), and under photolytic conditions, 1 mol of BzATP was shown to be covalently liganded to the beta subunit of the enzyme coincident with 100% loss in ATPase activity. Previous studies with the mitochondrial F1-ATPase have suggested a mechanism involving catalytic cooperativity during ATP hydrolysis. Our demonstration of a molar stoichiometry of 1 for photoinactivation is in accord with this mechanism. It is suggested that either F1 is unable to hydrolyze covalently bound BzATP, or that subsequent to hydrolysis, the BzADP product can not be released from the catalytic site. It is therefore inferred that F1 hydrolytic activity requires cooperativity between multiple, viable catalytic sites and that covalent modification of a single catalytic site is sufficient for complete enzyme inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2097310936,"Benzylamine derivatives containing para substituents of differing electronegativity as well as isomers of aminomethylpyridine have been assessed for their substrate and inhibitor potentials toward lysyl oxidase. Substituted benzylamines with increasingly electronegative para substituents had the lowest KI values and thus were the most effective inhibitors of the oxidation of elastin by lysyl oxidase. The kcat values for these compounds as substrates of lysyl oxidase were also reduced with increasingly electronegative para substituents. Both the Dkcat and D(kcat/Km) kinetic isotope effects decreased with increasingly electronegative p-substituents in [alpha, alpha'-2H]benzylamines. In contrast, there was no Dkcat solvent isotope effect with [2H] H2O while the D(kcat/Km) solvent isotope effect tended to increase with increasingly electronegative p-substituents. These results are consistent with the stabilization of an enzyme-generated substrate carbanion and thus the retardation of substrate oxidation by electronegative substituents. Such ground state stabilization thus can result in compounds with increased potential for the inhibition of the oxidation of protein substrates of lysyl oxidase."

Kinetic studies with partially inactivated enzymes show that inactivation of a given subunit in the octameric glutamine synthetase affects the activities of its neighboring subunit such that the rate of the inactivation as well as the gamma-glutamyltransferase activity of the noninactivated subunits decreases while their biosynthetic activity is enhanced. This outcome of subunit interaction is the same irrespective of whether Mn2+ or Mg2+ is used to fulfill the divalent cation requirement of glutamine synthetase for the inactivation reaction and the gamma-glutamyltransferase reaction. Although only Vmax is affected in the gamma-glutamyltransferase assay, both Km (glutamate) and Vmax are changed in the biosynthetic assay."
https://openalex.org/W1590987542,"Carboxypeptidase H is one of several enzymes required for the processing of peptide hormone precursors. In this study, inhibition of carboxypeptidase H by its peptide products was investigated. Carboxypeptidase H activity in bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules and rat adrenal medulla homogenate was inhibited by the peptides Met- and Leu-enkephalin, vasopressin, oxytocin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, substance P, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, with oxytocin and ACTH 1-14 having the least effect, at concentrations of 2-20 mM. Inhibition by amidated peptide products (vasopressin, oxytocin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, substance P, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone) show that the final products of the precursor processing pathway can regulate carboxypeptidase H. These levels of peptides are similar to known intragranular peptide concentrations indicating that product and feedback inhibition of carboxypeptidase H may play a role in the control of neuropeptide synthesis. The proenkephalin-derived peptides Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, and Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 competitively inhibited bovine and rat carboxypeptidase H with Ki values of 12.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 5.5 mM, respectively. The significantly greater Ki for Met-enkephalin may reflect the effects of higher intragranular concentration of Met-enkephalin, since one proenkephalin molecule contains four copies of Met-enkephalin and only one copy of each of the other enkephalin peptides. Thus, the products from one multivalent precursor molecule may equivalently inhibit carboxypeptidase H activity. Product inhibition of carboxypeptidase H and perhaps other processing enzymes may serve to limit the maximum peptide concentration within the secretory vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1494026351,"The primary translation product of mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor has been shown to have an Mr of 58,000. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the bovine kidney and lung and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system containing [35S]methionine. Immunoprecipitation of the labeled translation products, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, identified a 58-kDa protein as the primary translation product which is the unglycosylated precursor to be processed to the glycosylated mature 70-kDa form found in the plasma membranes. The result lends strong support to our previous proposal that mature ANP receptor is composed of two disulfide-linked 70-kDa subunits, eliminating the possibility that the two 70-kDa subunits arise from a larger 140-kDa precursor by proteolytic cleavage."
