We report here that expression of microRNA-145 (miR-145) is low in self-renewing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) but highly upregulated during differentiation. We identify the pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 as direct targets of miR-145 and show that endogenous miR-145 represses the 3′ untranslated regions of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4. Increased miR-145 expression inhibits hESC self-renewal, represses expression of pluripotency genes, and induces lineage-restricted differentiation. Loss of miR-145 impairs differentiation and elevates OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4. Furthermore, we find that the miR-145 promoter is bound and repressed by OCT4 in hESCs. This work reveals a direct link between the core reprogramming factors and miR-145 and uncovers a double-negative feedback loop involving OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and miR-145.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are valuable resources for clinical therapies because of their unlimited self-renewal ability and potential to generate any differentiated cell type (pluripotency). The self-renewal and pluripotency properties are regulated by an array of protein-coding genes, such as transcription factors and chromatin remodeling enzymes, in a core regulatory circuitry (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A.

This circuitry includes OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, which form self-regulatory networks and control a wide range of downstream genes (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E.

In addition to protein-coding genes, a group of noncoding microRNA (miRNA) genes are connected to the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ESCs (Marson et al., 2008Marson A. Levine S.S. Cole M.F. Frampton G.M. Brambrink T. Johnstone S. Guenther M.G. Johnston W.K. Wernig M.

However, relatively little is known about how miRNAs epigenetically modulate ESC self-renewal and pluripotency. miRNAs bind to partially complementary target sites in messenger RNA (mRNA) 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), which results in degradation of the target mRNAs, or translational repression of the encoded proteins (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27032) Google Scholar). In general, one gene can be repressed by multiple miRNAs and one miRNA may repress multiple target genes, which results in the formation of complex regulatory feedback networks. In a wide variety of developmental processes, miRNAs fine tune or restrict cellular identities by targeting important transcription factors or key pathways (Stefani and Slack, 2008Stefani G. Slack F.J. Small non-coding RNAs in animal development.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific expression signature of miRNAs in ESCs has been used successfully to distinguish ESCs from differentiated cell types (Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Keys D.N. Au-Young J.K. Chen C. MicroRNAs in embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 218: 251-255Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several groups reported genome-wide miRNA expression profiles using various platforms (Houbaviy et al., 2003Houbaviy H.B. Murray M.F. Sharp P.A. Embryonic stem cell-specific microRNAs.Dev.

More than 100 miRNAs are differentially expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and the differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs) (Morin et al., 2008Morin R.D. O'Connor M.D. Griffith M. Kuchenbauer F. Delaney A. Prabhu A.L. Zhao Y. McDonald H. Zeng T. Hirst M. et al.Application of massively parallel sequencing to microRNA profiling and discovery in human embryonic stem cells.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), but the genes targeted by most of these miRNAs are unknown. The characterization of the miRNA pathways and their underlying molecular mechanisms is of great importance to the understanding of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency. The requirement of miRNAs in maintenance of ESC populations and pluripotency was initially demonstrated by genetic studies. Murine ESCs with genetic deletion of key miRNA processing enzymes Dicer (Kanellopoulou et al., 2005Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K.

USA. 2005; 102: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) or DGCR8 (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) lose their pluripotency and show defective differentiation. Dicer-deficient mutant ESCs can be partially rescued by the miR-290 cluster miRNAs that regulate Rbl2-dependent DNA methylation to downregulate Oct4 indirectly (Benetti et al., 2008Benetti R. Gonzalo S. Jaco I. Munoz P. Gonzalez S. Schoeftner S. Murchison E. Andl T. Chen T. Klatt P. et al.A mammalian microRNA cluster controls DNA methylation and telomere recombination via Rbl2-dependent regulation of DNA methyltransferases.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Filipowicz W. MicroRNAs control de novo DNA methylation through regulation of transcriptional repressors in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, miR-290 decreases during ESC differentiation, when Oct4 needs to be switched off, which makes it less likely to be a dominant player in the differentiation process. On the other hand, mutant DGCR8 ESCs do not fully downregulate pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Rex1, Sox2, and Nanog in response to differentiation (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unclear what miRNAs may be involved in the direct repression of pluripotency markers. The study of the functions of miRNAs in ESCs is still in an early stage, and the direct roles of miRNAs in downregulating pluripotency genes are yet to be investigated. Here, we set out to investigate the roles of miRNA in the direct repression of pluripotency genes in hESCs. We hypothesized that the 3′ UTRs of pluripotency genes may be targeted for downregulation by miRNAs in hESCs to allow attenuation of the self-renewal program. We searched for miRNAs that have increased expression levels during ESC differentiation and are predicted to target hESC transcription factors. By expression analysis and computational predictions, we identified miR-145 as a temporally regulated miRNA during hESC differentiation and validated that it can target 3′ UTRs of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 in luciferase assays in both HeLa cells and hESCs. By gain-of-function and loss-of function approaches, we showed that the endogenous levels of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 are controlled posttranscriptionally by miR-145 in hESCs. Contrary to the decrease of the pluripotency factors during differentiation, miR-145 level was relatively low in hESCs and increased during differentiation. We found that ectopic miR-145 expression significantly disrupts the maintenance of hESCs in the self-renewal state. The function of miR-145 was further investigated during hESC differentiation, and we revealed that miR-145 is necessary and sufficient to modulate the differentiation progression through the OCT4/SOX2 pathway. In addition, the promoter of miR-145 was repressed by OCT4 in hESCs. In brief, miR-145 is connected to pluripotency network in a double-negative feedback loop. We uncovered a direct link between a miRNA and the core pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 and demonstrated that miR-145 represses pluripotency and controls ESC differentiation. To identify human miRNAs that display temporal expression regulation, we compared expression profiles of 466 miRNAs between undifferentiated hESC line H9 and differentiated EBs using the Taqman real-time multiplex RT-PCR method, a reliable technique to quantify the levels of mature miRNAs (Kye et al., 2007Kye M.J. Liu T. Levy S.F. Xu N.L. Groves B.B. Bonneau R. Lao K. Kosik K.S. Somatodendritic microRNAs identified by laser capture and multiplex RT-PCR.RNA. 2007; 13: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The quality of the hESC culture was confirmed by immunostaining and karyotype analysis. hESCs expressed stem cell markers OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, and EB differentiation produced precursor cells of the three germ layers (Figure S1 available online). Our miRNA expression analysis yielded results consistent with previous reports: two clusters of miRNAs, miR-302 and miR-371/372/373, were ESC specific (Laurent et al., 2008Laurent L.C. Chen J. Ulitsky I. Mueller F.J. Lu C. Shamir R. Fan J.B. Loring J.F.

Biol. 2004; 270: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). From the expression analysis, we found that miR-145 was expressed at relatively low level in undifferentiated hESCs, but was significantly upregulated in EBs (Figures 1A and 1B). The temporal upregulation of miR-145 was also observed in BMP4-induced hESC differentiation in a time course consistent with the downregulation of OCT4 expression (Figure S3). miR-145, identified in mice (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Identification of novel genes coding for small expressed RNAs.Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar) and later in human (Michael et al., 2003Michael M.Z. O'Conner S.M. van Holst Pellekaan N.G. Young G.P. James R.J. Reduced accumulation of specific microRNAs in colorectal neoplasia.Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 882-891PubMed Google Scholar), contains a unique seed sequence that is conserved in Xenopus, zebrafish, and various mammals. Human miR-145 is enriched in germline and mesoderm-derived tissues, such as uterus, ovary, testis, prostate, spleen, and heart (Landgraf et al., 2007Landgraf P. Rusu M. Sheridan R. Sewer A. Iovino N. Aravin A. Pfeffer S. Rice A. Kamphorst A.O. Landthaler M. et al.A mammalian microRNA expression atlas based on small RNA library sequencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). We focused on miR-145 because it is predicted to target multiple hESC reprogramming factors—OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4—by TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2003Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Prediction of mammalian microRNA targets.Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar), miRBase (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006Griffiths-Jones S. Grocock R.J. van Dongen S. Bateman A. Enright A.J. miRBase: microRNA sequences, targets and gene nomenclature.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D140-D144Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar), and Miranda (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9265) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Thus, miR-145 is a strong candidate repressor of pluripotency genes. To investigate whether OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 can be directly targeted by miR-145, we engineered luciferase reporters that have either the wild-type 3′ UTRs of these genes, or the mutant UTRs with a 6 base pair (bp) deletion in the target sites (Figure 1D). Reporter constructs such as these are widely used to provide experimental evidence that miRNAs can directly repress translation initiation. In HeLa cells, the luciferase reporters were cotransfected with miRNA precursor (“pre-miRs”) mimics, which were processed into mature miRNAs. A scrambled precursor (“pre-scramble”) with no homology to the human genome was used to control the nonspecific effects of expression. Pre-scramble did not affect the reporter activities. The pre-miR mimic of miR-145 (“pre-miR-145”) significantly reduced the luciferase activities of the wild-type OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 reporters between 25%–33% compared to the negative control pre-scramble (two-tailed Student's t test, OCT4: p = 1.9 × 10−4; SOX2: p = 0.001; KLF4: p = 1.3 × 10−6; Figure 1E). In contrast, mutant reporters were not repressed by pre-miR-145, which indicates that the target site directly mediates the repression (Figure 1E). Furthermore, no reduced activity was observed with the pre-miR of miR-128 (“pre-miR-128”). miR-128 has no target sites in the OCT4 and SOX2 UTRs, but has a predicted target site in the KLF4 UTR by TargetScan. Additionally, miR-145 also repressed the OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 reporters in 293T cells (Figure S4). Taken together, these results show that miR-145 directly targets OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 3′ UTRs. We studied the role of endogenous miR-145 in repressing the OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 3′ UTR reporters in hESCs under self-renewal conditions. A luciferase reporter with no UTR was used as a negative control, which is resistant to any miRNA repression in hESCs. At 24 hr after transfection, there was significant repression on the wild-type 3′ UTR luciferase reporter activities of OCT4 (p = 5.1 × 10−5), SOX2 (p = 1.0 × 10−5), and KLF4 (p = 1.2 × 10−6) in comparison to the no-UTR control, and these effects persisted at 48 hr (Figures 2A–2C). In contrast, the mutant reporters with a 6 bp deletion of the miR-145 target sites had significantly less repression than the wild-type reporters (OCT4, p = 1.3 × 10−7; SOX2, p = 0.03; KLF4, p = 0.002. Figures 2A–2C). Particularly, the OCT4 mutant reporter was indistinguishable from the no-UTR control, which suggests that the OCT4 UTR is inhibited solely by miR-145. Unlike OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 may be downregulated by other miRNAs besides miR-145, as evidenced by the continued partial repression of the mutant reporters. We conclude that the endogenous miR-145 in hESCs is sufficient to repress OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 3′ UTR reporters directly. We further addressed the dependence of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 3′ UTR reporter repression on the level of miR-145. Because the difference between the wild-type and mutant reporters can be attributed to the action of miR-145 alone, the difference is best reflected by the ratio of the mutant reporter to the mean of the wild-type reporter (Lewis et al., 2003Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Prediction of mammalian microRNA targets.Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar). Indeed, the depletion of miR-145 by antisense inhibitor locked nuclei acid (LNA) in hESCs completely abolished the differential regulation between the mutant and wild-type 3′ UTR reporters (Figures 2D–2F), indicating that the repression on the target UTR reporters was miR-145 dependent. Next, we studied the repression of the OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 UTRs by miR-145 during hESC differentiation. Upon withdrawal of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in hESC cultures, the magnitude of repression for the OCT4 and KLF4 UTRs as represented by the ratio of the mutant to wild-type reporters showed a significant increase as differentiation progressed to day 2, 4, and 8 (Figures 2G and 2I). Consistent with the repression of the 3′ UTRs, OCT4 and KLF4 proteins also showed a gradual decrease during differentiation (Figure S5A). In contrast, the wild-type and mutant SOX2 reporters failed to exhibit a significant difference after differentiation (Figure 2H). These results indicate that the endogenous miR-145 exerts more repression on OCT4 and KLF4 than on SOX2 during hESC differentiation. miRNAs can downregulate gene expression by either of two posttranscriptional mechanisms: mRNA cleavage or translational repression (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27032) Google Scholar). Because luciferase assay does not distinguish the two mechanisms well, we further examined how miR-145 repressed the endogenous OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 in hESCs. We upregulated miR-145 by expressing the miR-145 precursor from a lentiviral vector (“Lenti-miR-145”), and studied the effect on the mRNA and protein levels of these three factors. Three days after Lenti-miR-145 virus infection, we isolated the GFP-positive (“GFP+”) hESC population that expressed the viral-vector-encoded GFP by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure 3A). To rule out any effect of lentivirus infection, we used the same lentivector expressing a scrambled sequence (“Lenti-scr”) with no homology to the human genome in parallel as a control. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA level of SOX2, but not OCT4 or KLF4, was decreased in the Lenti-miR-145 population compared to the Lenti-scr control population (Figure 3B). Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of OCT4 and KLF4, but not SOX2, were reduced by Lenti-miR-145 (Figure 3C). These results are in line with recent study demonstrating that some targets are repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, while other targets show mostly mRNA destabilization (Baek et al., 2008Baek D. Villen J. Shin C. Camargo F.D. Gygi S.P. Bartel D.P. The impact of microRNAs on protein output.Nature. 2008; 455: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). The reduction of the OCT4, KLF4 protein, and SOX2 mRNA levels indicates that these endogenous reprogramming factors are posttranscriptionally controlled by miR-145 in hESCs. Next, we investigated whether the endogenous miR-145 in hESCs is necessary to repress the three factors. We downregulated miR-145 in hESCs by transfection of the Alexa488-conjugated miR-145 antisense inhibitor LNA sequence (“LNA-miR-145”), and FACS isolated the Alexa488-positive population at 48 hr (Figure 3D). As a control, a scrambled LNA sequence (“LNA-scr”) was used in parallel. In comparison to the LNA-scr control, the mRNA level of SOX2 and the protein levels of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 were upregulated (Figures 3E and 3F) when miR-145 was depleted in LNA-miR-145. These findings are consistent with the capacity of endogenous miR-145 in hESCs to repress ectopic UTR reporters (Figure 2), and indicate that endogenous miR-145 constantly modulates the level of its targets. Next, we studied the functional role of miR-145 in modulating hESC self-renewal by a gain-of-function approach. As we have found that miR-145 targets multiple pluripotency factors, we investigated by analyzing the self-renewal marker SSEA4 whether the maintenance of self-renewal under normal culturing conditions would be affected by increased miR-145. In comparison to the negative control Lenti-scr, upregulation of miR-145 through Lenti-miR-145 expression for 6 days caused a significant drop of the self-renewal marker SSEA4 staining (p = 0.0004, Figure 4A) in lentiviral GFP-expressing cells analyzed by flow cytometry. This drop was comparable to that in hESC cultures deprived of bFGF for 6 days, which suggests that Lenti-miR-145 is a strong inhibitor of ESC pluripotency. The non-lentiviral-infected GFP-negative cells were unaffected (Figure S6B). Another self-renewal marker, Tra-1-81 staining, also confirmed the disruption of hESC maintenance by Lenti-miR-145 (Figure S6A). We also employed a positive control lentivirus expressing the previously validated OCT4-shRNA (“shOCT4”) (Zaehres et al., 2005Zaehres H. Lensch M.W. Daheron L. Stewart S.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Daley G.Q. High-efficiency RNA interference in human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The addition of shOCT4 decreased the self-renewal level significantly, as expected. Furthermore, Lenti-miR-145 culture also exhibited significantly higher apoptosis rate compared to the negative control Lenti-scr (p = 0.0002, Figure 4B) assayed by apoptosis marker annexin V flow cytometry in lentiviral GFP-expressing cells. This suggests that some cells resorted to apoptosis when they were unable to self-renew. Another feature of self-renewing hESCs is their long S phase in the cell cycle. Propidium iodide staining revealed that Lenti-miR-145 culture had significantly less S phase cells than Lenti-scr (Figure 4C). These results indicate that the miR-145 upregulation disrupts the maintenance of the self-renewal of hESCs, which suggests that miR-145 is a critical negative regulator of self-renewal. To assess the long-term effect of miR-145, we performed the colony formation assay. Individual hESCs infected by negative control Lenti-scr yielded compact and undifferentiated colonies (Figure 4D) that were all GFP positive, which suggests that the lenti-vector was stably integrated and highly expressed in these hESCs. In contrast, hESCs transduced with the Lenti-miR-145 produced small and grossly differentiated colonies (Figure 4D). Similar effects were observed in the positive control shOCT4 colonies. Quantification of the Lenti-miR-145 phenotypes showed that the miR-145 inhibited hESC clonogenicity more than shOCT4 (Figure 4E). At day 11, the Lenti-miR-145 cells showed a significant drop of self-renewal level compared to the negative control Lenti-scr (p = 1.4 × 10−9, Figure 4F). Furthermore, these Lenti-miR-145 colonies could not be propagated more than one generation under self-renewal culture conditions, which indicates depletion of stem cells. In summary, we found that upregulation of miR-145 alone in hESCs is sufficient to prohibit the maintenance of self-renewal, and miR-145 has strong effects probably because of its repression of all three pluripotency factors together. hESCs can differentiate into cells of extraembryonic trophectoderm and three different germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm.

Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses."

https://openalex.org/W2059750004,"Sirtuins are NAD-dependent protein deacetylases that connect metabolism and aging. In mammals, there are seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7), three of which are associated with mitochondria. Here, we show that SIRT5 localizes in the mitochondrial matrix and interacts with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), an enzyme, catalyzing the initial step of the urea cycle for ammonia detoxification and disposal. SIRT5 deacetylates CPS1 and upregulates its activity. During fasting, NAD in liver mitochondria increases, thereby triggering SIRT5 deacetylation of CPS1 and adaptation to the increase in amino acid catabolism. Indeed, SIRT5 KO mice fail to upregulate CPS1 activity and show elevated blood ammonia during fasting. Similar effects occur during long-term calorie restriction or a high protein diet. These findings demonstrate SIRT5 plays a pivotal role in ammonia detoxification and disposal by activating CPS1."
https://openalex.org/W2016967864,"Enveloped viruses that rely on a low pH-dependent step for entry initiate infection by fusing with acidic endosomes, whereas the entry sites for pH-independent viruses, such as HIV-1, have not been defined. These viruses have long been assumed to fuse directly with the plasma membrane. Here we used population-based measurements of the viral content delivery into the cytosol and time-resolved imaging of single viruses to demonstrate that complete HIV-1 fusion occurred in endosomes. In contrast, viral fusion with the plasma membrane did not progress beyond the lipid mixing step. HIV-1 underwent receptor-mediated internalization long before endosomal fusion, thus minimizing the surface exposure of conserved viral epitopes during fusion and reducing the efficacy of inhibitors targeting these epitopes. We also show that, strikingly, endosomal fusion is sensitive to a dynamin inhibitor, dynasore. These findings imply that HIV-1 infects cells via endocytosis and envelope glycoprotein- and dynamin-dependent fusion with intracellular compartments."

The ability of cells to properly apportion a complete set of chromosomes to each daughter cell during mitosis is dependent on a unique chromatin domain known as the centromere. It is this locus on the chromosome, through its recruitment of a large macromolecular protein complex, that mediates the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules as well as the transient recruitment of proteins involved in the mitotic or spindle assembly checkpoint (Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W.

Centromeric chromatin incorporates a unique centromeric nucleosome containing Centromere Protein-A (CENP-A). In humans, CENP-A assembles into centromeric nucleosomes that recruit a CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex (CENP-ANAC) present throughout the cell cycle (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E.

Distinct from the CENP-ANAC, the centromeric CENP-A nucleosome also interacts with three additional components, HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein, previously known as hFLEG1) and Nucleophosmin1 (NPM1) as well as the FACT complex (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R.

The consequence of the interaction of the CENP-A nucleosome with HJURP is explored below. Human centromeric DNA is primarily comprised of 171 base pair alpha-satellite elements arranged in tandem repeats (Manuelidis and Wu, 1978Manuelidis L. Wu J.C.

The centromere-specific nucleosomes are interspersed with canonical histone H3 containing nucleosomes (Blower et al., 2002Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H.

It is this unique CENP-A-containing chromatin that is the most likely candidate to constitute the epigenetic mark of the centromeres. Obviously, each round of DNA synthesis presents a challenge for the stable propagation of a centromeric epigenetic mark, including deposition at replicated centromeres of new CENP-A nucleosomes. Various compositions of CENP-A nucleosomes (or nucleosome-like complexes) have been suggested including tetrameric and hexameric complexes that could distinguish the CENP-A nucleosome from the canonical H3.1-containing octameric nucleosome (Dalal et al., 2007Dalal Y.

We now use affinity tagging to identify prenucleosomal complexes containing human CENP-A. One component, HJURP, is shown to be a CENP-A-selective histone chaperone required for assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes. Prenucleosomal CENP-A or histone H3.1 and their associated proteins were purified from chromatin-depleted extracts of cells stably expressing tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagged versions of CENP-A or histone H3.1 (Figures 1A and 1B). Since the chromatin-bound CENP-A-TAP in these cells had been demonstrated previously to directly bind a collection of centromere proteins that comprise the CENP-ANAC (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. The human CENP-A centromeric nucleosome-associated complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and localize properly to centromeres (Figure 1A), we reasoned that it must participate in the appropriate protein-protein interactions required for targeting and assembling new CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres. Comparable proportions of endogenous CENP-A, TAP-tagged CENP-A, or histone H3 were in the initial chromatin-free extracts (Figure 1C). Affinity purification of CENP-TAP or H3.1-TAP (using IgG-coupled beads) yielded complexes that were devoid of histone H2B (Figure 1D), consistent with complexes representing prenucleosomal forms. This is in contrast to the purification of histone H3.1 and CENP-A from nucleosome-containing chromatin extracts where stoichiometric amounts of histone H2A and H2B were present (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. The human CENP-A centromeric nucleosome-associated complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). A combination of silver staining (Figure 1E) and mass spectrometry (Table S1 available online) was used to demonstrate that the CENP-A and histone H3.1 prenucleosomal complexes obtained were almost completely distinct. Only histone H4, part of the final nucleosome, and HSP70 were common to both CENP-A and histone H3.1 prenucleosomal complexes. Consistent with previous reports (Kaufman et al., 1995Kaufman P.D.

The most prominent proteins uniquely associated with prenucleosomal CENP-A were the 32 kDa phosphoprotein NPM1 and the 83 kDa protein HJURP (Kato et al., 2007Kato T. Sato N. Hayama S. Yamabuki T. Ito T. Miyamoto M. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Activation of Holliday junction recognizing protein involved in the chromosomal stability and immortality of cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8544-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; Figure 1E). Homologs of HJURP were identified in several mammals (human and mouse share only 40% sequence identity; Figure S1B). Both NPM1 and HJURP were completely absent from prenucleosomal histone H3.1-TAP complexes. Both were also previously found to be associated with CENP-A nucleosomes present within centromeric chromatin, albeit at substantially lower levels as judged by silver staining and mass spectrometry (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. The human CENP-A centromeric nucleosome-associated complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The CENP-A prenucleosomal complex did not contain any of the known constitutive centromere components. Inspection of the HJURP sequences revealed five highly conserved tryptophan residues (Figures S1A and S1C) resembling the tryptophan-aspartate (WD40) repeats found in chromatin assembly factors such as CAF-1 p60, RbAp46, RbAp48, and HIRA (Figure S1D). Two additional proteins, RuvB like-1 (RuvBL1) and replication protein A1 (RPA1), were identified by solution mass spectrometry in association with prenucleosomal CENP-A, although with low sequence counts (Table S1). Neither were observable by silver staining (Figure 1E), and mass spectrometry of isolated silver-stained bands failed to reidentify these proteins, indicating that these proteins are, at best, substoichiometric components of the CENP-A prenucleosomal complex. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of chromatin-free extracts from untransfected HeLa cells was used to characterize the prenucleosomal complexes of endogenous CENP-A. The majority of CENP-A and HJURP migrated together with a 10 S sedimentation coefficient (Figure 2A). No significant pool of free CENP-A:H4 heterotetramer (3.2 S; Black et al., 2004Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Woods Jr., V.L. Cleveland D.W. Structural determinants for generating centromeric chromatin.Nature. 2004; 430: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or dimer was present and no histone H2B sedimented with CENP-A in this prenucleosomal fraction. A minority of NPM1 cofractionated with prenucleosomal CENP-A, consistent with only a small proportion of total NPM1 stably associated with CENP-A. The partial overlap of NPM1 and HJURP with each other supports their formation of distinct prenucleosomal complexes with CENP-A. The peak of soluble CENP-A fractions did not contain an enrichment of RPA1 or RuvBL1 (data not shown), further suggesting that these proteins may be associated with only a small subset of the CENP-A prenucleosomal complex. To determine whether HJURP directly binds CENP-A, GST-HJURP, CENP-A, and histone H4 were expressed and purified from E. coli. In assays where the CENP-A and histone H4 heterotetramer was combined with GST-HJURP or with GST, a complex with equimolar levels of CENP-A and H4 was selectively recovered with GST-HJURP (Figure 2B). When added to these binding assays, recombinant his-tagged H2A:H2B dimers did not interact with HJURP either alone or as part of the CENP-A:H4-HJURP complex. Thus, association of CENP-A:H4 and HJURP reflects a direct interaction that is independent of H2A:H2B and can form spontaneously in the absence of other cellular factors. To test if HJURP is required for CENP-A localization to centromeres, HJURP levels were reduced by transfection of siRNA targeting HJURP mRNA. Within 72 hr, HJURP protein levels were reduced to below 5% of their initial levels (Figure 3A). Cell-cycle distribution of the resulting cell population was not affected (Figure S2). By three cell cycles after initiating HJURP depletion, the majority of cells had substantially reduced levels of endogenous CENP-A (Figures 3B and 3D) or YFP-CENP-A (Figures 3C and 3E) at individual centromeres. Since expression of YFP-CENP-A is controlled by the 5′ LTR of the virus used to produce the stable lines, this latter finding demonstrates that CENP-A loss is not due to cell-cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation of CENP-A. Cells reduced in HJURP developed a higher proportion (accumulating to more than a third of the total by 72 hr) of misshapen, multilobed nuclei or contained micronuclei (Figure 3F). Both morphological abnormalities were phenocopies of siRNA-mediated reduction in CENP-A itself (Black et al., 2007aBlack B.E. Jansen L.E. Maddox P.S. Foltz D.R. Desai A.B. Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W.

Our attempts to alter CENP-A nucleosome assembly by reducing NPM1 protein levels by siRNA showed no effect on overall levels of CENP-A at the centromere following a 72 hr treatment (data not shown). As we were only able to obtain modest suppression of NPM1 (70% reduction), we cannot rule out that the degree of NPM1 knockdown is insufficient to alter CENP-A assembly, especially given that NPM1 is a highly expressed protein. However, it is also possible that NPM1 plays a nonessential role in the assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes or that the nucleophosmin paralogs NPM2 and NPM3 may compensate for the absence of NPM1. Long-term reduction of HJURP resulted in a reduction of the level of CENP-A protein overall (Figures 3A and S3B), consistent with failure to load new CENP-A and/or loss from centromeres and suggesting instability of the pool of CENP-A that is not associated with the prenucleosomal complex or incorporated into centromeric chromatin. To test if putative histone chaperone activity of HJURP was limited to stabilizing prenucleosomal CENP-A, but not directly involved in its centromeric loading, CENP-A was expressed at high levels. If HJURP was required for stability but not loading, CENP-A should be in"

This information is of particular importance with regard to AMPA-type glutamate receptors, the multimeric complexes assembled from GluA1-A4 subunits, as the trafficking of these receptors into and out of synapses is proposed to depend upon the subunit composition of the receptor. We report a molecular quantification of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) by employing a single-cell genetic approach coupled with electrophysiology in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. In contrast to prevailing views, we find that GluA1A2 heteromers are the dominant AMPARs at CA1 cell synapses (∼80%). In cells lacking GluA1, -A2, and -A3, synapses are devoid of AMPARs, yet synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and dendritic morphology remain unchanged. These data demonstrate a functional dissociation of AMPARs from trafficking of NMDARs and neuronal morphogenesis.

This study provides a functional quantification of the subunit composition of AMPARs in the CNS and suggests novel roles for AMPAR subunits in receptor trafficking. The advent of molecular biology and receptor cloning has resulted in extraordinary advances in our understanding of neurotransmitter receptors. Virtually all ionotropic receptors are multimeric structures composed of variable combinations of subunits. The function and trafficking of these receptors are critically dependent on their subunit composition. Based on the biophysical properties of heterologously expressed receptors; the expression pattern of the subunits; conventional gene knockout (KO) approaches; and, in rare instances, the discovery of subunit selective antagonists, the subunit composition of native synaptic receptors has been inferred but not unambiguously established. We have focused on determining the subunit composition of AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at the excitatory Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses onto CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, arguably the most-studied synapse in the brain. This synapse releases glutamate that acts on two types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, AMPARs and NMDARs. AMPARs are primarily responsible for the fast moment-to-moment communication at excitatory synapses and undergo rapid activity-dependent recruitment during synaptic plasticity. Four subunits, GluA1–A4 (GluR1–4 or GluR-A to -D) (Collingridge et al., 2008Collingridge G.L. Olsen R.W. Peters J. Spedding M. A nomenclature for ligand-gated ion channels.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 56: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), contribute to the formation of heterotetrameric receptors (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R.

The subunit composition of AMPARs has received a great deal of attention, as it has been proposed to dictate the mode of AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A.

In addition, the biophysical properties of AMPARs are thought to depend on subunit composition (Cull-Candy et al., 2006Cull-Candy S. Kelly L. Farrant M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the precise subunit composition has remained elusive, even at the best-studied synapse in the brain. We have used a single-cell genetic approach that combines the use of electrophysiology and conditional KO mice for GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 (GRIA1fl/fl, GRIA2fl/fl, GRIA3fl/fl) to delete each of the GluA subunits, either alone or in combination, by expressing Cre recombinase in individual CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. The subunit composition of synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPARs was determined by simultaneous whole-cell recording from Cre-expressing cells and neighboring control cells, as well as recording from somatic outside-out patches (OOPs). Comparing the results of single subunit deletions with multiple subunit deletions provided a cross-validation that was remarkably consistent, thus permitting a rigorous quantification of the subunit composition of AMPARs. We found that approximately 80% of synaptic and >95% of somatic extrasynaptic receptors are GluA1A2 heteromers. The remaining receptors are GluA2A3 heteromers. Importantly, the number and composition of synaptic NMDARs remain unchanged in the complete absence of AMPARs, and no obvious change in dendritic morphology was observed. The present results provide a quantification of the subunit composition of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses in the CNS, and facilitate understanding of AMPAR trafficking and synaptic plasticity in vivo. Furthermore, the approach outlined in this study of simultaneously deleting multiple genes in single cells is equally powerful in defining the specific roles of any family of related proteins. Of all the AMPAR subunits, GluA2 has the most impact on the biophysical properties of the resulting heteromeric complexes. AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit are strongly inwardly rectifying in the presence of intracellular polyamines and are Ca2+ permeable, whereas those that contain the GluA2 subunit have a linear or near-linear current-voltage (I/V) relationship and are impermeable to divalent cations (Cull-Candy et al., 2006Cull-Candy S.

The time course of signaling at central glutamatergic synapses.News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). This unique property, conferred by the presence of the GluA2 subunit, is due to the Arg607 residue introduced into the GluA2 pore loop by RNA editing at the Q/R site (Sommer et al., 1991Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels.Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Such properties are easily observed during electrophysiological recordings, the technique that we use throughout this paper to isolate the properties of fully functional, surface-expressed heteromeric AMPAR complexes. There is general agreement that, under basal conditions, synaptic AMPARs at CA1 pyramidal neurons are composed of heteromeric receptors containing the edited GluA2 subunit (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. AMPA receptor trafficking at excitatory synapses.Neuron. 2003; 40: 361-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R.

The cell biology of synaptic plasticity: AMPA receptor trafficking.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is unclear whether extrasynaptic receptors, which abound on the surface of CA1 pyramidal cells and are proposed to serve as a reserve receptor pool for the synapse, have the same composition as synaptic receptors with respect to their GluA2 subunit content. This is an important issue, because biochemical studies have detected a small but significant population of GluA1 homomeric receptors in the hippocampus (Sans et al., 2003Sans N. Vissel B. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Chang K. Royle G.A. Wang C.Y. O'Gorman S. Heinemann S.F. Wenthold R.J.

Evidence for multiple AMPA receptor complexes in hippocampal CA1/CA2 neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and understanding the identity of extrasynaptic AMPARs is crucial for studying LTP. Two standard methods were used to determine whether surface AMPARs in WT mice contain or lack the GluA2 subunit. The first method was to measure the I/V relationship of glutamate-evoked AMPAR currents in OOPs pulled from the soma of CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices. The second method involved determining the sensitivity of the AMPAR response to the polyamine toxin, philanthotoxin 433 (PhTx-433). GluA2-lacking receptors are strongly and selectively blocked by PhTx-433, whereas GluA2-containing receptors are not (Washburn and Dingledine, 1996Washburn M.S. Dingledine R. Block of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors by polyamines and polyamine toxins.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar). Since the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells lack excitatory synapses (Megias et al., 2001Megias M. Emri Z. Freund T.F. Gulyas A.I. Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), we used somatic OOPs to study the properties of extrasynaptic AMPARs. First we examined the properties of AMPAR responses in the germline GluA2 KO mouse that lacks GluA2 in every cell (Jia et al., 1996Jia Z. Agopyan N. Miu P. Xiong Z. Henderson J. Gerlai R. Taverna F.A. Velumian A. MacDonald J. Carlen P. et al.Enhanced LTP in mice deficient in the AMPA receptor GluR2.Neuron. 1996; 17: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We applied glutamate with cyclothiazide to these patches in the presence of APV, picrotoxin, and TTX as a way of isolating glutamate-evoked, AMPAR-mediated current. As expected, the I/V showed strong inward rectification (Figures 1A and 1C). A dose-response analysis demonstrated that the minimal concentration of PhTx-433 required to rapidly and completely block AMPAR-mediated currents in the GluA2 KO mouse was 100 nM (Figures 1A and 1D). We next examined the properties of extrasynaptic AMPARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons from wild-type (WT) mice. In this case, the I/V was near linear (Figures 1B and 1C), suggesting that all AMPARs contain GluA2. To confirm this, we found that glutamate-evoked current was untouched by the application of 100 nM PhTx-433 (Figures 1B and 1D). Our results, combined with previous work, indicate that GluA1 homomers—and indeed any AMPAR complex lacking GluA2—are excluded from the surface of CA1 pyramidal cells from animals at the age of 2–4 weeks under basal conditions. Previously, germline AMPAR subunit deletions have been employed to study the contributions of individual subunits to synaptic transmission (Andrasfalvy et al., 2003Andrasfalvy B.K.

However, this traditional KO approach is potentially problematic for this specific question for at least two reasons. First, the absence of a protein throughout neurodevelopment could lead to compensatory changes that render the resulting cellular phenotype a false readout of the true contribution of the protein in the native condition (Elias et al., 2006Elias G.M. Funke L. Stein V. Grant S.G. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Synapse-specific and developmentally regulated targeting of AMPA receptors by a family of MAGUK scaffolding proteins.Neuron. 2006; 52: 307-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Second, in addition to the direct (desired) effect, germline deletion of an AMPAR allele has the potential to indirectly affect AMPARs by affecting the activity of presynaptic inputs and indeed the entire circuit behavior of the brain, producing undesired consequences on the activity-dependent development of excitatory synapses. For these reasons, we used a different approach in an attempt to determine contributions of AMPAR subunits to synaptic transmission: we used conditional KO alleles for GluA1 (Engblom et al., 2008Engblom D. Bilbao A. Sanchis-Segura C. Dahan L. Perreau-Lenz S. Balland B. Parkitna J.R. Lujan R. Halbout B. Mameli M. et al.Glutamate receptors on dopamine neurons control the persistence of cocaine seeking.Neuron. 2008; 59: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), GluA2 (Shimshek et al., 2005Shimshek D.R. Bus T. Kim J. Mihaljevic A. Mack V. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Schaefer A.T. Enhanced odor discrimination and impaired olfactory memory by spatially controlled switch of AMPA receptors.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e354https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and GluA3 (see the Experimental Procedures) and created homozygous gene-targeted mouse strains for each (GRIA1fl/fl, GRIA2fl/fl, and GRIA3fl/fl). To eliminate the target gene, Cre recombinase was expressed in a small set of hippocampal neurons either by inoculating the hippocampus of P0–P2 mice by transcranial stereotactic injection with a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing Cre covalently bound to GFP (rAAV-Cre-GFP) or biolistic transfection of a Cre-IRES-GFP construct in hippocampal slice cultures from P5–P7 mice. With both P0 injections and slice cultures, we could genetically alter a small percentage of hippocampal neurons, thus minimizing the impact of altered circuit behavior on the physiology of recorded neurons. In addition, deletion of AMPAR subunit alleles occurred in closer temporal relation to the time of recording than can be achieved in germline mutants, reducing possible compensatory effects. Simultaneous recordings from a GFP-expressing cell and a neighboring control cell, with a single stimulating electrode to evoke EPSCs in both cells, permitted study of the postsynaptic effects of the genetic manipulation while controlling for presynaptic inputs. By breeding the GRIA1fl/fl, GRIA2fl/fl, and GRIA3fl/fl mice to each other, we succeeded in generating triple-GRIA1-3fl/fl mice. Figure 2A shows a typical acute slice made at P25 from a mouse injected at P0 with CA1 pyramidal cells infected with rAAV-Cre-GFP. Cre expression, and thus GFP, is confined to the nucleus. Recording from a Cre-expressing cell (green trace in inset) in the triple-GRIA1-3fl/fl mice demonstrated the complete absence of AMPAR EPSCs recorded at −70 mV (Figures 2B1 and 2B3), whereas the size of the NMDAR EPSCs was the same as that recorded in the control cell (black trace in inset) (Figures 2B2 and 2B3). We also measured the glutamate-evoked AMPAR currents from extrasynaptic receptors in somatic OOPs. In contrast to the large and reproducible currents in control cells, Cre-expressing cells exhibited no detectable current (Figure 2C). These findings indicate that GluA1, -A2, and -A3 fully account for functional AMPARs in CA1 pyramidal cells. In no case did Cre-expressing cells express AMPARs, indicating that the recombination is extremely efficient. The lack of change in the NMDAR EPSCs suggests that the number of synapses and release of glutamate are unchanged. We examined the properties of the NMDAR EPSCs more closely, because it is well established that neuronal activity controls the developmental switch of the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs (Barria and Malinow, 2002Barria A.

In particular, immature synapses primarily express NR2B-containing receptors with slow kinetics and high sensitivity to the NR2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil. These receptors are then replaced by NR2A-containing receptors with fast kinetics. Surprisingly, despite the loss of all AMPAR excitatory drive, the decay of the NMDAR EPSCs (Figure 2D), as well as their sensitivity to ifenprodil (Figures 2E1 and 2E2), were the same as in control cells, indicating that neuronal activity, presumably due to NMDAR activation in these cells in vivo, is still sufficient for the “activity-dependent” switch in NR2 subunits observed during development. Finally, we examined the voltage sensitivity of the NMDAR EPSCs and found that it, too, was the same as that in control cells (Figure 2F). The lack of change in the NMDAR EPSCs implies that there is no change in the number of synapses or in the release of glutamate in our experimental conditions. A detailed examination of the morphology of neurons entirely lacking AMPARs confirmed the physiological results. After about 3 weeks of rAAV-Cre-GFP injection, when the infected neurons lack detectable AMPAR-mediated currents (Figures 2B and 2C), CA1 pyramidal neurons were filled with fluorescent dyes, fixed, and examined with confocal microscopy (Figures 2G and 2H). We could detect no change in the average number of branchpoints of dendrites, dendritic length, or spine density (see the Experimental Procedures). Given that surface AMPAR expression does not exist after GluA1, -A2, and -A3 deletion, we next sought to determine the relative contributions of each subunit. We first examined the consequence of deleting GluA1 over time. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures provided a simple preparation to follow the time course of subunit depletion. We prepared slice cultures from P5-7 mice (see the Experimental Procedures) and performed biolistic transfection of a Cre-IRES-GFP construct 2 days later. Following the expression of Cre in GRIA1fl/fl hippocampal slice cultures, there was a gradual decrease in AMPAR EPSC amplitudes that stabilized at ∼20% of control values at ∼14 days after transfection, while there was no change in the NMDAR EPSCs (Figures 3A1 and 3A2). None of the manipulations carried out in the rest of this study resulted in a change in the NMDAR EPSC. Although a precise time course was not carried out in the P0 in vivo inoculation experiments, AMPAR EPSCs also stabilized at ∼20% but required approximately 3 weeks after initial viral injection to reach this stabilized state. Since there was no obvious difference between the two sets of data (see Figure S1 available online), we pooled the data from both slice cultures and acute slices for each pair of recordings. The scatter plot shows that there was an 80.6% ± 3.1% (n = 31) loss of the AMPAR EPSCs (Figures 3B1, 3B3, and 3B4). The I/V of the remaining AMPAR EPSCs, recorded after pharmacological blockade of NMDARs, remained linear, indicating that the remaining receptors contained GluA2 (Figure 3C). To analyze the mechanism for reduced AMPAR EPSCs, we recorded mEPSCs (Figures 3E and 3F). There was a clear decrease in the amplitude of mEPSCs (Figure 3F1), indicating that there is a loss of AMPARs from all synapses, as well as a decrease in frequency (Figure 3F2). Given the absence of any apparent change in presynaptic release probability, as measured by PPF (Figure 3D), a decrease in mEPSC frequency could be explained if functional AMPARs at a population of synapses are below the detection threshold or lost entirely. As the decay kinetics of mEPSCs depends on subunit composition (Jonas, 2000Jonas P. The time course of signaling at central glutamatergic synapses.News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar), we measured the decay of mEPSCs. Superimposed peak-normalized traces (Figure 3E) show that the kinetics are faster in the absence of GluA1 (Cnt, 11.3 ± 0.5 ms, n = 22; GluA1, 7.7 ± 1.4 ms, n = 10; p < 0.01) (Figure 3F3). These data suggest that GluA1A2 heteromers account for approximately 80% of synaptic AMPARs. Although there remains the formal possibility that some GluR1 protein persists weeks after the onset of Cre expression, and that remaining AMPARs still contain GluA1, it is more likely that remaining AMPARs are GluA2A3 heteromers, as demonstrated below. The profound loss of functional synaptic AMPARs following the ablation of GluA1, coupled with the fact that the I/V of the synaptic currents remains linear, suggests that GluA2A3 receptors contribute ∼20% to basal synaptic transmission. In keeping with the modest role of GluA3, deleting GluA3 resulted in a 16.3% ± 10.0% (n = 19) decrease in AMPAR EPSCs (Figures 3B2 and 3B3). It remains a possibility that some type of compensation might underestimate the actual contribution of GluA3. However, the cross-validation by deletion of GluA1 or GluA3 alone (Figure 3B) suggests that such compensation, if any, is minimal. Given the small effects of GluA3 deletion, we did not examine time points earlier than 3 weeks after rAAV-Cre-GFP infection. The change in synaptic transmission was not associated with any change in rectification (Figure 3C) or in PPF (Figure 3D). No significant change in either the amplitude or the frequency of mEPSCs was detected (Figures 3E and 3F). These data suggest that about 80% of receptors are GluA1A2 heteromers and that about 16% are GluA2A3 heteromers at excitatory synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Since all surface AMPARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons contain GluA2, we were interested in how the cell responded to its loss. Following the transfection of Cre in slice cultures, the AMPAR EPSC amplitudes fell to ∼50% of control values at 6 days and then remained constant (Figure 4A1). In contrast, there was a gradual decrease in the rectification index (RI), measured in the presence of NMDAR blockers, which stabilized at 12–14 days (Figures 4A1, 4A2, and 4C). It is not entirely clear what might account for the striking difference in the rectification and AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude at day 6. Nevertheless, the decrease in RI represents the gradual loss of GluA2-containing receptors. The RI at 12–14 days is identical to that recorded in the GluA2 germline KO, indicating that by 2 weeks no functional GluA2-containing synaptic receptors are left (Figures 4A1 and 4A2). In these same experiments, no change in the NMDAR EPSCs was observed (Figures 4A1 and 4A2). rAAV-Cre-GFP experiments with GRIA2fl/fl mice also showed that loss of GluA2 caused an ∼50% loss of AMPAR EPSCs. Since there was no obvious difference between the results obtained from P0 injections and the slice culture experiments (Figure S1), the data were pooled, and a single scatter plot of the values obtained at 12–14 days postinfection/posttransfection is shown (Figures 4B1–4B3). There was a 48.3% ± 3.8% (n = 86) loss of the AMPAR EPSCs. In addition, PPF did not change, excluding a change in release probability (Figure 4D). Is the decrease in the evoked synaptic responses due to a uniform loss of receptors across the entire population of synapses, as in the case with GluA1 deletion? To address this question, we examined mEPSCs (Figures 4E and 4F). Remarkably, there was no change in the mean amplitude of mEPSCs (Figures 4E and 4F1) but a dramatic reduction in frequency (Figure 4F2). This suggests that two processes occur during the los"
https://openalex.org/W2159079025,"The histone H3 variant CenH3, called CENP-A in humans, is central in centromeric chromatin to ensure proper chromosome segregation. In the absence of an underlying DNA sequence, it is still unclear how CENP-A deposition at centromeres is determined. Here, we purified non-nucleosomal CENP-A complexes to identify direct CENP-A partners involved in such a mechanism and identified HJURP. HJURP was not detected in H3.1- or H3.3-containing complexes, indicating its specificity for CENP-A. HJURP centromeric localization is cell cycle regulated, and its transient appearance at the centromere coincides precisely with the proposed time window for new CENP-A deposition. Furthermore, HJURP downregulation leads to a major reduction in CENP-A at centromeres and impairs deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A, causing mitotic defects. We conclude that HJURP is a key factor for CENP-A deposition and maintenance at centromeres."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), whereas neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are spared. Using intracellular patch electrochemistry to directly measure cytosolic dopamine (DAcyt) in cultured midbrain neurons, we confirm that elevated DAcyt and its metabolites are neurotoxic and that genetic and pharmacological interventions that decrease DAcyt provide neuroprotection. L-DOPA increased DAcyt in SN neurons to levels 2- to 3-fold higher than in VTA neurons, a response dependent on dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, resulting in greater susceptibility of SN neurons to L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. DAcyt was not altered by α-synuclein deletion, although dopaminergic neurons lacking α-synuclein were resistant to L-DOPA-induced cell death. Thus, an interaction between Ca2+, DAcyt, and α-synuclein may underlie the susceptibility of SN neurons in PD, suggesting multiple therapeutic targets. The basis for selective death of specific neuronal populations in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear.

Thus, an interaction between Ca2+, DAcyt, and α-synuclein may underlie the susceptibility of SN neurons in PD, suggesting multiple therapeutic targets. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and a progressive loss of specific neuronal populations. In particular, ventral midbrain (VM) dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) preferentially degenerate in PD, while neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons are relatively spared (Dauer and Przedborski, 2003Dauer W. Przedborski S. Parkinson's disease: mechanisms and models.Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3649) Google Scholar). A role of α-syn in PD pathogenesis is demonstrated by cases of familial PD that result from mutations or overexpression of α-syn, as well as by the observation that SN neurons in mice with α-syn deletion are protected against the parkinsonian neurotoxins MPTP and 6-OHDA (Alvarez-Fischer et al., 2008Alvarez-Fischer D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42655-42668Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has also been recently suggested that high Ca2+ levels due to Cav1.3 channel-dependent pacemaking activity (Nedergaard et al., 1993Nedergaard S. Flatman J.A. Engberg I. Nifedipine- and ω-conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ conductances in guinea-pig substantia nigra pars compacta neurones.J. Physiol. 1993; 466: 727-747PubMed Google Scholar) may contribute to SN susceptibility, as VTA neurons use Na+ channels for pacemaking (Chan et al., 2007Chan C.S. Guzman J.N. Ilijic E. Mercer J.N. Rick C. Tkatch T. Meredith G.E. Surmeier D.J. ‘Rejuvenation’ protects neurons in mouse models of Parkinson's disease.Nature. 2007; 447: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Cav1.3 antagonists block SN cell death in MPTP and other neurotoxin models (Chan et al., 2007Chan C.S. Guzman J.N. Ilijic E. Mercer J.N. Rick C. Tkatch T. Meredith G.E.

The reason for the preferential death of SN DA neurons is, however, unclear, as both α-syn and Cav1.3 channels are expressed throughout the CNS in neurons that are not lost in PD (Clayton and George, 1998Clayton D.F.

A long-standing hypothesis of neurodegeneration in PD postulates that the buildup of cytosolic DA (DAcyt) with associated oxyradical stress and its possible interaction with α-syn and other PD-related proteins underlie neurotoxicity (Caudle et al., 2008Caudle W.M.

A role for DAcyt in the selectivity of cell death in PD, however, has never been directly studied due to a lack of means to measure DAcyt. Here we use a new electrochemical approach to measure DAcyt in neurons following various pharmacological and genetic interventions. We report that “multiple hits” consisting of high cytoplasmic Ca2+, elevated DAcyt, and α-syn expression are required to evoke selective death of dopaminergic neurons from SN and show that interference with any of these three factors rescues the neurons. We previously introduced intracellular patch electrochemistry (IPE) to study the regulation of cytosolic catecholamine homeostasis in cultured primary murine adrenal chromaffin cells (Mosharov et al., 2003Mosharov E.V. Gong L.W. Khanna B. Sulzer D. Lindau M. Intracellular patch electrochemistry: regulation of cytosolic catecholamines in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5835-5845PubMed Google Scholar) and the PC12 cell line (Mosharov et al., 2006Mosharov E.V. Staal R.G. Bove J. Prou D. Hananiya A. Markov D. Poulsen N. Larsen K.E. Moore C.M. Troyer M.D. et al.α-synuclein overexpression increases cytosolic catecholamine concentration.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9304-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To extend IPE measurements to DA neurons, we employed VM cultures from mice that express green fluorescent protein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter (TH-GFP; see Figure S1 available online) (Sawamoto et al., 2001Sawamoto K. Nakao N. Kobayashi K. Matsushita N. Takahashi H. Kakishita K. Yamamoto A. Yoshizaki T. Terashima T. Murakami F. et al.Visualization, direct isolation, and transplantation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 6423-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of fixed 2-week-old cultures of VM neurons for TH showed that approximately 97% of GFP+ cells were TH+ (185 of 191 cells). IPE measurements in cyclic voltammetric (CV) mode that detects DA preferentially over other intracellular metabolites (including L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine [L-DOPA] and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [DOPAC]) revealed that DAcyt in untreated GFP+ neurons was below the detection limits of the technique (<0.1 μM). This was similar to DAcyt levels in PC12 cells (Mosharov et al., 2006Mosharov E.V. Staal R.G. Bove J. Prou D. Hananiya A. Markov D. Poulsen N. Larsen K.E. Moore C.M. Troyer M.D. et al.α-synuclein overexpression increases cytosolic catecholamine concentration.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9304-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but differed from the 10–20 μM cytosolic catecholamine concentrations found in untreated chromaffin cells (Mosharov et al., 2003Mosharov E.V. Gong L.W. Khanna B. Sulzer D. Lindau M. Intracellular patch electrochemistry: regulation of cytosolic catecholamines in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5835-5845PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that 1 hr pretreatment with 100 μM L-DOPA produces a 2- to 3-fold increase of cytosolic catecholamine concentration in chromaffin cells (Mosharov et al., 2003Mosharov E.V. Gong L.W. Khanna B. Sulzer D. Lindau M. Intracellular patch electrochemistry: regulation of cytosolic catecholamines in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5835-5845PubMed Google Scholar). The same dose of L-DOPA increased DAcyt in GFP+ neurons to 17.4 ± 1.7 μM (mean ± SEM; n = 74 cells). To determine the kinetics of DAcyt changes after L-DOPA treatment, we performed IPE at 1, 8, 15, and 24 hr after L-DOPA addition to the media. After 1 hr of 100 μM L-DOPA exposure, DA in the cytosol reached a steady-state level that was maintained for ∼8 hr, followed by a decline to control levels over the succeeding 24 hr of drug treatment (Figure 1A). Interestingly, 500 μM L-DOPA increased DAcyt to the same maximum level, but the elevated steady state was maintained longer, and 24 hr after L-DOPA treatment, DAcyt was still higher than in untreated cells. To study the dependence of DAcyt on extracellular L-DOPA, neuronal cultures were treated with a range of L-DOPA concentrations for 1 hr at 37°C, followed by IPE measurements in the presence of the same L-DOPA concentrations in the bath and in the pipette solutions within the following 30 min at room temperature. The drug response curve was hyperbolic (Figure 1B) with an apparent K0.5 of ∼10 μM L-DOPA. As the steady-state DA concentration in neuronal cytosol is regulated by multiple enzymes and transporters, we attempted to determine which metabolic step limited DAcyt accumulation in L-DOPA-treated cells. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC) measurements of the total intracellular DA (the majority of which represents vesicular DA; Chien et al., 1990Chien J.B.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5835-5845PubMed Google Scholar) and DOPAC contents showed that these metabolites were elevated to the same degree in neurons exposed to 100 and 500 μM L-DOPA (Figure 1C), indicating that there was no difference in the rates of DA oxidation by monoamine oxidase A (MAO) and vesicular uptake by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). To establish whether L-DOPA transport into the cell or its conversion to DA by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) limited the L-DOPA metabolic consumption, we measured total intracellular L-DOPA levels in VM cultures after 1 hr treatment with 100 and 500 μM L-DOPA concentrations in the presence of the AADC inhibitor benserazide to block DA synthesis (Figure 1D). The initial rate of L-DOPA accumulation in the cells was not saturated under these conditions, consistent with previously published data (Sampaio-Maia et al., 2001Sampaio-Maia B. Serrao M.P. Soares-da-Silva P. Regulatory pathways and uptake of L-DOPA by capillary cerebral endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neuronal cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C333-C342PubMed Google Scholar) on the kinetics of L-DOPA uptake by cell lines derived from astrocytes and neurons (Km = 50–100 μM). Overall, these data suggest that the activity of AADC limits the steady-state DAcyt concentration following L-DOPA treatment. The data in Figure 1C also provide information about the rate of L-DOPA turnover by the cells. The combined rate of DA and DOPAC synthesis during 1 hr of L-DOPA exposure was ∼40 fmol/μg of total protein. As each culture dish typically contained 50 −100 μg of total protein, the rate of L-DOPA consumption during 10 hr of incubation was 20–40 pmol per culture. This rate, however, is too low to account for the decline in the DAcyt observed after 10 hr of cell incubation with L-DOPA (Figure 1A), as the total amount of available L-DOPA was >3 orders of magnitude higher (200 nmol in 2 ml of 100 μM solution). We therefore examined the availability of extracellular L-DOPA, which is known to auto-oxidize to DOPA-semiquinone and DOPA-quinone derivatives (Sulzer and Zecca, 2000Sulzer D. Zecca L. Intraneuronal dopamine-quinone synthesis: a review.Neurotox. Res. 2000; 1: 181-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC-EC measurements of L-DOPA concentration in cell-free media showed that the drug disappeared with first-order kinetics and a half-life of 4.7 hr (Figure 1E). This suggests that after 100 or 500 μM L-DOPA initial doses, its concentration in the media would reach the K0.5 levels in 16 or 26 hr, respectively (Figure 1F), which is in close agreement with the kinetics of DAcyt changes, as a significant decrease in its initial steady state was observed at approximately these time points (Figure 1A). Together, these data allow us to predict the time dependence of DAcyt changes based on the concentration of L-DOPA added to the media and the initial increase in DAcyt determined by IPE (see Discussion). We next investigated whether exposure to various L-DOPA concentrations, and thereby different durations of sustained elevated DAcyt, correlated with neurotoxicity. We identified an exponential dependence of neurotoxicity on the extracellular L-DOPA concentration (Figure 2A), whereas the time dependence for cell survival in cultures treated with 250 μM L-DOPA demonstrated that the number of TH+ neurons declined linearly after drug exposure, reaching ∼50% of the control levels after 4 days, with no subsequent neuronal loss (Figure 2B). As L-DOPA at this concentration is cleared within ∼22 hr, the data indicate a lag between the end of L-DOPA/DA-mediated stress and the completed course of the catechol-induced toxicity. For further experiments we exposed cultures to 250 μM L-DOPA, which consistently produced ∼50% loss of VM dopaminergic neurons 4 days following drug addition. Extracellular DA released by neuronal activity did not seem to play a significant role in the L-DOPA-induced cell death, as neuronal viability was not affected by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM), which inhibits stimulation-dependent transmitter release (data not shown). To further determine which pool of DA was responsible for the observed cell damage, we employed postnatal cultures of cortical and striatal neurons, which do not express TH, DAT, or VMAT. Following L-DOPA treatment of cortical neurons, we detected small amounts of DA measured by HPLC-EC (Figure 1C) and a substantial elevation of DAcyt measured by IPE (Figure 2C). This was accompanied by >60% loss of cells immunoreactive to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which was used as a neuronal marker (Figure 2D). L-DOPA neurotoxicity was NSD-1015 sensitive, confirming AADC-mediated DA synthesis in cortical neurons (data not shown). In contrast, almost no DAcyt was detected in L-DOPA-treated striatal neurons, and they were spared following L-DOPA challenge (Figures 2C and 2D). Together, our data suggest DAcyt as the primary source of the L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. To study the contribution of individual metabolic pathways in the maintenance of the DAcyt steady state and to determine whether changes in DA level correlate with neurotoxicity, we performed metabolite measurements and toxicity studies on L-DOPA-treated neurons that were preincubated with specific inhibitors of AADC, MAO, and VMAT. Inhibition of the DA-synthesizing enzyme AADC with NSD-1015 (Figures 3A and 3B) or benserazide (not shown) blocked L-DOPA-induced elevation of whole-cell intracellular DA and DOPAC. Benserazide also inhibited the buildup of DAcyt following L-DOPA treatment (Figure 3C), consistent with the idea that the IPE oxidation signal comes from DA synthesized by AADC in the cytosol (note that NSD-1015 alters IPE sensitivity for DA, and therefore was not examined; see Experimental Procedures). Moreover, the blockade of L-DOPA decarboxylation completely prevented drug-induced cell death (Figure 3D), indicating that an L-DOPA metabolite, but not L-DOPA itself, was responsible for the toxicity. (A and B) HPLC-EC measurements of total intracellular DA (A) and DOPAC (B) in rat VM neuronal cultures pretreated for 1 hr with 500 μM NSD-1015, 2 μM reserpine (Res), or 10 μM pargyline (PGL) and then treated with 100 μM L-DOPA for 1 hr (n = 6–10 dishes).

Dotted lines and shadowed boxes in (D) and (F) represent mean ± SEM in untreated cells. The contribution of DA catabolism was investigated by treating cells with pargyline, an inhibitor of MAO that almost completely abolished DOPAC synthesis (Figure 3B). Pargyline also produced a several-fold increase in both the total amount of intracellular DA (Figure 3A) and DAcyt (Figure 3C) in L-DOPA-treated neurons, which further correlated with a significantly greater neuronal loss (Figure 3D). The blockade of VMAT-mediated DA uptake into the vesicles depletes vesicular catecholamine storage, as observed by a reduction in the exocytotic quantal size (Colliver et al., 2000Colliver T. Hess E. Pothos E.N. Sulzer D. Ewing A.G. Quantitative and statistical analysis of the shape of amperometric spikes recorded from two populations of cells.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consistently, pretreatment of VM neurons with reserpine decreased the amount of total intracellular DA synthesized from L-DOPA by ∼2-fold both with and without pargyline (Figure 3A). We observed, however, no effect of reserpine, or another VMAT inhibitor, tetrabenazine (10 μM; data not shown), on either DAcyt or the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons (Figures 3C and 3D). The discrepancy between the reduction of the total DA in reserpine-treated neurons and the lack of the effect of VMAT inhibition on DAcyt might be explained by the distribution of synaptic vesicles between neuronal cell bodies and the neurites. If the majority of vesicles filled with DA are located in synaptic terminals far from the cell bodies, any transmitter redistributed from them would be invisible to IPE (see Experimental Procedures). To examine the effects of other DA-releasing drugs on somatic DA concentration, we exposed L-DOPA-treated neurons to methamphetamine (METH), which disrupts the vesicular proton gradient and redistributes DA from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol (Sulzer et al., 2005Sulzer D. Sonders M.S. Poulsen N.W. Galli A. Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: a review.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 406-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In contrast to the increased cytosolic catecholamine levels observed in chromaffin cells acutely treated with METH (Mosharov et al., 2003Mosharov E.V. Gong L.W. Khanna B. Sulzer D. Lindau M. Intracellular patch electrochemistry: regulation of cytosolic catecholamines in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5835-5845PubMed Google Scholar), neurons exposed to 50 μM METH showed decreased DAcyt (Figure 3E); 5 μM METH produced the same decrease of DAcyt (38% of untreated cells; p < 0.005 by t test). METH-mediated reduction of DAcyt was blocked by the DA uptake transporter (DAT) inhibitor cocaine, suggesting that the effect was due to reverse transport through DAT (Sulzer et al., 2005Sulzer D. Sonders M.S. Poulsen N.W. Galli A. Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: a review.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 406-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). METH-mediated decrease of DAcyt and its blockade by cocaine were also observed in L-DOPA-treated cells in the presence of pargyline (data not shown). Note that DAcyt in L-DOPA-treated neurons was unaffected by DAT inhibitors cocaine (Figure 3E) or nomifensine (5 μM; data not shown), supporting the idea that reverse transport is not induced by the elevated DAcyt alone, but requires additional METH-mediated effects on DAT (Kahlig et al., 2005Kahlig K.M. Binda F. Khoshbouei H. Blakely R.D. McMahon D.G. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Amphetamine induces dopamine efflux through a dopamine transporter channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consistent with the IPE results, METH protected neuronal cell bodies from L-DOPA toxicity (Figure 3F), despite the considerable neurite loss that occurs in METH-treated cultured DA neurons (Cubells et al., 1994Cubells J.F. Rayport S. Rajendran G. Sulzer D. Methamphetamine neurotoxicity involves vacuolation of endocytic organelles and dopamine-dependent intracellular oxidative stress.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Larsen et al., 2002Larsen K.E. Fon E.A. Hastings T.G. Edwards R.H. Sulzer D. Methamphetamine-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons involves autophagy and upregulation of dopamine synthesis.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8951-8960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When applied for 4 days without L-DOPA, neither METH or cocaine nor the combination of the two drugs had a significant effect on the number of surviving neurons (data not shown). We previously developed a recombinant adenovirus that overexpresses VMAT2 (rVMAT2), resulting in reduced neuronal neuromelanin content and enhanced quantal size, and which increased the number of evoked quantal neurotransmitter release events from the terminals of cultured VM dopaminergic neurons (Pothos et al., 2000Pothos E.N. Larsen K.E. Krantz D.E. Liu Y. Haycock J.W. Setlik W. Gershon M.D. Edwards R.H. Sulzer D. Synaptic vesicle transporter expression regulates vesicle phenotype and quantal size.J.

Neurosci. 2000; 11: 159-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To investigate whether enhanced vesicular uptake may decrease DAcyt and rescue neurons from L-DOPA-induced toxicity, we employed an adenoviral construct that resulted in overexpression of the recombinant VMAT2 in 80%–90% of both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic cells (Figure S2). VMAT2 overexpression significantly decreased DAcyt in L-DOPA-treated GFP+ VM neurons (from 17.4 ± 1.7 μM, n = 74 neurons to 3.1 ± 0.8 μM, n = 28; Figure 4A), but had no effects on GFP− neurons from the same culture (2.4 ± 0.8 μM, n = 33 versus 2.3 ± 1.9 μM, n = 7). GFP+ neurons in cultures treated with a virus that did not contain rVMAT2 displayed the same DAcyt levels after L-DOPA treatment as control cells (data not shown). Consistent with the kinetics of L-DOPA metabolic consumption (Figure 1), rVMAT2 lowered DAcyt to the same extent in cells treated with 100 and 500 μM L-DOPA (Figure 4A). Moreover, infection with rVMAT2 effectively protected TH+ neurons from the L-DOPA-mediated neurotoxicity (Figure 4B). It should be noted, however, that these data also suggest that somatic vesicles or other organelles that do not normally sequester substantial levels of DA can do so after transporter overexpression, as has been demonstrated for noncatecholaminergic AtT-20 cells (Pothos et al., 2000Pothos E.N. Larsen K.E. Krantz D.E. Liu Y. Haycock J.W. Setlik W. Gershon M.D. Edwards R.H. Sulzer D. Synaptic vesicle transporter expression regulates vesicle phenotype and quantal size.J.

(D) Comparison of DAcyt levels in neurons from α-syn knockout, heterozygous, and wild-type mice treated with 100 μM L-DOPA for 1 hr (n = 20–49 cells). To investigate the role of α-syn in mediating DAcyt neurotoxicity, we generated α-syn-deficient mice that express eGFP in dopaminergic neurons (see Experimental Procedures). Whereas VM neurons from α-syn−/− and α-syn+/− mice were more resistant to L-DOPA-induced stress than neurons from their wild-type littermates (Figure 4C), IPE measurements indicated no difference in the DAcyt concentration between the three groups (Figure 4D). These data suggest that the pathogenic effect of α-syn is downstream of DA synthesis (see Discussion), and that the presence of both elevated DAcyt and α-syn is required for L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. To address the question of differential susceptibility of neurons from different brain regions, we prepared cultures that were enriched with cells from either SN or VTA, as previously published (Burke et al., 1998Burke R.E.

In mice, the germ cell fate is induced in pluripotent epiblast cells by signaling molecules, yet the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that germ cell fate in the epiblast is a direct consequence of Bmp4 signaling from the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), which is antagonized by the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). Strikingly, Bmp8b from the ExE restricts AVE development, thereby contributing to Bmp4 signaling. Furthermore, Wnt3 in the epiblast ensures its responsiveness to Bmp4. Serum-free, defined cultures revealed that, in response to Bmp4, competent epiblast cells uniformly expressed key transcriptional regulators Blimp1 and Prdm14 and acquired germ-cell properties, including genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming, in an orderly fashion. Notably, the induced cells contributed to both spermatogenesis and fertility of offspring.

By identifying a signaling principle in germ cell specification, our study establishes a robust strategy for reconstituting the mammalian germ cell lineage in vitro. The germ cell lineage is the source of totipotency, ensuring the creation of new organisms in most multicellular species. In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are the origin of both oocytes and spermatozoa, emerge from the proximal epiblast cells and arise as a cluster of approximately 40 alkaline-phosphatase (AP)-positive cells in the extraembryonic mesoderm at around embryonic day (E) 7.25 (Ginsburg et al., 1990Ginsburg M. Snow M.H. McLaren A. Primordial germ cells in the mouse embryo during gastrulation.Development. 1990; 110: 521-528PubMed Google Scholar, Lawson and Hage, 1994Lawson K.A. Hage W.J. Clonal analysis of the origin of primordial germ cells in the mouse.Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 182: 68-84PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, they initiate migration, passing through a developing hindgut and colonizing the embryonic gonads, where they initiate differentiation into either oocytes or spermatozoa. Gene-knockout studies have demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signals play essential roles in the generation of AP-positive PGCs from the epiblast (see review, (Saitou, 2009Saitou M. Specification of the germ cell lineage in mice.Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1068-1087Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar)): Bmp4 and Bmp8b emitted from the ExE, as well as the signal transducers known as Smads (Smad1, 4, and 5), are critical for the generation of PGCs. In addition, Bmp2 arisen from the VE seems to augment the role of Bmp4 to ensure the generation of sufficient numbers of PGCs. A Bmp ligand initiates signaling by binding to and bringing together type I (activin receptor-like kinase (Alk) 3/BmprIA, Alk6/BmprIB, and Alk2) and type II (Bmp type II receptor (BmprII) and activin type II receptors (ActrIIA and ActrIIB)) receptor serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface. This allows receptor II to phosphorylate the receptor I kinase domain, which then propagates the signal through phosphorylation of the conserved C-terminal residues of the Smad1, 5, or 8 proteins, which, by forming heterodimers with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus and function as transcriptional regulators (Shi and Massague, 2003Shi Y. Massague J. Mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling from cell membrane to the nucleus.Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4505) Google Scholar). At present, however, the mechanism through which the Bmp signals generate the germ cell lineage (i.e., direct target cells, receptor complexes, and target genes employed by Bmps, etc.) and why only a subset of epiblast cells is specifically induced into germ cell fate remain largely unclear. Indeed, there exists a formal possibility that some unidentified secondary factor specifies the germ cell fate in the Bmp-sensitized epiblast cells (Lawson et al., 1999Lawson K.A. Dunn N.R. Roelen B.A. Zeinstra L.M. Davis A.M. Wright C.V. Korving J.P. Hogan B.L. Bmp4 is required for the generation of primordial germ cells in the mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other signaling pathways that play key roles during gastrulation, such as Wnt and Nodal signaling (Brennan et al., 2001Brennan J. Lu C.C. Norris D.P. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Nodal signalling in the epiblast patterns the early mouse embryo.Nature. 2001; 411: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 1999Liu P. Wakamiya M. Shea M.J.

Recent studies have identified B-lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1, also known as Prdm1) and Prdm14, two of the PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ) domain-containing transcriptional regulators, as key factors for the specification of germ cell fate (Ohinata et al., 2005Ohinata Y.

Genet. 2008; 112: 11306-11311Google Scholar). The expression of Blimp1 and Prdm14 starts independently in a few cells of the proximal posterior epiblast at around the pre/no to early-streak (P/0S-ES) stage (∼E6.25-E6.5, see (Downs and Davies, 1993Downs K.M. Davies T. Staging of gastrulating mouse embryos by morphological landmarks in the dissecting microscope.Development. 1993; 118: 1255-1266PubMed Google Scholar) for embryonic staging), and these cells increase in number and go on to form PGCs with AP activity and stella/Pgc7 expression (Saitou et al., 2002Saitou M.

Blimp1-, Prdm14-, and stella-positive PGCs integrate three key events, the repression of a somatic mesodermal program (Saitou et al., 2002Saitou M. Barton S.C.

Blimp1 is essential for all three events (Kurimoto et al., 2008Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Ohinata Y. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Saitou M. Complex genome-wide transcription dynamics orchestrated by Blimp1 for the specification of the germ cell lineage in mice.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1617-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas Prdm14 ensures the latter two (Yamaji et al., 2008Yamaji M.

Genet. 2008; 112: 11306-11311Google Scholar). These advances in our understanding of the molecular properties of the emerging germ cell lineage have now made it possible to tackle some of the most important, yet unresolved questions: How do the signaling molecules in gastrulation endow a restricted population of the epiblast cells with the germ cell fate, and how would it be possible to induce the epiblast cells selectively toward the germ cell fate? In this study, through extensive in vivo genetic analyses as well as in vitro serum-free cultures, we have identified a paradigm of signaling activity for the specification of germ cell fate, highlighting the feasibility of generating the germ cell lineage in mammalian species in vitro. In contrast to the expression of Blimp1 and Prdm14, which is restricted to the most proximal posterior epiblast cells at the P/0S-ES stage (Figures 1A and 1B, and Figure S1 available with this article online) (Ohinata et al., 2005Ohinata Y.

To explore this possibility, we examined the expression of the Blimp1 reporter, Blimp1-mVenus (BV) (Ohinata et al., 2008Ohinata Y. Sano M. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Saitou M.

In all three homozygous−/− mutants, BV in the epiblasts was absent or severely impaired (Figures 1E–1H and S2), indicating that germ cell specification is blocked at its earliest stage in these mutants. All three −/− embryos failed to express Prdm14, as visualized by the Prdm14-mVenus (P14V) reporter (Figures 1I and S3; Yamaji et al., 2008Yamaji M. Seki Y. Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Yuasa M. Shigeta M.

In both the Bmp4−/− and Bmp8b−/− mutants, epiblast cells lost the signal for the C-terminally phosphorylated, active form of Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8), which presented strongly both in the BV-positive cells and embryonic mesoderm in wild-type embryos (Figure 1E). In contrast, Smad1−/− epiblast cells showed some levels of the pSmad1/5/8 (Figure 1E), which would reflect the phosphorylated Smad5 (Arnold et al., 2006Arnold S.J. Maretto S. Islam A. Bikoff E.K.

These findings indicate that ExE-derived Bmp signals, through the phosphorylation of Smad proteins, directly or indirectly activate Blimp1 and Prdm14 in the most proximal epiblast cells. We next analyzed Blimp1 expression in the mutants for Smad2 and FoxH1 (Brennan et al., 2001Brennan J. Lu C.C. Norris D.P. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J.

Smad2 and FoxH1 mediate Nodal signaling, especially in the VE, and are required to form AVE, which emits inhibitory signals [e.g., Cer1 against Bmp and Nodal, Lefty1 against Nodal, Dkk1 against Wnt, etc.] ((Lewis et al., 2008Lewis S.L.

Consequently, in Smad2−/− embryos, the entire epiblast adopts a posterior mesodermal fate and, similarly, a substantial proportion of FoxH1−/− mutants failed to specify anterior structures. In both mutants, ExE seems relatively unaffected. Remarkably, in Smad2−/− embryos that lack Cer1-positive AVE (but bear the BV-positive VE itself) (Figures 1J, 1K, and S4; Brennan et al., 2001Brennan J. Lu C.C. Norris D.P. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Nodal signalling in the epiblast patterns the early mouse embryo.Nature. 2001; 411: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), all the epiblast cells contacting the ExE, as well as those locating more distally, showed strong BV (Figures 1K and S4, second row). In severely affected Smad2−/− mutants, essentially all the epiblast-derived cells showed BV (Figures 1K and S5, third row). The numbers of BV-positive cells in the mutants were much larger than those in the wild-types (Figure 1L). Notably, thicker VE cells were observed at the distal part of some −/− mutants (Figure 1K, arrowhead): These would be aberrant distal VE (DVE)-like cells that failed to migrate anteriorly to become AVE. Similarly, in FoxH1−/− embryos, the BV-positive region expanded into a larger area of the epiblast (Figure 1K) and the numbers of BV-positive cells increased substantially (Figure 1M). We observed an increased number of BV-positive cells both in the Smad2 and FoxH1 heterozygous+/− mutants, especially at the early- to midstreak (E-MS, E6.5-E6.75) stages (t test, p < 0.05). In some FoxH1−/− mutants that developed relatively normally through gastrulation, we detected a much larger cluster of AP-positive cells (Figure S6) and of Blimp1- and stella-positive cells (Figure 1N) than those in wild-type embryos, suggesting that the excessive BV-positive mutant epiblast cells can differentiate into PGC-like cells. These findings indicate that the restricted expression of Blimp1 in the posterior region is due to an inhibition of its expression in the anterior region by the AVE, and in its absence, most, if not all, of the PS stage epiblast cells can adopt the germ cell fate if they receive Bmp signals. To precisely define the roles of signaling molecules and the pathways for germ cell induction, we established a system for the serum- and feeder-free in vitro culture of early embryos. When cultured in GMEM with 15% KSR (hereafter referred to as serum-free basal medium (SFM), see Experimental Procedures) for 36 hr in a floating condition, E6.0 whole embryos, which showed BV only in the VE, developed into E7.5 embryo-like structures bearing a cluster of BV- and AP-positive PGC-like cells (Figures 2A and S7), suggesting that this condition allows normal embryonic development and germ cell specification. Using this system, we examined the requirements of ExE and VE for Blimp1 induction in the epiblast. E6.0 embryonic fragments bearing ExE and epiblasts (ExE+Epi, VE removed) showed BV relatively uniformly in the epiblast after 36 hr culture in the SFM (Figure 2A). When cultured with LIF, the epiblast cells still exhibited BV (Figure 2A). Notably, when cultured with LIF and BMP4, nearly all the epiblast cells showed strong BV (Figure 2A). These findings indicate that ExE induces Blimp1 in the epiblast without VE and that exogenous BMP4 further potentiates Blimp1 induction. In contrast, E6.0 embryonic fragments bearing VE and Epi (ExE removed) did not exhibit BV in the epiblast under any of the three conditions (Figure 2A). This may be because ExE may secrete some factor(s) other than BMP4, which is (are) indispensable for Blimp1 expression in the epiblast, or VE, more specifically AVE, may function as an inhibitor of Blimp1 induction in this condition, as indicated by the genetic experiments. To distinguish between these possibilities, we cultured isolated epiblasts (Epi, VE and ExE removed). After 36 hr culture in the SFM, the epiblasts appeared to show good growth and, unexpectedly, some BV (Figure 2A). However, when cultured with LIF, they grew similarly but did not show BV (Figure 2A). We found that LIF has an activity to suppress the induction of Goosecoid (Gsc), a marker for the mesendoderm (see review, Tam and Loebel, 2007Tam P.P. Loebel D.A. Gene function in mouse embryogenesis: get set for gastrulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 368-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar; Figure S8), suggesting that Blimp1 expression in the SFM might reflect a differentiation of epiblast cells into a mesendodermal lineage. We then cultured the epiblasts (the entire epiblast, as well as the proximal and distal halves) with LIF and BMP4 and found that all these fragments exhibited intense BV (Figure 2A). These data indicate that essentially all the epiblast cells at E6.0, if separated from VE, a source for inhibitory signals, are able to express Blimp1 in response to BMP4 alone. By using Blimp1, Prdm14, and AP activity as markers for PGCs, we next explored the conditions for PGC specification. In addition to LIF and BMP4, we examined the effects of BMP8b, SCF, a potent survival factor of PGCs (Dolci et al., 1991Dolci S. Williams D.E. Ernst M.K. Resnick J.L. Brannan C.I. Lock L.F. Lyman S.D. Boswell H.S. Donovan P.J.

Effect of Steel factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor on murine primordial germ cells in culture.Nature. 1991; 353: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and other BMPs. Epiblasts cultured in the SFM for 36 hr showed BV, but they were negative for AP activity, and thus were not PGC-like cells (Figures 2B and 2C). No induction of BV- or AP-positive cells was observed in response to addition of SCF, BMP8b or both (Figures 2B and 2C). When LIF was added, BV was suppressed, but again, addition of SCF, BMP8b or both did not induce BV- and AP-positive cells (Figure 2B, C). In contrast, epiblasts cultured in the SFM with BMP4 exhibited BV and AP activity with high efficiency, regardless of the presence of LIF, SCF, or BMP8b (Figures 2B and 2C). These findings indicate that BMP4 alone can induce essentially all the E6.0 epiblast cells into Blimp1- and AP-positive PGC-like cells. Addition of LIF would theoretically be beneficial for PGC-like cell culture, since LIF promotes PGC growth (Dolci et al., 1991Dolci S. Williams D.E. Ernst M.K. Resnick J.L. Brannan C.I. Lock L.F.

Scaldaferri M.L. Iona S. La Sala G. De Felici M. Growth factors sustain primordial germ cell survival, proliferation and entering into meiosis in the absence of somatic cells.Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (see also above). It was essential to culture the epiblasts in a serum-free, floating condition to induce PGC-like cells, since addition of 5% FBS or adherent culture in a fibronectin-coated dish prevented BV induction (Figure S9). We next examined the dose-dependent effect of BMP4 by culturing E6.0 epiblast with varying concentrations of BMP4 and BMP8b: The efficiency of BV and AP activity induction was highly dependent on the dosage of BMP4, but not of BMP8b (Figures 2D and 2E). We evaluated the effects of a panel of BMPs and found that BMP4 and BMP2 were the most and second-most potent inducers, respectively, of the BV- and AP-positive PGC-like cells (Figure 2F). Importantly, we obtained identical results on the induction of Prdm14 in isolated epiblasts (Figures S10 and S11). Furthermore, consistent with the idea that AVE inhibits Blimp1 expression, exogenous Cer1, one of the inhibitory signals from the AVE, blocked BMP4-mediated BV induction from the epiblast (Figure 2G). These findings demonstrate that BMP4 but not BMP8b is sufficient to induce Blimp1-, Prdm14-, and AP-positive PGC-like cells from the epiblast dose-dependently in culture. We next analyzed a signaling pathway for Blimp1 and Prdm14 induction by Bmp4. We evaluated the effect of Alks-Fc fragments on BV and P14V induction by BMP4, revealing that the Alk3- and Alk6-Fc fragments are the most and second-most potent inhibitors, respectively (Figures 2H and S11). We tested whether the Bmp4−/− and Smad1−/− epiblasts can respond to BMP4. Remarkably, Bmp4−/− epiblasts exhibited BV and P14V in response to BMP4 (Figures 2I and S12), indicating that the lack of BV and P14V in the Bmp4−/− epiblasts is due solely to the loss of Bmp4 in the ExE. In contrast, Smad1−/− epiblasts were resistant to BMP4 for BV and P14V expression, although weak and sporadic inductions of these genes were detected, presumably due to the presence of Smad5 (Figures 2I and S12). A previous work has reported that Bmp4 signaling through Alk2 and Smad1 in the VE is an obligatory pathway for the generation of AP-positive PGCs (de Sousa Lopes et al., 2004de Sousa Lopes S.M. Roelen B.A. Monteiro R.M. Emmens R. Lin H.Y. Li E. Lawson K.A. Mummery C.L. BMP signaling mediated by ALK2 in the visceral endoderm is necessary for the generation of primordial germ cells in the mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1838-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, our evidence indicates that Bmp4 signaling through Alk3 (or Alk6) via Smad1 (and 5) in the epiblast is sufficient to induce Blimp1-, Prdm14-, and AP-positive PGC-like cells in vitro and that the (A)VE works, at least in part, as a source for inhibitory signal(s) against Bmp4 for Blimp1 induction. We therefore examined whether Bmp4 signaling through Smad1 in the VE is obligatory for Blimp1 expression in the epiblast by generating chimeras between blastocysts from Smad1+/− crosses and wild-type ES cells bearing the BV transgene: ES cells injected into blastocysts contribute only to the embryonic lineages (Nagy et al., 2003Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo.Third Edition edn. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2003Google Scholar), and thus if the host blastocyst is Smad1−/−, we can analyze whether Smad1 in the ExE and VE is obligatory for Blimp1 expression in the epiblast. All chimeras between wild-type (n = 5), Smad1+/− (n = 8), and Smad1−/− (n = 2) hosts and ES cells with BV exhibited specific BV expression in the presumptive PGC precursors, but not in the VE (Figure 2J), demonstrating that Smad1 in the VE is dispensable for Blimp1 expression in the epiblast. Thus, direct Bmp4 signaling in the epiblast through Alk3 (or Alk6) and one of the type II receptors complex via Smad1 and 5 is necessary and sufficient for PGC specification. We next analyzed the time window for adoption of the germ cell fate by epiblast cells. Epiblasts isolated as early as E5.5 exhibited robust BV and AP activity in response to BMP4, whereas those isolated 6 hr earlier (E5.25) did not (Figure 3A). Until about E6.25, isolated epiblasts showed BV and AP activity, but those isolated at E6.5 or later exhibited less intense BV and weak/faint AP activity (Figure 3A). Thus, the epiblasts acquire the ability to adopt a Blimp1- and AP-positive PGC-like state in response to BMP4 at around E5.5 and lose it after around E6.5. How long, then, is the period of time during which the Blimp1-positive cells are newly recruited from the epiblast for the germ cell fate in vivo? To address this question, we made use of a cell tracking method by a photo-convertible fluorescent reporter, KikGR (Tsutsui et al., 2005Tsutsui H. Karasawa S. Shimizu H. Nukina N. Miyawaki A. Semi-rational engineering of a coral fluorescent protein into an efficient highlighter.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). KikGR is fluorescent green after synthesis but, by blue-violet light, can be converted to red, which persists permanently, serving as a lineage tracer. We generated a transgenic strain expressing membrane-targeted KikGR (mKikGR) under the control of Blimp1 (BKik, Figure S13) and analyzed the recruitment of Blimp1-positive cells from the epiblast during critical periods for germ cell specification (Figures 3B and 3C). BKik embryos at the PS stage showed green fluorescence only in the VE, which was converted to red by violet light. The embryos were then cultured for 12 hr, reaching the 0S stage. As expected, the VE cells showed both green and red fluorescence, reflecting the newly synthesized and originally presented proteins, respectively (Figure 3C). Importantly, in the most proximal epiblasts, we observed a number of green-only cells, which represent newly recruited Blimp1-positive PGC precursors (Figure 3C). We performed the same experiment with the MS stage embryos, which, after culture, developed into EB stage embryos bearing cells with both green and red fluorescence (“labeled” cells at the MS stage) and with green-only fluorescence (newly recruited cells during the culture) (Figure 3C). We obtained a similar result with the LS stage embryos (Figure 3C). However, the EB stage embryos, which, after culture, developed into those of the late-head-fold (LHF) stage, bore cells only with both green and red fluorescence (Figure 3C). These findings show that the recruitment of the Blimp1-positive PGC precursors begins between the PS and 0S stages and continues at least until the LS stage, but after the EB stage, it apparently ceases and PGCs increase their numbers solely by cell division. What, then, would be the role of Bmp8b in PGC specification? We explored two possibilities—that Bmp8b is critical 1) for the proper expression of Bmp4 in the ExE, or 2) for conferring to the epiblasts an ability to respond to Bmp4. However, our experiments negated both these functions (Figures 4B, 4C, and S12). We therefore exami"

These studies establish the natural H2B ubiquitylation factors in human cells and also detail the mechanistic basis for H2B ubiquitylation and function during transcription. Chromosomal histones are subject to a variety of well-studied covalent modifications—including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation—that have been implicated in transcriptional regulation. H2B monoubiquitylation also has been implicated in transcription by recent genetic and cell-based assays, although the precise mechanisms involved in H2B ubiquitylation and the role(s) of ubiquitylated H2B are not fully understood (Weake and Workman, 2008Weake V.M. Workman J.L. Histone ubiquitination: triggering gene activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of the highly conserved RAD6 and BRE1 homologs have suggested that they may function universally as the relevant ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes, respectively. However, there are recent reports that UbcH6 serves as the E2 for H2B ubiquitylation in human cells (Zhu et al., 2005Zhu B. Zheng Y. Pham A.D. Mandal S.S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D.

In contrast to other histone modifications that are concentrated in the unstructured N-terminal tails, H2B ubiquitylation occurs at a residue (lysine 120) that is embedded within the C-terminal α helix. This may account for the generally low level of H2B ubiquitylation in cells and suggests an involvement of additional mechanisms for making the site accessible to H2B ubiquitylation factors and for target gene specificity. Indeed, early studies in yeast implicated several transcription factors in H2B ubiquitylation and indicated a tight linkage between H2B ubiquitylation and transcription. Thus, RAD6 was shown to be recruited to the promoter in an activator- and BRE1-dependent manner and to colocalize with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) dependent upon BRE1 and the PAF complex (Wood et al., 2003Wood A.

Importantly, requirements of the PAF complex and the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) serine 5 kinase Kin28 for H2B ubiquitylation have implicated H2B ubiquitylation in transcription elongation (Ng et al., 2003aNg H.H.

In further support of this view, defects in H2B ubiquitylation result in sensitivity to 6-azauridine (Xiao et al., 2005Xiao T. Kao C.F. Krogan N.J. Sun Z.W. Greenblatt J.F. Osley M.A. Strahl B.D.

From a mechanistic viewpoint, H2B ubiquitylation is essential for specific H3K4 and H3K79 methylation events by Set1 and Dot1, respectively (Dover et al., 2002Dover J. Schneider J.

In this regard, Pavri et al., 2006Pavri R. Zhu B. Li G. Trojer P. Mandal S. Shilatifard A. Reinberg D. Histone H2B monoubiquitination functions cooperatively with FACT to regulate elongation by RNA polymerase II.Cell. 2006; 125: 703-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar reported that H2B ubiquitylation directly facilitates FACT-dependent chromatin transcription in vitro.

These results leave open the interesting question of whether H2B ubiquitylation directly stimulates transcription or, conversely, whether transcription facilitates H2B ubiquitylation for subsequent functions. Here we have employed biochemically defined systems, along with RNAi analyses, to show that RAD6 is the cognate E2 of the BRE1 complex and solely responsible for H2B ubiquitylation at lysine 120 in human cells. We further show that ongoing PAF complex-dependent transcription is required for efficient H2B ubiquitylation and that H2B ubiquitylation per se has no discernable effect on the level of p300-, PAF complex- and SII-dependent chromatin transcription. Along with further demonstrations of specific intermolecular interactions between RAD6 and components of the BRE1 and PAF complexes, these findings establish the H2B ubiquitylation factors in human cells and provide a detailed biochemical description of the mechanism of H2B ubiquitylation and function during transcription. Human BRE1A/RNF20 was previously shown to serve as an E3 for H2B ubiquitylation (Kim et al., 2005Kim J. Hake S.B. Roeder R.G. The human homolog of yeast BRE1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator through direct activator interactions.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and to form a complex with the hBRE1B/RNF40 paralog (Zhu et al., 2005Zhu B. Zheng Y. Pham A.D. Mandal S.S.

In confirmation of an intracellular interaction, ectopically expressed HA-hBRE1B was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (M2 agarose) only in the presence of FLAG-hBRE1A (Figure 1A). For more systematic studies, the heteromeric hBRE1 complex was reconstituted in insect cells by baculovirus-mediated expression of hBRE1A and FLAG-hBRE1B. The purified complex contained two polypeptides (doublet of equal densities) that were individually recognized by anti-hBRE1A and anti-hBRE1B antibodies, thus implying stoichiometric hBRE1A and hBRE1B levels in the complex (Figure 1B). A further analysis revealed that the association of hBRE1A with hBRE1B is critically dependent upon an N-terminal hBRE1A domain (residues 1–381) and further stabilized by two central regions (residues 381–517 and 738–872) that alone show no interaction with hBRE1B (Figure 1C). Overall, these observations indicate that hBRE1A, through its N-terminal region, forms a stable stoichiometric complex with hBRE1B. Consistent with the phylogenetic sequence conservation and the ability of mouse RAD6A and RAD6B to complement yeast Rad6 (yRad6) mutants for H3K4 dimethylation (Sun and Allis, 2002Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Ubiquitination of histone H2B regulates H3 methylation and gene silencing in yeast.Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), we found that both human RAD6 E2s (hRAD6A and hRAD6B), but not the hUbcH6 E2, fully complement the function of yRad6 for H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4-H3K79 di- and trimethylation in yeast (Figure 2A). These results led us to propose a role for hRAD6, through an intrinsic E2 activity and in conjunction with hBRE1, in H2B ubiquitylation in human cells. In further functional analyses, an hBRE1A siRNA, but not a control siRNA, resulted in the loss of both hBRE1A (Figure 2B, first panel, lane 2) and hBRE1B (second panel, lane 2). In contrast, an hBRE1B siRNA resulted in a large reduction of hBRE1B (second panel, lane 3) with no effect on hBRE1A (first panel, lane 3). These data are consistent with the existence of an hBRE1A·hBRE1B complex (hBRE1 complex) and an associated stabilization of hBRE1B by hBRE1A. Similarly, hRAD6A and combined hRAD6A plus hRAD6B siRNAs decreased the level of hRAD6 (third panel, lanes 5 and 7), whereas an hRAD6B siRNA did not result in any obvious change in the overall level of hRAD6 (third panel, lane 6; note that the anti-hRAD6 antibody does not discriminate hRAD6A and hRAD6B due to their near-identical amino acid sequences). The latter result is not due to an inefficiency of hRAD6B siRNA since the hRAD6A and hRAD6B siRNAs decreased corresponding mRNA levels to nearly the same extent (Figure 2C). Therefore, consistent with a previous report (Koken et al., 1996Koken M.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Jasper-Dekker I. de Wit J. Willemsen R. Roest H.P. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating DNA repair enzymes HHR6A and B suggests a role in spermatogenesis and chromatin modification.Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we conclude that hRAD6A comprises the majority of the endogenous hRAD6 protein pool. Finally, an hUbcH6 siRNA effected an almost complete loss of hUbcH6 protein without causing any changes in the levels of the other proteins tested (Figure 2B, fourth panel, lane 8). Reductions of endogenous hBRE1A and hBRE1B, independently or together, also resulted in significant concomitant decreases of H2B ubiquitylation (probed both by an anti-H2B antibody and by an anti-ubH2B antibody that specifically recognizes ubiquitylated H2B at lysine 120 [Minsky et al., 2008Minsky N. Shema E. Field Y. Schuster M. Segal E. Oren M. Monoubiquitinated H2B is associated with the transcribed region of highly expressed genes in human cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar]), H3K4 di- and trimethylation, and H3K79 dimethylation but little or no changes in H3K4 and H3K79 monomethylation (Figure 2B, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). Most importantly, hRAD6A siRNA or combined hRAD6A plus hRAD6B siRNAs resulted in significant decreases in H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 trimethylation and a moderate decrease in H3K79 dimethylation (lanes 5 and 7 versus lane 1). In contrast, but consistent with its negligible effect on the total hRAD6 level, an hRAD6B siRNA caused no significant changes in any of these histone modifications (lane 6 versus lane 1). Notably, an almost complete reduction of endogenous hUbcH6 by an hUbcH6 siRNA failed to effect any detectable changes in these histone modifications (lane 8). Beyond global histone modifications, we also observed a clear correlation between hRAD6 and H2B ubiquitylation levels, as well as H3K4 methylation levels, on the p21 gene (Figure S1 available online). Taken together, these observations show strong correlations between the level of hRAD6, but not hUbcH6, and the levels of H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 and H3K79 methylation. Each E3 specifically and directly binds to its cognate E2 (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). To identify an E2 that directly binds to the hBRE1 complex, we examined interactions of the purified hBRE1 complex with several human E2s (Figures 3A and S2A). Among the nine tested E2s, including hUbcH6, only hRAD6A and hRAD6B directly bound to the hBRE1 complex (Figures 3B and S2B). These data contrast with those of an earlier report that hUbcH6 specifically interacts with the hBRE1 complex (Zhu et al., 2005Zhu B. Zheng Y. Pham A.D. Mandal S.S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Monoubiquitination of human histone H2B: the factors involved and their roles in HOX gene regulation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the specific physical interaction described here was also confirmed by other approaches (Figures S3 and S4). In addition, and importantly, hRAD6 was found to interact with the hBRE1 complex but not with individual hBRE1A or hBRE1B polypeptides (Figures 3B and S3B; Kim et al., 2005Kim J. Hake S.B. Roeder R.G. The human homolog of yeast BRE1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator through direct activator interactions.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that formation of the heteromeric hBRE1 complex is critical for direct interaction with hRAD6. In a further demonstration of intracellular interactions (Figure 3C), endogenous hRAD6 protein, but not hUbcH6, was coimmunoprecipitated (by anti-FLAG antibody) with hBRE1A and hBRE1B from extracts derived from human cells that express FLAG-hBRE1A/RNF20. Similar interactions were observed following baculovirus-mediated expression of hBRE1, hRAD6, and hUbcH6 proteins in insect cells (Figure S4). Direct interactions between RING finger-containing E3 and cognate E2 proteins result in both substrate and E3 ubiquitylation (Lorick et al., 1999Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In this regard, and further confirming the functional relevance of the physical interaction between hRAD6 and the hBRE1 complex, incubation of the hBRE1 complex with purified ubiquitin, E1 and E2 proteins (Figure 3D) revealed a hRAD6-dependent polyubiquitylation of the hBRE1 complex that was visualized by autoradiography (Figure 3E, lanes 2 and 3) and immunoblot (Figure 3F, lanes 2 and 5) and shown to be dependent upon the catalytic activity of hRAD6 (Figure S5). Although purified hUbcH6 exhibited a strong ubiquitin-conjugating activity, it failed to mediate any detectable polyubiquitylation of the hBRE1 complex (Figure 3E, lane 4; Figure 3F, lanes 3 and 6; Figure S5B). Several reports showed that the signature RING finger domains of E3s serve as platforms for the E2 binding that is essential for protein ubiquitylation (Lorick et al., 1999Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal RING fingers in hBRE1A and hBRE1B are both dispensable for ubiquitylation of the hBRE1 complex (Figure S6), suggesting that hRAD6 interacts with the hBRE1 complex through a region(s) other than the RING finger domain. As expected from the results of Figure 3B, an hBRE1 complex containing intact hBRE1B and the minimal hBRE1A fragment (N381) capable of complex formation with hBRE1B (Figure 1C) was shown to interact with hRAD6 whereas hBRE1B and an hBRE1A fragment (N230) that is unable to form a complex with hBRE1B could not (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate unequivocally that hRAD6, but not hUbcH6, interacts specifically and functionally with the hBRE1 complex, both in vitro and in vivo, through a region other than the RING finger domain in the hBRE1 complex (Figure 3H; see Discussion). To clearly demonstrate a direct hRAD6 E2 function in H2B ubiquitylation, we employed an in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay. Complete reactions containing purified E1, hRAD6A, the hBRE1 complex, ubiquitin (His- and HA-tagged), and oligonucleosomes derived from HeLa cells generated a lysine 120-ubiquitylated H2B (ubH2B) (Figure 4A, top panel, lanes 2 and 8), whereas reactions with omission of any of these components did not (top panel, lanes 3–7). Although a significant level of H2B ubiquitylation was detected in the absence of the hBRE1 complex, this clearly represents H2B ubiquitylation at a site(s) other than lysine 120 (compare top panel, lane 5 versus middle panel, lane 5). This is consistent with the ability of RAD6 to ubiquitylate free core histones (Jentsch et al., 1987Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. The yeast DNA repair gene RAD6 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.Science. 1987; 329: 131-135Google Scholar; Figure S7), as well as both histone octamer and nucleosomal substrates (Figure S7), in the absence of an E3. This appears to reflect a nonspecific RAD6 ubiquitin-conjugating activity that is manifested in a purified assay system lacking constraints that normally control accessibility of RAD6 to histones. These results also strengthen the validity of the anti-ubH2B antibody for monitoring precise in vitro H2B ubiquitylation events. In relation to specificity and possible redundancy of the ubiquitylation enzymes, hRAD6A (more efficiently) and hRAD6B (less efficiently) were both found to ubiquitylate H2B at lysine 120 in a catalytic activity-dependent manner (Figure 4B, lanes 1–5). Notably, hUbcH6 failed to generate any detectable ubH2B (lanes 6–8), even at a 3-fold higher dose than hRAD6 (lane 8). Unlike individual RAD6 proteins, individual hBRE1A and hBRE1B polypeptides failed to mediate ubiquitylation of H2B (Figure 4C, lanes 1–4), thus demonstrating that formation of the heteromeric BRE1 complex and the resulting interaction with RAD6 are critical for the E3 function of the hBRE1s. In a further analysis of purified hBRE1 complexes with combinations of RING finger deletions (Figure S6), H2B ubiquitylation was abrogated by deletion either of both RING fingers (Figure 4C, lane 7 versus lane 4) or of the hBRE1A RING finger (lane 5 versus lane 4) but was relatively unaffected by deletion of the hBRE1B RING finger (lane 6 versus lane 4). Overall these results indicate redundant functions for RAD6A and RAD6B, but distinct functions for the essential hBRE1A and hBRE1B proteins (and their individual RING fingers), in H2B ubiquitylation (see Discussion). In a further analysis of the efficiency of the in vitro H2B ubiquitylation reactions, we observed a dose-dependent increase in H2B ubiquitylation in response to varying amounts of the hBRE1 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 2–4), but not of hRAD6A (lanes 5–7). These data suggest that the hBRE1 complex is more limiting for H2B ubiquitylation, at least in vitro, and may explain enhanced H2B ubiquitylation by ectopic hBRE1A, but not by ectopic hRAD6, in a cell-based assay (Kim et al., 2005Kim J. Hake S.B. Roeder R.G. The human homolog of yeast BRE1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator through direct activator interactions.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The PAF elongation factor complex is required for both H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4-K79 methylation in yeast (Krogan et al., 2003Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K.

Histone H2B ubiquitylation is associated with elongating RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To test how the human PAF (hPAF) complex links H2B ubiquitylation and transcription processes, we first examined the interaction between highly purified E2 proteins (Figure 3A) and hBRE1 and hPAF complexes (Figure 5A). Interestingly, hRAD6A and hRAD6B were shown to associate with the purified hPAF complex in the presence, but not in the absence, of the hBRE1 complex (Figure 5B, lanes 7 and 8 versus lanes 3 and 4). Given the earlier demonstration of direct hRAD6-hBRE1 complex interactions (above), these results suggest that the hBRE1 complex mediates the association of hRAD6 with the hPAF complex. In confirmation, the purified hBRE1 complex was found to bind directly to the purified hPAF complex (Figure 5C). A further analysis with individual subunits of the hPAF complex (Figure 5D) showed a strong selective binding of the purified hBRE1 complex to the hPAF1 subunit (Figure 5E), thus implicating hPAF1 as the major subunit responsible for interaction of the hPAF complex with the hBRE1 complex. Although hUbcH6 was shown to interact weakly (potentially nonspecifically; below), with the hPAF complex, inclusion of the hBRE1 complex in the reaction did not alter binding efficiency (Figure 5B, lane 5 versus lane 9). In view of the direct association of the hRAD6-hBRE1 complex with the hPAF complex, we tested whether the hPAF complex directly stimulates H2B ubiquitylation. Somewhat surprisingly, the hPAF complex was found to decrease hRAD6-hBRE1 complex-mediated H2B ubiquitylation within an oligonucleosome substrate (Figure 5F, lanes 3–5 versus lane 2), presumably because a strong competitive binding of the hPAF complex in this context prevents the hBRE1 complex from binding effectively to histones. This suggests that the PAF complex plays a role in H2B ubiquitylation other than stimulating catalysis by RAD6-BRE1. Consistent with our inability to see any role for hUbcH6 in H2B ubiquitylation, hUbcH6 still did not effect any detectable H2B ubiquitylation in our assays even in the presence of the hPAF complex (Figure 5F, lanes 6–9). In order to test the role of the PAF complex in H2B ubiquitylation during transcription, we employed an in vitro assay (schematized in Figure 6A) containing purified factors and a chromatinized pML array template that contains p53-binding sites (Figure S8). An assay under transcription conditions with all components present generated a very significant level of H2B ubiquitylation at lysine 120 (Figure 6B, compare lanes 3 and 9). This corresponds to ubiquitylation of about 15% of the total H2B used for transcription, as judged by comparison with histone octamer standards (compare lane 3 versus lanes 10–14) containing fully ubiquitylated H2B (McGinty et al., 2008McGinty R.K. Kim J. Chatterjee C. Roeder R.G. Muir T.W. Chemically ubiquitylated histone H2B stimulates hDOT1L-mediated intranucleosomal methylation.Nature. 2008; 453: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We also confirmed a requirement for the hBRE1 complex (Figure 6B, lane 4) and an inability of hUbcH6 to substitute for the E2 function of hRAD6 (lane 8). Importantly, this efficient H2B ubiquitylation is coupled to activator-dependent transcription because omission of either p53 or nucleoside triphosphates (but with ATP present) reduced ubH2B to an undetectable level (lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, omission of the hPAF complex resulted in an undetectable level of ubH2B (lanes 5 and 7) whereas SII omission significantly decreased the efficiency of H2B ubiquitylation (lane 6). As shown in Figure 6D, and as will be detailed elsewhere (J.K., M.G., and R.G.R., unpublished data), SII and the hPAF complex act independently to effect equivalent low levels of transcription, and synergistically to effect high levels of transcription, in this assay (lanes 1–4). Hence, the efficiency of H2B ubiquitylation generally correlates with the transcription level. These results thus suggest that the PAF complex facilitates H2B ubiquitylation through an effect on transcription and thereby directly links transcription to H2B ubiquitylation factors (Figure 6C). However, the fact that omission of the hPAF complex completely eliminates H2B ubiquitylation, while omission of SII does not, indicates that H2B ubiquitylation is also dependent upon hPAF complex functions other than those directly connected to transcription. We next tested the effect of H2B ubiquitylation on hPAF- and SII-dependent transcription of chromatin by p53. Surprisingly, we found that addition of ubiquitylation factors (ubiquitin, E1, hRAD6A, and the hBRE1 complex) actually effected a moderate decrease in transcription (Figure 6D, lanes 2, 3, and 4 versus lanes 6, 7, and 8). However, this inhibition is not due to H2B ubiquitylation at lysine 120 since these inhibitory effects were also observed in transcription of chromatin reconstituted with the H2B K120R mutant (lanes 10, 11, and 12 versus lanes 14, 15, and 16). In a test for contributions of individual factors to the inhibitory effect (Figure 6E), we found transcription inhibition mainly in reactions containing hRAD6A (lanes 2 and 13 versus lanes 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12). We suspect that this modest nonspecific hRAD6-dependent transcription inhibition is due both to a lack of normal constraints to interfering interactions (such as nonspecific binding of hRAD6 to histones; Figure S7) and to a lack of positively acting effectors that recognize ubH2B in the purified assay system. In addition, hUbcH6 alone (lane 15) or with other ubiquitylation factors (lane 16) did not increase, but instead slightly decreased, transcription. To test more directly for an effect of H2B ubiquitylation on chromatin transcription in the absence of the chromatin ubiquitylation machinery, we assembled chromatin with histone octamers containing a semisynthetic H2B fully ubiquitylated at lysine 120 (McGinty et al., 2008McGinty R.K.

This is the first documented involvement of the TCR locus in human disease and will shed light on how HLA-TCR interactions contribute to organ-specific autoimmune targeting. Narcolepsy with cataplexy, characterized by sleepiness and rapid onset into REM sleep, affects 1 in 2,000 individuals1,2. Narcolepsy was first shown to be tightly associated with HLA-DR2 (ref. 3) and later sublocalized to DQB1*0602 (ref. 4). Following studies in dogs5 and mice6, a 95% loss of hypocretin-producing cells in postmortem hypothalami from narcoleptic individuals was reported7,8. Using genome-wide association (GWA) in Caucasians with replication in three ethnic groups, we found association between narcolepsy and polymorphisms in the TRA@ (T-cell receptor alpha) locus, with highest significance at rs1154155 (average allelic odds ratio 1.69, genotypic odds ratios 1.94 and 2.55, P < 10−21, 1,830 cases, 2,164 controls). This is the first documented genetic involvement of the TRA@ locus, encoding the major receptor for HLA-peptide presentation, in any disease. It is still unclear how specific HLA alleles confer susceptibility to over 100 HLA-associated disorders9; thus, narcolepsy will provide new insights on how HLA–TCR interactions contribute to organ-specific autoimmune targeting and may serve as a model for over 100 other HLA-associated disorders9."
https://openalex.org/W2017550851,"The chromatin architecture of eukaryotic gene promoters is generally characterized by a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by at least one H2A.Z variant nucleosome. Computational predictions of nucleosome positions based on thermodynamic properties of DNA-histone interactions have met with limited success. Here we show that the action of the essential RSC remodeling complex in S. cerevisiae helps explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment. In RSC-depleted cells, NFRs shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. Nucleosome positioning at distinct subsets of promoters additionally requires the essential Myb family proteins Abf1 and Reb1, whose binding sites are enriched in NFRs. In contrast, H2A.Z deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning. By regulating H2A.Z deposition using a steroid-inducible protein splicing strategy, we show that NFR establishment is necessary for H2A.Z deposition. These studies suggest an ordered pathway for the assembly of promoter chromatin architecture."

Theories of visual recognition can be largely divided into two main groups: (1) theories advocating top-down influences and long recurrent feedback connections (e.g., Bullier, 2001Bullier J.

Cybern. 1980; 36: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar, Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Hierarchical models of object recognition in cortex.Nat.

Surfing a spike wave down the ventral stream.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 2593-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although ultimately both bottom-up and top-down influences are likely to play significant roles in visual object recognition, the relative contribution of bottom-up versus top-down processes in different aspects of visual object recognition remains unclear. The location and timing of responses elicited in visual cortex constitute important constraints to quantify the role of feedforward and feedback signals. In macaque monkeys, selective responses can be elicited in inferior temporal cortex ∼100 ms after stimulus onset (e.g., Hung et al., 2005Hung C.P. Kreiman G. Poggio T. DiCarlo J.J. Fast read-out of object identity from macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, Keysers et al., 2001Keysers C. Xiao D.K. Foldiak P.

Neurophysiol. 1983; 50: 1415-1432PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known about the latency and location of responses in human visual cortex. Scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings suggest that complex visual categorization tasks (distinguishing the presence of an animal in a natural scene) can trigger differential signals ∼150 ms after stimulus onset (Thorpe et al., 1996Thorpe S. Fize D. Marlot C. Speed of processing in the human visual system.Nature. 1996; 381: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), but the localization of these signals in the brain is not clear (see also Johnson and Olshausen, 2005Johnson J.S. Olshausen B.A. The earliest EEG signatures of object recognition in a cued-target task are postsensory.J. Vis. 2005; 5: 299-312PubMed Google Scholar). Face-selective responses at ∼200 ms after stimulus onset have been reported in field potentials recorded from the human temporal lobe averaged over tens to hundreds of trials (McCarthy et al., 1999McCarthy G. Puce A. Belger A. Allison T. Electrophysiological studies of human face perception. II: Response properties of face-specific potentials generated in occipitotemporal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Single-neuron recordings in the human medial temporal lobe (areas that are not exclusively visual including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus) yield latencies ranging from 200 to 500 ms (Kreiman et al., 2000Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Category-specific visual responses of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, Mormann et al., 2008Mormann F. Kornblith S. Quiroga R.Q. Kraskov A. Cerf M. Fried I. Koch C. Latency and selectivity of single neurons indicate hierarchical processing in the human medial temporal lobe.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8865-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although there is no hard threshold to separate bottom-up from top-down signals, several pieces of evidence suggest that after ∼200 ms there is likely to be prominent impact from backprojections (Garrido et al., 2007Garrido M.I. Kilner J.M. Kiebel S.J. Friston K.J. Evoked brain responses are generated by feedback loops.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Top-down signal from prefrontal cortex in executive control of memory retrieval.Nature. 1999; 401: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In order to unravel the neuronal circuits and mechanisms that give rise to selective, robust, and fast visual pattern recognition, it is important to combine location information with a characterization of the dynamics of the physiological events involved in object processing in single trials. In this study, we used neurophysiological recordings to directly quantify the degree of selectivity, invariance, and speed of visual processing in the human visual cortex. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 912 subdural electrodes implanted in 11 subjects for evaluation of surgical approaches to alleviate resilient forms of epilepsy (Engel et al., 2005Engel A.K.

Neurosci. 2005; 6: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Kreiman, 2007Kreiman G. Single unit approaches to human vision and memory.Curr. Opin.

Med. 1997; 48: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We observed that physiological responses in the occipital and temporal lobes, most prominently in the inferior occipital gyrus, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, showed strong selectivity to complex objects while maintaining robustness to object transformations. The robust and selective responses were clear even in single trials and within ∼100 ms after stimulus onset. Eleven subjects (6 male, 9 right-handed, 12–34 years old) were presented with digital photographs of objects belonging to five categories (“animals,” “chairs,” “human faces,” “fruits,” and “vehicles”) while recording electrophysiological activity from 48 to 126 intracranial electrodes implanted to localize epileptic seizure foci (Experimental Procedures). There were five different exemplars per category (see Figure S1B available online). Images were grayscale and contrast normalized, and were presented for 200 ms in pseudorandom order, with an interval between images of 600 ms (Figure S1A), while subjects performed a one-back task. The physiological responses from two example recording sites are shown in Figure 1. An electrode located in the left temporal pole (Talairach coordinates: −27.0, −11.8, −35.3; area number 43 in Table S2) showed differential activity across object categories, with an enhanced response to images from the fruits category (Figure 1A, black trace). To quantify the degree of selectivity, we defined the intracranial field potential (IFP) response as the range of the IFP signal, that is, max(IFP) – min(IFP), in a time window from 50 to 300 ms after stimulus onset. The time window from 50 to 300 ms was chosen so as to account for the approximate latency of the neural response (Richmond et al., 1983Richmond B.J. Wurtz R.H. Sato T. Visual responses in inferior temporal neurons in awake rhesus monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 50: 1415-1432PubMed Google Scholar, Schmolesky et al., 1998Schmolesky M.T. Wang Y. Hanes D.P. Thompson K.G. Leutgeb S. Schall J.D. Leventhal A.G. Signal timing across the macaque visual system.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 3272-3278PubMed Google Scholar) while remaining within the average saccade time (Rayner, 1998Rayner K. Eye movements in reading and information processing: 20 years of research.Psychol. Bull. 1998; 124: 372-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar). We note that in many cases the selectivity extended well past the 300 ms boundary (e.g., see Figures S1E and S1F for two particularly clear examples). Throughout the manuscript, we focus on the early part of the physiological responses (see Discussion). We also quantitatively compared different time windows and other possible definitions of the IFP response (Figure S3; Supplemental Data). In the example in Figure 1A, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) across categories on the IFP responses yielded p < 10−6 (Experimental Procedures). The selective response was consistent across repetitions (z score = 3.2; Supplemental Data) and also across the different exemplars for each category (Figure 1B). When we ranked the objects according to the IFP response, the five best objects were the five exemplars from the fruits category (Figure 1C; bootstrap p < 10−5; Experimental Procedures). Therefore, the category selectivity in this electrode cannot be ascribed to responses to only one or a few particular exemplar objects. Another example electrode is shown in Figures 1F–1J. This electrode, located in the left inferior occipital gyrus (Talairach coordinates: −48.8, −69.1, −11.8; area number 14 in Table S2) in a different subject, showed stronger responses to images from the human faces category (Figure 1F, blue trace). More examples are shown in Figures S1D–S1G. Although many studies have focused on analyzing the average responses across multiple repetitions, the brain needs to discriminate object information in real time. This imposes a strict criterion for selectivity. We used a statistical learning approach (Bishop, 1995Bishop C.M. Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition. Clarendon Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar, Hung et al., 2005Hung C.P. Kreiman G. Poggio T. DiCarlo J.J. Fast read-out of object identity from macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to quantify whether the information from IFPs available in single trials was sufficient to distinguish one category from the other categories (Experimental Procedures). Figure 1D shows the distribution of the IFP responses for the trials where a fruit was presented (black trace) versus all the other trials (gray trace), and Figure 1E shows the corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Green and Swets, 1966Green D. Swets J. Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics. Wiley, New York1966Google Scholar, Kreiman et al., 2000Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Category-specific visual responses of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to compute the proportion of single trials in which we could detect the preferred category (in this example, fruits). Other ways of defining selectivity, including a one-way ANOVA on the IFP responses (Kreiman et al., 2000Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Category-specific visual responses of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), a point-by-point ANOVA (Thorpe et al., 1996Thorpe S. Fize D. Marlot C. Speed of processing in the human visual system.Nature. 1996; 381: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), and the use of other statistical classifiers (Bishop, 1995Bishop C.M. Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition. Clarendon Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar), yielded similar results (Supplemental Data). We separated the repetitions used to train the classifier and those used to test its performance to avoid overfitting. The output of the classifier is a performance value (labeled “classification performance” throughout the text) that achieves 100% if all test trials are correctly classified and 50% for chance levels. In the examples in Figures 1A and 1F, we could decode the preferred object categories (fruits and human faces, respectively) from the IFP responses in single trials with performance levels of 69% ± 6% and 65% ± 5%, respectively. We recorded data from 912 electrodes in 11 subjects (see Table S1 for the recording site location distribution). To determine whether a given classification performance value was significantly different from chance levels, we used a permutation procedure whereby we randomly shuffled the object category labels (Supplemental Data). Based on this bootstrap procedure, we used a threshold of 3 standard deviations from the mean based on the null hypothesis (Figure S2A). We observed selective responses in at least one electrode in all the subjects. Most of the selective electrodes (67%) responded preferentially to one rather than multiple object categories (Figure S2B). Across all the electrodes, we observed selective responses to the five different object categories that were tested (Figure S2C), expanding on previous IFP reports describing mostly selectivity to faces (McCarthy et al., 1999McCarthy G. Puce A. Belger A. Allison T. Electrophysiological studies of human face perception. II: Response properties of face-specific potentials generated in occipitotemporal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The distribution of selective responses across categories was not uniform: there were more electrodes responding to the human faces category than to any of the other four categories (Figure S2C). We note that the observation of an electrode that shows selectivity for a particular object category does not necessarily imply the existence of a “brain area” devoted exclusively to that category (see Discussion). The classification performance values ranged from 58% to 82% (Figure S2D; 61% ± 4%, mean ± SD). Other statistical classifiers and other definitions of IFP response yielded similar conclusions (Figure S3; Supplemental Data). As illustrated in the two examples in Figure 1, the category selectivity could not be explained by preferences for individual exemplars. Very few electrodes showed statistically significant performance levels when the classifier was trained to discriminate among individual exemplars instead of across categories (Supplemental Data). Additionally, the classification performance also dropped significantly when each category was arbitrarily defined by randomly drawing 5 exemplars out of the total of 25 exemplars (Supplemental Data). We asked whether the physiological differences across object categories could be explained by low-level image properties shared by the exemplars of a given category. To address this question, we considered 15 different image properties including contrast, number of bright or dark boxes, and so forth and computed the correlation coefficient between the IFP responses and these image properties for each electrode. Although in a few electrodes we observed significant correlations, on average, the low-level image properties that yielded the strongest correlations could not account for more than 10% of the variance in the IFP responses (Supplemental Data). Of the 912 electrodes, 111 (12%) showed selectivity. These electrodes were nonuniformly distributed across the different lobes (occipital: 35%; temporal: 14%; frontal: 7%; parietal 4%). To determine the location of the electrodes, we coregistered the preoperative magnetic resonance images with the postoperative computer tomography images and mapped each electrode onto one of 80 possible brain locations (Table S2). The areas with the highest proportions of selective electrodes were the inferior occipital gyrus (86%; area 14 in Table S2), fusiform gyrus (38%; area 17 in Table S2), parahippocampal portion of the medial temporal lobe (26%; area 19 in Table S2), midoccipital gyrus (22%; area 15 in Table S2), lingual gyrus in the medial temporal lobe (21%; area 18 in Table S2), inferior temporal cortex (18%; area 31 in Table S2), and the temporal pole (14%; area 43 in Table S2). The number of selective electrodes in all the areas that we studied is shown in Table S1. The analyses reported thus far describe the selectivity of individual electrodes, but the brain has access to information from many different locations. In order to quantify how well we could decode information by considering the ensemble activity across electrodes or across brain regions, we constructed a vector containing the responses of multiple electrodes and used the same statistical classifier approach described above (see Hung et al., 2005Hung C.P. Kreiman G. Poggio T. DiCarlo J.J. Fast read-out of object identity from macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar and Experimental Procedures). Data from multiple electrodes were concatenated assuming that the activity was independent (Supplemental Data). Figure S4A shows one way to build such an ensemble vector by selecting electrodes based on the rv value, that is, the ratio of the variance across object categories to the variance within object categories. The electrode selection was performed using only the training data. Using such an ensemble of 11 electrodes, the overall classification performance ranged from 74% to 95%. These values correspond to binary classification for each object category where chance performance is 50%; the values for multiclass classification where chance performance is 20% are shown in Figure S4B. These values provide only a lower bound to the information available in the neural ensemble, because the addition of more electrodes, the use of more complex nonlinear classifiers, and the incorporation of interactions across areas could enhance the classification performance even more. In order to further evaluate the spatial specificity of the selective responses, we built neural ensembles by drawing electrodes based on their location (Table S1). The regions that yielded the highest classification performance levels are shown in Figure 2, and included the inferior occipital gyrus (area 14 in Table S2), fusiform gyrus (area 17 in Table S2), lingual gyrus (area 18 in Table S2), parahippocampal gyrus (area 19 in Table S2), inferior temporal cortex (area 31 in Table S2), and the temporal pole (area 43 in Table S2). The classification performance values for all areas are shown in Figure S5. The ensemble results in Figure 2 (and Figure S5) are consistent with the location results presented for individual electrodes above. The intracranial field potentials show a temporal resolution of milliseconds. We therefore used the detailed time course of the IFP to estimate the latency of the selective responses. We followed the procedure in Thorpe et al., 1996Thorpe S. Fize D. Marlot C. Speed of processing in the human visual system.Nature. 1996; 381: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar: (1) we defined an electrode to be “selective” if there were 25 consecutive bins (bin size = 2 ms at Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and 3.9 ms at Children's Hospital Boston [CHB]) where a one-way ANOVA on the IFP responses across object categories yielded p < 0.01; and (2) for the selective electrodes, we defined the latency as the earliest time point where 10 consecutive bins yielded p < 0.01 in the same analysis (Figure S6A). The latencies depend on the threshold parameters; this parameter dependence is described in Figures S6B and S6C. The parameters 25, 10, and 0.01 represent conservative cutoff values that yield a low probability of false alarm. This selectivity criterion yielded 94 selective electrodes (cf. 111 selective electrodes reported above); the number of electrodes that passed the selectivity criterion in 1000 shuffles of the category labels was 0. The distribution of latencies is shown in Figure 3A; the mean latency across all the electrodes was 115 ± 44 ms. The latencies for those electrodes in the inferior occipital gyrus (area 14 in Table S2) were shorter than the ones for electrodes in temporal lobe locations (Figure S6D). In order to evaluate the earliest time point at which we could reliably decode category information in single trials, we binned the IFP responses using windows of 25 ms and computed the IFP range in each bin. We used an SVM classifier to decode category information in each time bin (Figure 3B). This is a demanding task for the classifier, because we only used a very small amount of data (25 ms) to train the classifier and to test its performance (see Figures S7A–S7C for the results for each object category and using bin sizes of 25, 50, and 100 ms). In spite of the task difficulty, we could still discriminate category information as early as ∼100 ms after stimulus onset. The latencies and decoding results are compatible with single-neuron studies in macaque monkey inferior temporal cortex (Hung et al., 2005Hung C.P. Kreiman G. Poggio T. DiCarlo J.J.

They show that common variants in the BARD1 locus at 2q35 are strongly associated with the disease. We conducted a SNP-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) focused on the high-risk subset of neuroblastoma1. As our previous unbiased GWAS showed strong association of common 6p22 SNP alleles with aggressive neuroblastoma2, we restricted our analysis here to 397 high-risk cases compared to 2,043 controls. We detected new significant association of six SNPs at 2q35 within the BARD1 locus (Pallelic = 2.35 × 10−9–2.25 × 10−8). We confirmed each SNP association in a second series of 189 high-risk cases and 1,178 controls (Pallelic = 7.90 × 10−7–2.77 × 10−4). We also tested the two most significant SNPs (rs6435862, rs3768716) in two additional independent high-risk neuroblastoma case series, yielding combined allelic odds ratios of 1.68 each (P = 8.65 × 10−18 and 2.74 × 10−16, respectively). We also found significant association with known BARD1 nonsynonymous SNPs. These data show that common variation in BARD1 contributes to the etiology of the aggressive and most clinically relevant subset of human neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2092935454,"Humans and other animals change their behavior in response to unexpected outcomes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in such adaptive responding, based on evidence from reversal tasks.

OFC is critical for the former function; here we show it is also critical for the latter. In a Pavlovian overexpectation task, inactivation of OFC prevented learning driven by unexpected outcomes, even when performance was assessed later. We propose this reflects a critical contribution of outcome signaling by OFC to encoding of reward prediction errors elsewhere. In accord with this proposal, we report that signaling of reward predictions by OFC neurons was related to signaling of prediction errors by dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA).

This is typically demonstrated experimentally using reversal learning tasks, in which subjects must learn to switch their responses when the associations between cues and outcomes are reversed. Damage to OFC reliably impairs rapid reversal learning (Chudasama and Robbins, 2003Chudasama Y. Robbins T.W.

Behav. 1998; 26: 351-360Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Rescorla, 1970Rescorla R.A. Reduction in the effectiveness of reinforcement after prior excitatory conditioning.Learn. Motiv. 1970; 1: 372-381Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to test whether OFC also supports the former function—facilitating new learning in the face of unexpected outcomes. In this task, rats are first trained that several cues independently predict reward. Subsequently, two cues are presented together, in compound, followed by the same reward. When responding for the individual cues is assessed again later, rats exhibit reduced responding to the compounded cues. This reduced responding is thought to result from the violation of summed expectations for reward during compound training. In other words, in compound training, the rat expects to receive two rewards, one for each cue, but only obtains one. The resulting discrepancy between actual and expected outcomes—the negative prediction error—changes the strength of the underlying associative representations, leading to reduced responding when the cues are presented alone. Here we report that reversible inactivation of OFC during compound training prevents this later reduction in responding to the individual cues. This result cannot be explained as a simple deficit in using associative information to guide behavior, and instead indicates that signals from OFC are required for learning. We propose that this function reflects the contribution of outcome signaling by OFC neurons to encoding of reward prediction errors by other brain areas. In support of this hypothesis, we present single-unit recording data showing that when signaling of reward predictions in OFC is high, signaling of reward prediction errors by dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) is low. Furthermore, we also show that VTA, like OFC, is necessary for learning during overexpectation. These data implicate the OFC as a critical part of a circuit driving learning when outcomes are not as expected. To test the hypothesis that the OFC plays a critical role in facilitating learning in the face of unexpected outcomes, we employed a Pavlovian overexpectation task consisting of three phases: conditioning, compound training, and a probe test. In the conditioning phase, three different cues are independently associated with food reward. Subsequently, in compound training, two of these cues are presented simultaneously as a compound in order to induce a heightened expectation of reward. This heightened expectation is violated when only the normal amount of reward is delivered, inducing a prediction error which then modifies the strength of the underlying associative representations. As a result, rats trained in this manner exhibit reduced responding to the cues previously presented in compound, when they are presented alone in a probe test administered after compound conditioning. This decline in responding is evident from the start of the probe test, indicating that it is the result of learning that occurred during compound training. By dissociating learning in the face of unexpected outcomes (in compound training) from the use of the new information (in probe testing), this task provides an excellent vehicle with which to test the hypothesis that OFC has a specific role in learning when expected and actual outcomes differ. If this is true, then inactivation of OFC during compound training should prevent the spontaneous decline in responding to compounded cue in the probe test. On the other hand, if OFC is only required for using information about expected outcomes to guide behavior, then inactivation of OFC during compound training should have no effect on behavior in the subsequent probe test. Thirty-five rats were trained in a modified version of the overexpectation task, illustrated by the experimental timeline in Figure 1. Prior to training, 19 rats underwent surgery to implant cannulae bilaterally in OFC. This included 14 rats that later received muscimol and baclofen infusions to inactivate OFC (OFCi group), and 5 rats that later received saline infusions to serve as controls. Muscimol and baclofen were given at a concentration sufficient to cause reversal learning impairments similar to those caused by neurotoxic lesions of OFC; impairments were reversible as demonstrated by subsequent normal reversal performance (see Supplemental Results available online). Cannulae location is illustrated in Figure 1. The remaining 16 rats served as nonsurgical controls. The saline and nonsurgical controls exhibited no differences in any of the subsequent measures of conditioning, and thus they were combined into a single control group. After surgery and a 2 week recovery period, these rats underwent 10 days of conditioning, during which cues were paired with flavored sucrose pellets (banana and grape, designated as O1 and O2, counterbalanced). We have shown elsewhere that these flavored pellets are equally preferred but discriminable, by both controls and OFC-lesioned rats (Burke et al., 2008Burke K.A. Franz T.M. Miller D.N. Schoenbaum G. The role of orbitofrontal cortex in the pursuit of happiness and more specific rewards.Nature. 2008; 454: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Three unique auditory cues (tone, white noise, and clicker, designated A1, A2, and A3, counterbalanced) were the primary cues of interest. A1 served as the “overexpected cue” and was associated with three pellets of O1. A2 served as a control cue and was associated with three pellets of O2. A3 was associated with no reward and thus served as a CS−. Rats were also trained to associate a visual cue (cue light, V1) with three pellets of O1. V1 was to be paired with A1 in the compound phase to induce overexpectation; therefore a nonauditory cue was used in order to discourage the formation of compound representations. Rats in the control and OFCi groups showed similar responding to V1 in all phases (see Supplemental Results for statistical analysis of V1 responding). Acquisition of conditioned responding to the critical auditory cues is shown in Figure 1A. Both controls and OFCi rats developed elevated responding to A1 and A2, compared to A3, across the 10 sessions. Rats in both groups learned to respond to these two cues equally, and responding did not increase across the final four sessions. In accord with this impression, ANOVA (group X cue X session) revealed significant main effects of cue and session (cue: F(2,66) = 56.5, p < 0.000001; session: F(9,297) = 5.26, p = 0.000001), and a significant interaction between cue and session (F(18,594) = 9.88, p < 0.000001); however, there were no main effects nor any interactions with group (F values < 1.36, p values > 0.14). A direct comparison of responding to A1 and A2 revealed no statistical effects of either cue or group (F values < 1.60, p values > 0.21), indicating that rats learned to respond to these two cues equally. Furthermore, there were no effects of session in the final 4 days of training (F values < 2.29, p values > 0.08), indicating that responding was at ceiling. After initial conditioning, the rats underwent 4 days of compound training. These sessions were the same as preceding sessions, except that V1 was delivered simultaneously with A1. V1 also continued to be presented separately to support its associative strength and thereby maximize the effect of overexpectation on A1. A2 and A3 continued to be presented as before. Immediately prior to each session, rats in the OFCi group received bilateral infusions of muscimol and baclofen in order to inactivate OFC; cannulated rats in the control group received saline infusions. Responding during compound training is shown in Figure 1B. Both controls and OFCi rats maintained elevated responding to A1/V1 and A2, compared to A3, across the four sessions. ANOVA (group X cue X session) revealed significant main effects of cue and session (cue: F(2,66) = 101.4, p < 0.000001; session: F(3,99) = 3.33, p = 0.02) and a significant interaction between cue and session (F(6,198) = 2.90, p = 0.009). While there were no effects of group on the raw response rates (F values < 3.6, p values > 0.06), a comparison of responding to each cue across the last 4 days of initial conditioning versus the 4 days of compound training revealed a significant increase in responding to A1 when it was presented in compound with V1 in controls (F(1,20) = 5.42, p = 0.017), but not in OFCi rats (F(3,39) = 1.56, p = 0.23). There was no change in responding to A2 in either group (F values < 2.68, p values > 0.11). This effect was also evident in response rates normalized to the last day of training, which showed a significant increase to the A1/V1 compound in controls (F(1,20) = 5.47, p = 0.029), but not in OFCi rats (F(1,13) = 0.60, p = 0.45) (Figure 1B, insets). Thus OFC inactivation prevented summation of responding to the compound cue. This effect is consistent with a role for OFC in generating outcome expectancies to drive behavior, which has been shown previously. The question then is whether the loss of this function would also prevent the learning normally induced by compound training. To test this question, rats received a probe test the day after the last compound conditioning session, in which A1, A2, and A3 were presented alone without reinforcement. Conditioned responding is shown in Figure 1C. Both control and OFCi rats showed elevated responding to A1 and A2, compared to A3, and this responding extinguished across the session. Accordingly, an ANOVA (group X cue X trial) revealed significant main effects of cue and trial (cue: F(2,66) = 39.7, p < 0.000001; trial: F(7,231) = 14.8, p < 0.000001) and a significant interaction between cue and trial (F(14,462) = 2.34, p = 0.003). Importantly there were no significant interactions involving group and trial (F values < 1.37, p values > 0.21), indicating that there were no effects of prior inactivation of OFC on extinction learning. Because extinction learning would be impaired by damage to OFC (Izquierdo and Murray, 2005Izquierdo A. Murray E.A. Opposing effects of amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex lesions on the extinction of instrumental responding in macaque monkeys.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this result indicates that there was no lasting impairment to OFC function resulting from prior inactivation. In addition to these effects, which were similar between groups, controls also showed less responding to the overexpected A1 cue than to the A2 control cue. As a result, there was a significant interaction between group and cue (F(2,66) = 3.23, p = 0.04). A step-down ANOVA comparing responding to A1 and A2 revealed that controls showed less responding to the overexpected A1 cue than to the A2 control cue (F(1,20) = 14.1, p = 0.001); OFCi rats responded at identical levels to the A1 and A2 cues throughout the probe session (F(1, 13) = 0.008, p = 0.92). Importantly the difference in responding to A1 and A2 in controls was evident on the first trial in the probe test and persisted throughout extinction (Figure 1C). Thus the decline in responding was not due to effects of extinction or other manipulations in the probe test. The difference in responding was entirely due to a significant decline in responding to the A1 cue; there was no significant change in responding to A2. By contrast, OFCi rats responded at identical levels to the A1 and A2 cues throughout the probe session, and responding on the first trial in the probe test was statistically indistinguishable from responding during compound training. In other words, inactivation of OFC during compound training prevented the spontaneous decrease in conditioned responding to A1 during the probe test, even though the OFCi rats did not receive any inactivating agents at the time of probe testing. Consistent with this impression, a statistical comparison of responding on the first trial of the probe test and last day of compound conditioning revealed a significant decline in responding to A1 in controls (F(1, 19) = 13.4, p = 0.002), but not OFCi rats (F(1, 13) = 0.97, p = 0.34), and no change in responding to A2 in either group (F values < 1.18 p values > 0.29). Neurotoxic lesions of OFC produced exactly the same effect in a separate experiment (see Supplemental Results). This pattern of results suggests an alternate role for OFC in promoting adaptive or flexible behavior in the face of unexpected outcomes. The involvement of the OFC in flexible behavior is typically demonstrated experimentally using reversal learning tasks, in which associations between cues and outcomes are switched. Damage to the OFC causes animals to be unable to change established response patterns in this setting (Chudasama and Robbins, 2003Chudasama Y. Robbins T.W.

Mem. 2003; 10: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Yet reversal tasks confound the acquisition and the use of new associative information. Previously, researchers have hypothesized that OFC-dependent reversal deficits occur because OFC is necessary for using associative information acquired by other brain regions, such as amygdala, either to inhibit inappropriate responses or to drive correct ones. Yet these hypotheses are inconsistent with recent data showing that animals with damage to OFC are readily able to inhibit prepotent responses in some settings (Chudasama et al., 2007Chudasama Y. Kralik J.D. Murray E.A. Rhesus monkeys with orbital prefrontal cortex lesions can learn to inhibit prepotent responses in the reversed reward contingency task.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and with observations that recoding of associative information after reversal in OFC is both inversely related to reversal performance and less than that observed in other brain regions (Paton et al., 2006Paton J.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2643-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither account can easily explain the current results, since both predict no effect of reversible inactivation during the compound training phase on subsequent performance in the probe test. Instead, our results suggest that OFC is necessary for learning from differences between actual and expected outcomes, as occurs on the compound trials when the summed expected outcome fails to materialize. Differences between expected and actual outcomes are thought to generate signals—prediction errors—to drive associative learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Interestingly a number of brain imaging studies have reported that neural activity in OFC, as reflected in BOLD signal, is correlated with errors in reward prediction. For example, BOLD signal in regions within OFC increases abruptly when expectations for reward are not met (Nobre et al., 1999Nobre A.C. Coull J.T. Frith C.D. Mesulam M.M. Orbitofrontal cortex is activated during breaches of expectation in tasks of visual attention.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and this signal conforms with formal learning theory predictions in a blocking paradigm (Tobler et al., 2006Tobler P.N. O'Doherty J. Dolan R.J. Schultz W. Human neural learning depends on reward prediction errors in the blocking paradigm.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus OFC might contribute to learning during overexpectation if it were directly signaling reward prediction errors. To test this hypothesis, we examined single-unit spiking activity in OFC neurons in a simple choice task that we have previously used to characterize signaling of prediction errors in rat dopamine neurons (Roesch et al., 2007Roesch M.R. Calu D.J. Schoenbaum G. Dopamine neurons encode the better option in rats deciding between differently delayed or sized rewards.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The choice task and associated behavior are illustrated in Figure 2. Rats were required to respond to one of two adjacent wells after sampling one of three different odor cues at a central port. One odor signaled a sucrose reward in the right well (forced-choice), a second odor signaled a sucrose reward in the left well (forced-choice), and a third odor signaled reward at either well (free-choice). During recording, rats learned to bias their choice behavior in response to manipulations of the size or time to reward in one or the other well (Figures 2A and 2B). In theory, these manipulations should induce prediction errors, particularly at the start of new blocks when the rats must learn that their prior expectations are no longer valid. Specifically we would expect positive prediction errors at the start of blocks 2sh, 3bg, and 4bg (Figure 2A), when an unexpected reward is instituted, and negative prediction errors at the start of blocks 2lo and 4sm (Figure 2A), when an expected reward is omitted. In accord with this proposal, spiking activity in dopamine neurons in VTA, thought to signal positive and negative prediction errors (Bayer and Glimcher, 2005Bayer H.M. Glimcher P.W.

Dopamine responses comply with basic assumptions of formal learning theory.Nature. 2001; 412: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), was higher at the start of blocks 2sh, 3bg, and 4bg (reproduced in Figure 2Ci for comparison with OFC data), lower at the start of blocks 2lo and 4sm (reproduced in Figure 2Cii), and transferred to the predictive cues after learning in these blocks (reproduced in Figures 2Ciii and 2Cv). Spiking activity in OFC neurons recorded in this same choice task did not exhibit any of these characteristics. Analysis of data from before learning, not included in previously published work (Roesch et al., 2006Roesch M.R. Taylor A.R. Schoenbaum G. Encoding of time-discounted rewards in orbitofrontal cortex is independent of value representation.Neuron. 2006; 51: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), showed that reward-related activity in OFC was unaffected by delivery of an unexpected reward (Figure 2Di) or by omission of an expected reward (Figure 2Dii). Nor was there any relationship between the development of cue selectivity and encoding of positive prediction errors in these OFC neurons (Figures 2Diii and 2Dv). The same was true when responses of all OFC neurons were considered, without preselecting for those that were reward responsive (see Supplemental Results). Although a small minority of OFC neurons fired more in response to unexpected rewards, none of them showed a suppression of activity to reward omission, as would be expected if they were signaling prediction errors. Indeed, to the slight extent that neurons fired more in response to unexpected rewards, they also tended to fire more to reward omission rather than less, as indicated by a weak but significant positive correlation between the two responses (Figure 2Div). This relationship is the opposite of that observed in dopamine neurons (Figure 2Civ). If spiking activity in OFC does not reflect prediction errors, then why is OFC necessary for learning driven by these errors during overexpectation and, perhaps, reversal learning? One possibility is that signals from OFC might contribute to the normal calculation of prediction errors by neurons in areas like VTA. Recent studies suggest that OFC is critical for signaling information about expected outcomes, in real time, to guide behavior (Izquierdo et al., 2004Izquierdo A. Suda R.K. Murray E.A.

For example, rats and monkeys with damage to OFC are unable to modify cue-evoked responding spontaneously to reflect changes in the value of the predicted outcome (Izquierdo et al., 2004Izquierdo A.

https://openalex.org/W2167325573,"We tend to think of culture — in humans and in other animals — as something that is passed on through social learning. But the species-typical nature of some aspects of cultural diversity, and variations between individuals of a particular species, point to possible genetic origins. Fehér et al. explored this latter point by analysing the establishment of socially learned birdsong in an island colony of naive zebra finches. Although the original founding members of the colony were never exposed to tutored birdsong during development, and exhibited a song that differed markedly from wild-type, in as few as three or four generations, the tutored song approached that of the wild-type. These findings suggest that species-specific song culture can develop de novo, and echo the well known instance of de novo evolution of Nicaraguan sign language, spontaneously developed by deaf children in Managua, showing grammatical similarities to spoken human languages. Although culture is often considered to be passed on through social learning, there are species-typical constraints to cultural diversity that could have genetic origins. By studying the establishment of socially learned birdsong in an island colony of naive zebra finches with a song much different from wild type, it is now revealed that over as few as 3–4 generations the tutored song approaches that of the wild type. Thus, species-typical song culture can develop de novo, giving insight into language change and evolution in humans. Culture is typically viewed as consisting of traits inherited epigenetically, through social learning. However, cultural diversity has species-typical constraints1, presumably of genetic origin. A celebrated, if contentious, example is whether a universal grammar constrains syntactic diversity in human languages2. Oscine songbirds exhibit song learning and provide biologically tractable models of culture: members of a species show individual variation in song3 and geographically separated groups have local song dialects4,5. Different species exhibit distinct song cultures6,7, suggestive of genetic constraints8,9. Without such constraints, innovations and copying errors should cause unbounded variation over multiple generations or geographical distance, contrary to observations9. Here we report an experiment designed to determine whether wild-type song culture might emerge over multiple generations in an isolated colony founded by isolates, and, if so, how this might happen and what type of social environment is required10. Zebra finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in laboratory11 or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations in two social environments: tutor–pupil pairs in sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations. Thus, species-typical song culture can appear de novo. Our study has parallels with language change and evolution12,13,14. In analogy to models in quantitative genetics15,16, we model song culture as a multigenerational phenotype partly encoded genetically in an isolate founding population, influenced by environmental variables and taking multiple generations to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W1969799392,"Flavonoids normally accumulate in plants as O-glycosylated derivatives, but several species, including major cereal crops, predominantly synthesize flavone-C-glycosides, which are stable to hydrolysis and are biologically active both in planta and as dietary components. An enzyme (OsCGT) catalyzing the UDP-glucose-dependent C-glucosylation of 2-hydroxyflavanone precursors of flavonoids has been identified and cloned from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica), with a similar protein characterized in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). OsCGT is a 49-kDa family 1 glycosyltransferase related to known O-glucosyltransferases. The recombinant enzyme C-glucosylated 2-hydroxyflavanones but had negligible O-glucosyltransferase activity with flavonoid acceptors. Enzyme chemistry studies suggested that OsCGT preferentially C-glucosylated the dibenzoylmethane tautomers formed in equilibrium with 2-hydroxyflavanones. The resulting 2-hydroxyflavanone-C-glucosides were unstable and spontaneously dehydrated in vitro to yield a mixture of 6C- and 8C-glucosyl derivatives of the respective flavones. In contrast, in planta, only the respective 6C-glucosides accumulated. Consistent with this selectivity in glycosylation product, a dehydratase activity that preferentially converted 2-hydroxyflavanone-C-glucosides to the corresponding flavone-6C-glucosides was identified in both rice and wheat. Our results demonstrate that cereal crops synthesize C-glucosylated flavones through the concerted action of a CGT and dehydratase acting on activated 2-hydroxyflavanones, as an alternative means of generating flavonoid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2058035029,"Spontaneous 'mini' release occurs at all synapses, but its nature remains enigmatic. We found that >95% of spontaneous release in murine cortical neurons was induced by Ca2+-binding to synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), the Ca2+ sensor for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release. Thus, spontaneous and evoked release used the same Ca2+-dependent release mechanism. As a consequence, Syt1 mutations that altered its Ca2+ affinity altered spontaneous and evoked release correspondingly. Paradoxically, Syt1 deletions (as opposed to point mutations) massively increased spontaneous release. This increased spontaneous release remained Ca2+ dependent but was activated at lower Ca2+ concentrations and with a lower Ca2+ cooperativity than synaptotagmin-driven spontaneous release. Thus, in addition to serving as a Ca2+ sensor for spontaneous and evoked release, Syt1 clamped a second, more sensitive Ca2+ sensor for spontaneous release that resembles the Ca2+ sensor for evoked asynchronous release. These data suggest that Syt1 controls both evoked and spontaneous release at a synapse as a simultaneous Ca2+-dependent activator and clamp of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2112810336,"Organized neuronal firing is crucial for cortical processing and is disrupted in schizophrenia. Using rapid amplification of 5' complementary DNA ends in human brain, we identified a primate-specific isoform (3.1) of the ether-a-go-go-related K(+) channel KCNH2 that modulates neuronal firing. KCNH2-3.1 messenger RNA levels are comparable to full-length KCNH2 (1A) levels in brain but three orders of magnitude lower in heart. In hippocampus from individuals with schizophrenia, KCNH2-3.1 expression is 2.5-fold greater than KCNH2-1A expression. A meta-analysis of five clinical data sets (367 families, 1,158 unrelated cases and 1,704 controls) shows association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in KCNH2 with schizophrenia. Risk-associated alleles predict lower intelligence quotient scores and speed of cognitive processing, altered memory-linked functional magnetic resonance imaging signals and increased KCNH2-3.1 mRNA levels in postmortem hippocampus. KCNH2-3.1 lacks a domain that is crucial for slow channel deactivation. Overexpression of KCNH2-3.1 in primary cortical neurons induces a rapidly deactivating K(+) current and a high-frequency, nonadapting firing pattern. These results identify a previously undescribed KCNH2 channel isoform involved in cortical physiology, cognition and psychosis, providing a potential new therapeutic drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2025246434,"During the cellular response to DNA damage in eukaryotes, cell-cycle arrest is coordinated with DNA repair. Here the human F-box protein FBXO31 is shown to regulate the cell-cycle transition from G1 to S phase in response to DNA damage by mediating degradation of cyclin D1. Diverse DNA damaging agents result in increased FBXO31 levels, indicating that FBXO31 is a general mediator required to arrest cell growth after DNA damage. Upon DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate the DNA damage response, a complex signalling pathway which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Using a genome-wide RNA interference screen, the human F-box protein FBXO31 is shown to regulate the G1/S cell cycle transition in response to DNA damage by mediating degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase. In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR1,2,3. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes4. One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers5,6,7,8,9. Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent on the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after γ-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2027713539,"DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic mark in plants and mammals. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be triggered by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Here, we report the identification of an RdDM effector, KTF1. Loss-of-function mutations in KTF1 reduce DNA methylation and release the silencing of RdDM target loci without abolishing the siRNA triggers. KTF1 has similarity to the transcription elongation factor SPT5 and contains a C-terminal extension rich in GW/WG repeats. KTF1 colocalizes with ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) in punctate nuclear foci and binds AGO4 and RNA transcripts. Our results suggest KTF1 as an adaptor protein that binds scaffold transcripts generated by Pol V and recruits AGO4 and AGO4-bound siRNAs to form an RdDM effector complex. The dual interaction of an effector protein with AGO and small RNA target transcripts may be a general feature of RNA-silencing effector complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2031710562,"Recently, we identified Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) as a mediator of glucotoxic beta cell death and discovered that lack of Txnip protects against streptozotocin- and obesity-induced diabetes by preventing beta cell apoptosis and preserving endogenous beta cell mass. Txnip has therefore become an attractive target for diabetes therapy, but although we have found that txnip transcription is highly induced by glucose through a unique carbohydrate response element, the factors controlling this effect have remained unknown. Using transient transfection experiments, we now show that overexpression of the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) transactivates the txnip promoter, whereas ChREBP knockdown by small interfering RNA completely blunts glucose-induced txnip transcription. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that glucose leads to a dose- and time-dependent recruitment of ChREBP to the txnip promoter in vivo in INS-1 beta cells as well as human islets. Furthermore, we found that the co-activator and histone acetyltransferase p300 co-immunoprecipitates with ChREBP and also binds to the txnip promoter in response to glucose. Interestingly, this is associated with specific acetylation of histone H4 and recruitment of RNA polymerase II as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Thus, with this study we have identified ChREBP as the transcription factor that mediates glucose-induced txnip expression in human islets and INS-1 beta cells and have characterized the chromatin modification associated with glucose-induced txnip transcription. In addition, the results reveal for the first time that ChREBP interacts with p300. This may explain how ChREBP induces H4 acetylation and sheds new light on glucose-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and transcription.

Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in cellular redox control and apoptosis (1Junn E. Han S.H. Im J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W. Um H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W.

In particular, we have previously demonstrated that Txnip levels are significantly up-regulated in pancreatic islets of different mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and that increased Txnip expression induces pancreatic beta cell apoptosis (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Loss of pancreatic beta cell mass by apoptosis is a key factor in the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (5Eizirik D.L. Kutlu B. Rasschaert J. Darville M. Cardozo A.K. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1005: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 7Butler A.E. Janson J.

Science. 2005; 307: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Txnip may play an important role in this process. In fact, using Txnip-deficient mice harboring a naturally occurring nonsense mutation in their txnip gene (HcB-19) as well as our beta cell-specific txnip knock-out mice (bTKO), we discovered that lack of txnip protects against diabetes induced by multiple low dose injections of streptozotocin (a classical model of type 1 diabetes) (9Chen J. Hui S.T. Couto F.M. Mungrue I.N. Davis D.B. Attie A.D. Lusis A.J. Davis R.A. Shalev A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3581-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, Txnip deficiency was also able to rescue severely obese and insulin-resistant BTBRob/ob mice lacking leptin from diabetes, as demonstrated by our double-mutant congenic BTBRlepob/obtxniphcb/hcb (BTBR.ob/hcb) mice (9Chen J. Hui S.T. Couto F.M. Mungrue I.N. Davis D.B. Attie A.D. Lusis A.J. Davis R.A. Shalev A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3581-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). BTBRob/ob mice are considered one of the most stringent models of type 2 diabetes, since, unlike B6ob/ob BTBRob/ob mice typically develop severe diabetes already at 6 weeks of age and completely decompensate at around 10 weeks (10Lan H. Rabaglia M.E. Stoehr J.P. Nadler S.T. Schueler K.L. Zou F. Yandell B.S. Attie A.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, Txnip-deficient BTBR.ob/hcb mice remained normoglycemic for over 6 months. Interestingly, the main mechanism responsible for this Txnip-mediated protection against streptozotocin- and obesity-induced diabetes was a dramatic ∼50-fold reduction in beta cell apoptosis and preservation of endogenous beta cell mass (9Chen J. Hui S.T. Couto F.M. Mungrue I.N. Davis D.B. Attie A.D. Lusis A.J. Davis R.A. Shalev A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3581-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that Txnip represents a critical link between glucose toxicity and beta cell death (11Chen J. Saxena G. Mungrue I.N. Lusis A.J. Shalev A. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on these combined findings, Txnip has become an attractive novel target for diabetes therapy, but still very little is known about its regulation. Txnip expression is highly induced by glucose in different tissues, and we originally identified it as the top glucose-induced gene in our human islet oligonucleotide microarray study (12Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffmann S.C. Hirshberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

Diabetes. 2008; 57: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We further established that this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level, and a detailed promoter deletion analysis revealed that a short proximal promoter region was necessary and sufficient for glucose-induced transactivation (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). More specifically, a unique nonpalindromic 17-bp E-box repeat was found to be highly conserved between species and function as the cis-acting carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) for glucose-induced txnip transcription (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), but the trans-acting factors remained unknown. reverse transcription carbohydrate response element carbohydrate response element-binding protein cytomegalovirus ChREBP-specific small interfering RNA oligonucleotide chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase II trichostatin A histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase liver-type pyruvate kinase. reverse transcription carbohydrate response element carbohydrate response element-binding protein cytomegalovirus ChREBP-specific small interfering RNA oligonucleotide chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase II trichostatin A histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase liver-type pyruvate kinase. The present study was therefore aimed at identifying the transcription factor(s) as well as potentially associated co-activators and chromatin modifications that mediate glucose-induced txnip expression. INS-1 and HIT-T15 cells were maintained as described previously (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were incubated at 5 mm glucose for 30 h prior to being used for any experiments. Human islets were obtained through the Islet Cell Resources Basic Science Islet Distribution Program and incubated overnight in RPMI medium containing 5 mm glucose prior to a 24-h incubation at low (1.67 mm) or high (16.7 mm) glucose. (We used these conditions to reproduce the experimental design of our original human islet oligonucleotide microarray and quantitative RT-PCR studies that identified TXNIP as a highly glucose-induced gene (12Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffmann S.C. Hirshberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).) Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) was cloned from mouse liver, and NeuroD was cloned from human islets using the Elongase amplification system (Invitrogen) and primers 13 and 14 and primers 17 and 18, respectively (Table S1). Amplicons where then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the CMV promoter. All other plasmids have been described previously (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). HIT-T15 cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected with CMV-ChREBP, CMV-NeuroD, or CMV-LacZ together with the D4 or mut D4 txnip reporter constructs at a 3:1 ratio (0.5 μg of DNA/well) using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) in serum-free RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 2.5 mm glucose. 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were determined by a dual luciferase assay (Promega). The pRL-TK control plasmid (Promega), co-transfected at 5 ng/well, was used to correct for transfection efficiency. INS-1 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with a txnip promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid (FL-TXNIP) or an SV40-driven pGL3 control plasmid (1 μg/ml) and ChREBP-specific small interfering RNA oligonucleotide (siChREBP) (0.1 μm) (RSS301430; Invitrogen) or scrambled oligonucleotides (0.1 μm) (D-001810-01-20; Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT Duo transfection reagent (Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific, Chicago, IL) (5 μl/well) and incubated at low (5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose prior to analysis by the dual luciferase assay. To confirm ChREBP knockdown, cells transfected with siChREBP or scrambled oligonucleotide and grown at 25 mm glucose were harvested for RNA extraction with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and for protein extraction using 150 μl of whole cell extract lysis buffer (11Chen J. Saxena G. Mungrue I.N. Lusis A.J. Shalev A. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed as described previously (13Cha-Molstad H. Keller D.M. Yochum G.S. Impey S. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13572-13577Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 500 μg of protein (by BCA protein assay kit) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of ChREBP (sc-21189), Mlx (sc-14705), USF2 (sc-862X), RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (sc-899X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies or specific antibodies against acetylated histone H3 (06-599), acetylated histone H4 (06-866) (Upstate/Millipore, Billerica, MA), lysine 4-trimethylated histone H3 (ab8580; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody as a negative control (β-galactosidase) (Abcam). Human islets were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde directly to the cell media to a final concentration of 1%. Sonication was performed with a Misonix cup horn sonicator for 10 30-s pulses at output 4. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-human ChREBP (sc-21189) or p300 antibodies (sc-584X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were captured with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose slurry. DNA fragments were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit and quantified by real time PCR with primers listed in Table S1. Although histone acetylation occurs at the promoter and 5′-coding region, methylation is enriched in the coding region (14Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 15Espinoza C.R. Feeney A.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6668-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8036) Google Scholar). Since we only saw modest changes in acetylation in the txnip promoter region (data not shown), we used the 5′-coding region primers 7 and 8 (Table S1) for modified histone ChIP analysis. Human islet nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (17Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (250 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal rabbit p300 (sc-584) or goat ChREBP (sc-21189) antibodies in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 4 h at 4 °C followed by precipitation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were resuspended in NuPAGE LDS electrophoresis sample buffer (Invitrogen) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with polyclonal mouse anti-p300 (1:300; 05-257; Upstate/Millipore), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-ChREBP (1:500; NB400–135H; Novus Biologicals) or goat anti-Mlx (1:300; sc-14705; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by secondary anti-mouse or anti-goat antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized by ECL Plus detection reagent (GE Healthcare). p values were calculated by Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance for data sets of more than two groups. Glucose-induced txnip transcription depends on a short proximal region of the txnip promoter and especially on a well conserved ChoRE consisting of two E-boxes (4Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Analysis of this critical 17-bp ChoRE sequence of the human, rat, and mouse txnip promoter using MatInspector (Genomatix) predicted ChREBP as the only conserved putative trans-acting factor binding to this region (Fig. 1A). In fact, ChREBP has been recognized as the key transcription factor mediating glucose-induced gene expression especially in liver (18Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, although ChREBP belongs to the B group of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that recognize E-boxes containing CACGTG or CATGTG sequences, the E-boxes in the txnip promoter are nonpalindromic and consist of a repeat of CACGAG sequences (also referred to as N-boxes (19Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). To test experimentally if ChREBP might induce txnip transcription, we performed transfection experiments using luciferase reporter constructs driven by the proximal txnip promoter region containing the intact ChoRE (D4) or a mutation of the first E-box (mut D4) (Fig. 1B) and overexpressing ChREBP or LacZ. As a negative control, we also performed parallel experiments overexpressing NeuroD, which is involved in glucose-induced transcription of the insulin gene. Indeed, our results demonstrated that ChREBP overexpression stimulates transcription from the txnip promoter (Fig. 1C), whereas NeuroD overexpression had no effect (Fig. 1D). Moreover, mutation of the core sequence of the txnip-ChoRE in the mut D4 completely abolished ChREBP-mediated transactivation, indicating that this cis-acting element is critical for the ChREBP effect. To examine whether ChREBP binds the txnip promoter in vivo, we performed ChIP assays using INS-1 beta cells incubated at low (5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose for 6 h and utilized PCR primers flanking the txnip-ChoRE. A moderate level of ChREBP binding to the txnip promoter was observed even at low glucose, whereas upon high glucose, ChREBP recruitment to the txnip promoter increased ∼3-fold (Fig. 2A). Very similar effects were also observed with another primer pair (data not shown). ChREBP is known to mediate glucose-induced transactivation of liver-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) in the liver as well as in beta cells (18Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 20Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and was therefore used as a positive control. Indeed, glucose led to a similar induction of ChREBP binding to the LPK promoter, although the level of ChREBP binding to the txnip promoter was higher overall (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the glucose-induced increase in ChREBP binding to the txnip-ChoRE was also associated with a 2-fold increase in Pol II recruitment to the txnip promoter (Fig. 2B), consistent with the role of ChREBP as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, the IgG/β-galactosidase control showed no enrichment of txnip-ChoRE (Fig. 2C), and binding to the GAPDH internal control was negligible, confirming the specificity of these ChIP assays. In addition, we also studied the role of USF2, another B group basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that recognizes E-boxes. Although overexpression of USF2 increased txnip promoter activity in transfection experiments and ChIP assays demonstrated some USF2 binding to the txnip promoter in INS-1 beta cells, no increase in USF2 binding was observed in response to glucose (data not shown), suggesting that USF2 is not mediating the observed glucose-induced activation of txnip transcription. We also performed dose response and time course experiments using INS-1 beta cells treated with increasing concentrations of glucose (0–25 mm) for 6 h or treated with 25 mm glucose for various periods of time (0–24 h). ChREBP binding to txnip-ChoRE increased in a dose-dependent manner, showing the biggest effect at 25 mm glucose (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we found that ChREBP binding occurs as early as 15 min in response to glucose (Fig. S1) and persists for at least 24 h (Fig. 3C). Since active ChREBP forms heterodimers with Mlx in the nucleus, we again employed ChIP analysis to examine whether there is also Mlx binding to the txnip-ChoRE in vivo. Indeed, Mlx not only bound to the txnip-ChoRE, but its DNA binding increased in a time-dependent manner in response to high glucose (Fig. 3D), further supporting the role of ChREBP/Mlx in glucose-induced txnip transcription. To further confirm that ChREBP is the main regulator of glucose-induced txnip gene expression, we knocked down ChREBP by RNA interference (Fig. 4, A and B). While transfection of INS-1 beta cells with scrambled oligonucleotide did not affect glucose-induced txnip promoter activity, siChREBP completely blunted the glucose effect (Fig. 4C), indicating that ChREBP is critical for glucose-induced txnip transcription. In contrast, siChREBP had no effect on the SV40 promoter activity run as a negative control (Fig. 4D). Chromatin modification and, in particular, histone deacetylation by HDACs has been shown to be associated with inhibition of gene transcription. To investigate whether histone deacetylation may play a role in the inhibition of txnip gene expression at low glucose, INS-1 cells incubated at low (5 mm) glucose were treated with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (60 nm) (Sigma) or with high (25 mm) glucose with or without TSA for 6 h, and txnip mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly, TSA induced txnip gene expression significantly in the presence of low or high glucose (Fig. 5A), suggesting that histone acetylation/deacetylation plays an important role in the control of txnip transcription. Furthermore, this TSA-mediated txnip induction was as potent as the one conferred by high glucose, and together they resulted in an additive effect. To further define the specific histone modifications conferred by TSA, we performed ChIP assays using specific antibodies detecting acetylated H3 and H4 representing common activation marks. The results revealed that TSA induces both H3 and H4 acetylation of the txnip gene (Fig. 5, B and C). To examine the possible role of histone acetylation in glucose-induced txnip gene expression, we performed modified histone ChIP assays using INS-1 beta cells incubated again at low or high glucose for various periods of time, focusing specifically on H4 and H3, which are frequently hyperacetylated in actively transcribed genes. In addition, we investigated H3 lysine 4 trimethylation as another classical chromatin activation mark. Interestingly, glucose led to a significant increase in H4 acetylation of the txnip gene (Fig. 6A), whereas H3 acetylation (Fig. 6B) and H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (Fig. 6C) or dimethylation (data not shown) were not affected by glucose. To further confirm our findings in human islets, ChIP analysis was performed using isolated human islets incubated again at low or high glucose. Similar to our findings in INS-1 beta cells, we observed a significant 3-fold increase in ChREBP binding to the human TXNIP promoter in response to high glucose (Fig. 7A). To further study potential cofactors involved in this glucose-induced activation of TXNIP transcription, we also examined the possible role of p300. The transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 has been shown to regulate the expression of other glucose-responsive genes, such as insulin and fibronectin (21Qiu Y. Guo M.

Moreover, p300 is one of the major HATs (in addition to HAT1 and TIP 60) that acetylate H4. As a co-activator, p300 directly associates with Pol II (28Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D.

Cell. 2002; 10: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could confer the Pol II recruitment observed in our studies. Taken together with our observation that glucose induces txnip H4 acetylation, p300 seemed to represent an attractive candidate. Indeed, ChIP analysis again using isolated human islets revealed that p300 was recruited to the txnip promoter at high glucose (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, using nuclear extracts of human islets incubated at high glucose and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we were able to demonstrate that p300 physically interacts with ChREBP/Mlx (Fig. 7C). Together, these findings suggest that glucose exposure of beta cells leads within minutes to binding of a complex containing ChREBP/Mlx and p300 to the txnip promoter, which results in H4 acetylation, opening of the chromatin structure, recruitment of Pol II, and activation of transcription (Fig. 8). Increased beta cell Txnip expression, especially induced by high glucose, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic beta cell loss and diabetes. In this study, we have now identified ChREBP as the critical transcription factor, p300 as the co-activator/HAT, and H4 acetylation as the specific chromatin modification mediating this glucose-induced transcription of beta cell txnip. Glucose-regulated transcription has been shown to be often mediated by ChoREs consisting of a palindromic E-box repeat, such as CACGTG, present in the LPK-ChoRE (18Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 32Rufo C. Teran-Garcia M.

However, in the case of txnip, the ChoRE is not composed of a canonical E-box sequence but rather of two nonpalindromic (CACGAG) E-boxes or N-boxes. Nevertheless, this txnip-ChoRE was able to confer strong transactivation induced by ChREBP, as shown in our transfection experiments (Fig. 1), and appears to have a high affinity for ChREBP, as demonstrated by in vivo ChREBP binding in our ChIP experiments using INS-1 beta cells as well as human islets (Figs. 2, 3, and 7). Some ChREBP binding to the txnip promoter was even observed at low glucose, but upon stimulation with high glucose, ChREBP binding increased 3-fold, which was also associated with a 2-fold increase in Pol II occupancy. These results are consistent with the finding that ChREBP shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus occurs at both low and high glucose in beta cells but that high glucose leads to a 3-fold increase in the rate of its nuclear entry (33Davies M.N. O'Callaghan B.L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24029-24038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and results in the required dephosphorylation steps (34Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Glucose-induced ChREBP recruitment displayed a dose- and time-dependent pattern, and the very rapid increase of ChREBP binding to the txnip promoter observed within 15 min of exposure to high glucose (Fig. S1) further suggests a direct effect and is consistent with the known role of txnip as an early response gene and its rapid changes in expression (35Saitoh T. Tanaka S. Koike T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Other E-box-binding proteins, such as NeuroD, were not able to mimic the ChREBP effects (Fig. 1D), and although USF2 may be involved in general modulation of txnip transcription (data not shown), ChIP analysis failed to reveal any increase in USF2 recruitment to the txnip promoter in response to glucose, suggesting that USF2 is not mediating the glucose effects. This is consistent with previous finding in regard to the regulation of LPK in beta cells (20Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mlx, the heterodimeric ChREBP partner, also bound to the txnip promoter, and its binding activity was increased in response to high glucose (Fig. 3D). Mlx appears to be required for glucose-activated transcription, since overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Mlx in hepatocytes abolished glucose-induced txnip mRNA expression (36Ma L. Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12019-12027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, since Mlx is known to lack intrinsic transcriptional activity (37Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Coulter K.L. Logan J.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it might exert its function via stabilizing the binding of two ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers to the ChoRE (39Ma L. Sham Y.Y. Walters K.J. Towle H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In HA1ER cells, a cell line derived from normal human renal epithelium, MondoA, a paralog of ChREBP, has recently been reported to regulate glucose-stimulated txnip gene expression (40Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, as mentioned by the authors, this role of MondoA/Mlx seems to be tissue-specific and restricted to skeletal muscle and the particular cell lines used. In this regard, it is also surprising that the subcellular localization of MondoA was not regulated by glucose in either primary human skeletal muscle cells or in C2C12 myoblasts (41Sans C.L. Satterwhite D.J. Stoltzman C.A. Breen K.T. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, even important components of the core transcription machinery were recently found to be different in skeletal muscle as compared with other tissues (42Deato M.D. Marr M.T. Sottero T. Inouye C. Hu P. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Deato M.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2137-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which may help to explain some of these tissue-specific differences in the mechanisms mediating glucose-induced txnip expression. Indeed, overexpression of ChREBP, but not MondoA, rescued LPK luciferase reporter expression when a dominant-negative form of Mlx was expressed in primary hepatocytes, suggesting that ChREBP is the critical transcription factor in liver (36Ma L. Tsatsos N.G. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12019-12027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very recent study using transient reporter gene transfection also demonstrated that ChREBP regulates glucose-induced txnip transcription in human prostate carcinoma cells. In regard to pancreatic beta cells, our knockdown experiments using ChREBP small interfering RNA demonstrated that glucose-induced txnip transcription was completely abolished (Fig. 4), proving that ChREBP is essential for glucose-activated txnip transcription in beta cells. Together with our ChIP findings in INS-1 beta cells as well as human islets demonstrating for the first time in vivo binding of ChREBP to the txnip promoter, these results provide strong evidence for ChREBP/Mlx being the key regulatory complex of glucose-stimulated txnip gene expression in pancreatic beta cells. Although ChREBP has been studied extensively as a mediator of glucose-induced transcription of glycolytic and lipogenic genes, especially in the liver (18Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), our current results suggest that the effects of ChREBP may reach far beyond regulation of hepatic enzymes and also include control of prodiabetic Txnip and pancreatic beta cells as a major site of action. In this regard, our observation of ChREBP-p300 interaction is of particular interest (Fig. 7). The transcriptional co-activator p300 also functions as a HAT for H3/H4 and has been shown to interact with other E-box-binding proteins (21Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Breen G.A. Jordan E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Eckner R.

Lo S. Pan S. Zhang K. Lymar E. Farina A. Martinez E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10220-10234Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and to be involved in the regulation of glucose-regulated genes (21Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Ozcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Kaur H. Chen S. Xin X. Chiu J. Khan Z.A. Chakrabarti S. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3104-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Its interaction with ChREBP may therefore not only explain how ChREBP induces H4 acetylation and recruitment of Pol II to the txnip promoter but may also be key for the molecular understanding of the regulation of other ChREBP target genes and their potential chromatin modification and transactivation. The importance of chromatin modification as a powerful mechanism of transcriptional control has gained more recognition over recent years, and especially histone acetylation of H3 and/or H4 has been found to effectively open the chromatin structure, thereby enabling Pol II binding and transcriptional activation (44Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). The balance of histone acetylation/deacetylation is tightly regulated by a variety of HATs and HDACs. Interestingly, although glucose-induced LPK expression has been found to be associated with H4 as well as H3 acetylation (45Eckert D.T. Zhang P. Collier J.J. O'Doherty R.M. Scott D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the same was true for TSA-induced txnip expression (Fig. 5, B and C), our data indicate that glucose specifically induces H4 but not H3 acetylation of the txnip gene (Fig. 6). These findings suggests that glucose and HDAC inhibitors mediate their effects on txnip transcription at least in part by independent molecular pathways, which is consistent with their additive effects that we observed on txnip mRNA expression (Fig. 5A). Although TSA is obviously only an experimental stimulus, our findings of increased txnip expression in response to this HDAC inhibitor suggest that histone deacetylation by HDACs might play an important physiological role in the inhibition of txnip gene expression at low glucose. In summary, the results of the present study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms governing pancreatic beta cell txnip expression in particular and glucose-regulated gene transcription and chromatin modification in general. Since Txnip has emerged as a novel target for diabetes therapy, these findings are of special relevance and reveal new approaches to specifically inhibit glucose-induced txnip transcription. This may help to interrupt the vicious cycle of glucose inducing beta cell Txnip expression, resulting in beta cell apoptosis, worsening of the hyperglycemia, and diabetes progression.

https://openalex.org/W2009187320,"The proteasome is a protease that controls diverse processes in eukaryotic cells. Its regulatory particle (RP) initiates the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by unfolding the substrate and translocating it into the proteasome core particle (CP) to be degraded. The RP has 19 subunits, and their pathway of assembly is not understood. Here we show that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae three proteins are found associated with RP but not with the RP-CP holoenzyme: Nas6, Rpn14 and Hsm3. Mutations in the corresponding genes confer proteasome loss-of-function phenotypes, despite their virtual absence from the holoenzyme. These effects result from deficient RP assembly. Thus, Nas6, Rpn14 and Hsm3 are RP chaperones. The RP contains six ATPases-the Rpt proteins-and each RP chaperone binds to the carboxy-terminal domain of a specific Rpt. We show in an accompanying study that RP assembly is templated through the Rpt C termini, apparently by their insertion into binding pockets in the CP. Thus, RP chaperones may regulate proteasome assembly by directly restricting the accessibility of Rpt C termini to the CP. In addition, competition between the RP chaperones and the CP for Rpt engagement may explain the release of RP chaperones as proteasomes mature."
https://openalex.org/W2027505506,"Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited onto mRNAs during splicing, serve as positional landmarks for the intron exon structure of genes, and direct posttranscriptional processes in the cytoplasm. EJC removal and recycling by translation are ill understood and have been attributed to ribosomal passage. This work identifies the ribosome-associated protein PYM as an EJC disassembly factor and defines its mechanism of function. Whereas EJC assembly intermediates are resistant to PYM, fully assembled EJCs are dissociated from spliced mRNAs by PYM. This disassembly involves PYM binding to the EJC proteins MAGOH-Y14. PYM overexpression in cells disrupts EJC association with spliced mRNA and inhibits nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In cells depleted of PYM, EJCs accumulate on spliced mRNAs and EJC protein recycling is impaired. Hence, PYM is an EJC disassembly factor that acts both in vitro and in living cells, and that antagonizes important EJC functions."
https://openalex.org/W2014054765,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play important functions in neural development. NR2B is the predominant NR2 subunit of NMDAR in the developing brain. Here we use mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to knock out NR2B in isolated single cells and analyze its cell-autonomous function in dendrite development. NR2B mutant dentate gyrus granule cells (dGCs) and barrel cortex layer 4 spiny stellate cells (bSCs) have similar dendritic growth rates, total length, and branch number as control cells. However, mutant dGCs maintain supernumerary primary dendrites resulting from a pruning defect. Furthermore, while control bSCs restrict dendritic growth to a single barrel, mutant bSCs maintain dendritic growth in multiple barrels. Thus, NR2B functions cell autonomously to regulate dendrite patterning to ensure that sensory information is properly represented in the cortex. Our study also indicates that molecular mechanisms that regulate activity-dependent dendrite patterning can be separated from those that control general dendrite growth and branching."

https://openalex.org/W1982016364,"Key aspects of the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) remain unresolved despite decades of investigation. Alterations in postsynaptic glutamate receptors are believed to contribute to the expression of various forms of LTP and LTD, but the relative importance of presynaptic mechanisms is controversial. In addition, while aggregate synaptic input to a cell can undergo sequential and graded (incremental) LTP and LTD, it has been suggested that individual synapses may only support binary changes between initial and modified levels of strength. We have addressed these issues by combining electrophysiological methods with two-photon optical quantal analysis of plasticity at individual active (non-silent) Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices of hippocampus from adolescent rats. We find that these synapses sustain graded, bidirectional long-term plasticity. Remarkably, changes in potency are small and insignificant; long-term plasticity at these synapses is expressed overwhelmingly via presynaptic changes in reliability of transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2038359917,"The mechanisms that ensure an equal inheritance of cellular organelles during mitosis are an important area of study in cell biology. For the mitochondria fragment during mitosis, however, the cellular links that signal these changes are largely unknown. We recently identified a SUMO protease, SenP5, that deSUMOylates a number of mitochondrial targets, including the dynamin-related fission GTPase, DRP1. In interphase, SenP5 resides primarily within the nucleoli, in addition to a cytosolic pool. Here we report the relocalization of SenP5 from the nucleoli to the mitochondrial surface at G2/M transition prior to nuclear envelope breakdown. The recruitment of SenP5 results in a significant loss in mitochondrial SUMOylation, and a concomitant increase in the labile pool of DRP1 that drives mitochondrial fragmentation. Importantly, silencing of SenP5 leads to an arrest in the cell cycle precisely at the time when the protease is translocated to the mitochondria. These data indicate that transition of SenP5 to the mitochondria plays an important role in mitochondrial fragmentation during mitosis. The altered intracellular localization of SenP5 represents the first example of the mitochondrial recruitment of a SUMO protease and provides new insights into the mechanisms of interorganellar communication during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2107338383,"Substrates of the proteasome are recognized and unfolded by the regulatory particle, and then translocated into the core particle (CP) to be degraded. A hetero-hexameric ATPase ring, containing subunits Rpt1-6, is situated within the base subassembly of the regulatory particle. The ATPase ring sits atop the CP, with the Rpt carboxy termini inserted into pockets in the CP. Here we identify a previously unknown function of the Rpt proteins in proteasome biogenesis through deleting the C-terminal residue from each Rpt in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results indicate that assembly of the hexameric ATPase ring is templated on the CP. We have also identified an apparent intermediate in base assembly, BP1, which contains Rpn1, three Rpts and Hsm3, a chaperone for base assembly. The Rpt proteins with the strongest assembly phenotypes, Rpt4 and Rpt6, were absent from BP1. We propose that Rpt4 and Rpt6 form a nucleating complex to initiate base assembly, and that this complex is subsequently joined by BP1 to complete the Rpt ring. Our studies show that assembly of the proteasome base is a rapid yet highly orchestrated process."

However, the effects of stimulation on neuronal activity are highly variable and poorly understood. To investigate the basis of this variability, we performed extracellular recordings in the visual cortex following application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Our measurements of spiking and local field potential activity exhibit two types of response patterns which are characterized by the presence or absence of spontaneous discharge following stimulation. This variability can be partially explained by state-dependent effects, in which higher pre-TMS activity predicts larger post-TMS responses. These results reveal the possibility that variability in the neural response to TMS can be exploited to optimize the effects of stimulation. It is conceivable that this feature could be utilized in real time during the treatment of clinical disorders.

It is conceivable that this feature could be utilized in real time during the treatment of clinical disorders. There is an extensive history of attempts to alter brain function using external electrical stimulation (Fritsch and Hitzig, 1870Fritsch G. Hitzig E. Ueber die elektrishe Erregarkeit des Grosshirns. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1870Google Scholar, Kringelbach et al., 2007Kringelbach M.L. Jenkinson N. Owen S.L. Aziz T.Z. Translational principles of deep brain stimulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A primary focus of this work has been to establish neural modifications that relieve specific clinical disorders. Conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or depression, which often appear resistant to pharmacological intervention, have shown major improvement after treatment with invasive electrical stimulation techniques (Kringelbach et al., 2007Kringelbach M.L.

However, the effectiveness of TMS in therapeutic applications is not clear, and this emphasizes the need for a basic understanding of TMS mechanisms (Burt et al., 2002Burt T. Lisanby S.H.

The major challenge facing the therapeutic use of TMS, or any brain stimulation technique, is the difficulty in predicting how underlying neural circuits will be altered by the application of electrical fields. This problem is inherently complex, as the cumulative effect of stimulation depends on numerous factors. These may include: the structure of the targeted neural circuit, the profile of neural activity during application, the responses of different cell classes (e.g., excitatory versus inhibitory; projecting versus local neurons), the resulting biochemical or structural modifications of synaptic connections, and the possible alterations of neuromodulatory inputs. Combined with these biological factors are also a number of flexible stimulation parameters, such as duration, frequency, intensity, and electric field orientation. Each of these variables has been found previously to alter the outcome of TMS application (Berardelli et al., 1998Berardelli A. Inghilleri M. Rothwell J.C. Romeo S. Curra A. Gilio F. Modugno N. Manfredi M. Facilitation of muscle evoked responses after repetitive cortical stimulation in man.Exp. Brain Res. 1998; 122: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 1997Chen R.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 15: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Given the dependence of the effects of TMS on physiological state, brain region, and stimulation paradigms, it is difficult to identify general principles by which brain stimulation affects neural function. It is not surprising, therefore, that the literature in this field contains some contradictory and potentially confusing findings. For example, identical stimulation parameters can result in neuronal activation, suppression, or both, depending on the brain region (Paus, 2005Paus T. Inferring causality in brain images: a perturbation approach.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, substantial intersubject variation has been noted both within healthy populations (Cahn et al., 2003Cahn S.D. Herzog A.G. Pascual-Leone A. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation: effects of hemispheric laterality, gender, and handedness in normal controls.J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 20: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and with respect to patient populations (Brighina et al., 2002Brighina F. Piazza A. Daniele O. Fierro B. Modulation of visual cortical excitability in migraine with aura: effects of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.Exp. Brain Res. 2002; 145: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even within the same individual, the effects of TMS appear to depend on the initial cortical activation state (for a review, see Silvanto and Muggleton, 2008Silvanto J. Muggleton N.G. New light through old windows: moving beyond the “virtual lesion” approach to transcranial magnetic stimulation.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In these latter experiments, TMS produces different perceptual or behavioral outcomes that may depend on the excitability levels of specific neuronal populations (Silvanto and Muggleton, 2008Silvanto J. Muggleton N.G.

The apparent subtlety and complexity of the physiological effects of TMS necessitate empirical investigation in order to understand the stimulation-induced neural activity patterns. The shortage of available neural data describing the effects of TMS (e.g., see Allen et al., 2007Allen E.A. Pasley B.N. Duong T. Freeman R.D.

Physiol. 2005; 566: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), coupled with a potentially broad use of TMS, motivates the investigation we describe here. We have conducted neurophysiological recordings of spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the visual cortex of anesthetized cats before, during, and after TMS application. A well-controlled study of TMS in an appropriate animal model is a necessary first step toward a basic understanding. In a previous report, we described primary neural responses to short TMS pulse trains and their relation to hemodynamic signals (Allen et al., 2007Allen E.A. Pasley B.N. Duong T. Freeman R.D. Transcranial magnetic stimulation elicits coupled neural and hemodynamic consequences.Science. 2007; 317: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the current study, we undertake an extensive analysis to provide insight into the effects of TMS on single-neuron and population activity. We describe the variability of responses to TMS and find evidence for two qualitatively different response patterns which are characterized by the presence or lack of spontaneous discharge following stimulation. A portion of this variability can be explained by state-dependent effects, in which the post-TMS response depends on pre-TMS activity levels. We recorded single-unit and LFP responses at 47 sites in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat (n = 5 animals). Single units were classified as simple (n = 17) or complex (n = 30), using the ratio of the first harmonic to the average firing rate (Skottun et al., 1991Skottun B.C. De Valois R.L. Grosof D.H. Movshon J.A. Albrecht D.G. Bonds A.B. Classifying simple and complex cells on the basis of response modulation.Vision Res. 1991; 31: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Recordings were made with either posterior or superior positioning of a figure-eight TMS coil (Figure 1A). We find no significant differences in the neural responses to TMS between electrode-coil configurations of simple and complex cell classes (rank-sum test, p > 0.2 for all comparisons), and therefore the data are pooled for all analyses. Each trial in our experimental paradigm (Figure 1B) consisted of a baseline period (40 s), application of a short TMS pulse train, and a post-TMS recovery period lasting from 5 to 15 min. TMS stimulation parameters were varied in frequency (1–8 Hz) and duration (1–4 s) on separate trials, with constant intensity at 100% stimulator output. Throughout each trial, a visual stimulus optimized to drive the cell was presented repeatedly for 2 s at 8 s intervals. As reported previously (Allen et al., 2007Allen E.A. Pasley B.N. Duong T. Freeman R.D. Transcranial magnetic stimulation elicits coupled neural and hemodynamic consequences.Science. 2007; 317: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we observe two primary effects of TMS. These include a transient elevation of spontaneous activity immediately following TMS, and a prolonged reduction in visually evoked activity that lasts for several minutes (Figure 1C). These different response components are seen clearly when the activity levels during and between presentations of visual stimuli are separated into evoked and spontaneous firing rates, respectively (Figure 1D). Additional experiments without interleaved visual stimuli showed comparable effects of TMS on spontaneous activity (see Figure S1 available online). We analyzed the trial-by-trial variability of two TMS response components. The “spontaneous component” reflects the response to TMS itself. The “evoked component” reflects the effect of TMS on stimulus processing. Although the effects of TMS on these components are generally robust, we have observed considerable variability across both cells and trials. Figure 2 shows peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for four representative cells (A–D), each tested in two separate trials. These data represent the full range of response patterns we have observed and suggest an interesting distinction between TMS response components: variability across trials appears greater for spontaneous compared to visually evoked responses. To quantify the variability of response components, we examined the relative standard deviation (RSD) of changes in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity in the first minute following TMS. This variability measure is similar to the Fano factor (Stevens and Zador, 1998Stevens C.F. Zador A.M. Input synchrony and the irregular firing of cortical neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and accounts for differences in response amplitude by normalization of the standard deviation by the mean response (see Experimental Procedures). The RSD was calculated over trials with identical stimulation parameters at a given site (n = 23 sets of trials). Trial-to-trial variability in the spontaneous response (median RSD = 1.71) is significantly greater than that of the evoked (median RSD = 0.62, Wilcoxon signed-rank test paired by trial, p < 0.0005). We also compared the median RSD for trials within cells to the median RSD for equivalent trials across cells (see Experimental Procedures). For the evoked response, trial variability is significantly greater across cells than within the same cell (permutation test, p < 0.01). The same is not true for the spontaneous response component (permutation test, p = 0.51). These results indicate not only greater trial-to-trial variability in spontaneous activity but also a lack of evidence for a characteristic spontaneous response to TMS that could distinguish one cell from another. Differences between spontaneous and evoked components are further evident when we examine trends in TMS responses over time. Throughout experiments, we observed that cells appeared more likely to exhibit spontaneous discharge on earlier trials. An example of this trend is shown in Figure 3A, which displays the PSTHs of seven consecutive trials from a single unit. Pronounced spontaneous spiking is evident in trials 1–4, but is considerably reduced or absent in trials 5–7 (Figures 3A and 3B). Analyzing all trials (grouped by cell and stimulation parameters), we find a weak, though significant, negative correlation between trial order and the magnitude of post-TMS spontaneous spiking (Figure 3C; r = 0.26, p < 0.01, t test). No similar relationship is found for evoked responses (r = 0.07, p = 0.46). A significant difference between spontaneous and evoked response trends (p < 0.01, one-tailed z test after Fisher's transformation) argues against a simple decrease in TMS efficacy over time. Instead, these results suggest the presence of long-term or cumulative effects of TMS, which appear unique to spontaneous responses. The source of this long-term effect remains to be determined, but there is a suggestion of a sensitivity of the spontaneous response to baseline network properties (see below). The observation of seemingly all-or-none spontaneous responses motivated the division of trials into two qualitatively different groups, which we characterized as bursting (B) or nonbursting (NB). Trials in which the spontaneous firing rate in the first minute exceeded the baseline rate by two or more standard deviations were classified as B (n = 60/161). Trials showing a decrease or no change were classified as NB (n = 56/161). The remaining 45 trials exhibited an intermediate response (i.e., an increase of less than two standard deviations) and were not included in either group. Both B and NB trial types are observed in all animals and at virtually every recording site (100% when considering sites with at least four trials). There are no significant differences with regard to the proportion of trials at specific stimulation frequencies or durations (χ2 test, p = 0.83 and p = 0.77, respectively). Additionally, simple and complex cell classes exhibit similar proportions of B and NB trials (χ2 test, p = 0.71). Thus, the division of trials reflects the presence of distinct response patterns across trials, rather than across stimulation parameters or cells. To characterize the different responses of B and NB trials, we first examined the distributions of interspike intervals (ISIs) in each group. Figure 4 displays the logarithmic ISI histograms of spontaneous spikes for B (left) and NB (right) trials. The histograms of both response types are bimodal, with distinct peaks at short and long ISIs, a pattern frequently observed for cortical neurons (e.g., Reich et al., 2000Reich D.S. Mechler F. Purpura K.P. Victor J.D. Interspike intervals, receptive fields, and information encoding in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1964-1974PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to TMS (Figure 4A, top), the ISI peaks of B and NB trials are similarly located at roughly 3 and 200 ms (determined by fitting a mixture of Gaussians). Following TMS (Figure 4A, middle), the short ISI peak is unchanged for both trial types. ISIs of this length may reflect the small refractory period between action potentials (Izhikevich, 2006Izhikevich E.M. Bursting.Scholarpedia. 2006; 1: 1300Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that TMS does not alter this intrinsic cellular property. In contrast, TMS produces a substantial leftward shift in the long ISI peak of B trials, whereas the NB ISI distribution remains relatively unaltered. This shift is most prominent in the first 30 s post-TMS and there is a gradual recovery to baseline over 1–2 min (Figure 4B). The spontaneous discharge induced by TMS, therefore, appears to occur primarily at intervals of 20–40 ms, or 25–50 Hz. This frequency range corresponds to gamma band rhythms and is believed to involve activation of local sensory microcircuits, rather than a single cell (Liu and Newsome, 2006Liu J. Newsome W.T. Local field potential in cortical area MT: stimulus tuning and behavioral correlations.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7779-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Siegel and Konig, 2003Siegel M. Konig P. A functional gamma-band defined by stimulus-dependent synchronization in area 18 of awake behaving cats.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4251-4260PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the disruption of spike intervals appears limited to spontaneous activity, as the ISI distributions of evoked spiking were relatively unaffected (see Figure S2). Differential responses of B and NB groups are also evident in the average time courses (Figure 5). By definition, B trials exhibit a large increase in spontaneous spiking, whereas NB trials show a small though significant and long-lasting reduction (Figures 5A and 5B). A similar response pattern for LFP power is evident in higher-frequency bands (∼30–150 Hz), where TMS induces an increase in B trials and a prolonged decrease in NB trials (Figures 5C and 5D). The similarity of LFP and spiking response patterns may appear trivial given the typically close association of these signals (Heeger and Ress, 2002Heeger D.J. Ress D. What does fMRI tell us about neuronal activity?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that LFPs were classified based on single-unit spiking recorded at the same site. Because LFPs presumably reflect the aggregate activity of cells near the electrode tip (Logothetis et al., 2007Logothetis N.K. Kayser C. Oeltermann A. In vivo measurement of cortical impedance spectrum in monkeys: implications for signal propagation.Neuron. 2007; 55: 809-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100PubMed Google Scholar), the differences in high-frequency LFP power suggest that neuronal responses to TMS can be relatively homogeneous within a local area (see also Spatial Correlation and Coherence section). In the lower-frequency LFP bands, B and NB responses are quite similar. Both groups show strong decreases in power that persist for longer than 5 min after TMS application (Figure 5D, bottom rows). The distinction between responses in the low and high frequencies may be related to the different functional roles attributed to specific brain rhythms (Belitski et al., 2008Belitski A. Gretton A. Magri C. Murayama Y. Montemurro M.A. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Low-frequency local field potentials and spikes in primary visual cortex convey independent visual information.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5696-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Logothetis, 2008Logothetis N.K. What we can do and what we cannot do with fMRI.Nature. 2008; 453: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). For example, theta band activity is hypothesized to coordinate activity across distant cortical areas (Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E. Dalal S.S. Soltani M. Nagarajan S.S. Kirsch H.E. Berger M.S. Barbaro N.M. Knight R.T. High gamma power is phase-locked to theta oscillations in human neocortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), whereas gamma activity is thought to represent the synchronous processing of local neurons (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W. Dynamic predictions: oscillations and synchrony in top-down processing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar, Liu and Newsome, 2006Liu J. Newsome W.T. Local field potential in cortical area MT: stimulus tuning and behavioral correlations.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7779-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We next examined differences in evoked responses between B and NB groups. One might expect the presence or absence of strong spontaneous discharge to affect TMS-induced changes in stimulus-evoked activity. For example, strong discharge could fatigue the cells, resulting in a more pronounced reduction in evoked responses. Conversely, spontaneous discharge could signify strong activation of a local neural circuit which might facilitate evoked activity and produce a more moderate decrease, or even increase, in the stimulus-evoked response. The average time courses of evoked spiking, however, support neither of these scenarios. As shown in Figure 5E, the single-unit responses of B and NB trials are essentially identical. The effect of TMS on evoked LFPs is largely similar to that for spikes, in that both B and NB groups show decreases in power across nearly all frequencies (Figures 5G and 5H). The similar time courses of evoked activity for B and NB trials (Figures 5E–5H) contrast sharply with the dissimilar response pattern for spontaneous activity (Figures 5A–5D). It therefore appears that spontaneous and evoked response components are not inherently interrelated. The lack of correlation between changes in spontaneous and evoked spiking also supports this notion (r = 0.042, p > 0.5, t test, n = 161 trials). Thus far, we have characterized the substantial variability of TMS-induced neural responses. We now investigate possible factors that may explain this variability. An intriguing possibility is that the effect of TMS in some way depends on the initial physiological state of the cortex. Numerous studies have noted robust differences when applying TMS during distinct brain states, for example during different levels of visual stimulation (Silvanto et al., 2007Silvanto J. Muggleton N.G. Cowey A. Walsh V. Neural adaptation reveals state-dependent effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or spatial attention (Bestmann et al., 2007Bestmann S. Ruff C.C. Blakemore C. Driver J. Thilo K.V. Spatial attention changes excitability of human visual cortex to direct stimulation.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 134-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have examined whether natural fluctuations in cortical activity could yield similar results by analyzing post-TMS responses as a function of pre-TMS activity levels. In these analyses, we use a partial correlation approach (see Experimental Procedures) which controls for the possible influence of additional factors. These factors include the mean amplitude of pre-TMS spontaneous activity, TMS stimulation parameters, and trial number. Therefore, reported correlations are those that remain after these factors have been linearly regressed from both pre- and post-TMS variables. One possible metric of cortical activity state is the responsiveness of cells to visual stimulation. We examined the distributions of pre-TMS evoked spiking responses for B and NB groups (Figure 6A). Although the distributions are broad and overlap considerably, trials classified as B are slightly more responsive to visual stimuli compared to those classified as NB. This difference is small, but significant (B: 35 ± 19 spikes/s, NB: 28 ± 17 spikes/s, mean ± SD; p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A regression analysis including all trials (n = 161) indicates the same relationship: pre-TMS evoked spiking is positively correlated with TMS-induced spontaneous spiking (Figure 6B; r = 0.30, p < 0.0001). To examine visual responsiveness at the population level, we performed a similar regression analysis using pre-TMS stimulus-evoked LFPs. As shown in Figure 6C, the magnitude of pre-TMS evoked high gamma power, relative to the spontaneous power in the same band, is significantly correlated with post-TMS spontaneous firing rate (r = 0.30, p < 0.0005, t test). Although a positive correlation is also observed for gamma band power, the lower-frequency bands instead exhibit negative correlations (Figure 6D). This finding is consistent with previous studies showing a suppression of low-frequency power during stimulus presentation and a general anticorrelation of power between lower and higher bands (Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H. Rorie A.E. Desimone R. Modulation of oscillatory neuronal synchronization by selective visual attention.Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, Liu and Newsome, 2006Liu J. Newsome W.T.

Ebisch B. Schmidt K.E. Niessing M. Singer W. Galuske R.A. Hemodynamic signals correlate tightly with synchronized gamma oscillations.Science. 2005; 309: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that strong cortical responsiveness to visual stimuli increases the likelihood of spontaneous discharge following TMS. A second possible metric of cortical activity state is the level of spontaneous, or ongoing, activity. Theoretically, both the baseline spontaneous spike rate and the baseline spontaneous LFP power can be used to independently assess cortical activity state. However, because cortical spontaneous spike rates are typically low (1.4 ± 1.8 spikes/s in this sample), they are not well suited for a correlation analysis. Thus, we focus our analysis on the relative LFP power during the pre-TMS period (see Experimental Procedures). The mean spontaneous LFP power spectra for B and NB groups are shown in Figure 6E. In this analysis, LFP trials were classified as NB or B using either post-TMS spontaneous spikes or post-TMS spontaneous LFP power. In both cases, trials were classified as B if TMS induced an increase of at least two standard deviations above baseline spontaneous activity, and as NB if there were a decrease or no change. Regardless of the classification scheme, B trials are associated with greater power in the high gamma band of pre-TMS spontaneous LFPs compared to NB trials (p < 0.05 for spik"

However, most P-type ATPases pump small cations or metal ions, and atomic structures revealed a transport mechanism that is conserved throughout the family. Hence, a challenging problem is to understand how this mechanism is adapted in P<sub>4</sub>-ATPases to flip phospholipids. P<sub>4</sub>-ATPases form heteromeric complexes with Cdc50 proteins. The primary role of these additional polypeptides is unknown. Here, we show that the affinity of yeast P<sub>4</sub>-ATPase Drs2p for its Cdc50-binding partner fluctuates during the transport cycle, with the strongest interaction occurring at a point where the enzyme is loaded with phospholipid ligand. We also find that specific interactions with Cdc50p are required to render the ATPase competent for phosphorylation at the catalytically important aspartate residue. Our data indicate that Cdc50 proteins are integral components of the P<sub>4</sub>-ATPase transport machinery. Thus, acquisition of these subunits may have been a crucial step in the evolution of flippases from a family of cation pumps."

Hsp27 was triply phosphorylated by MAPKAP-2 kinase, and phosphorylation was tracked by urea-PAGE. An increasing degree of suppression of insulin or α-lactalbumin aggregation correlated with a decreasing Hsp27 self-association, which was the least for phosphorylated Hsp27 followed by the mimic followed by the unphosphorylated protein. It was also found that Hsp27 added to pre-aggregated insulin did not reverse aggregation but did inhibit these aggregates from assembling into even larger aggregates. This chaperone activity appears to be independent of Hsp27 phosphorylation.

Small heat shock proteins, including Hsp27, behave as ATP-independent molecular chaperones during cellular heat shock. They bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation until the proteins can be refolded by larger ATP-dependent chaperones or are digested (7.Arrigo A.P. Simon S. Gibert B.

It is not entirely clear what the role of Hsp27 size and phosphorylation state plays in its heat shock function because there are conflicting results in the literature. Some in vitro studies concluded that the unphosphorylated oligomeric Hsp27 (or the murine isoform Hsp25) protects proteins against aggregation better than does the phosphorylation mimic (13.Rogalla T.

In-cell studies found that phosphorylation of Hsp27 was essential for thermo-protection of actin filaments (32.Geum D. Son G.H. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19913-19921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the Hsp27 phosphorylation mimic decreased inclusion body formation better than did unphosphorylated Hsp27 (33.Chiou Y.W. Hwu W.L. Lee Y.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1782: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular chaperone function of Hsp27 by correlating chaperone activity with Hsp27 size and by comparing fully phosphorylated Hsp27 with its phospho-mimic. Hsp27 and its S15D/S78D/S82D phospho-mimic mutant were expressed and purified using the New England Biolabs IMPACT-CN (Intein-Mediated Purification with an Affinity Chitin-binding Tag) system. The details of this system are described in the manual from New England Biolabs. A brief description follows. The Hsp27 template DNA is cloned into the pTYB11 plasmid from New England Biolabs, using the SapI site and EcoRI cloning site. The SapI site places the Hsp27 template directly adjacent to the intein template on the plasmid. The Hsp27 is then expressed fused to the intein in BL21 cells induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The intein tag is a 454-amino acid residue sequence from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA1 gene. It contains a chitin binding domain and is self-cleavable using the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Purification is done by running the cell lysate over a chitin bead column, binding the intein to the column, and then cleaving the intein from Hsp27 using DTT, thereby releasing the Hsp27 from the column. The pTYB11 plasmid allows the Hsp27 and intein to be directly adjacent, at the N terminus of Hsp27, so that after cleavage the Hsp27 does not contain any extra residues. The proteolytic inhibitor PMSF was included from the point of bacterial cell lysis throughout the remainder of the preparation and during storage of the protein. Without PMSF, Hsp27 became slowly digested to a product that ran slightly faster than full-length Hsp27 on SDS-PAGE. Hsp27 concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, after subtracting the density at 320 mm, using an extinction coefficient of A280 nm0.1% = 1.65. Hsp27 has a single Cys at position 137 that is in the dimer interface (9.Mchaourab H.S. Berengian A.R. Koteiche H.A.

Hsp27-3D was disulfide cross-linked by air oxidation by dialyzing versus a buffer in the absence of metal ion chelators, i.e. in 2 mm Mops, 0.01% NaN3, 50 μm PMSF, pH 7.5, for 4–7 days at 4 °C. This is essentially the method reported (35.Zavialov A. Benndorf R. Ehrnsperger M. Zav'yalov V. Dudich I. Buchner J. Gaestel M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36.Zavialov A.V. Gaestel M. Korpela T. Zav'yalov V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hsp27 was phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with MAPKAP kinase-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (38.Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-940PubMed Google Scholar). In the reaction mixture the concentration of Hsp27 was 4 μm and that of the kinase was 1.7 ng/ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 5 h and then at room temperature for an additional 18 h. Aliquots were removed periodically and run on 10% (polyacrylamide) urea-PAGE according to the literature (39.Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In the preparation of large batches of phosphorylated protein, the kinase/Hsp27 ratio was reduced, to conserve the kinase, and the incubation time was increased for complete phosphorylation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA), using either an An60 Ti four-hole rotor or an An50 Ti eight-hole rotor. Data were acquired with the interference optics system using sapphire cell windows. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the cell assembly was enhanced by using double-sector, meniscus-matching, 12-mm, aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces and interference slit window holders on the top window (Biomolecular Interaction Technologies Center, Durham, NH). Samples were subjected to overnight dialysis in the appropriate buffer and then spun at 6,000 rpm for 5 min to match the menisci. After this step, the rotor was removed, shaken, and placed back in the chamber to allow for the temperature to equilibrate for at least 1 h. Velocity experiments were conducted at 50,000 rpm at 20 or 37 °C. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed by using the program SEDANAL (40.Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) to test for interacting models. A curve was deemed acceptable only if the standard deviation was less than or equal to the previously measured optical noise of the system (1 × 10−2 fringes). The program SEDFIT (41.Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the least squares sedimentation coefficient distribution (ls-g(s)) and the weight average sedimentation coefficient from this distribution. The program SEDNTERP (42.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Sciences.

Bovine insulin (Sigma) or bovine calcium-depleted α-lactalbumin (Sigma) aggregation was initiated by chemical reduction with DTT and was followed by light scattering in a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorometer using an excitation and emission wavelength of 465 nm. Temperature was controlled with a Varian Peltier device. Activity for insulin was measured at 37 °C in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.5 (43.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Activity for α-lactalbumin was measured at 37 °C in 0.125 m NaCl, 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0 (27.Panasenko O.O. Seit Nebi A. Bukach O.V. Marston S.B. Gusev N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Measurements were made in the absence and presence of Hsp27 at various ratios of insulin or α-lactalbumin to Hsp27. All components of the mixture, except DTT, were combined in fluorescence cells and incubated in the spectrofluorometer at 37 °C for about 30 min, whereupon the DTT was added, and the light scattering followed as a function of time. Because urea-PAGE is used to detect the phosphorylated states of proteins (39.Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 44.Pal B.K.

Mudalige W.A. Jackman D.M. Dobbin A.D. Heeley D.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2008; 29: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we tried the same technique to identify the phosphorylated states of Hsp27. Fig. 1 is urea-PAGE of the time course of the in vitro MAPKAP-2 phosphorylation of Hsp27, which is reported to take place at Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82 (20.Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The single band of the unphosphorylated species develops with time into four equally spaced bands and finally becomes only the fastest moving band of the four (3P). On SDS-PAGE (data not shown), samples at these time points ran as a single band with the same migration. These results are consistent with the four bands representing the unphosphorylated, singly, doubly, and triply phosphosphorylated (3P) species in order of increasing gel migration. The equal separation of the bands attests to the addition of one equally charged phosphate group per band. The single SDS-PAGE band for all stages of phosphorylation indicates that the faster migrating urea-PAGE bands are not because of proteolysis. Phosphorylated Hsp27 such that it migrated as the single 3P band on urea-PAGE was used as phosphorylated Hsp27 in subsequent experiments. The phosphorylation of Hsp27 is usually followed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (22.Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For unphosphorylated Hsp27 (Hsp27-wt), data acquired at 37 °C in physiological buffer and corrected to s20,w resulted in a sedimentation coefficient value close to 20 S (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the 20 S material represented a limiting size, peak s20,w values in Fig. 2A were extrapolated to infinite concentration by plotting 1/s20,w versus 1/c. The extrapolated value was 20 S to within the uncertainty of the measurements. This value is consistent with a spherical 22-mer (including 0.3 g of water/g of protein) and represents the minimum size (because of the assumption of spherical shape) of the largest oligomer, i.e. at infinite concentration, observable under these conditions. Because the sedimentation value of Hsp27-wt at the highest concentration studied (Fig. 2A) is close to the infinite concentration value, then at this concentration Hsp27-wt is an oligomeric distribution centered around a minimum size of a 22-mer. This size is consistent with a previous analytical ultracentrifugation study (19.Lelj-Garolla B. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On a priori grounds we would have expected the higher s20,w peak to be narrower than the lower s20,w value peak (Fig. 2, B and C) if the self-association were a simple two species equilibrium. Contrary to expectations, the higher s20,w peak is broader than the lower s20,w value peak, making it likely that there is a distribution of large oligomers of different sizes and/or shapes. This polydispersity is consistent with cryo-electron microscopy (17.Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. Mchaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and gel filtration studies (12.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of Hsp27 (Hsp27-3P) results in the appearance of a much smaller species at an s20,w value of about 2.5 S in addition to the larger oligomer with the proportion of the smaller species increasing with decreasing concentration (Fig. 2C). The size distribution of the S15D/S78D/S82D phospho-mimic mutant (Hsp27-3D) is between Hsp27-wt and Hsp27-3P (Fig. 2B). The species present are in dynamic equilibrium as evidenced by the shift from larger to smaller species upon dilution. It is also clear that there are few intermediate species present between the high molecular weight oligomer distribution and the much smaller dissociated species, especially for Hsp27-wt and Hsp27-3D. To help characterize the size of the small phosphorylated species, we attempted to produce a solution of Hsp27 that was monodisperse. After surveying a number of buffer conditions, we found that Hsp27-3D formed a monodisperse sedimentation profile with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of about 2.6 S in the absence of added salt at 20 °C (Fig. 3). At this low salt condition (<1 mm ionic strength), the boundaries formed by Hsp27-3D did not shift with concentration (Fig. 3), and they fit to a single species of a molecular mass of 40,000 Da using SEDANAL. Because the molecular mass of Hsp27 is 23 kDa, this species is consistent with a tight dimer. Strong support for this assignment comes from the sedimentation velocity of intermolecularly disulfide cross-linked Hsp27-3D. Cross-linked Hsp27-3D sediments in this low salt buffer with an s20,w value of close to 2.6 S (Fig. 3), providing further proof that the former is a dimer. Phosphorylated Hsp27 under these conditions is mostly dimer but, unlike the phospho-mimic, shows some indication of dissociation because its profile is shifted to somewhat lower s values upon dilution (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity of fully phosphorylated Hsp27 (Hsp27-3P) at 20 °C in the absence of salt in 2 mm Tris, 0. 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, 50 μm PMSF, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The concentration-normalized sedimentation distribution function (y axis) is plotted versus the apparent sedimentation coefficient (x axis).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the s value for the small Hsp27 species under more physiological conditions and to compare the size of the different forms of Hsp27, we plotted the weight average of the sedimentation coefficient (〈s20,w〉) as a function of Hsp27 concentration under such conditions (Fig. 5). 〈s20,w〉 was calculated by integrating the ls-g(s) curves (see Fig. 2) as a function of concentration for Hsp27-wt, -3D, and -3P. For unphosphorylated Hsp27, 〈s20,w〉 changes very little over the entire concentration range, indicating no appreciable dissociation of the large oligomers even at very low concentrations. For the phospho-mimic, 〈s20,w〉 is considerably less than that of Hsp27-wt at the high concentration end and then slowly decreases further with dilution. For phosphorylated Hsp27, 〈s20,w〉 is smaller yet than that of the phospho-mimic, and both reach an 〈s20,w〉 value of 2.5 S at the lowest concentrations studied. This is the value for the dimer that we have determined above, demonstrating that the dimer is the smallest species present for phosphorylated Hsp27 and its phospho-mimic under physiological conditions. The average size of phosphorylated Hsp27 is smaller than that of the phospho-mimic at all concentrations studied above about 0.03 mg/ml (Fig. 5). From the value of 2.5 S, the dimer axial ratio was estimated (42.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Sciences. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) to be 11:1 using a hydration of 0.4 g of water/g of protein calculated from the amino acid composition. This indicates that the dimer sediments as an elongated molecule because an Hsp27 dimer of two spherical structures would have a much smaller axial ratio of 2:1. The fact that 〈s20,w〉 increases as a function of increasing Hsp27-3D concentration (Fig. 5) indicates a dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and oligomer species. In contrast, a previous analytical ultracentrifugation study (19.Lelj-Garolla B. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) found that, under similar buffer conditions, 〈s20,w〉 for Hsp27-3D remained constant at about 2.6 S from 0 to 0.6 mg/ml, indicating that the dimer does not self-associate to form oligomer. The reason for this difference is not apparent. They also concluded, from modeling, that this value of about 2.6 S was a weight average value from a monomer ⇌ dimer equilibrium mixture, and we determined that the 2.5–2.6 S species was a dimer without any significant monomer present. The molecular chaperone activity of small heat shock proteins is often evaluated by DTT reduction of insulin (43.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Reduction breaks the disulfide bonds holding together insulin chain A and chain B whereupon chain B aggregates (48.Sanger F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone activity of Hsp27-3P was compared with Hsp27-wt and Hsp27-3D during the DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. Experiments in Fig. 6 were performed at an insulin concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (43.6 μm) and in the absence and presence of Hsp27 at insulin/Hsp27 monomer molar ratios of 164:1, 82:1, and 41:1. It is clear that all three forms of Hsp27 protect against aggregation with Hsp27-3D and Hsp27-3P protecting roughly equally but much better than Hsp27-wt. In fact, at an insulin/Hsp27 monomer molar ratio of 41:1, insulin plus DTT showed no increase in turbidity in the presence of Hsp27-3D and Hsp27-3P, although there was a substantial increase in the presence of the same amount of Hsp27-wt. In all cases there appears to be a lag before the onset of turbidity (Fig. 6), consistent with a slow nucleation phase followed by a rapid aggregation phase. At the Hsp27 concentrations used in Fig. 6 (≤0.025 mg/ml), it is clear from the centrifugation experiments (Fig. 5) that Hsp27-3D and Hsp27-3P are completely dissociated to dimers, whereas the Hsp27-wt is assembled in oligomeric structures. This indicates that the dimeric form of Hsp27 is the most active chaperone species for insulin, thus explaining the equal protection afforded by Hsp27-3P and Hsp27-3D at these low concentrations. To test this hypothesis further, insulin aggregation experiments were performed at a higher Hsp27 concentration (about 0.17 mg/ml) where there is a relative increase in oligomeric species at the expense of dimer for both Hsp27-3P and Hsp27-3D with Hsp27-3P containing a higher proportion of dimer and less oligomer than Hsp27-3D (Fig. 5). The effectiveness of this higher Hsp27 concentration in inhibiting insulin aggregation was compared for Hsp27-wt, Hsp27-3D, and Hsp27-3P at an insulin/Hsp27 monomer molar ratio of 14.4:1 (Fig. 7). The relative turbidity inhibition by Hsp27 inversely correlates with the Hsp27 size, i.e. the smallest, Hsp27-3P, inhibits better than the larger Hsp27-3D, which inhibits better than the largest, Hsp27-wt. Thus the experiments at both relatively low (Fig. 6) and high (Fig. 7) concentrations support the hypothesis that the smaller the Hsp27 species the better is its molecular chaperone activity, with respect to insulin aggregation. This conclusion is consistent with the model suggesting that for small heat shock proteins the oligomer is a storage state for the more chaperone-competent smaller subunits (31.Shashidharamurthy R. Koteiche H.A. Dong J. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5281-5289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). That Hsp27-3P is less effective in suppressing insulin aggregation at these higher concentrations is most likely because of the increased relative amount of Hsp27-3P oligomer compared with dimer. The experiment in Fig. 7 not only illustrates the role of size in the Hsp27 chaperone function, it also clearly demonstrates that the Hsp27-3D mutant only partially mimics the chaperone activity of phosphorylated Hsp27. We cannot entirely rule out that, in addition to its effect on Hsp27 size, phosphorylation plays some other specific role in the Hsp27 chaperone function. α-Lactalbumin similarly aggregates upon reduction of its intramolecular disulfide bonds with DTT (49.Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 demonstrates that Hsp27-3P limits α-lactalbumin aggregation better than does Hsp27-3D, which is slightly better than Hsp27-wt. These findings show again, with a protein other than insulin, that phosphorylated Hsp27 is a more effective molecular chaperone than is the unphosphorylated protein or the phospho-mimic. Phosphorylated Hsp27 was highly effective in inhibiting the aggregation of insulin at relatively low insulin and Hsp27 concentrations (Fig. 6) where Hsp27-3P was exclusively dimer. At a ratio of 1 Hsp27 monomer per 41 insulin molecules, the aggregation was completely inhibited. It would appear unlikely that about 40 individual chains of insulin are simultaneously bound to each Hsp27 molecule, considering that this is equivalent to an insulin/Hsp27-3P mass ratio of about 6:1 (assuming Hsp27-3P binds only insulin B chains). However, two hypothetical models might account for this potent activity. One mechanism is based on the postulate that, in general, protein aggregation passes through a slow nucleation step before rapid aggregation (50.Roberts C.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 98: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 51.Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Insulin aggregation proceeding via insulin nucleation is consistent with the observed lag phase before aggregation (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Thus we propose that Hsp27-3P sequesters multimeric insulin nuclei that precede aggregation, thereby associating with many unfolded insulin molecules without binding to each individually. That the Hsp27 dimer is an elongated molecule further contributes to maximize insulin binding. Another possibility, which may act together with or instead of the nucleation model, is that Hsp27-3P could change the conformation of bound unfolded insulin. This changed state of unfolded insulin would be aggregation-incompetent and remain as such for some time after dissociation from Hsp27 before it reverted back to the aggregation-competent structure. At the present time there are insufficient data to provide further support for either of these models. To know if Hsp27 can reverse protein aggregation, we added Hsp27-3P to DTT-aggregated insulin at an insulin/Hsp27-3P monomer molar ratio of 41:1, a level that fully protected insulin from aggregating (Fig. 6C). The Hsp27-3P was added just as the aggregation reached peak value (Fig. 9). The light scattering remained unchanged, indicating that Hsp27-3P cannot reverse insulin aggregation. However, for the insulin sample without added Hsp27-3P or with added buffer lacking Hsp27-3P, the light scattering trace eventually became extremely noisy, and the signal dropped dramatically (Fig. 9). A visual inspection of the samples after the run revealed that the Hsp27-3P-added sample was homogeneously cloudy, and the unaltered sample contained large aggregation clumps that had settled below the fluorometer light beam, thus explaining the erratic light scattering intensity. Hsp27-wt, at the same level, was able to similarly block large aggregate formation (data not shown). Thus it appears that insulin aggregation occurs in two phases, first is the formation of smaller aggregates that then combine, in a second phase, to form much larger aggregates. Furthermore, Hsp27 was able to block the second phase from happening, in an apparently phosphorylation-independent manner. Does this two-phase aggregation phenomenon have an in vivo relevance? Does the second phase correspond, in some way, to inclusion body formation, and does Hsp27 play some protective role in this process? It has been reported that transfection of Hsp27 into cells does decrease inclusion body formation (33.Chiou Y.W. Hwu W.L. Lee Y.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1782: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our finding that Hsp27-3D and -3P protect against insulin aggregation better than Hsp27-wt is in contrast to the literature (13.Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 19.Lelj-Garolla B. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. As pointed out in the Introduction, there are several disagreements in the literature over whether unphosphorylated Hsp27 (or Hsp25) protects against protein aggregation better than does the phospho-mimic. There are several possible explanations for these differences as follows: some of these disagreements involved different target proteins; some studies used Hsp27, whereas others used Hsp25; and one study used tissue-prepared Hsp25, whereas all others used bacterially expressed Hsp27 (or Hsp25); and several studies employed Hsp27 expressed with additional residues at the N or C terminus. It has been reported that extra His residues at the N terminus alter the size distribution of Hsp27 (18.Lelj-Garolla B. Mauk A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which could then alter the molecular chaperone activity. However, there are no clear trends between these possibilities and the different reported molecular chaperone activities. The resolution of these discrepancies awaits further investigation. The following conclusions have been made. 1) Urea-PAGE is an effective technique for assaying the level of phosphorylation of Hsp27. 2) Although the Hsp27-3D mutant is widely used and assumed to functionally reproduce the phosphorylated molecule, the mutant is only a partial and qualitative mimic for phosphorylated Hsp27, i.e. the size of the phosphorylated protein is smaller than that of the mimic, and it protects against protein aggregation better than does the mimic. 3) The dimer is the minimum size of phosphorylated Hsp27 under physiological conditions and is an elongated molecule. 4) Unphosphorylated Hsp27 oligomer is a polydisperse distribution of species centered around a minimum 22-mer size. 5) There is a low population of species between the Hsp27 dimer and the large oligomeric species, indicating that intermediate sized multimers are energetically unfavorable. 6) Increasing molecular chaperone activity of Hsp27, with respect to insulin and α-lactalbumin aggregation, correlates with a decreasing size of Hsp27, with the Hsp27 dimer being the most active species. 7) Two possible models were proposed to describe the mechanism of the molecular chaperone activity of phosphorylated Hsp27 on insulin. 8) Although Hsp27 cannot reverse insulin aggregation, it does prevent smaller aggregates from combining to form larger aggregates."

Additionally, PCNA interacts with a large number of replication, repair, and signaling factors to coordinate enzymatic processes at sites of replication and repair (2Moldovan G.L. Pfander B.

PCNA is a homotrimer consisting of 37-kDa subunits, each of which comprises two similar globular domains. The PCNA monomers are arrange in head-to-tail fashion, forming a ring with pseudo 6-fold symmetry. The central channel has a diameter of 34 Å, large enough to accommodate double-stranded DNA (3Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clamp loader, replication factor C (RFC), mediates the assembly of PCNA onto DNA at primer-template junctions (7Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at nicks in the DNA backbone (8Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in a process that is dependent on ATP. The PCNA·DNA complex is very stable, exhibiting a half-life of tens of minutes (9Yao N.

Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5003-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the interactions of various replication and repair proteins with PCNA are well studied (recently reviewed in Ref. 2Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), the interactions between PCNA and DNA are less well understood. Structural studies reveal that the central channel of the clamp is lined with highly conserved, positively charged residues (3Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 4Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis indicates that these residues may be more important for PCNA loading onto DNA than for sliding along DNA (11Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the positively charged residues interact with the phosphodiester backbone but that these interactions are highly dynamic and are frequently displaced by ions from solution (12Ivanov I. Chapados B.R. McCammon J.A. Tainer J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ring structure of PCNA and its relatively weak interaction with DNA allow it to move along the DNA in a diffusive fashion. Early work showed that PCNA can only be stably trapped on linear DNA when bound to polymerase δ on a primer-template (13Ng L. McConnell M. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13571-13576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for PCNA moving along DNA stems from a study, which measured UV cross-linking of PCNA to a chemically modified, double-stranded DNA template. On circular DNA, a high degree of cross-linking was observed, but linearization of the template dramatically reduced cross-linking, suggesting a rapid dissociation of PCNA from the DNA ends (14Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5330-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the absence of a more direct way to assess the motion of PCNA along DNA, it has been difficult to study the molecular nature of the PCNA·DNA interactions and to understand how translocation of the sliding clamp occurs. In recent years, single-molecule techniques have been used to study diffusion of a variety of proteins along DNA. The earliest studies focused on the E. coli RNA polymerase, which is suggested to diffuse along DNA to find promoters (15Kabata H. Kurosawa O. Arai I. Washizu M. Margarson S.A. Glass R.E.

These studies allowed for a detailed biophysical characterization of diffusive protein motion along DNA and revealed a number of different mechanisms of translocation (24Gorman J. Greene E.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Here we use a single-molecule approach to show that PCNA diffuses along DNA using two distinct modes. In one diffusion mode, the clamp tracks the helical pitch of the DNA duplex, resulting in a rotational movement of the protein around the DNA. In the second mode, the protein undergoes a faster, predominantly translational motion. We speculate how these two diffusive mechanisms contribute to the activity of the different classes of proteins that are tethered to DNA by PCNA. The human PCNA open reading frame was amplified from Int pET19pps (kind gift from Dr. Tom Ellenberger) and was cloned into pET28b between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), dialyzed into Storage Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. Purified human RFC complex with an N-terminal RFC1 deletion, which increases PCNA loading efficiency, was a kind gift from Dr. Jerard Hurwitz (25Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G.

The purified PCNA was labeled by coupling AlexaFluor 555-maleimide (Invitrogen) to solvent-exposed cysteine groups on the protein. The human PCNA monomer contains six cysteine residues of which two are surface-exposed (PDB ID: 1AXC) (4Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), resulting in a total of six solvent-accessible cysteines per trimer. The labeling reaction was performed following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Briefly, PCNA aliquots were thawed and dialyzed overnight at 4 degrees into labeling buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl). After reducing the protein with 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, dye was added at a ratio of 10 dyes per PCNA trimer, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 22 °C. Finally, the reaction was quenched with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and free dye was separated from labeled protein using a size exclusion column (PD10, Amersham Biosciences). Labeling stoichiometry was assessed using UV-visible spectrophotometry and determined to be 0.7 ± 0.3 AlexaFluor 555 per PCNA trimer. Fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Full-length Xenopus laevis PCNA (X. laevis PCNA) was cloned and expressed as described previously (27Chang D.J. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32081-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The His6-X. laevis PCNA was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Josman, LLC). High speed supernatant (egg cytosolic) extract was prepared from X. laevis eggs as described previously (28Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Endogenous PCNA was depleted to below 0.25% with a rabbit polyclonal anti-X. laevis PCNA antibody (characterized in supplemental Fig. S1A). The extent of depletion was determined by Western blotting with anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody PC10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purified and labeled human PCNA was reintroduced to the depleted extract at a concentration of 1 μm monomers, and primer extension was measured. Extracts were supplemented with an ATP-regeneration system (2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μg/ml creatine kinase (all from Sigma)), 15 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma), and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (New England Biolabs) was added at 15 ng/μl extract. Incorporation of radioactivity was measured after running the replication products on a 0.8% agarose-TBE gel. Imaging buffers were based on the work of Ellison and Stillman (29Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E33Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To obtain buffers with varying concentrations of potassium glutamate, stocks of Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CHAPS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% Nonidet P-40) with 0 mm potassium glutamate and 500 mm potassium glutamate were prepared and mixed to achieve the desired salt concentration. The total ionic strength I of the buffers was calculated by using, l=12∑n=1NCnZ2(eq. 1) where c is the molar concentration of ion n, z is the charge number of that ion, and the sum is taken over all ions n. At pH 7.5, 47% of the 50 mm Hepes (free acid; pKa = 7.55) in our solutions will be charged (z2 = 1), resulting in an ionic strength of 12 mm. The sodium hydroxide used to achieve a pH of 7.5 contributes ∼13 mm to the ionic strength. Similarly, 7 mm MgCl2 adds 21 mm ionic strength (for the divalent magnesium ions, z2 = 4). In the absence of any potassium glutamate, these contributions add up to an ionic strength of 41 mm. Addition of potassium glutamate will change the ionic strength accordingly (z = 1). Viscous sliding buffers were based on Buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 150 mm potassium glutamate) with glycerol, or PEG6000 added by weight to achieve the desired viscosity (5*ηwater or 10*ηwater) (47Sheely M.L.

Streptavidin-coated flow cells were constructed as reported before (20Blainey P.C. van Oijen A.M. Banerjee A. Verdine G.L. Xie X.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The inlet tubing had an inner diameter of 0.38 mm (PE20 from BD Biosciences) and 10-cm length to minimize the dead volume. Biotin-lambda-biotin DNA was prepared by ligating custom, 12-mer oligonucleotides with 3′Biotin modification (IDT) (BL1, 5′-AGGTCGCCGCCC-Biotin-3′; and BL2, 5′-GGGCGGCGACT-Biotin-3′) to their complementary, single-stranded ends of lambda DNA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To allow single-molecule observations of protein sliding along stretched DNA in the absence of hydrodynamic flow, we assembled stretched DNA onto the surface of the flow cell with both DNA ends coupled to the surface. To achieve this double tethering, 30 pm biotin-lambda-biotin DNA was flow stretched in Buffer A with 35 mm potassium glutamate. After the association of the first biotin with the streptavidin-coated surface, the DNA was stretched by the flow and the second biotin bound to the surface. By changing the flow rate that was applied when introducing the DNA into the flow cell, the length distribution of the DNA could be controlled (results not shown). To visualize DNA, we flow in a 100 nm solution of Sytox Orange (Invitrogen), a DNA intercalating dye, in Buffer A and image with 521 nm laser excitation at variable power. We only stain the DNA at the end of the experiment after PCNA sliding trajectories have been collected. The results described in the main text are obtained on DNA that was immobilized to the surface using a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min, resulting in a mean end-to-end distance of 11.5 ± 0.1 μm (corresponding to 70.3 ± 0.5% of the contour length of lambda-phage B-DNA) for DNA molecules upon which PCNA sliding was measured (see supplemental Fig. S4B). Typically, we observed 10–25 doubly tethered DNA molecules per 80 × 80 μm2 field of view. The typical single-molecule PCNA loading reaction contained 0.4 nm RFC (1/1000 dilution of stock immediately prior to use), 1 nm PCNA (1/2000 dilution immediately prior to use), and 1 mm ATP in 100 μl of Buffer A with 35 mm potassium glutamate. This reaction was drawn into the flow cell containing doubly tethered DNA molecules, was allowed to incubate for 20 min at room temperature, and then was flushed out with 40 flow-cell volumes of Buffer A with 500 mm potassium glutamate. Next, the buffer of interest was exchanged into the flow cell for 40 flow-cell volumes, flow was stopped, and event acquisition would begin. Typically, 0–3 PCNA molecules were observed per doubly tethered DNA molecule. QDots (605 nm) were functionalized with mouse monoclonal anti-histidine tag antibody (MCA1396 from AbD Serotec) using the Invitrogen QDot Antibody Conjugation Kit. For PCNA·QDot experiments, AlexaFluor 555- or mock-labeled PCNA was loaded as usual except that the initial wash included ∼1 nm anti-his QDots for 10 min. Next, the flow cell was washed with 40–100 flow cell volumes of Buffer A + 500 mm potassium glutamate to remove free QDots. Finally, the buffer of interest was exchanged into the flow cell for 40 flow-cell volumes, flow was stopped, and image acquisition was started. Fluorescence imaging of AlexaFluor 555-PCNA and PCNA·QDot complexes moving along DNA or QDot bound to DNA was performed as before (19Tafvizi A. Huang F. Leith J.S. Fersht A.R. Mirny L.A. van Oijen A.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: L01-L03Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The AlexaFluor 555 dye and QDot (605 nm) emission were excited by the 521-nm line from an Ar/Kr laser (Coherent I-70 Spectrum), and fluorescence was collected by an EM-CCD (Andor iXon) after filtering scattered laser light (Chroma Technology). Typically, 2.5- to 5-fold less power was used for QDot imaging than for AlexaFluor 555 imaging. Typical frame rates were 19 Hz for AlexaFluor 555-PCNA and 4 Hz for PCNA·QDot. Data were analyzed by custom-written particle-tracking MATLAB® code (19Tafvizi A. Huang F. Leith J.S. Fersht A.R. Mirny L.A. van Oijen A.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: L01-L03Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The positions of labeled particles were determined by fitting each single-molecule fluorescence image to a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. This procedure allows the determination of a particle's position with a precision that can be better than the diffraction-limited optical resolution of the microscope used. The accuracy of position determination strongly depends on the signal strength corresponding to a single molecule and is given by, σ2=[s2N+a2/12N+8πs4b2a2N2](eq. 2) where N is the number of photons collected (32Thompson R.E. Larson D.R. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2775-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Typical signals from individual AlexaFluor 555 and QDot labels corresponded to 1000 ± 500 and 6000 ± 3000 photons per 50-ms integration. Using the standard deviation of the microscope point-spread function s (150 nm), the pixel size a (166 nm), and the background level b (13–19 photons for AlexaFluor 555 imaging and 4–12 photons for QDot imaging), we calculate the standard error of position determination to be σ = 12 nm for AlexaFluor 555-PCNA and σ = 2.2 nm for PCNA·QDot. Using the experimentally obtained trajectories of individual sliding particles, we determined the diffusion coefficient D of each particle by plotting its mean square displacement (MSD) as a function of step interval m times the time interval, Δt, MSD(M,m)=∑i=1M−m(yi+m−yi)2M−m(eq. 3) Here, M represents the total number of steps in the trajectory, m ranges from 1 to M, and yi is the displacement of the particle along the axis of the DNA in step i. Effectively, MSD(M,m) is the average of the squared displacements of the particle in the trajectory with length M, calculated from all pairs of positions that are m steps apart. According to the one-dimensional diffusion equation MSD(M,m) = 2DmΔt, we can obtain D by fitting the resulting data to a straight line using a weighted least-square fitting procedure. We measure the diffusion coefficient of the PCNA as half of the slope of the line fit to the MSD versus mΔt between steps m = 2 through m = 10. The lower end of this range was chosen, because many trajectories exhibit nonlinear behavior in the first step likely due to DNA fluctuations. The top of the range was limited by the shortest trajectories we accepted for fitting. Particles that were apparently immobile on the DNA or that showed bounded diffusion in the time window under consideration were excluded from analysis. Since bounded diffusion is apparent as a nonlinearity of the MSD versus mΔt, we report only particles for which the MSD(M,m) was correlated to mΔt with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 or higher. Using MATLAB, we simulated a one-dimensional random walk of 100 steps, each consisting of the average of 100 sub-steps with normally distributed step sizes. Sub-steps were used to better approximate the averaging inherent to imaging a single molecule over a finite window of time (the exposure time Δt). Next, a single parameter was used to scale the step size distribution of the particles to a desired diffusion coefficient. As we did with our experimentally observed diffusion trajectories, we fit the mean-square displacement MSD versus time mΔt of these sample trajectories in the range of m = 2 through 10. Finally, we simulated one-dimensional diffusion trajectories of a stepper changing randomly between two different diffusion coefficients on timescales faster than Δt. We used two different step sizes as the only two parameters to scale the trajectories. The two step sizes were chosen such that their resultant diffusion coefficients matched the theoretical limits for helical and non-helical diffusion of PCNA along DNA. Subsequently, we used a probability fhel for the stepper to use the step size associated with helical diffusion (and a probability (1 − fhel) to use the step size corresponding to non-helical diffusion). fhel was varied from 0 (100% maximal non-helical diffusion) to 1 (100% maximal helical diffusion). The mean diffusion coefficient from 100 of these 100-step trajectories was observed to vary linearly with fhel. To visualize the movement of PCNA along DNA, a cysteine-reactive organic dye (AlexaFluor 555-maleimide) was used to fluorescently label His-tagged PCNA at one of its native cysteines. Human PCNA monomers have six cysteine residues of which only two, C27 and C62, are solvent exposed (PD BID: 1AXC) (4Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Their positions are in loops distant from the DNA-interaction surface, making it unlikely that labeling would interfere with protein movement along DNA. Spectrophotometry performed after labeling revealed the presence of 0.7 ± 0.3 AlexaFluor 555 per PCNA trimer (see “Experimental Procedures”). To confirm that labeling did not inhibit PCNA function, we performed a primer extension assay using X. laevis egg extracts. A high speed supernatant of Xenopus egg cytoplasm supports PCNA-dependent replication of single-stranded DNA (33Méchali M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 93-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon depletion of the endogenous X. laevis PCNA to <0.25% (supplemental Fig. S1A), primer extension on M13 single-stranded DNA was reduced ∼30-fold. Supplementing the depleted extracts with mock-labeled or AlexaFluor 555-labeled PCNA restored synthesis to 40% of the level seen in mock depleted extract (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). This result shows that AlexaFluor 555-PCNA is able to support processive DNA synthesis just as actively as unmodified PCNA. To track fluorescently labeled PCNA on DNA, we stretched and immobilized λ phage DNA on the glass surface of a microfluidic flow cell. To this end, we functionalized both ends of linearized λ DNA with biotin to allow binding to a streptavidin-coated surface. Introducing the biotinylated λ DNA into the flow cell at high flow rates caused the DNA to bind to the surface via streptavidin in a stretched state, with a length corresponding to ∼70% of its contour length. To minimize nonspecific interactions between the surface and protein or DNA, the glass was chemically functionalized with high molecular weight, biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on top of which the streptavidin was deposited (30Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). PCNA was loaded onto the stretched λ DNA in the flow cell. PCNA requires RFC and ATP for loading around DNA in the absence of DNA ends (6Burgers P.M. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tsurimoto T.

We reduced the concentrations of both RFC and PCNA in the loading reaction to limit the number of PCNA trimers loaded per λ DNA to less than one. After loading is complete, the RFC clamp loader releases from the DNA-bound clamp (35Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephan S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34776-34783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, to ensure that the molecules visualized were PCNA alone and not PCNA bound by the clamp loader, we washed the flow cell with 0.5 m potassium glutamate buffer to remove any residual RFC complexes or incompletely loaded PCNA (8Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, omission of ATP in the washing and imaging steps prevents residual RFC from binding to DNA or PCNA (36Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Following these stringent washing steps, individual fluorescent complexes could be observed moving along the DNA for several hours. When ATP or RFC was omitted from the loading reaction, no sliding events were observed (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest successful loading and observation of individual fluorescently labeled PCNA complexes on DNA. Once PCNA was loaded onto the stretched λ DNA, it was visualized using wide-field fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence of individual, labeled PCNA molecules was imaged as a function of time with a charge-coupled device camera. Fig. 1A shows a representative time series of images of a single molecule of PCNA moving along λ DNA. The position of the clamp on the DNA through time was determined using particle-tracking algorithms (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fitting every diffraction-limited, fluorescence image with a two-dimensional Gaussian function determined the position of the protein. The precision of position determination is determined by the total amount of signal collected from a single molecule and can be much better than the resolution of th"

Using two photon–guided focal stimulation, we found spike timing–dependent plasticity of proximal excitatory inputs to olfactory bulb granule cells that originated, in part, from cortical feedback projections. The protocol that potentiated proximal inputs depressed distal, dendrodendritic inputs to granule cells. Granule cell excitatory postsynaptic potentials and mitral cell inhibition were also potentiated by theta-burst stimulation. Plasticity of cortical feedback inputs to interneurons provides a mechanism for encoding information by modulating bulbar inhibition."

Here, we describe the unique synaptic and spatiotemporal properties of waves generated by the retina's glutamatergic circuits. First, knockout mice lacking vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 do not have glutamatergic waves, but continue to exhibit cholinergic waves, demonstrating that the two wave-generating circuits are linked. Second, simultaneous outside-out patch and whole-cell recordings reveal that retinal waves are accompanied by transient increases in extrasynaptic glutamate, directly demonstrating the existence of glutamate spillover during waves. Third, the initiation rate and propagation speed of retinal waves, as assayed by calcium imaging, are sensitive to pharmacological manipulations of spillover and inhibition, demonstrating a role for both signaling pathways in shaping the spatiotemporal properties of glutamatergic retinal waves."
https://openalex.org/W2043075046,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, positive strand RNA virus of about 9.6 kb. Like all enveloped viruses, the HCV membrane fuses with the host cell membrane during the entry process and thereby releases the genome into the cytoplasm, initiating the viral replication cycle. To investigate the features of HCV membrane fusion, we developed an in vitro fusion assay using cell culture-produced HCV and fluorescently labeled liposomes. With this model we could show that HCV-mediated fusion can be triggered in a receptor-independent but pH-dependent manner and that fusion of the HCV particles with liposomes is dependent on the viral dose and on the lipid composition of the target membranes. In addition CBH-5, an HCV E2-specific antibody, inhibited fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, point mutations in E2, known to abrogate HCV glycoprotein-mediated fusion in a cell-based assay, altered or even abolished fusion in the liposome-based assay. When assaying the fusion properties of HCV particles with different buoyant density, we noted higher fusogenicity of particles with lower density. This could be attributable to inherently different properties of low density particles, to association of these particles with factors stimulating fusion, or to co-flotation of factors enhancing fusion activity in trans. Taken together, these data show the important role of lipids of both the viral and target membranes in HCV-mediated fusion, point to a crucial role played by the E2 glycoprotein in the process of HCV fusion, and reveal an important behavior of HCV of different densities with regard to fusion."

In this study, we generated an Escherichia coli FoF1 (EFoF1) mutant in which the ϵ subunit lacked the C-terminal domain (FoF1ϵΔC), and ATP synthesis driven by acid-base transition (ΔpH) and the K+-valinomycin diffusion potential (ΔΨ) was compared in detail with that of the wild-type enzyme (FoF1ϵWT).

The dependence of the activities of FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC on various combinations of ΔpH and ΔΨ was similar, suggesting that the rate-limiting step in ATP synthesis was unaltered by the C-terminal domain of ϵ. Solubilized FoF1ϵWT also showed lower kcat and higher Km values for ATP hydrolysis than the corresponding values of FoF1ϵΔC.

The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by the ϵ subunit of Escherichia coli F1 (EF1) and FoF1 (EFoF1) has been extensively studied. Addition of ϵ to ϵ-depleted EF1 showed noncompetitive inhibition of ATP hydrolysis (7Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The affinity of MgATP and MgADP to the high affinity site of the three catalytic β subunits of EF1 was decreased by ϵ (11Weber J. Dunn S.D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the ϵ subunit of EF1 had no effect on the equilibrium between ATP and ADP·Pi but inhibited product release under unisite catalysis conditions (12Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EFoF1-mediated ATP hydrolysis by ϵ was also demonstrated in experiments involving partial digestion by a protease (13Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of the ϵ subunit of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 F1 (TF1) and FoF1 (TFoF1) has also been studied extensively. Slow binding and hydrolysis of TNP-ATP, a fluorescent ATP analog, under unisite catalysis conditions have been reported (14Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to EF1, inhibition by the ϵ subunit of TF1 was relieved slowly and apparently disappeared at high ATP concentrations ([ATP]). This is not due to the dissociation of ϵ from the F1 complex, because disappearance of inhibition at high [ATP] was also reported in TFoF1 in which ϵ is indispensable for stable complex formation (15Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ATP hydrolysis, there has been no detailed analysis of the effect of ϵ on ATP synthesis. The ϵ subunit has a molecular mass of 14 kDa and a two-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal 10-stranded β-sandwich and two C-terminal α-helices. Of these two domains, the C-terminal domain is responsible for inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, and the ϵ subunit in which this domain is absent does not have any inhibitory effect (15Kato-Yamada Y.

Structural studies on isolated ϵ and its complex with the truncated γ subunit have shown that the C-terminal domain of ϵ adopts two different conformations, the “hairpin-folded” and “extended” states (Fig. 1) (17Wilkens S.

These studies have shown that the extended state inhibits ATP hydrolysis, whereas the hairpin-folded state does not. In contrast to ATP hydrolysis, the correlation between the conformation of ϵ and its effect on ATP synthesis has not been fully understood. In both EFoF1 and TFoF1, when ϵ was fixed in an extended state that inhibits ATP hydrolysis, no change was observed in the ATP synthesis activity driven by the proton motive force (Δμ) generated by the respiratory chain in the inverted membrane (26Tsunoda S.P.

Based on these results, it has been proposed that ϵ functions as a ratchet that inhibits only ATP hydrolysis. However, Masaike et al. (31Masaike T. Suzuki T. Tsunoda S.P. Konno H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that truncation of the C-terminal domain of ϵ increased the ATP synthesis activity of TFoF1, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of ϵ suppresses the ATP synthesis activity. In this study, we generated an EFoF1 mutant with a truncated ϵ subunit that did not contain the C-terminal α-helices (FoF1ϵΔC). This mutant was purified and reconstituted into a liposome, and the ATP synthesis rate was measured by the acid-base transition (ΔpH) and K+-valinomycin diffusion potential (ΔΨ) methods. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by solubilized EFoF1 was also measured. The activities of FoF1ϵΔC under various conditions were investigated and compared in detail with those of the wild-type enzyme (FoF1ϵWT). The results indicated that the ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities of FoF1ϵΔC were much higher than those of FoF1ϵWT. The inhibitory mechanism of the C-terminal α-helices of the ϵ subunit of EFoF1 was discussed. A wild-type EFoF1 expression vector (pRA100) (32Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was provided by Prof. R. A. Capaldi, University of Oregon. Based on this vector, a 1.3 S subunit of Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase (33Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to the N terminus of the β subunits, and three histidine residues were introduced at the C terminus of the c subunits. This mutant is referred to as the wild-type (denoted by FoF1ϵWT) hereafter. FoF1 lacking the two α-helices in the C terminus of the ϵ subunit (denoted by FoF1ϵΔC) was generated by introducing a stop codon at the position of Asp-91. RA1 strain E. coli (unc−/cyo−) (34Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was transformed with the FoF1 mutant plasmid. After preculture in 5 ml of LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl) containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 8–9 h at 37 °C, the cells were inoculated in 1.2 liters of TB (1.2% tryptone, 2.4% yeast extract, 0.4% glycerol, 1.25% K2HPO4, and 0.23% KH2PO4) containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and then cultured for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and washed with buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 50 mm KCl. The pellet was then resuspended in buffer A (100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science)). Egg white lysozyme (8–12 mg, Seikagaku Corp.) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, 1–2 mg of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and 5 mm MgCl2 were added, and incubation was carried out at 4 °C for 20 min. The spheroplasts were then spun down, resuspended in buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm 4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride (PAB)), and sonicated (model CL4, Misonix) on ice. They were then centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris. The supernatant containing the inverted membrane was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 75,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B at 250 mg/ml. The inverted membrane was stored at −80 °C prior to further use. The membrane suspension (250 mg/ml, wet weight of inverted membrane/volume of buffer) in 0.8% (w/v) n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) was centrifuged at 75,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube on ice. Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ADP, 50 mm imidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 5 mm PAB) and 2% (w/v) octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8, Wako) were added to the pellet, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice. It was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The collected supernatant was injected into a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ADP, 50 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm PAB, 0.3% (w/v) C12E8, and 0.1% (w/v) E. coli total lipid (Avanti)). The column was washed twice with 5 ml of buffer D. His-tagged EFoF1 was eluted with 3 ml of buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ADP, 500 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm PAB, 0.3% (w/v) C12E8, and 0.1% (w/v) E. coli total lipid). Six drops of the eluate were collected in each 1.5-ml tube containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified EFoF1 fractions were run on 15% SDS-PAGE to select the purest fractions that contained all the subunits and the least contaminants. The chosen fractions were pooled and passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer F (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1× protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm PAB, 0.3% (w/v) C12E8, and 0.1% (w/v) E. coli total lipid). EFoF1 was eluted with 1 ml of buffer F. The eluate was concentrated and further purified in an Amicon Ultra-4 100,000 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The protein concentration of the sample was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. Purified EFoF1 was immediately used for reconstitution into the liposome or to measure the ATP hydrolysis activity. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine from soybean (type II-S, Sigma) was suspended in buffer G (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm KCl (pH 7.5)) by vigorous vortexing. The liposome suspension was then repeatedly freeze-thawed three times. The final concentration of the lipid was 40 mg/ml. Solubilized EFoF1 was reconstituted into the liposomes using the freeze-thaw method. The EFoF1 solution (∼1 mg/ml, 100 μl) was added to the liposome suspension (40 mg/ml, 1 ml), and the mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C prior to further use. Reconstitution efficiency of EFoF1 into liposome was assessed by SDS-PAGE of EFoF1/liposome suspension and the supernatant after centrifugation of EFoF1/liposome at 75,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The ATP synthesis activity was measured as described previously with slight modifications (35Toei M. Gerle C. Nakano M. Tani K. Gyobu N. Tamakoshi M. Sone N. Yoshida M. Fujiyoshi Y. Mitsuoka K. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20256-20261Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To acidify the interior of the proteoliposomes, 10 μl of the proteoliposome suspension was mixed with 50 μl of acidification buffer (300 mm MES-NaOH or HEPES-NaOH) and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Following incubation, the pH of the acidified liposome suspension was measured by a glass electrode, and this value was regarded as the pH inside the liposome (pHin). The ATP synthesis reaction was initiated by injecting 60 μl of the acidified proteoliposomes into 1 ml of base buffer containing 100 mm Tricine-Na (pH 8.8) or HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1–50 mm phosphate, 2.2 mg of luciferin/luciferase mixture from ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science), 0.001–1 mm ADP, 36 nm valinomycin, and 1–300 mm KCl. The amount of ATP generated was measured as the increase in the luminescence intensity of the luciferin/luciferase reaction at 550 nm in an FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Japan). The ATP synthesis rate was calculated using the initial slope of the increase in the luminescence intensity. To calibrate the system for measuring the amount of generated ATP, a known amount of ATP was injected into the base buffer after measurement. To measure the dependence of the ATP synthesis rate on the ADP or phosphate concentration, the phosphate and ADP concentrations were fixed at 10 and 1 mm, respectively. The pH of the mixture of acidified proteoliposome suspension and base buffer (pHout) was directly measured using a glass electrode to determine ΔpH (= pHout − pHin). The ΔpH and ΔΨ dependences were measured by changing the pH and [K+] of the acidification and base buffers. ΔΨ was calculated by the Nernst equation using the difference in [K+] inside and outside the liposome, i.e. 2.3(kBT/e)log([K+]out/[K+]in), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and e is the elementary charge. Measurements were carried out at 24–25 °C. The ATP hydrolysis activity of solubilized EFoF1 was measured with an ATP regeneration system using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (VP-550, Jasco). Various concentrations of ATP (Sigma) were added to the assay mixture (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KCl, 0.3% (w/v) C12E8, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH) at 0 s, and this was followed by the addition of various concentrations of EFoF1 at 30 s. The NADH absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 1200 s. The ATP hydrolysis rate was calculated from the time course of the change in [NADH] using a molecular extinction coefficient value of 6220 at 340 nm. Because the ATP hydrolysis activity gradually increased in the initial state after the addition of EFoF1, the maximum activity in the steady state at around 1000–1200 s was used for data analysis. Measurements were carried out at 24–25 °C. The C-terminal α-helices of the ϵ subunit of EFoF1 were truncated by introducing a stop codon at Asp-91 (Fig. 1). The ATP synthesis activity of the truncated mutant (FoF1ϵΔC) was compared in detail with that of the wild-type enzyme (FoF1ϵWT). The expression level of FoF1ϵΔC was similar to that of FoF1ϵWT in the inverted membrane of RA1 strain E. coli (unc−/cyo−), and it was purified as a stable EFoF1 complex using the His tags introduced into the c subunits (Fig. 2A). No differences in concentration determination by the BCA assay and purity were observed between FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC. Purified EFoF1 was reconstituted into the liposome, and ATP synthesis activities driven by ΔpH and ΔΨ were measured. Several methods have been proposed for reconstituting EFoF1 into liposomes, including the following: 1) reconstitution by detergent removal from a mixture of solubilized EFoF1 and liposome using Bio-Beads SM (36Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); 2) dialysis; and 3) reconstitution by diluting the detergent in solubilized EFoF1 with an excess amount of liposome and subsequent freeze-thaw. Because the last method resulted in the highest ATP synthesis activity (data not shown), we employed this method throughout this study. The reconstitution efficiencies were very high, and no differences were observed between FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC (Fig. 2B). By using an excess of the liposome suspension, a high lipid/protein molar ratio was obtained (∼2 × 105). The average protein/liposome ratio was less than unity, and most liposomes contained one or zero EFoF1 molecules. This was estimated by assuming that the liposome diameter is in the range 100–200 nm (Fig. 3A) (30Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Gräber P. Börsch M.

A, schematic illustration of the experimental system. B, examples of raw data at pHin and pHout values of 5.5 and 8.5, respectively (ΔpH = 3.0), corresponding to 177 mV (= 2.3(kBT/e)ΔpH). ΔΨ was generated by the difference in [K+]out (30 mm) and [K+]in (1 mm) in the presence of 36 nm valinomycin. ΔΨ was calculated by the Nernst equation, i.e. ΔΨ = 2.3(kBT/e)log([K+]out/[K+]in), and corresponded to 87 mV. The proton motive force (Δμ, 264 mV) was calculated by the equation Δμ = 2.3(kBT/e)ΔpH + ΔΨ. The ATP synthesis rates of FoF1ϵWT (blue) and FoF1ϵΔC (red) and liposome without FoF1 (black), determined by linear fitting of the initial slope after addition of the FoF1 liposome, were 11, 49, and <1 s−1, respectively. The concentrations of ADP and Pi were 1 and 10 mm, respectively. Measurements were carried out at 24–25 °C. Final concentrations of EFoF1 were ∼0.5 nm, and final concentrations of ATP added as standard were 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examples of raw data obtained from the ATP synthesis experiments are shown in Fig. 3B. The amount of generated ATP was determined on the basis of the luminescence observed in the luciferin-luciferase reaction. The luminescence intensity was proportional to the ATP concentration in the reaction mixture under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Addition of ADP to the reaction mixture showed a slight increase in the luminescence intensity because of the ATP contamination in ADP, which was calculated to be ∼0.05%. Under the “Discussion,” we used the initial rate of ATP synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3B, FoF1ϵΔC exhibited a much higher rate (49 s−1, red line) than FoF1ϵWT (11 s−1, blue line), as reported earlier for TFoF1 in an inverted membrane (31Masaike T. Suzuki T. Tsunoda S.P. Konno H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The observed differences were actually due to the removal of C-terminal α-helices of the ϵ subunit and not to variations in concentration determination, purity, and reconstitution efficiency between FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the C-terminal domain of ϵ suppresses the ATP synthesis activity. As a control, the time course of the liposome without EFoF1 is also shown (<1 s−1, Fig. 3B, black line), and the results indicate that the ATP was actually generated by EFoF1. The ATP synthesis rate was measured at various concentrations of ADP and Pi. The [substrate]-velocity plots for ADP and Pi showed that the ATP synthesis rates of FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 4, A and B). The values of the turnover number (kcat) and Michaelis constant (Km) are summarized in Table 1. The kcat values of FoF1ϵWT for ADP and Pi were 0.29- and 0.30-fold the values of FoF1ϵΔC, respectively (ratio shown in Table 1). Furthermore, in the case of FoF1ϵWT, the Michaelis constants (Km) were 4.0- (ADP) and 1.3-fold (Pi) higher than those of FoF1ϵΔ. These changes resulted in second-order rate constants (kcat/Km) of FoF1ϵWT that were 0.073- (ADP) and 0.23-fold (Pi) the values of FoF1ϵΔ.TABLE 1%Kinetic parameters for ATP synthesis of FoF1ϵWT and FoF1ϵΔC reconstituted into liposomesSubstrates variedADPa[Pi] was 10 mm.Pib[ADP] was 1 mm.kcatKm(ADP)kcat/Km(ADP)kcatkm(Pi)kcat/Km(Pi)s−1mm−1 s−1s−1mm−1 s−1FoF1ϵWT16 ± 0.6(1.0 ± 0.12) × 10−41.6 × 10520 ± 1.2(4.2 ± 0.92) × 10−34.8 × 103FoF1ϵΔC55 ± 3.2(2.5 ± 0.58) × 10−52.2 × 10666 ± 5.0(3.2 ± 0.86) × 10−32.1 × 104RatiocThe values for FoF1ϵWT were divided by those for FoF1ϵΔC.0.294.00.0730.301.30.23a [Pi] was 10 mm.b [ADP] was 1 mm.c The values for FoF1ϵWT were divided by those for FoF1ϵΔC.

https://openalex.org/W2069815021,"Upon massive DNA damage, hyperactivation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 causes severe depletion of intracellular NAD and ATP pools as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms contributing to PARP-1-dependent impairment of mitochondrial functioning have not been identified. We found that degradation of the PARP-1 product poly(ADP-ribose) through the concerted actions of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase and NUDIX (nucleoside diphosphate-X) hydrolases leads to accumulation of AMP. The latter, in turn, inhibits the ADP/ATP translocator, prompting mitochondrial energy failure. For the first time, our findings identify NUDIX hydrolases as key enzymes involved in energy derangement during PARP-1 hyperactivity. Also, these data disclose unanticipated AMP-dependent impairment of mitochondrial exchange of adenine nucleotides, which can be of relevance to organelle functioning and disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006053579,"Budelli et al. show that a sodium-dependent potassium current is a major component of the delayed rectifier outward current in neurons. This current is carried by Slack channels encoded by the Slo2.2 gene and activated by a persistent sodium current. One of the largest components of the delayed outward current that is active under physiological conditions in many mammalian neurons, such as medium spiny neurons of the striatum and tufted-mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, has gone unnoticed and is the result of a Na+-activated K+ current. Previous studies of K+ currents in mammalian neurons may have overlooked this large outward component because the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) is typically used in such studies. We found that TTX also eliminated this delayed outward component in rat neurons as a secondary consequence. Unexpectedly, we found that the activity of a persistent inward sodium current (persistent INa) is highly effective at activating this large Na+-dependent (TTX sensitive) delayed outward current. Using siRNA techniques, we identified SLO2.2 channels as being carriers of this delayed outward current. These findings have far reaching implications for many aspects of cellular and systems neuroscience, as well as clinical neurology and pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W2163581448,"The dynamic and reversible process of ubiquitin modification controls various cellular activities. Ubiquitin exists as monomers, unanchored chains, or protein-conjugated forms, but the regulation of these interconversions remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a protein designated Rfu1 (regulator of free ubiquitin chains 1), which regulates intracellular concentrations of monomeric ubiquitins and free ubiquitin chains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rfu1 functions as an inhibitor of Doa4, a deubiquitinating enzyme. Rapid loss of free ubiquitin chains upon heat shock, a condition in which more proteins require ubiquitin conjugation, was mediated in part by Doa4 and Rfu1. Thus, regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis is controlled by a balance between a deubiquitinating enzyme and its inhibitor. We propose that free ubiquitin chains function as a ubiquitin reservoir that allows maintenance of monomeric ubiquitins at adequate levels under normal conditions and rapid supply for substrate conjugation under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2053232173,"Krüpple-like transcription factor 5 (KLF5) is a zinc-finger transcription factor promoting cell survival and tumorigenesis in multiple cancers. A high expression level of KLF5 has been shown to be associated with shorter breast cancer patient survival. However, the role of KLF5 and mechanism of KLF5 actions in breast cancer remain unclear. In this study, we found that KLF5 knockdown by small interfering RNA in two breast cell lines, MCF10A and BT20, induces apoptosis. Interestingly, a pro-survival phosphatase, dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), is down-regulated by KLF5 ablation. Consistently, KLF5 overexpression increases the MKP-1 protein expression in Hs578T and MCF7. We further found that MKP-1 is essential and sufficient for KLF5 to promote breast cell survival. However, MKP-1 is not a KLF5 direct transcription target because the MKP-1 mRNA level is not regulated by KLF5. By cycloheximide chase assays, we found that KLF5 decreases MKP-1 protein degradation via activating the ERK signaling. Inhibition of pERK by the pharmacological inhibitor U0126 specifically blocks KLF5-induced MKP-1 phosphorylation and stabilization. Additionally, constitutive activation of ERK by constitutively activated MEK1 rescues the KLF5 depletion-induced MKP-1 down-regulation. Consistently, the phosphorylation-deficient MKP-1 mutant cannot be stabilized by KLF5. Finally, the activation of ERK by KLF5 is very likely through the KLF5 direct target gene FGF-BP in breast cells.

Our previous study showed that KLF5 promotes the TSU-Pr1 bladder cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W.

Following that, we proved that KLF5 promotes breast cell proliferation partially through directly inducing the fibroblast growth factor-binding protein 1 (FGF-BP) transcription in breast cancer. 3H. Q. Zheng, Z. Zhou, L. Chaudhury, J. T. Dong, and C. Chen, unpublished data. FGF-BP was confirmed to be a KLF5-induced gene in the mouse lung in an independent microarray study (13Wan H. Luo F.

Besides FGF-BP, another KLF5 downstream target gene (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1/DUSP1/CL-100), has been documented to promote cell survival (14Wu W. Pew T. Zou M. Pang D. Conzen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4117-4124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated via phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK. These MAPKs are inactivated via de-phosphorylation by MKPs including MKP-1 (15Keyse S.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Although pERK usually contributes to cell proliferation and survival, pJNK and pp38 promote cell apoptosis in response to stress (16Junttila M.R. Li S.P. Westermarck J. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 954-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The balance between MAPKs and MKPs determines whether cells undergo survival or apoptosis (17Wada T. Penninger J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2838-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Consistently, MKP-1 has been reported to be overexpressed in many types of cancer including breast cancer (15Keyse S.M.

Interestingly, the pERK levels are increased by KLF5 in TSU-Pr1 (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the mechanism by which MKP-1 is induced by KLF5 in breast cancer. We showed evidence that KLF5 promotes breast cell survival partially through MKP-1. The induction of MKP-1 by KLF5 in breast cells is at the protein post-translational level but not the transcriptional level. The activation of ERK signaling by KLF5 is essential and sufficient for MKP-1 protein phosphorylation and stabilization in breast cells. We further demonstrated that activation of ERK signaling is likely mediated by the KLF5 direct target gene FGF-BP. Taken together, the KLF5-FGF-BP-pERK-MKP-1 signaling axis may contribute to breast cancer and provide new therapeutic targets for breast cancer. The immortalized breast epithelial cell line MCF10A was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 50/50 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.1 μg/ml cholera enterotoxin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The breast cancer cell lines BT-20 and MCF7 were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acid, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The breast cancer cell line Hs578T was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. These cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Immunoblotting was performed with 40 μg of proteins. The anti-β-actin and anti-V5 antibodies are from Sigma. The anti-PARP, anti-cleaved caspase 3, anti-pERK, and anti-pMKP-1Ser-359 antibodies are from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The anti-KLF5 rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously (27Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The anti-MKP-1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The control luciferase siRNA (Lucsi), KLF5 siRNA (KLF5si) (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL), and MKP-1 siRNA (MKP-1si) (silencer select pre-designed siRNA, Ambion, Austin, TX) were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The siRNA target sequences were: 5′-AGCTCACCTGAGGACTCACAC-3′, for the human KLF5 gene, 5′-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA-3′ for the luciferase gene, and 5′-GGACTAATCGAGTCAAGCT-3′ for the human MKP-1 gene. The final concentration of Lucsi and KLF5si was 100 nm; and the final concentration of MKP-1si was 10 nm. The KLF5 and control gfp adenoviruses have been described previously (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MCF7 and Hs578T cells were infected with adenoviruses in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After incubation with the adenoviruses for 4 h, the cells were cultured in normal growth media. Hs578T, MCF10A, and HEK293T cells were seeded into a 12-well plate at a density of 1–2.5 × 105 cells per well. After overnight culture, the cells were either transfected with different siRNAs or plasmids or infected with adenoviruses. Two days after transfection or infection, the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml CHX. Total proteins were collected at different time points and subjected to immunoblotting for KLF5, MKP-1, and β-actin. Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptions were performed using the IscriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Forward primer, 5′-GATCTAGATATGCCCAGTTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CAGCCTTCCCAGGTACACTTG-3′, were used to amplify KLF5 by PCR in a 20-μl volume. Primer sequences for MKP-1 were 5′-CCCGGAGCTGTGCAGCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGGCCCATGAAGCTGAAGT-3′ (reverse). A total of 32 cycles were used to amplify KLF5 and MKP-1, whereas 28 cycles were used to amplify the β-actin control. MCF10A and BT20 cells were transfected with KLF5si, MKP-1si, and Lucsi, respectively, for 5 days before analysis. The SRB assay was used to measure cell viability as described in our previous report (28Chen C. Zhou Z. Ross J.S. Zhou W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The human MKP-1 gene was amplified from IMAGE clone 5296005 with the pfu enzymes by PCR using primers 5′-ttggatccATGGTCATGGAAGTGGGCAC-3′ and 5′-ttctcgagTCAGCAGCTGGGAGAGGTCG-3′. The catalytically inactive MKP-1C258S mutant was generated by PCR using primers 5′-GTTTGTCCACTCCCAGGCAGGCATTTCCCG-3′ and 5′-TGCCTGCCTGGGAGTGGACAAACACCCTTC-3′. The MKP-1S359A/S364A mutant was generated by primers 5′-ttggatccATGGTCATGGAAGTGGGCAC-3′ and 5′-ttctcgagTCAGCAGCTGGGTGCGGTCGTAATGGGTGCCTGAAGGTAGCTCAGCGCAC-3′. The PCR products was digested by BamHI/XhoI and subcloned into the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector and verified by DNA sequencing. The pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZ vector (Invitrogen) was used as a negative control. A constitutively activated MEK1 was amplified from pMCL-MEK1-ΔED (29Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. A. E. Aplin, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) and subcloned into pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector. All plasmids were transfected into HEK 293FT packing cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Lentiviruses were collected at 72 h after transfection and used to transduce MCF10A cells in a 6-well plate. Forty-eight h after transduction, the antibiotic blasticidin (10 μg/ml) was added to select drug-resistant populations. KLF5 has previously been shown to express in estrogen receptor α negative basal-like breast cells. 3H. Q. Zheng, Z. Zhou, L. Chaudhury, J. T. Dong, and C. Chen, unpublished data. To determine whether KLF5 promotes breast cell survival, we knocked down KLF5 in two KLF5 positive breast cell lines, MCF10A and BT20 (30Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6567-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We examined the levels of apoptosis markers, cleaved PARP, and caspase 3, in the control luciferase siRNA (Lucsi) and well characterized KLF5 siRNA (KLF5si) (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Aizawa K. Suzuki T. Kada N. Ishihara A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 70-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) transfected cells by immunoblotting. We found that KLF5si induces the cleavage of both PARP and caspase 3 compared with Lucsi in MCF10A and BT20 (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that KLF5 knockdown decreases cell survival through inducing apoptosis, we measured cell viability by the SRB assay and Annexin V levels by flow cytometry. Consistent with Western blot results, KLF5si significantly decreases cell viability (Fig. 1B) and increases Annexin V staining (data not shown) in both MCF10A and BT20. Interestingly, the protein expression levels of a potential KLF5 downstream gene, the pro-survival phosphatase MKP-1, are decreased by KLF5si in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). To test if MKP-1 indeed promotes breast cell survival, we knocked down MKP-1 by a pre-designed anti-MKP-1 siRNA in both MCF10A and BT20 and examined apoptosis. As expected, knockdown of MKP-1 also induces the cleavage of both PARP and caspase 3 and the decrease of cell viability like knockdown of KLF5 in both MCF10A and BT20 (Fig. 1, C and D). Because silence of KLF5 induces apoptosis and down-regulates the expression of the pro-survival MKP-1 protein in breast cells, we wondered if KLF5 functions partially through MKP-1. We performed a rescue experiment in MCF10A to determine whether MKP-1 overexpression can block the KLF5si-induced apoptosis. The wild-type (WT) MKP-1, the catalytically inactive mutant MKP-1C258S (32Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and the lacZ control genes were forced overexpressed in MCF10A populations, respectively, by lentiviruses (Fig. 2A). In line with our previous observation, KLF5si decreases the MKP-1 protein level and induces apoptosis, indicated by cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 and loss of cell viability, in the control LacZ overexpressing cells. As expected, forced overexpression of WT MKP-1 clearly decreases the pERK levels and KLF5si-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained from two stable MKP-1 overexpressing MCF10A clones (data not shown). Unexpectedly, overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant MKP-1C258S also blocks the KLF5si-induced apoptosis as efficiently as WT MKP-1. As a dominant negative MKP-1 mutant, MKP-1C258S increases the pERK levels (Fig. 2A). Consistently, the expression level of MKP-1C258S is higher than that of WT MKP-1 presumably because a high level of pERK stabilizes the MKP-1 protein (see below in detail). These findings suggest that overexpression of MKP-1 can partially rescue the KLF5si-induced apoptosis in MCF10A. KLF5 is a well established transcriptional factor regulating transcription of a number of genes. To test whether MKP-1 is a KLF5 direct transcriptional target, we examined MKP-1 expression at the protein level by Western blot and the mRNA level by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR after knocking down and overexpressing KLF5. To our surprise, KLF5si decreases MKP-1 expression at the protein level but not at the mRNA level in both MCF10A and BT20 cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, KLF5 overexpression increases the expression of MKP-1 at the protein level but not at the mRNA level in both Hs578T and MCF7 (Fig. 3, C and D). Finally, we found that KLF5 cannot activate the MKP-1 promoter in MCF7 by dual luciferase reporter assays (data not shown). These results suggest that MKP-1 is not a KLF5 direct transcription target gene in breast cells. MKP-1 is a short-lived protein (the half-life is about 45 min in fibroblasts) degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (25Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To investigate whether KLF5 regulates MKP-1 protein stability, we performed CHX chase assays and found that KLF5 knockdown in MCF10A cells decreases the endogenous MKP-1 protein half-life (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistently, KLF5 overexpression clearly increases the MKP-1 protein half-life in Hs578T (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that KLF5 decreases MKP-1 protein degradation in breast cells. The proteasomal degradation of MKP-1 has been demonstrated to be inhibited by pERK-mediated MKP-1 phosphorylation at Ser-359 and Ser-364 residues (25Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Additionally, the SCFSKP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase has been suggested to promote MKP-1 ubiquitin-mediated degradation (26Lin Y.W. Yang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We first found that KLF5si does not increase the SKP2 expression levels in MCF10A and BT20 (data not shown). Then, we determined whether KLF5 stabilizes MKP-1 via pERK-mediated MKP-1 phosphorylation because KLF5 up-regulates the pERK levels in TSU-Pr1 (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and KLF5si decreases the pERK levels in MCF10A (Fig. 2A). Indeed, inhibition of pERK, but not JNK and p38, by pharmacological inhibitors dramatically decreases the MKP-1 protein level in MCF10A (Fig. 5A). Consistently, KLF5si reduces the serum-induced pERK and MKP-1 levels in MCF10A (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that both the MEK inhibitor U0126 and KLF5si dramatically decrease pERK levels and MKP-1 phosphorylation at Ser-359 by using an antibody that specifically recognizes the pMKP-1Ser-359 (Fig. 5C). Additionally, we found that KLF5 overexpression up-regulates pERK, pMKP-1Ser-359, and total MKP-1 levels in Hs578T. When pERK is inhibited by U0126, KLF5 overexpression fails to increase the levels of pMKP-1Ser-359 and total MKP-1 in Hs578T (Fig. 5D). Finally, the constitutive activation of ERK by overexpression of constitutively activated MEK1 can completely rescue the KLF5si-induced pMKP-1Ser-359 and total MKP-1 down-regulation in MCF10A (Fig. 5E). These results strongly suggest that KLF5 stabilizes MKP-1 through activation of ERK. To further confirm that phosphorylation of MKP-1 at Ser-359/Ser-364 is essential for KLF5-mediated MKP-1 protein stabilization, we generated a MKP-1 mutant in which both Ser-359 and Ser-364 residues were replaced with Ala. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, WT MKP-1 can be stabilized by KLF5 overexpression in HEK293T cells. However, the MKP-1S359A/S364A mutant cannot be stabilized by KLF5 under the same conditions. Consistently, the mutant MKP-1 shows a shorter half-life than WT MKP-1 presumably due to lack of phosphorylation at Ser-359 and Ser-364 by pERK (Fig. 6, C and D). The degradation of MKP-1S359A/S364A is still through proteasome because the proteasome inhibitor MG132 can dramatically protect it from degradation in HEK293T cells (Fig. 6E). A recent study in our laboratory showed that KLF5 directly regulates transcription of the FGF-BP in breast cells. 3H. Q. Zheng, Z. Zhou, L. Chaudhury, J. T. Dong, and C. Chen, unpublished data. Because FGF-BP has been reported to activate ERK signaling (33Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40247-40253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that KLF5 up-regulates the pERK level through FGF-BP. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down both KLF5 and FGF-BP individually in MCF10A. As shown in Fig. 7A, knockdown of either KLF5 or FGF-BP decreases the pERK, pMKP-1Ser-359, and total MKP-1 levels. Additionally, we found that KLF5 cannot increase the MKP-1 protein level in the presence of FGF-BP siRNA in MCF7 (Fig. 7B). Thus, KLF5 may activate ERK-MKP-1 signaling through FGF-BP in breast cells (Fig. 7C). Accumulated evidence suggests that KLF5 is a pro-survival factor. First, KLF5 has been shown to promote leukemia cell survival through directly inducing the Survivin gene expression (9Zhu N. Gu L. Findley H.W. Chen C. Dong J.T. Yang L. Zhou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14711-14718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Second, KLF5 was reported to promote cell survival by directly promoting the survival kinase Pim1 expression in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line (10Zhao Y. Hamza M.S. Leong H.S. Lim C.B. Pan Y.F. Cheung E. Soo K.C. Iyer N.G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, KLF5 promotes HeLa and NIH-3T3 cell survival from tumor necrosis factor-α through interacting with PARP1 (11Suzuki T. Nishi T. Nagino T. Sasaki K. Aizawa K. Kada N. Sawaki D. Munemasa Y. Matsumura T. Muto S. Sata M. Miyagawa K. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, the cardiovascular apoptosis is significantly increased in KLF5 heterozygous knock-out mice (11Suzuki T. Nishi T. Nagino T. Sasaki K. Aizawa K. Kada N. Sawaki D. Munemasa Y. Matsumura T. Muto S. Sata M. Miyagawa K. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). High expression levels of KLF5 mRNA have been shown to be a prognostic factor for shorter disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with breast cancer (4Tong D. Czerwenka K. Heinze G. Ryffel M. Schuster E. Witt A. Leodolter S. Zeillinger R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 2442-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggest that KLF5 is expressed in immortalized breast epithelial cell lines and a subset of estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cell lines (27Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6567-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 3H. Q. Zheng, Z. Zhou, L. Chaudhury, J. T. Dong, and C. Chen, unpublished data. However, the role of KLF5 and the mechanism by which KLF5 functions in the breast have not been well studied. In this study, we showed that KLF5 promotes breast cell survival through the FGF-BP-pERK-MKP-1 signaling axis. First, we demonstrated that depletion of endogenous KLF5 or MKP-1 in two breast cell lines, MCF10A and BT20, induces apoptosis (Fig. 1). Next, we found that KLF5 maintains and increases the pro-survival phosphatase MKP-1 protein levels in breast cells (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Following that, we demonstrated that MKP-1 can partially rescue KLF5 knockdown-induced apoptosis in MCF10A (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we characterized the mechanism by which KLF5 up-regulates MKP-1 in breast cells and found that KLF5 decreases MKP-1 protein degradation via pERK-mediated MKP-1 phosphorylation (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Finally, we showed that KLF5 activates ERK signaling through its direct target gene FGF-BP (Fig. 7). Multiple lines of evidence suggests that KLF5 up-regulates MKP-1 expression through activating the ERK signaling. First, KLF5 does not directly regulate the MKP-1 gene at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3). Second, KLF5 increases MKP-1 protein stability (Fig. 4). Third, KLF5 maintains and increases pERK levels in multiple breast cell lines, and pERK is sufficient and essential for KLF5-mediated MKP-1 stabilization (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Additionally, we confirmed that the pMKP-1Ser-359 is regulated by KLF5-FGF-BP-pERK signaling (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Furthermore, the mutation of two key pERK phosphorylation sites (S359A/S364A) in MKP-1 abrogates KLF5-mediated MKP-1 stabilization (Fig. 6). These findings strongly suggest that KLF5 up-regulates MKP-1 via pERK-mediated MKP-1 protein phosphorylation and stabilization (Fig. 7C). As described in the Introduction, pERK can increase MKP-1 expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Wang Z. Xu J. Zhou J.Y. Liu Y. Wu G.S.

Indeed, we found that KLF5 increases the MKP-1 mRNA levels in TSU-Pr1 (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, MKP-1 mRNA levels are not regulated by KLF5 in tested breast cell lines. It is possible that the signaling transduction from pERK to MKP-1 transcription is inactive in breast cells. The phosphorylation mediated protein stabilization is the primary mechanism by which pERK increases MKP-1 expression in breast cells. To understand the mechanism by which KLF5 up-regulates ERK signaling, we tested the possibility that KLF5 up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor, a known KLF5 target gene in squamous epithelial cells (34Yang Y. Goldstein B.G. Nakagawa H. Katz J.P. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and a well known receptor tyrosine kinase activating ERK. However, we did not detect any changes of epidermal growth factor receptor expression when KLF5 is knocked down in MCF10A (data not shown). A recent study in our laboratory indicated that KLF5 directly controls transcription of the FGF-BP gene in breast cells. 3H. Q. Zheng, Z. Zhou, L. Chaudhury, J. T. Dong, and C. Chen, unpublished data. FGF-BP is a secreted protein that can bind to fibroblast growth factors and promote FGF receptor-mediated ERK activation (33Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40247-40253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We subsequently tested if FGF-BP mediates ERK activation and MKP-1 stabilization by KLF5. As expected, knockdown of either KLF5 or FGF-BP dramatically decreases the pERK, pMKP-1Ser-359, and total MKP-1 levels in MCF10A (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, knockdown of FGF-BP abrogates the KLF5 overexpression induced up-regulation of pERK, pMKP-1Ser-359, and total MKP-1 in MCF7 (Fig. 7B). These findings support the KLF5-FGF-BP-pERK-MKP-1 linear model proposed in Fig. 7C although it may be oversimplified under physiological conditions. A surprising finding of this study is that MKP-1 can promote MCF10A cell survival in a phosphatase activity independent manner (Fig. 2). It has been reported that the phosphatase activity is essential for the anti-apoptotic function of MKP-1 after UV treatment in human fibroblasts (35Hamdi M. Kool J. Cornelissen-Steijger P. Carlotti F. Popeijus H.E. van der Burgt C. Janssen J.M. Yasui A. Hoeben R.C. Terleth C. Mullenders L.H. van Dam H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7135-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because MKP-1 can de-phosphorylate multiple MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38, overexpression of the catalytically inactive MKP-1C258S mutant may increase multiple MAPKs at the same time. Indeed, we found that the pERK levels are dramatically increased in the MKP-1C258S overexpressing MCF10A cells due to the lack of negative feedback control (Fig. 2A). Because the balance between the pro-survival pERK level and the pro-apoptosis pJNK/pp38 levels determines whether cells will live or die (16Junttila M.R. Li S.P. Westermarck J. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 954-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), it is possible that the elevated pERK levels contribute to the pro-survival function of MKP-1C258S in MCF10A. Besides MKP-1, KLF5 may promote breast cell survival through other downstream genes and pathways because MKP-1 can only partially rescue KLF5 depletion-induced apoptosis in MCF10A (Fig. 2). Other signal pathways may contribute to the function of KLF5 on cell survival as well. For example, KLF5 has been shown to increase the pAKT levels in TSU-Pr1 (3Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AKT has been well documented to promote cell survival through blocking the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins (12Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4763) Google Scholar). Indeed, we confirmed that both KLF5 and FGF-BP inhibition decreases the pAKT levels in MCF10A (data not shown). Thus, it is most likely that KLF5 promotes breast cell survival through multiple pathways, including FGF-BP-pERK-MKP-1 and FGF-BP-pAKT. Besides FGF-BP, we cannot completely exclude that KLF5 up-regulates the pERK level and breast cell survival through other target genes such as SURVIVIN and PIM1 and other mechanisms, such as interaction with PARP1. In summary, we showed that KLF5 is a pro-survival transcription factor in breast cells. KLF5 functions partially through pERK-mediated MKP-1 protein phosphorylation and stabilization. Finally, we found that KLF5 may up-regulate the pERK levels through the direct target gene FGF-BP in breast cells. The KLF5-FGF-BP-pERK-MKP-1 signaling axis may provide new therapeutic targets for invasive breast cancer. We are grateful to Dr. A. Aplin for providing the constitutively activated MEK1 plasmid and Dr. P. McKeown-Longo for providing SB203580."
https://openalex.org/W2090989739,"Bacteriophages specific for Escherichia coli K1 express a tailspike protein that degrades the polysialic acid coat of E. coli K1 that is essential for bacteriophage infection. This enzyme is specific for polysialic acid and is a member of a family of endo-sialidases. This family is unusual because all other previously reported sialidases outside of this family are exo- or trans-sialidases. The recently determined structure of an endo-sialidase derived from bacteriophage K1F (endoNF) revealed an active site that lacks a number of the residues that are conserved in other sialidases, implying a new, endo-sialidase-specific catalytic mechanism. Using synthetic trifluoromethylumbelliferyl oligosialoside substrates, kinetic parameters for hydrolysis at a single cleavage site were determined. Measurement of kcat/Km at a series of pH values revealed a dependence on a single protonated group of pKa 5. Mutation of a putative active site acidic residue, E581A, resulted in complete loss of sialidase activity. Direct 1H NMR analysis of the hydrolysis of trifluoromethylumbelliferyl sialotrioside revealed that endoNF is an inverting sialidase. All other wild type sialidases previously reported are retaining glycosidases, implying a new mechanism of sialidase action specific to this family of endo-sialidases."
https://openalex.org/W2091591103,"Herpes simplex virus-1 is a large double-stranded DNA virus that is self-sufficient in a number of genome transactions. Hence, the virus encodes its own DNA replication apparatus and is capable of mediating recombination reactions. We recently reported that the catalytic subunit of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase (UL30) exhibits apurinic/apyrimidinic and 5'-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activities that are integral to base excision repair. Base excision repair is required to maintain genome stability as a means to counter the accumulation of unusual bases and to protect from the loss of DNA bases. Here we have reconstituted a system with purified HSV-1 and human proteins that perform all the steps of uracil DNA glycosylase-initiated base excision repair. In this system nucleotide incorporation is dependent on the HSV-1 uracil DNA glycosylase (UL2), human AP endonuclease, and the HSV-1 DNA polymerase. Completion of base excision repair can be mediated by T4 DNA ligase as well as human DNA ligase I or ligase IIIalpha-XRCC1 complex. Of these, ligase IIIalpha-XRCC1 is the most efficient. Moreover, ligase IIIalpha-XRCC1 confers specificity onto the reaction in as much as it allows ligation to occur in the presence of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase processivity factor (UL42) and prevents base excision repair from occurring with heterologous DNA polymerases. Completion of base excision repair in this system is also dependent on the incorporation of the correct nucleotide. These findings demonstrate that the HSV-1 proteins in combination with cellular factors that are not encoded by the virus are capable of performing base excision repair. These results have implications on the role of base excision repair in viral genome maintenance during lytic replication and reactivation from latency."
https://openalex.org/W2020411990,"In addition to their capacity for template-directed 5' --> 3' DNA synthesis at the polymerase (pol) site, DNA polymerases have a separate 3' --> 5' exonuclease (exo) editing activity that is involved in assuring the fidelity of DNA replication. Upon misincorporation of an incorrect nucleotide residue, the 3' terminus of the primer strand at the primer-template (P/T) junction is preferentially transferred to the exo site, where the faulty residue is excised, allowing the shortened primer to rebind to the template strand at the pol site and incorporate the correct dNTP. Here we describe the conformational changes that occur in the primer strand as it shuttles between the pol and exo sites of replication-competent Klenow and Klentaq DNA polymerase complexes in solution and use these conformational changes to measure the equilibrium distribution of the primer between these sites for P/T DNA constructs carrying both matched and mismatched primer termini. To this end, we have measured the fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra at wavelengths of >300 nm for conformational probes comprising pairs of 2-aminopurine bases site-specifically replacing adenine bases at various positions in the primer strand of P/T DNA constructs bound to DNA polymerases. Control experiments that compare primer conformations with available x-ray structures confirm the validity of this approach. These distributions and the conformational changes in the P/T DNA that occur during template-directed DNA synthesis in solution illuminate some of the mechanisms used by DNA polymerases to assure the fidelity of DNA synthesis."
