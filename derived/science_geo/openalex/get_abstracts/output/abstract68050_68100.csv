https://openalex.org/W2032918135,"A thermophilic, acidophilic procaryote lacking a cell wall has been isolated from a coal refuse pile which had undergone self-heating. Electron micrographs, chemical assays for hexosamine, and the inability of vancomycin to inhibit growth confirm the lack of a cell wall. The apparent ability of the organism to reproduce by budding and the low guanine plus cytosine content of its DNA indicate a relation to the mycoplasmas. The temperature optimum of the organism is 59 degrees C, and growth occurs over a range of 45 degrees to 62 degrees C. No growth occurs at 37 degrees C or at 65 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth is between 1 and 2, and growth occurs between pH 0.96 and 3.5 but does not occur at pH 0.35 and only poorly at pH 4.0. We propose to call this organism Thermoplasma acidophila. The existence of this organism extends considerably the range of habitats in which mycoplasma may occur."
https://openalex.org/W2041089401,"Improved methods for rearing and screening large numbers of flies permitted the recovery of 10 mutations exhibiting a reversible temperature-dependent adult paralysis among 1.1×106 flies tested. Of the 10 mutations, two were allelic to parats,two were alleles in a new locus, stoned (stn), and six fell into a third area, the shibire (shi) locus. Several of the shi alleles cause embryonic, larval and adult paralysis at 29° C as well as structural anomalies of various tissues. In addition to the ts mutations, several non-conditional mutations affecting adult movement were recovered."
https://openalex.org/W1992759994,"The slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was investigated in frog sympathetic ganglion cells. In contrast to the increased conductance associated with other known EPSP's, during the slow EPSP resting membrane conductance was decreased. Electrical depolarization of the membrane potentiated the slow EPSP, whereas progressive hyperpolarization decreased its size and then reversed it to a hyperpolarizing potential (the opposite of the effect of membrane polarization on other EPSP's). The reversal potential of the slow EPSP was close to the potassium equilibrium potential. We propose that the slow EPSP, in contrast to classical EPSP's, is generated by an inactivation of resting potassium conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1976343208,"Adult crickets have stereotyped patterns of motor output which are generated by the central nervous system, and which serve as a standard against which emerging nymphal patterns can be measured. The neural circuits generating these patterns are not functional at hatching. The pattern elements appear in an ordered sequence over the course of the last four molts. The circuits are completely functional before the final molt. Circuits which might be prematurely activated are suppressed in the nymph by descending inhibition from the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2047406530,"Isoleucine has been found to undergo a slow racemization reaction in a 5-meter sediment core taken from the Atlantis fracture zone (water depth, 4014 meters; actual location, 30°15.7′N, 43°18.9′W). The amount of racemization increases with increasing depth below the sediment-seawater interface. This isoleucine racemization reaction was used to calculate an age of 1.23 million years for the bottom of the core."

https://openalex.org/W2029023004,"Thirsty rodents will persistently lick a stream of dry air pumped through a standard drinking tube. This air-licking is attenuated by experimental manipulations which reduce the evaporative cooling of the tongue and mouth produced by the airstream. This suggests that such cooling is itself an effective reward for thirstry rodents. We tested this hypothesis by presenting thirsty rodents with a piece of cold, dry metal. Different species spent from 9 to 40 percent of their session time licking the cold metal. When deprived of water hamsters reared from birth without access to drinking water licked cold metal in preference to metal maintained at room or body temperature. This preference was approximately equal to that of littermates reared normally. We conclude that tongue cooling is a primary reward for thirsty rodents."

The acute toxicity of mercury compounds to phytoplankton is dependent on the chemical nature of the mercury compound and on cell concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2050027251,"From the change in the nuclear magnetic resonance splitting of heavy water in oriented wet collagen fibers at low temperatures, it is estimated that about 0.6 gram of heavy water per gram of collagen does not freeze. This estimate has been confirmed by a measurement of the heat evolved on melting ""frozen"" wet collagen. The water that does not freeze retains liquid-like mobility even at temperatures as low as -50 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W2073069198,"Delayed hypersensitivity reactions in vivo are exquisitely specific, in terms of both a lack of response after induction of tolerance and a response after sensitization. These studies in vitro demonstrate that this specificity, at least at the level of antigen recognition, is probably derived from different populations of cells, each responding to different antigens."

https://openalex.org/W2033580181,"The fluorocitrate isomer that is a strong inhibitor and inactivator of aconitase has been shown by x-ray crystallographic studies on the rubidium ammonium salt to have the configurations (1R : 2R) or (1S : 2S) 1-fluoro-2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid. A possible mechanism for the action of fluorocitrate is proposed which involves the 1R : 2R isomer suggested from biochemical data."

https://openalex.org/W1985467494,Skeletal muscle extracts from mice with muscular dystrophy contain severalfold higher than normal levels of free alkaline ribonuclease II activity and none of the free ribonuclease inhibitor normally present. This abnormal pattern is not seen in heart or liver extracts from dystrophic mice.

https://openalex.org/W2057715911,"A gene (Adhr(r)) which controls the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in the scutellum of maize has been found. This gene is not allelic to the Adh(1) locus, which specifies the charge of the enzyme molecule and hence its migration rate. The two genes are linked and located about 17 crossover units apart. The Adh(r)(N) allele specifies equal activities of both the Adh(1)(S) and Adh(1)(F) products. The Adh(r)(L) allele gives lower activities of the Adh(1)(S) products only and operates in both the cis and the trans configurations."

https://openalex.org/W2068266652,Electrical stimulation of area 18 of the cat visual cortex produces intense excitation of neurons in the superior colliculus. Excitation is followed by a period of decreased collicular responsiveness to light stimulation. These effects are seen in both directionally selective and nonselective units. The corticocollicular projection is retinotopically organized.

https://openalex.org/W2062456615,The skull of a young adult male Amerind from a grave at a coastal site in southern Connecticut bears a largely cicatrized elliptical anomaly near bregma. Some evidence suggests deliberate antemortem trephination of the scraping type. The specimen is of interest since perhaps fewer than twenty human skulls have been advanced as putative cases of trephining by North American aborigines.

https://openalex.org/W2028565647,"MOUSE skin has been used for many years as a convenient tissue for the assay of tumorigenic properties of tobacco condensates. This testing is prolonged and expensive, and the value of the results obtained is controversial; it is therefore desirable to find a way of shortening the experimental procedure. Sebaceous glands provide a convenient route of entry for substances painted on to the skin, and in particular for the lipid soluble carcinogenic hydrocarbons found in tobacco condensates, which can, in fact, be labelled and located in these glands. Polycyclic hydrocarbons in particular have been used to demonstrate the possibility of using destruction of sebaceous glands to indicate potential carcinogenic activity, and Bock and Mund1,2 showed that if compounds with a benzanthracene structure are used the degree of destruction is related to tumorigenic activity. Unfortunately, some carcinogenic substances in which the benzanthracene structure is absent (for example, 7,9-dimethylbenz(c)-acridine) do not destroy the sebaceous glands; but this does not apply to tobacco condensates3."
