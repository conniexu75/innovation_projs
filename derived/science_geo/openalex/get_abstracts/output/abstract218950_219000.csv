Bruce [ Science 134, 1049 (1961)], the acknowledgement (p. 1054, reference 31) should have read: It is a pleasure to express our thanks to Dr. Dorothy Price for calling our attention to the work of Jan Martan on the supracaudal glands of the guinea pig. ."

https://openalex.org/W2000563914,"The wavelength of a discriminative stimulus exerted no control over the behavior of ducklings raised in a monochromatic environment. Stimulus control was established, however, when responding was reinforced in the presence of one wavelength and not in the presence of another."

https://openalex.org/W2009848611,"Children with phenylketonuria excrete considerably less serotonin and tryptamine and somewhat less normetanephrine and p-tyramine than normal children. The excretion of these amines was not decreased in mongolism. Even during monoamine oxidase blockade, o-tyramine could not be detected in the urine of phenylketonurics. These findings are discussed in relation to the mental defect of phenylketonuria."

https://openalex.org/W2078312195,"A new molecular species of human transferrin, Tf $$Word$$, is described. Starch gel electrophoresis under high-voltage conditions permits the new variant to be clearly distinguished from previously described variants of closely similar mobilities. The presence of a faint iron-binding component which migrates slightly more rapidly than the principal transferrin with which it is associated is also described."

https://openalex.org/W2037709566,"THE function of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the tissues of the small intestine is not understood even though it is found in relatively large quantities, particularly in the enterochromaffin cells1. The most frequently repeated interpretation ascribes control of intestinal motility and vascular permeability to serotonin2,3. Thus, if the tonus of the gut is dependent on serotonin-levels, germ-free animals, which possess poor tonus of the tract and distended caeca4, might be expected to have a lower serotonin content in the gut than conventional animals. On the contrary, however, this communication provides evidence that intestinal serotonin-levels are actually depressed by the presence of micro-organisms in the lumen of the gut."

https://openalex.org/W2027035329,"TRANSFER of experimental glomerulonephritis on originally healthy rats has been accomplished in this and other laboratories by means of parabiosis1,2. Transfer was observed in random-bred as well as in inbred rats, either in short-term experiments or after intervals up to 71 days between institution of nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis in the primarily nephritic animal, and parabiotic conjunction with the originally healthy partner3–5. Fluorescein-labelled antisera were used to exclude the involvement of the primarily injected heterologous (rabbit) antibodies in the transfer phenomenon6. From these experiments it was derived that a secondary nephritis-producing factor, appearing as a consequence of the nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis in the circulation of the primarily nephritic rat, was transferred to the primarily healthy animal capable of attacking the corresponding organs of the latter."

https://openalex.org/W2166729414,"The synthesis of 2-amino-3-methyl-4-pentynoic acid with a configuration corresponding to alloisoleucine has been reported (4), and a partial hydrogenation of this compound would afford a method of obtaining w-dehydroalloisoleucine. However, in the method of synthesis of 2-amino-3-methyl-4-pentynoic acid herein reported, a mixture of both of the diastereoisomeric forms of the acetylenic derivatives was obtained. Subsequent fractional recrystallization of the mixture separated the isomers into the two racemic forms. Partial hydrogenation of the appropriate triple bond compound produced either w-dehydroisoleucine or w-dehydroalloisoleucine, and complete hydrogenation yielded the anticipated nn-isoleucine or nn-alloisoleucine. The ethylenic analogues are more effective growth inhibitors than the acetylenic deriviatives for Escherichia coli, but for Lactobacillus arabinosus the relative inhibitory activity depends upon whether the antagonism of isoleucine or of valine is being determined. Under appropriate conditions, antagonism of both isoleucine and valine by these analogues can be demonstrated with both organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2049200027,Extrasystoles are known to occur in some healthy individuals during common respiratory maneuvers such as holding the breath. Evidence is presented which shows that under controlled laboratory conditions this kind of extrasystole can be conditioned. Conditional stimuli signaling inspiration and expiration acquired the properties of the respiratory maneuvers by inducing extrasystoles during normal breathing.

Spink2 reviewed the actions of snake venom and endotoxin, and concluded that their mechanism of action is similar; however, in recent studies Condie et al.3 showed that there are few parallels between the biological responses of rabbits to Escherichia coli endotoxin and Agkistrodon piscivorus venom and that the two toxins are distinct immunochemically."

https://openalex.org/W2040059513,"A NUMBER of methods have been described for testing residual insecticides against various insects, and for the bio-assay of insecticide deposits on treated surfaces. In general these entail confining the insects for testing under a transparent container on the treated surface for a certain time of exposure, and measuring the mortality after holding in clean cages for a further period. Wiesmann1 used halves of Petri dishes, while Hadaway and Barlow2 used glass tubes, inverted funnels and ‘Perspex’ cylinders."
