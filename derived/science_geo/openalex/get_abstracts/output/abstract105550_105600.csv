https://openalex.org/W1507160997,"Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that plays an important role in angiogenesis, promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 11 proteins in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of control- and VEGF-stimulated BAEC with antisera to phospholipase C- γ (PLC- γ) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P. Evaluation of the Western blots with antisera to phosphotyrosine demonstrated that PLC- γ and two proteins (100 and 85 kDa) that associate with PLC- γ were phosphorylated in response to VEGF. By using antisera specific to other mediators of signal transduction that contain SH2 domains for immunoprecipitation, it was demonstrated that VEGF promotes phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP), and the oncogenic adaptor protein NcK. Proteins of Mr consistent with the VEGF receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR were also tyrosine phosphorylated in stimulated cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Nck, PLC- γ, and two GAP-associated proteins, p190 and p62, were in GAP immunoprecipitates of VEGF-stimulated BAEC, and tyrosine-phosphorylated NcK was in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase immunoprecipitates. These observations suggest that VEGF promotes formation of multimeric aggregates of VEGF receptors with proteins that contain SH2 domains and activate various signaling pathways. VEGF-promoted proliferation of endothelial cells and tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2 domain containing signaling molecules were inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting from pre-existing endothelium, is a significant component of a wide variety of biological processes, including embryonic vascular development and differentiation, wound healing, organ regeneration, and pathological processes including tumorigenesis(1Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proliferation of capillary endothelial cells, migration of capillary tubules, and extracellular matrix degradation are important steps in angiogenesis. A variety of growth factors are associated with this process, including tumor necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor, angiogenin, and prostaglandin E2(1Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these factors are believed to induce angiogenesis indirectly. Other growth factors important to angiogenesis, such as acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and plateletderived growth factor, are mitogens for a large number of cell types(1Klagsbrun M.

The first step in VEGF action is binding to either of two receptor protein tyrosine kinases, Flk-1/KDR or Flt-1(17De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T.

Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Signaling by such receptors initiates with activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase followed by autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor(22Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Such tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors are recognized by cytoplasmic signaling molecules that connect the activated receptor to transduction cascades and promote cellular responses(23Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). The signaling molecules contain a conserved sequence of approximately 100 amino acids called the Src homology region 2 (the SH2 domain)(24Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 491-495PubMed Google Scholar), which directs their interaction with growth factor receptors phosphorylated on tyrosine residues(25Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction is defined by the amino acids surrounding the phosphotyrosine and the amino acid sequence of the SH2 domain. However, this model is untested insofar as VEGF is concerned, and the downstream signaling molecules activated by this mitogen have not been identified. In the present study, VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylations in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) have been characterized. We report that this mitogen promotes the tyrosine phosphorylations of numerous proteins, among which are four proteins that contain SH2 domains: PLC- γ, GAP, PI-3 kinase, and NcK; inhibition of these phosphorylation reactions is associated with diminished ability of VEGF to promote cell proliferation. Recombinant human VEGF was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (RC20) and agarose-conjugated monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antisera to PLC- γ, NcK, and GAP and polyclonal antiserum to PI-3 kinase were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. BAEC (a gift from Dr. Eric Jaffee, Cornell University Medical College, NY) were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in medium 199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 80 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. For experiments testing the ability of VEGF to promote tyrosine phosphorylations, near confluent cells were incubated in serum-free medium 199 for 16-18 h, washed once with serum-free medium 199, and cultured in this medium in the absence or presence of 1 nM VEGF for 5 min at 37°C. For immunoprecipitations with antisera to phosphotyrosine, NcK, and PI-3 kinase, 1 × 107 BAEC were lysed by incubation in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate for 20 min at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation using antisera to GAP and PLC- γ, 2 × 107 BAEC were used, and EGTA and EDTA were excluded from the lysis buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). Supernatants were shaken with antisera for 2 h at 4°C, after which 50 μl of a slurry of protein G-plus/protein A-agarose was added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4°C. The incubate was centrifuged for 5 s, and the agarose was washed with lysis buffer and recentrifuged. This process was repeated three times, after which Laemmli medium was added to the agarose, which was heated at 100°C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on 7.5% acrylamide gels and blotted to Immobilon-P (Millipore) during an overnight transfer. The immunoblots were blocked by incubation in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The immunoblots were then incubated with TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin and the primary antibody for 1-2 h at room temperature while being constantly shaken, washed three times with TBST, and then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. The enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL) was used for protein detection. To probe immunoblots with a second antiserum, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50°C. The blots were then incubated with antisera and processed as described above. Proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of BAEC using antisera to PLC- γ, GAP, PI-3 kinase, or Nck were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to Immobilon-P. The Western blots were incubated with antisera to PLC- γ, GAP, PI-3 kinase, or Nck. The antisera to PLC- γ, GAP, and PI-3 kinase each recognized a single protein of Mr corresponding to PLC- γ, GAP, and PI-3 kinase, respectively. The antisera to Nck recognized two proteins, Nck and PLC- γ, which was expected as these proteins contain a common antigenic epitope that is probably near their SH3 domains(26Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5843-5856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether tyrosine kinase activation is a component of VEGF signaling, phosphoproteins from control- and VEGF-stimulated BAEC were immunoprecipitated with antisera to phosphotyrosine, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 1A (leftpanel), incubation of BAEC with 1 nM VEGF for 5 min promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of Mr 200, 120, 80, 70, and 47. By extending the exposure time of film to the Western blot, it was possible to additionally detect VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Mr 145, 130, 62, 52, 42, and 32 proteins (Fig. 1A, rightpanel). The Mr values of several protein substrates for VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation were consistent with those of signaling molecules implicated in the actions of other angiogenic factors, such as PDGF and EGF. Among these were 145-kDa PLC- γ, 120-kDa GAP, the 85-kDa subunit of PI-3 kinase, and the 47-kDa oncogene ncK, which were investigated further. To determine whether PLC- γ is involved in VEGF signaling, serum-starved BAEC were incubated with 1 nM VEGF for 5 min at 37°C. PLC- γ in cell lysates was then immunoprecipitated and separated from other proteins by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation state of PCL- γ from control and VEGF-treated cells was evaluated by Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As illustrated by Fig. 1B, phosphorylation of 145-kDa PLC- γ, and two proteins (100 and 85 kDa) known to associate with PLC- γ(27Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was stimulated by VEGF. Also phosphorylated in response to VEGF were a 200-kDa protein, which is probably Flk-1(18Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 20Terman B.C. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E.

Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), and NcK, a 47-kDa protein that contains an epitope recognized by some antisera to PLC- γ (27Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of NcK in response to treatment of BAEC with VEGF was confirmed using antisera to NcK for immunoprecipitation, after which Western blots of SDS-PAGE-fractionated proteins were probed with antiphosphotyrosine antisera (Fig. 1D). These experiments showed that phosphorylation of Nck, two associated proteins (85 and 75 kDa), and probably Flk-1 was increased by VEGF. The 55-kDa protein detected by Western blotting was the IgG heavy chain of the NcK antiserum. Control experiments (Fig. 1, C and E) validated that equal amounts of PLC- γ and NcK were present in lysates of control- and VEGF-treated cells, showing that the increased signal detected by phosphotyrosine antibodies on Western blots did result from augmented phosphorylation. We next investigated whether another SH2 containing protein, GAP is a substrate for VEGF-promoted phosphorylation. Western blots of proteins from anti-GAP immunoprecipitates were probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, revealing that phosphorylation of 120-kDa GAP, a 110-kDa GAP degradation product(28Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Wong G. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1990; 61: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and two GAP-associated proteins, p190 (29Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and p62(30Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), was stimulated by VEGF (Fig. 2A), comparable amounts of GAP being present in lysates of control- and VEGF-treated cells (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation of 155-, 145-, and 47-kDa proteins in GAP immunoprecipitates was also augmented by VEGF; these may be Flt-1(17De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), PLC- γ, and NcK, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation of NcK was demonstrated by stripping the Western blot shown in Fig. 2A, which was probed with antisera to NcK (Fig. 2C). In a separate experiment, a Western blot of proteins from anti-GAP immunoprecipitates was probed with PLC- γ Ab (Fig. 2D), which led to the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC- γ in immunoprecipitates of VEGF-treated but not control cells. Another possible substrate for VEGF-promoted phosphorylation suggested by immunoprecipitations with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1A) is PI-3 kinase. To test this, BAEC were stimulated with VEGF, and PI-3 kinase was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3A) from cell lysates containing equal amounts of the protein (Fig. 3B). After SDS-PAGE, Western blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to permit evaluation of the effect of VEGF on the phosphorylation of PI-3 kinase. Phosphorylation of the 85- and 110-kDa subunits of PI-3 kinase, and a 190-kDa protein, which may correspond to a complex of the 110- and 85-kDa proteins, was increased by VEGF. The 47-kDa phosphoprotein substrate for VEGF was confirmed as NcK by stripping the Western blot shown in Fig. 3A and then reprobing with NcK antisera (Fig. 3C). Finally, we determined whether tyrosine phosphorylations promoted by VEGF could be related to the proliferative response elicited by this mitogen from BAEC. As shown in Fig. 4A, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suppressed the ability of VEGF to promote tyrosine phosphorylations. Fig. 4B shows that the diminished tyrosine phosphorylations were accompanied by an attenuation in the ability of VEGF to promote a proliferative response from BAEC. Activation of growth factor receptors promotes a cascade of intracellular phosphorylations that ultimately produces cellular responses. Tyrosine phosphorylations are most particularly associated with the proliferative response of cells to mitogens, which led us to investigate whether VEGF might promote such reactions. The covalent modification of specific tyrosyl residues in growth factor receptors and in signaling molecules is a form of cellular communication (22Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 23Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S.

Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A conserved domain of about 100 amino acids, the SH2 domain, specifically recognizes and binds to phosphotyrosine, thereby promoting interactions of activated receptors and signaling molecules with one another(23Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 24Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 491-495PubMed Google Scholar, 25Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The amino acid motif about the phosphotyrosine and within the SH2 domain lends this process of proteinprotein interaction specificity. The present study demonstrated that the endothelial cell-specific mitogen, VEGF, promotes an array of tyrosine phosphorylations in BAEC. We have identified four signaling molecules that contain SH2 domains (PLC- γ, GAP, NcK, and PI-3 kinase) as among the substrates for VEGF-promoted phosphorylations. By attenuating tyrosine phosphorylations induced by VEGF using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, it was possible to diminish the growth-stimulatory effect of VEGF on BAEC, thereby establishing a relationship between these processes. VEGF stimulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis, increases vascular permeability, induces endothelial cell and monocyte procoagulant activity, and promotes monocyte migration(3Connolly D.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 4Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr.

Med. 1990; 172: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The role of the phosphorylated signaling molecules, identified in the present study, in cellular responses to VEGF is not known but may be tentatively inferred by analogy to other growth factor receptor systems, particularly that for PDGF. Activated PLC- γ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which stimulate calcium release and activate protein kinase C, respectively(32Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI-3 kinase is a heterodimer composed of 85-kDa regulatory and 110-kDa catalytic subunits that promotes phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate on the D3 position of the inositol ring(33Downes C.P. Carter A.N. Cell. Signalling. 1991; 3: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). GAP is a negative regulator of p21ras, a downstream target of many receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(34Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). NcK is an oncogenic protein composed of one SH2 and three SH3 domains that may couple cell surface receptors to downstream effectors that regulate cellular responses induced by receptor activation(27Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When the PI-3 kinase or PLC- γ binding sites on PDGF receptors are mutated and the mutant receptors are expressed in epithelial cells, PDGF-induced mitogenesis is diminished(35Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T.

The role of GAP in mitogenesis is uncertain as DNA synthesis is normal in cells expressing a PDGF receptor mutant that lacks the GAP binding site (35Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T.

PLC- γ, PI-3 kinase, and GAP each modulate PDGF-induced chemotaxis (38Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and PLC- γ may additionally play a role in permeabilization of the endothelium by activating protein kinase C, which promotes this process(39Lynch J.J. Ferro T.J. Blumenstock F.A. Brockenauer A.M. Malik A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF promotes phosphorylation of signaling molecules associated with the production of various second messengers, activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, and induction of diverse types of cellular responses. Stimulation of BAEC with VEGF promotes formation of multimeric aggregates of signaling molecules. Immunoprecipitation of proteins from VEGF-treated BAEC with anti-PLC- γ Ab or anti-NcK Ab resulted in identification not only of phosphorylated PLC- γ and NcK but also two phosphoproteins (100 and 85 kDa) that associate with PLC- γ(27Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates with anti-GAP Ab resulted in identification of phosphorylated GAP, two GAP-associated proteins (p190 and p62)(29Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A.

Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This suggests that GAP•p190 complexes can transduce signals from p21ras to the nucleus, thereby affecting the expression of specific cellular genes. VEGF binds to either of two receptors, 160-kDa Flt-1 (17De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T.

Flk-1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in proliferating endothelial cells of vascular sprouts and branching vessels of embryonic and early postnatal brain but is dramatically reduced in adult, nonproliferating brain(21Millauer B.

Correlation of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Flk-1 to sites of VEGF action is consistent with a role for this receptor in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Expression of Flt-1 in Xenopuslaevis oocytes produced a system in which VEGF induced calcium release(17De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Thus, each VEGF receptor may play a role in promoting cellular responses. In the present study, we detected tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of Mr appropriate to both Flt-1 and Flk-1 when anti-PLC- γ Ab and anti-GAP mAb were used to immunoprecipitate proteins from lysates of VEGF-stimulated cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of GAP with NcK, and PLC- γ and PI-3 kinase with NcK suggests that groups of SH2 containing signaling molecules simultaneously bind to and are activated by tyrosine-phosphorylated VEGF receptors. Preliminary experiments in which an antibody raised to a GST-Flk-1 fusion protein was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from control- and VEGF-treated cells suggest that PLC- γ, GAP, NcK, PI-3 kinase, and other proteins associate with the Flk-1 tyrosine kinase. 2D. Guo and D. B. Donner, unpublished observations. However, unequivocal identification of the downstream mediators of VEGF action that associate with Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1 and the affinity with which such interactions occur must await further studies. These variables are likely to determine which cellular responses are mediated by each type of VEGF receptor. After submission of the present study, Waltenberger et al.(40Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described experiments with porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC), which do not express VEGF receptors, transfected with cDNAs for KDR or Flt-1. In neither PAEC/KDR nor PAEC/Flt-1 was VEGF able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC- γ, nor did either receptor appear to bind PI-3 kinase or GAP, although their activation downstream of Flt-1 and KDR was not ruled out. One explanation for the different signaling events detected in the BAEC used in the present study and in the transfected PAEC is that the latter may lack components of signaling pathways necessary for particular transduction events. Alternatively, the transfected receptors may not have appropriately aggregated or coupled with other signaling molecules despite their presence in PAEC. In summary, the present study demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylations are a component of the signaling system used by VEGF to promote responses. Four signaling molecules that contain SH2 domains, PLC- γ, NcK, GAP, and PI-3 kinase, are tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation of BAEC with VEGF. In other systems, these putative mediators of VEGF action have been associated with altered permeability of cell monolayers to macromolecules, chemotaxis, and cell growth. Tyrosine phosphorylations promoted by VEGF and the ability of VEGF to promote the proliferation of BAEC were reduced in parallel by genistein relating these processes. These observations constitute a considerable step toward defining postreceptor mechanisms that transduce VEGF receptor binding into cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1606337626,"Caveolae are subdomains of the plasma membrane which concentrate cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. It has recently been demonstrated that specific members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases require palmitoylation of NH2-terminal cysteine residues to localize in caveolae. Here we report that caveolin, an integral membrane protein which forms part of the coat of caveolae, also incorporates palmitate through linkage to cysteine residues. Caveolin contains only three cysteine residues which are all located on the COOH-terminal side of the hydrophobic transmembrane region. Immunofluorescent staining of cells transfected with caveolin indicated that, like the NH2 terminus, this COOH-terminal region is located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Studies of cysteine substitution mutants showed that all three cysteines are capable of incorporating palmitate and that the juxtamembrane Cys133 residue is the predominant site of palmitoylation. Simultaneous mutation of all three cysteine residues in caveolin resulted in the loss of ability to incorporate palmitate; however, this did not affect localization of the protein. Thus, palmitoylation of cysteine residues in nonmembrane spanning Src family protein tyrosine kinases has different consequences than in the transmembrane protein caveolin."
https://openalex.org/W1984899973,"The smallest membrane protein shown to catalyze ion-coupled transport is documented in this report. A gene coding for a small 110-amino acid membrane protein (emrE or mvrC) has been previously identified and cloned and shown to render Escherichia coli cells resistant to methyl viologen and to ethidium. In this report, it is shown that the resistance is due to extrusion of the toxic compounds in a process that requires a proton electrochemical gradient rather than ATP. For this purpose, cells in which the unc gene was inactivated were used so that the interconversion between the proton gradient and ATP is not possible, and the effect of agents, which specifically affect either of them, was tested on transport of ethidium in the intact cell. In addition, EmrE has been overexpressed and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Strikingly, the protein can be quantitatively extracted with a mixture of organic solvents such as chloroform:methanol and is practically pure after this extraction. Moreover, after addition of E. coli lipids to the chloroform:methanol extract, EmrE has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes loaded with ammonium chloride. Upon dilution of the proteoliposomes in ammonium-free medium, a pH gradient was formed that drove transport of ethidium and methyl viologen into the proteoliposome. Both substrates compete with each other and exchange with previously transported solute. EmrE is a multidrug transporter of a novel type, and, because of its size and its solubility properties, it provides a unique model to study structure-function aspects of transport reactions in ion-coupled processes.

EmrE is a multidrug transporter of a novel type, and, because of its size and its solubility properties, it provides a unique model to study structure-function aspects of transport reactions in ion-coupled processes. Toxic compounds are part of the natural environment in which living cells dwell, and development of strategies for life in this environment is a necessary trait for survival. Resistance to a wide range of cytotoxic compounds is a common phenomenon observed in many organisms throughout the evolutionary scale. Removal of toxic substances by transport is one of the strategies that have evolved. Multidrug transporters can actively remove a wide variety of substrates in an energy-dependent process and decrease the concentration of the offending compounds near their target. The proteins responsible for performing this task have been found in many organisms from bacteria to man. From analysis of their structure and properties, three families can be distinguished. One of them (ABC type) is best known for the P-glycoprotein in its various forms, which confers multidrug resistance to cancerous cells (Doige and Ames, 1993; Endicott and Ling, 1989; Gottesman and Pastan, 1993; Gros et al., 1986; Higgins, 1992). This family includes also many bacterial transport proteins. The ABC transporters utilize ATP to actively transport a wide variety of compounds. In some of the bacterial transporters, several subunits are required for activity, but in the P-glycoprotein and many others, one large polypeptide seems to be sufficient to perform all of the functions. The other family (TEXANs) includes proteins that render fungi and bacteria resistant to antibiotic treatment (Lewis, 1994; Neyfakh et al., 1991; Nikaido, 1994; Paulsen and Skurray, 1993). The TEXANs are antiporters, 400-500 amino acids long, which exchange various drugs with one or more protons and utilize in this way the proton electrochemical gradient to actively transport a variety of substrates. Proteins in mammals, located in intracellular organelles, which usually transport neurotransmitters such as dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine, also behave as multidrug transporters and belong to the TEXAN family (Schuldiner, 1994; Schuldiner et al., 1995). Very little attention has been paid to bacterial proteins of the third family (MiniTEXANs) (Grinius et al., 1992). They are very small, about 100 amino acids long, and, by analogy to the other known systems, it has been hypothesized that they confer resistance to several antibiotics presumably also by active extrusion. Being the smallest putative ion-coupled transporters known, they roused our attention since they could provide a simple model to study. A variety of genes coding for MiniTEXANs has been identified in several bacteria based on their ability to confer resistance to several drugs (Grinius et al., 1992). One of these genes, emrE or mvrC, is an Escherichia coli gene, which has been identified and cloned on the basis of its ability to confer resistance to ethidium (Purewal, 1991) and to methyl viologen (paraquat) (Morimyo et al., 1992). Previous studies have suggested the existence of an efflux system for toxic cationic compounds in E. coli (Midgley, 1987), and, because of the hydrophobic nature of the predicted polypeptide, it was suggested that EmrE is indeed an efflux system (Purewal, 1991). However, no direct evidence for this suggestion has yet been presented, and the nature of the energy required for extrusion has not been studied. The predicted sequence of EmrE suggests that it is a highly hydrophobic 12-kDa protein (Fig. 1). A hydropathic analysis of the sequence reveals the presence of four putative transmembrane segments with only one charged residue (Glu) in the putative transmembrane domain and a total of eight charged amino acids throughout the protein. A protein similar in size and number of charges, which has been studied in detail by many groups, is subunit c, a small membrane-bound subunit of the H+-ATPase (Fillingame, 1992). Subunit c is also known as the proteolipid because of its solubility in organic solvents. Since subunit c is purified by extraction in a mixture of chloroform and methanol, it was tempting to test a similar extraction procedure for EmrE. In this report, we describe studies in whole cells that provide evidence that EmrE is an antiporter that exchanges ethidium, methyl viologen, and a series of other quaternary compounds with one or more protons. In addition, EmrE displays unique properties that make it soluble in a mixture of organic solvents such as chloroform:methanol. EmrE was overproduced so that it was practically the only protein extractable in the above solvent mixture. The protein thus purified was reconstituted in proteoliposomes, and it catalyzed ΔpH-driven uptake of ethidium and [14C]methyl viologen. Uptake of both substrates was inhibited by a series of toxic cations, and preaccumulated solute exchanged with unlabeled excess substrate. E. coli JM109 (Yanish-Perron et al., 1985), TA15 (Goldberg et al., 1987), and TA15Δunc carrying the deletion unc702 (Harel-Bronstein et al., 1995) were used throughout this work. emrE was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on the published sequence of the gene (Morimyo et al., 1992; Purewal, 1991). The sense primer (CGGAATTCATATGAACCCTTATATTTATCTTG) overlapped with the first ATG in the coding area of the gene and included two restriction sites for cloning (NdeI and EcoRI). The reverse primer (CCGAATTCAAGCTTAATGTGGTGTGCTTCGTGAC) overlapped with the first termination codon after the open reading frame and included sites for the restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using genomic DNA from E. coli EP432 (Pinner et al., 1992), a K12 derivative, as a template. The reaction yielded a 333-base pair segment that was purified, digested with the proper enzymes, and cloned into both pT7-7 (Tabor and Richardson, 1985) predigested with NdeI and HindIII and into pKK223-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) predigested with EcoRI and HindIII. The plasmids obtained were named pT7-32 and pKK56, respectively. pT7-32, which contains the T7 polymerase promoter ϕ10 and the translation start site for the T7 gene 10 protein, was used for labeling EmrE with [35S]methionine essentially as previously described (Pinner et al., 1992). pT7-32 was transformed into TA15 carrying pGP1-2 (Tabor and Richardson, 1985). Transformants were grown at 30°C in minimal medium supplemented with thiamine (2.5 μg/ml), ampicillin and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and 0.5% glucose to a cell density of 0.6 A600. The temperature was then increased to 42°C to induce the T7 polymerase; 15 min later, rifampicin (200 μg/ml) was added, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min. Then, the culture was shifted back to 30°C for 40 min. [35S]Methionine (specific activity, 1350 Ci/mmol) was added to the cell suspension (10 μCi/ml), and incubation continued for an additional 40 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with a solution containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl and sonicated 3 times for 10 s using a probe-type sonicator. Undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation, and the membranes were then collected by further centrifugation at 213,500 × g for 20 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the above buffer, frozen in liquid air, and stored at −70°C. For overexpression, E. coli JM109/pKK56 was grown in minimal medium A with 0.5% glycerol, thiamine, and ampicillin as above. When the culture reached an A600 = 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mM; 2 h later, the cells were chilled on ice and harvested by centrifugation. Membranes were prepared by disrupting the cells using a French pressure procedure (Rosen, 1986), except that the buffer used was 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 150 mM choline chloride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM MgSO4, and 15 μg/ml DNaseI. After ultracentrifugation, membranes were resuspended at 10 mg of protein/ml, frozen in liquid air, and stored at −70°C. For testing resistance to toxic compounds, cells were grown on solid media supplemented with different concentrations of the compound or alternatively in media in which filter paper disks with the corresponding compound were placed on the disk. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 h of incubation at 37°C. To follow EmrE, membranes containing [35S]methionine-labeled protein and overexpressed protein were routinely mixed to yield approximately 1200 cpm/μg of membrane protein. For extraction, membranes in a volume of 10 μl (100 μg of membrane protein) were mixed with 150 μl of a mixture of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and incubated for 20 min on ice. For phase separation, 30 μl of water were added, and the suspension was centrifuged. The upper phase was removed, and the lower phase was dried under Argon and resuspended appropriately. For analysis in SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTPP+tetraphenylphosphoniumMPP+1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniumCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneΔ||+proton electrochemical gradient. the sample was resuspended in sample buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis was in 16% gels as described (Schagger and Jagow, 1987). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tetraphenylphosphonium 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone proton electrochemical gradient. For reconstitution, the volumes were increased (600 μl of membranes and 5 mg of protein/ml were extracted with 4.5 ml of organic solvent), and E. coli phospholipids (160 μl of 50 mg/ml) were added prior to extraction. The dried extract was resuspended in a solution containing 0.15 M NH4Cl, 0.015 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of plasmid DNA. The suspension was frozen in liquid air and kept at −70°C. Before the assay, the proteoliposome suspension was thawed at 37°C and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for a few seconds until clear. In proteoliposomes prepared for assay of [14C]methyl viologen, no DNA was added. Control experiments showed no effect of DNA on transport of the radioactive label. Transport of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed by dilution of 3 μl of the ammonium chloride containing proteoliposomes into 200 μl of an ammonium-free medium containing 42 μM [14C]methyl viologen (77 nCi), 140 mM KCl, 10 mM tricine, and 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 8). At given times, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution, filtered through Schleicher and Schull filters (0.2 μm), and washed with an additional 2-ml solution. The radioactivity on the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. Transport of ethidium into proteoliposomes was assayed by dilution of 10-15 μl of proteoliposomes to 2.5 ml of a medium as above except that ethidium (1 μg/ml) replaced the methyl viologen. Fluorescence was measured in a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter (Luminescence Spectrometer LS-5) with exciting light at 545 nm and emission at 610 nm. Cells grown in LB medium to A600 of 0.4 were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to A600 of 0.1 in minimal medium A (Davies and Mingioli, 1950) supplemented with 0.05% NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.36% glucose. CCCP (40 μM) was added for 5 min at 25°C. Ethidium was added to 1 μg/ml, and fluorescence was recorded as above. For efflux experiments, incubation with CCCP and ethidium was for 60 min at 37°C; cells were collected by centrifugation and quickly resuspended in medium containing the same ethidium concentration with or without CCCP; the fluorescence was monitored as above. When unc- cells were used, the resuspension medium (25 mM bis-Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.36% glucose) contained no phosphate to allow testing the effect of arsenate. Protein determination was according to Bradford(1976). Phospholipids were prepared from E. coli as described (Viitanen, et al., 1986). It is quite often found that resistance to toxic compounds conferred by transporters shows a very broad spectrum. This phenomenon has very far reaching clinical implications and deserves attention. EmrE (E. coli multidrug resistance E) was cloned independently by two groups: in one case as a gene that confers resistance to ethidium and named ethidium resistance protein and ethidium efflux protein (Purewal, 1991; Purewal et al., 1990) and in the other as conferring resistance to methyl viologen, a powerful superoxide radical propagator and named MvrC (Morimyo et al., 1992). A strain carrying a mutation (acrA) that results in increased susceptibility to a range of toxic compounds was used to estimate the ability of emrE to confer cross-resistance. Mutant cells carrying emrE were cross-resistant to several monovalent cations, including euflavine, proflavine, safranine O, quinaldine red, and pyronin Y (Purewal et al., 1990). In Table 1, wild type K12 cells carrying plasmids with (pT7-32) or without (pT7-7) emrE were compared. Cells expressing emrE display a higher resistance to ethidium, methyl viologen, erythromycin, sulfadiazine, and tetraphenyl phosphonium. EmrE-expressing cells show also a significant level of resistance to tetracycline, albeit lower than that conferred by the various Tet genes. Thus, while EmrE allows growth at 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Table 1), cells carrying pBR322 grow at concentrations at least 10 times higher.Tabled 1 By analogy to other systems, in previous studies it has been suggested that the resistance conferred by EmrE is due to a modification of the membrane permeability or to some type of pumping activity. We explored this assumption by studying the ability of EmrE to transport ethidium in whole cells. Lambert and Le Pecq(1984) developed an assay to study accessibility of nucleic acids to ethidium in E. coli cells. Addition of uncouplers was shown to induce a slow but very massive entry of ethidium, which was manifested by an increase in its fluorescence due to binding to nucleic acids. In Fig. 2A, results of such an experiment were reproduced, both in control cells and in cells expressing emrE. Addition of CCCP (40 μM) to energized cells in the presence of ethidium induced a large increase in the fluorescence of the latter. The levels of fluorescence at equilibrium (about 40-50 min, not shown) were practically identical. However, the rate of entry of ethidium after addition of CCCP was about twice higher in cells expressing emrE (t½ = 25 min in the control as compared with t½ = 12 min in the overexpressing cells), suggesting that under these conditions, EmrE is the main entry pathway upon deenergization of the cell. In addition, a dramatic difference was observed when the converse experiment was performed. Cells treated with CCCP were incubated for 60 min at 37°C to allow for equilibration, collected by centrifugation and rapidly resuspended in a medium containing the same concentration of ethidium but devoid of uncoupler (Fig. 2B). Upon removal of the uncoupler in the overexpressing cells, a rapid decrease in the fluorescence is observed even before the tracing begins and is completed in less than 2 min. This decrease in the fluorescence, which represents removal of ethidium from the cell against a concentration gradient, was completely prevented when the cells were resuspended in a medium with CCCP. The rate of extrusion in the control cells is much slower and reaches the new equilibrium only after about 20 min. The results described demonstrate that EmrE overexpression was accompanied by an increased rate of ethidium efflux in an energy-dependent reaction. It is difficult to identify the driving force for active transport in a strain possessing the H+-ATPase since the main forms of cell energy (oxidation energy, Δ, and ATP) can be interconverted by this enzyme. To demonstrate the nature of the energy source required for ethidium extrusion, we used a strain carrying a deletion in the unc operon so that the F1-F0 H+-ATPase was inactive, and it was then possible to manipulate independently both Δ and ATP. In these experiments, the effect of various agents on ethidium entry into the cell was tested. As in Fig. 2A, ethidium entry is due to failure of the extrusion machinery to remove it from the cell. The results of such an experiment are summarized in Fig. 2, C and D. Addition of CCCP and cyanide, two agents that inhibit Δ but did not affect ATP levels in this strain under these conditions (data not shown), induced ethidium entry into the cell as judged from the increase in its fluorescence. On the other hand, arsenate, an agent that decreased dramatically the ATP level (data not shown) without any effect on Δ, had no effect on ethidium uptake either. The data presented strongly supported the contention that EmrE is an H+-ethidium antiporter, which utilizes the Δ generated by the bacterial primary pumps to extrude toxic cations and reduce in this way their concentration in the cytoplasm. To identify EmrE, we used pT7-32, a derivative of pT7-7 in which emrE is expressed from a T7 polymerase promoter, so that we were able to specifically label its product with [35S]methionine in the presence of rifampicin, an inhibitor of the host but not of the phage RNA polymerase, as described by Tabor and Richardson(1985). Thus, in membranes prepared from a strain carrying pT7-32 and resolved by SDS-PAGE, a radioactive polypeptide was detected, which displays an apparent molecular mass of 9 kDa (Fig. 3, laneG). No labeling was detected when membranes were prepared from cells carrying pT7-7 with no insert (data not shown). Upon staining, no obvious difference could be discerned in membranes prepared from either the pT7-32 cells or those carrying pT7-7 (Fig. 3, lanesA and C). As described above, there are some similarities in the overall properties of EmrE and the subunit c of the F1-F0-H+-ATPase (Fillingame, 1992). Both are small polypeptides (11.9 and 8.2 kDa, respectively) with a relatively high percentage of hydrophobic amino acids typical of intrinsic membrane proteins and a small number of charges. Subunit c was also called the proteolipid because it was extracted with solvents used to extract membrane lipids and it was purified after extraction with these solvents. When membranes in which EmrE was labeled with [35S]methionine were similarly extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:1), more than 85% of the radioactivity was detected in the organic phase. When the organic phase was analyzed in SDS-PAGE and the radioactivity was assessed by imaging, again a single polypeptide was observed, identical to the one detected in the intact membrane (Fig. 3, laneH). As expected, most other proteins are not extracted by organic solvents as evident from the pattern of the polypeptide composition analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3, laneE). Practically no other proteins are observed, while a faint band corresponding to EmrE can now be clearly detected. These results are even more dramatic when EmrE was overexpressed using another vector, pKK223-3, in which the gene was fused to the strong and highly regulated tac promoter (plasmid pKK56). When membranes prepared from cells induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside were extracted as described above, a strong band corresponding to EmrE was observed (Fig. 3, laneF). This band was absent in extracts from membranes prepared from cells that were transformed with plasmid with no insert (not shown). The finding that EmrE is soluble in chloroform:methanol provides a potentially very powerful technical tool for many purposes such as structural analysis. Much of this depends on whether the original conformation of the protein is maintained in the solvent. One of the ways to test whether the protein was grossly denatured in the treatment relies on assay of the activity after solubilization, i.e. reconstitution into proteoliposomes and test of transport activity. The approach we used was to add E. coli phospholipids to the organic solvent extract, evaporate the solvent, and resuspend the protein and the lipid in a buffer containing ammonium chloride. The suspension was then frozen and sonicated so that a population of relatively uniform size, single layer proteoliposomes was formed. The driving force imposed was a pH gradient generated by the ammonium diffusion gradient obtained upon dilution of the proteoliposomes prepared in 0.15 M NH4Cl into media in which the ammonium was replaced by KCl (Taglicht et al., 1991). EmrE-catalyzed transport in proteoliposomes was documented with two substrates, namely ethidium and [14C]methyl viologen. To measure ethidium uptake, we took advantage of the effect of DNA on the quantum yield of its fluorescence. Proteoliposomes were prepared in the presence of DNA, and the fluorescence was monitored. Addition of ethidium to a cuvette containing proteoliposomes caused a large and biphasic increase in the fluorescence; a practically instantaneous increase was followed by a slower reaction (Fig. 4A). We assume that the fast increase is due to binding to the DNA present in the extraliposomal space. The slow phase was due to accumulation of ethidium in the inside of the liposome since addition of the ionophore nigericin, which collapses the transmembrane pH gradient, or methyl viologen, which competes with ethidium as shown below, completely inhibits the fluorescence increase corresponding to this phase (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, when control liposomes (no protein) were added to the cuvette, only the rapid increase in fluorescence was observed, which was due to binding of ethidium to the DNA present in the extraliposomal space (Fig. 4D). Ethidium accumulated in the proteoliposomes was released by collapse of the pH gradient upon addition of nigericin (Fig. 4A). The results demonstrate that ethidium is transported in a process that is dependent on EmrE and driven by ΔpH but does not allow for a detailed analysis of transport. A more quantitative documentation of EmrE-catalyzed transport was obtained by following accumulation of another substrate, [14C]methyl viologen. In these experiments, the pH gradient is generated as above, and a time-dependent accumulation of [14C]methyl viologen was observed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmrE (Fig. 5A, opensquares). Accumulation was linear during the first 5 min, reached a maximal level, and slowly leaked back to the medium (Fig. 5B, opensquares) as expected from the transient nature of the driving force. Transport was almost completely abolished when nigericin was added to the suspension so that no pH gradient was formed (Fig. 5A, filledsquares). No accumulation over the nigericin levels was detectable when liposomes reconstituted without EmrE were diluted to the reaction medium (Fig. 5A, filledcircles). The gradient of [14C]methyl viologen that the proteoliposomes maintain was about 100 (in > out). Thus, about 10% of the total radioactivity accumulated in the proteoliposomes while, based on measurements in similar systems (Taglicht et al., 1993), their internal volume represented only 0.1% of the total. The accumulated substrate was free in solution rather than irreversibly bound to internal structures since it could be rapidly released after equilibrium was reached; at the plateau level, addition of nigericin (Fig. 5B, filledsquares) caused a rapid release of all of the preaccumulated substrate within less than a minute. Also, addition of an excess (1 mM) of unlabeled methyl viologen, which exchanged with the intraliposomal isotope (filledcircles), caused the release of all of the radioactivity within 5-10 min. The kinetics of uptake were further analyzed by monitoring the initial rate of uptake at various concentrations of methyl viologen. The initial rate of uptake increased with the concentration of the substrate and then saturated (not shown). When the results of such an experiment were plotted according to Lineweaver-Burk (Fig. 5C), an apparent Km of 247 μM and a Vmax of 1572 nmol/min/mg protein were calculated from the linear regression of the plot. To test the substrate specificity of EmrE, the ability of several drugs to inhibit the initial rate of [14C]methyl viologen uptake was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Of the compounds tested, the most potent was the lipophilic cation TPP+ with an IC50 of 8 nM, while erythromycin had no effect up to 100 μM. The other inhibitors were, in order of potency, ethidium (2.5 μM) > acriflavine (8 μM) > tetracycline= reserpine (25 μM) = MPP+ (30 μM). The results described in this report demonstrate that EmrE, a 110-amino acid polypeptide, is an antiporter that exchanges H+ with toxic cations such as ethidium and methyl viologen. The studies with whole cells confirmed that expression of EmrE confers resistance to a variety of toxic cations most likely due to the increased ability of the cell to remove them from the cell and therefore lower their concentration in the cytoplasm. This assumption was supported by the demonstration that active removal of ethidium is markedly faster in cells overexpressing EmrE. In addition, the use of a Δunc strain, which cannot interconvert phosphate bond energy with the electrochemical gradient of protons, allowed to establish conditions in which the source of energy available for transport could be controlled. The studies with this strain demonstrated that EmrE uses the electrochemical gradient of protons to extrude ethidium. We concluded at this stage that most likely the basis of the resistance to the toxicity of the other compounds tested is also due to their active extrusion by the same mechanism. The studies in the intact cells were extended and confirmed by purification and reconstitution of EmrE. The reconstituted protein catalyzed the accumulation of ethidium and methyl viologen in a process dependent on ΔpH generated by an ammonium diffusion gradient. These studies directly demonstrated that EmrE functions as an antiporter that exchanges one or more H+ with toxic cations. Transport of methyl viologen and ethidium was demonstrated directly, while transport of the other cations was inferred from their ability to inhibit the accumulation of [14C]methyl viologen. As predicted from its ability to confer resistance to a variety of drugs, EmrE also showed a wide range of specificity. Transport was inhibited very potently by TPP+ and also by ethidium, acriflavine, reserpine, tetracycline, and MPP+. As for the first three drugs, EmrE was already shown to confer resistance to them (Midgley, 1987; Purewal et al., 1990). Tetracycline was tested because of the partial but significant resistance observed in this study (Table 1). The anti-hypertensive reserpine is a potent inhibitor (Ki in the subnanomolar range) of vesicular monoamine transporters, a protein from the TEXAN family of multidrug transporters (Schuldiner, 1994; Schuldiner et al., 1995). It also inhibits BMR, the Bacillus subtilis multidrug transporter, the closest bacterial homolog of the vesicular monoamine transporters. BMR is able to efflux out of bacterial cells structurally diverse compounds such as ethidium, TPP+, and acridine and is inhibited by reserpine at the low micromolar range (Ahmed et al., 1993; Neyfakh et al., 1991). Interestingly, sensitivity to reserpine is characteristic also of the mammalian multidrug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pearce et al., 1989). EmrE displays the lowest sensitivity to reserpine, with an IC50 of 25 μM. The neurotoxin MPP+, an agent that causes Parkinsonism in model systems, is a phenyl-pyridinium with structural similarity to the dipyridinium methyl viologen and is also a substrate of the vesicular monoamine transporter (Liu et al., 1992). It inhibits EmrE with an IC50 of 30 μM. Although a more comprehensive survey is needed, it seems that there is a significant overlap in the specificity range of the various multidrug transporters known. A unique feature of EmrE is its size; a 110-amino acid protein with four putative transmembrane segments catalyzes the same activities that have been previously observed in proteins three to five times larger. The fact that the small proteins of this family are transporters has been hypothesized before but without experimental support (Grinius et al., 1992). Also, several putative transporters with only one transmembrane segment have been cloned in recent years based on expression cloning in oocytes (Wells and Hediger, 1992). However, the overall size of these proteins is high, and the possibility that they may influence transport indirectly has not been ruled out. In this report we directly demonstrated that purified EmrE catalyzes the H+-cation exchange activity, and no other polypeptides are required for this activity. The following question can then be raised: why are the other transporters so large when the minimal subunit necessary is at the most 110 amino acids? One possibility is that EmrE functions as a homooligomer to form at least the 12 transmembrane segments usually observed in other transporters. On the other hand, it is also possible that only some domains of the larger proteins are needed for transport, and the rest functions for regulation of the activity and/or interaction with other proteins. Another very unique feature of EmrE, is its solubility in chloroform:methanol, which provides us with a powerful and unique tool for purification and characterization. Since only a handful of minor proteins is soluble in these organic solvents, after overproduction of EmrE it was possible to extract it highly purified. Most importantly, EmrE was active after this treatment, suggesting that the extraction did not induce major irreversible changes in its structure. The reconstituted protein has an apparent Km for methyl viologen of 247 μM and a Vmax of 1572 nmol/min/mg protein. The latter represents a turnover number of 14 min-1, which is in the same order of magnitude of many ion-coupled transporters (Taglicht et al., 1991). No quantitative data is available on the native protein, but the specificity range of the protein is practically identical to the range of resistance reported. The solubility of EmrE and subunit c in organic solvents does not reside in a specially high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids in both proteins; the percentage in both proteins is 49 and 44%, respectively, which is not different from other classical ion-coupled transporters, which is between 41 and 49.6% in seven H+-coupled bacterial transporters analyzed based on the sequences available from the data bank. 2The sequences analyzed were: Bmr, the Bacillus multidrug transporter (accession number P33449); Lac permease (A03418); MelB, thiomethylgalactoside permease (A03421); NhaA and NhaB, Na+/H+ antiporters (P13738 [GenBank] and P27377); PutP, proline permease (L01152); and TetC, tetracycline antiporter (A03508). On the other hand, the percent of charged amino acids is 7.2 and 9.6%, respectively, while in the 12 transmembrane helix transporters scanned as above, it is between 11 and 14.8%. Another important difference is the number of net charges, which is only +1 in EmrE and −2 in subunit c from E. coli. The range in the other transporters is between −7 and +7, with the lowest absolute number of net charges in the group analyzed being 4. It is therefore suggested that the existence of unpaired charges on the protein represent the main energy barrier for solubilization in the highly hydrophobic milieu of the organic solvents. This has been extensively discussed in the case of charge insertion in membranes (Engelman et al., 1986) and has also received some experimental support in experiments in which neutralization of charges of membrane proteins with H+ or Ca2+ rendered them soluble in organic solvents (Gitler, 1977). Multidrug resistance is a major concern in medical and agricultural diseases. In medicine, the emergence of resistance to multiple drugs is a major obstacle in the treatment of several tumors as well as many infectious diseases. In agriculture, the control of resistance of plant pathogens is of major economic importance. However, besides being an economical and health-threatening phenomenon, it seems that the great diversity of transporters that play a role in drug resistance points to evolution of these systems as a necessary trait for survival in a variety of adverse environments. Outside the protected atmosphere of the laboratory, all organisms have to cope with a large variety of toxic compounds. Some of these compounds are produced by living organisms as part of their fight for survival, while others are toxic wastes, either natural or man made. Obviously, only those organisms that have developed through evolution the ability to cope with a wide variety of compounds, have been able to survive. EmrE is a representative of one of the strategies that evolved, most likely to provide protection from the toxic compounds. Because of their small size and the mechanistic similarity with the TEXANs, we propose to call this family MiniTEXANs. As described here, the MiniTEXANSs seem to be a unique, effective, and very exciting family of proteins. Because of their size and properties, they may provide a very useful model to understand structure-function aspects of transport reactions in ion-coupled processes.

The NH2-terminal sequence of proMMP-7 is Lys-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Glu, which is identical to that of matrilysin. The zymogen is activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), yielding an intermediate form of Mr 21,000 and an active species of Mr 19,000 which shows the new NH2-terminal sequence of Tyr78-Ser-Leu-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ser. Although trypsin fully activates the zymogen, the activation rate by plasmin or leukocyte elastase is confined to ~50%. ProMMP-7 can be activated by MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) to its full activity in a single-step mechanism and generates the same NH2 terminus obtained by APMA activation, whereas MMP-1 (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) do not have such an effect. On the other hand, proMMP-1 is activated by MMP-7 to an activity similar to that obtained by APMA and the activation by MMP-7 is enhanced up to ~6.5-fold in the presence of APMA. This enhanced activity is donated by specific cleavage at the Gln80-Phe81 bond of proMMP-1. MMP-7 can also activate proMMP-9 up to ~50% of the full activity with a new NH2 terminus of Leu16-Arg-Thr-(Asn)-Leu. Incubation of proMMP-2 or proMMP-3 with MMP-7 results in no activation of these proMMPs. MMP-7 degrades type IV collagen, laminin-1, fibronectin, proteoglycan, type I gelatin, and insoluble elastin. These results suggest that in vivo MMP-7 may play a role in degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules in concert with MMP-1, −3, and −9 under pathological conditions.

Ten members have been identified and classified into four major types of structurally and functionally related metalloproteinases: 1) interstitial collagenases (tissue collagenase = MMP-1; neutrophil collagenase = MMP-8; collagenase 3 = MMP-13), which degrade fibrillar collagens; 2) gelatinases/type IV collagenases (72-kDa metalloproteinase = gelatinase A = MMP-2; 92-kDa metalloproteinase = gelatinase B = MMP-9), which hydrolyze gelatins and type IV and V collagens; 3) stromelysins (stromelysin 1 = MMP-3; stromelysin 2 = MMP-10), which are active against a wide range of substrates including proteoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, type IV collagen, and telopeptides of other collagens; 4) other MMPs (matrilysin = MMP-7; stromelysin 3 = MMP-11; macrophage metalloelastase = MMP-12)(1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Based on molecular masses of 51,929, 70,952, 53,997, 27,938, and 78,426 for MMP-1, −2, −3, −7, and −9, the extinction coefficients were calculated and E0.1% = 1.3, 1.9, 1.1, 1.6, and 1.3 ml/mg for MMP-1, −2, −3, −7, and −9, respectively, were used for the studies. Activation studies of proMMP-7 by active oxygen metabolites and acid exposure were performed according to our previous methods(16Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K.

The activities of MMPs to cartilage proteoglycan and insoluble elastin were assayed as described previously(27Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Banda M.J. Werb Z. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 288-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence of proMMP-7 and APMA-activated MMP-7 was determined by an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer with on-line high performance liquid chromatography (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). For the sequence analyses of active MMP species prepared by intermolecular activation, the enzyme species were separated by SDS-PAGE under the reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane(32Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins on the membrane were located by staining with 0.1% Amido Black 10B. The bands of interest were excised and sequenced. Samples resolved by SDS-PAGE with reduction were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were reacted with monoclonal antibodies, and protein bands were visualized by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method as described previously(16Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies specific to NH2-terminal (residues 31-49) or COOH-terminal domain (residues 643-661) of proMMP-9 and that to proMMP-3 were prepared and characterized previously(16Okada Y.

Monoclonal antibody against matrilysin was developed using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the COOHterminal peptide of human matrilysin (residues 253-267, GIQKLYGKRSNSRKK)(34Marti H.S. McNeil L. Thomas G. Davies M. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ProMMP-7 was maximally activated by reaction with 1 mM APMA for 4 h at 37°C and incubated with various protein substrates in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, 0.02% NaN3 at the indicated temperatures. The reaction was stopped with 20 mM EDTA and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified proMMP-7 was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE showing Mr 28,000 under both reducing and non-reducing conditions and had an NH2 terminus of Lys-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Glu. Both proMMP-7 in the culture medium and purified proMMP-7 were recognized by a peptide-specific monoclonal antibody to matrilysin (clone 125-20H11) (data not shown). The culture medium contained no protein bands recognizable by the antibody to MMP-3 (data not shown). The final product exhibited a specific activity of 8,095 μg digestion/min/mg of enzyme at 37°C against [3H]Cm-Tf when assayed after activation with 1 mM APMA for 4 h at 37°C. The overall yield of proMMP-7 was 46% with 193-fold purification after the first DEAE-cellulose step. APMA-activated MMP-7 was stable without loss of the activity even after storage at 23°C for 4 weeks, although proMMP-7 showed spontaneous activation (up to ~30%) in the same condition. However, there was no decrease in the activity or spontaneous activation of proMMP-7 when stored at 4°C for the same period. On the other hand, proMMP-7 became the active species of Mr 19,000 when thawed after storage for a month at −20°C. Inhibitor studies indicated that MMP-7 is a typical metalloproteinase. The activity of MMP-7 was completely inhibited by chelating agents including EDTA, EGTA, and 1,10-phenanthroline, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, and thiol compounds (data not shown). SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol were also inhibitory. However, inhibitors of serine, cysteine, or aspartic proteinases did not show any significant effect. The activation of proMMP-7 with 1 mM APMA was slower than that of proMMP-2 (17Okada Y. Morodomi T. Engheild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and faster than that of proMMP-3 or −9(16Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J.

J. 1988; 254: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) : 30 min of incubation at 37°C gave 65% of the full activity and maximal activation was obtained after 4 h-incubation (Fig. 1A). Prolonged incubation reduced the activity but 80% of the activity remained even after 24 h of incubation. A similar activation curve was obtained with 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mM APMA. ProMMP-7 was also activated to its full activity even with 0.1 mM APMA, although it took a longer (8 h) incubation for full activation. However, incubation with 1.5 mM APMA resulted in only about 70% activation of proMMP-7 (data not shown). During activation with 1 mM APMA, proMMP-7 of Mr 28,000 was processed initially to a molecule of Mr 21,000 and then converted to the Mr 19,000 species (Fig. 1B). When these MMP-7 species were compared with the activation curve, generation of the Mr 19,000 species was correlated with the activity, indicating that the Mr 19,000 form is an active species. The NH2 terminus of the active species of MMP-7 was Tyr78-Ser-Leu-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ser. Seven different serine proteinases including trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, plasmin, leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, thrombin, and plasma kallikrein were examined for their ability to activate proMMP-7. Fig. 2 shows that trypsin (1 μg/ml) can activate proMMP-7 to 95% of the full activity after 8 h of incubation at 37°C. At a higher concentration of trypsin (10 μg/ml), the zymogen was rapidly activated up to 85% after 8 h of incubation (Fig. 2), and the activity declined by further incubation up to 24 h (data not shown). In order to study the action of trypsin on proMMP-7 by SDS-PAGE 125I-labeled proMMP-7 was used, since radioiodination did not cause any significant changes in the intrinsic properties of the zymogen. Incubation of 125I-labeled proMMP-7 with trypsin (1 μg/ml) converted the precursor first into a fragment of Mr 22,500, which was then processed to a doublet of Mr 21,000 and 20,000 species after 8 h of incubation (Fig. 2). Contrary to our expectation, proMMP-7 was not activated at all with α-chymotrypsin (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml), but the zymogen was degraded to a Mr 15,500 species with 10 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Plasmin (10 μg/ml) and leukocyte elastase (10 μg/ml) could also activate proMMP-7 up to 55 and 45% of the full activity, respectively, although at lower concentrations (0.1 and 1 μg/ml) no significant activation was observed (Fig. 3). During incubation with these serine proteinases (10 μg/ml), proMMP-7 was processed to a protein band of Mr 19,000 with plasmin and that of Mr 20,500 with leukocyte elastase (Fig. 3). Cathepsin G itself was a poor activator for proMMP-7, giving only 20% of the full activity with conversion of the precursor into Mr 22,000 and 20,500 forms after 8 h of incubation at 37°C. However, the proteinase accelerated the proMMP-7 activation process by plasmin or leukocyte elastase without changing the activation rate (Fig. 3). Thrombin and plasma kallikrein did not activate proMMP-7 at all.Figure 3:Activation of proMMP-7 by plasmin or leukocyte elastase in the presence or absence of cathepsin G. ProMMP-7 (55 ng) was treated with plasmin (A) or leukocyte elastase (B) at 37°C at 10 μg/ml (□), 1 μg/ml (▵), or 0.1 μg/ml (○) in the absence of cathepsin G, and at 10 μg/ml in the presence of 10 μg/ml cathepsin G (×). The reaction was stopped with 2 mM DIFP, and MMP-7 activity was assayed against [3H]Cm-Tf for 30 min at 37°C. Activity obtained by incubation of proMMP-7 with 1 mM APMA for 4 h at 37°C was taken as 100% activity. No activation occurred with proMMP-7 incubated with buffer alone up to 8 h (data not shown). Inset, Mr changes in proMMP-7 during activation with 10 μg/ml plasmin (A) or 10 μg/ml leukocyte elastase (B). The reaction products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described in Fig. 2.

However, both reagents did not activate proMMP-7 (data not shown). The possibility of proMMP-7 activation by acid exposure, another activation mechanism shown with proMMP-9(30Okada Y. Naka K.

As shown in Fig. 4A, proMMP-7 was fully activated by MMP-3 in a dose-dependent manner. The activation was dependent on MMP-3 activity since neither MMP-3 inactivated by heat or 1,10-phenanthroline treatment nor proMMP-3 could activate proMMP-7. During the activation with MMP-3 proMMP-7 was processed to an active species with Mr 19,000 without any intermediate form on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). In the presence of 1 mM APMA, MMP-3 accelerated proMMP-7 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) and proMMP-7 was rapidly processed to an active species with Mr 19,000 (data not shown). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of MMP-7 activated by MMP-3 showed the sequence of Tyr78-Ser-Leu-Phe-Pro, which is identical to that of APMA-activated MMP-7. In contrast to proMMP-7 activation by MMP-3, none of MMP-1, 2, and 9 activated proMMP-7. It has been reported that proMMP-1 can be activated by other active MMPs including MMP-3, −7, −10, and −11(3Murphy G. Segain J.P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that proMMP-9 is activated by MMP-3. Thus, we examined activation of proMMP-1, −2, −3, and −9 by MMP-7. Fig. 5 shows that proMMP-1 is activated by MMP-7 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The activation rate by MMP-7 in a 1:1 molar ratio reached the level obtained by APMA-treatment. When proMMP-1 activation by MMP-7 was performed in the presence of 1 mM APMA, MMP-1 activity was strongly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner: ~6.5-fold more activity than that achieved by treatment with MMP-7 or APMA alone was obtained (Fig. 5). There was no difference in the relative molecular masses of active MMP-1 species of Mr 43,000 generated by treatment of proMMP-1 with APMA and/or MMP-7 (data not shown). However, NH2-terminal sequence analyses of these active MMP-1 species showed a different amino acid sequence: APMA-activated MMP-1 had NH2-terminal Val82-Leu-Thr-Glu-Gly and Leu83-Thr-Glu-Gly-Asn in 2:1 molar ratio, whereas the NH2 terminus"

Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared, and a cDNA pool obtained from the foot was screened by polymerase chain reaction. The reaction buffer containing 6 ng each of these primers, 1 × Tth reaction buffer (Toyobo), 200 μM dNTP, 1 μg cDNA, and 1 unit of Tth DNA polymerase (Toyobo) was amplified for 30 cycles using the DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer). Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 42°C, and 4 min at 70°C. The foot cDNA library of M. galloprovincialis(3Inoue K. Odo S. Biol. Bull. 1994; 186: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was screened with the polymerase chain reaction fragment labeled with [32P]dCTP. The cDNA obtained was subcloned into a plasmid vector pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences were determined using PRISM DyeDeoxy sequencing kit and 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was carried out with Genetyx Mac version 24.0.0 (Software Development Co. Tokyo). Ten μg of total RNA obtained from tissues of adult mussels or from larvae was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with whole cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP. As a result of the screening of foot cDNA pool by polymerase chain reaction, an about 1.2-kilobase amplified fragment containing all the three types of peptides previously reported (4Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained. The foot cDNA library of M. galloprovincialis(3Inoue K. Odo S. Biol. Bull. 1994; 186: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was screened using the fragment as a probe and a clone carrying an insert of approximately 1.5-kilobase DNA was isolated. The sequence analysis indicated that the clone contains an open reading frame of 1422 nucleotides ending with a stop codon (Fig. 1). A stop codon was also found preceding the first ATG codon by a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment (data not shown). The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 473 amino acids, which is hereafter referred to as Mgfp2 (M. galloprovincialis foot protein 2). The first 17 residues probably represent the signal peptide because of the hydrophobicity of this region and because of the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein reported previously(4Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expected cleavage position is consistent with the rule of von Heijne (5von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). No other distinct hydrophobic region, which was likely to be a transmembrane domain, was observed in the sequence. The mature sequence was classified into three distinct regions: the short N-terminal region, the long central repetitive region (37-40 amino acids in length), and the short C terminus region (Fig. 2). The N- and C-terminal regions mainly consisted of polar residues and several proline and tyrosine residues. These regions contained characteristic acidic sequences, DDEEDD and DDDE, respectively. It is interesting that YKPPVYKP is identical to a repeat motif of proline-rich cell wall protein of soybean (6Hong J.C. Nagao R.T. Key J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8367-8376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) not to mention the homology to the repeat consensus of Mgfp1, AKPSYPPTYK(P)(1Waite J.H. Case S.T.

Bull. 1994; 186: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The repetitive region, which occupies more than 90% of the mature peptide, consists of 11 repeats of the EGF-like motif in which 6 cysteine residues were arranged at a characteristic spacing (Fig. 2). Although the length of the repeats was not constant, the positions of cysteine and glycine residues in each repeat were highly conservative. Tyrosine residues were also well conserved in each repeat, although some of them were replaced with functionally similar phenylalanine residues as observed in other EGF-like peptides(7Hughes P.E. Morgan G. Rooney E.K. Brownlee G.G. Handford P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17727-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positions of proline, lysine, and asparagine residues were also common to most of 11 repeats (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the mature Mgfp2 calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence was 49.8 kDa, slightly larger than that roughly estimated from peptide fragments in the previous study in Mytilus edulis (42-47 kDa)(4Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2:Amino acid sequence of Mgfp2 deduced from cDNA sequence.

In the repetitive region, sequences of all the repeats were aligned according to the positions of conserved cysteine residues.

Positions of cysteine, glycine, and tyrosine/phenylalanine residues were shared with most of other members, but total similarities were moderate. EGF domains are supposed to have important roles for cell-cell interaction, but its functional mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Several characteristic elements in EGF-like structure have recently been identified in some EGF-like proteins. N-glycosylation sites and the hydroxylation sites of asparagine/aspartic acid have often been found in the EGF family of proteins. Possible modification sites were also present in Mgfp2: position 93 for N-glycosylation and positions 283 and 442 for aspartic acid and asparagine hydroxylation sites (Fig. 1). Some residues responsible for calcium binding have been determined in coagulation factors, e.g. aspartic acid or asparagine residues at positions 1 and 3 (numbering starts at the left in Fig. 3)(19Fülöp C. Walcz E. Valyon M. Glant T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17377-17383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues important for receptor binding and/or biological activities have also been identified in some members of EGF-family, e.g. the arginine residue at position 41, tyrosine residue at position 37, and several residues outside the region shown in Fig. 3(20Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Ben Levy R.B. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues are, however, not conserved in the EGF-like motif of Mgfp2. In addition, Mgfp2 contains no possible transmembrane domain. Thus, no amino acid residues reminiscent of cell-cell interaction were found in EGF-like motif of Mgfp2. The unique structural feature of Mgfp2, which is not observed in any other EGF-like proteins, is that it has DOPA residues in its primary structure. It is possible to identify positions of tyrosine residues that will be converted co- or post-translationally to DOPA by aligning the previously reported DOPA-containing peptides (4Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the whole sequence. It is interesting that putative DOPA residues are clustered in both ends of the sequence (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that both ends are located at the surface of the molecule in the tertiary structure where DOPA residues will be accessible to catechol oxidase, the conversion enzyme(2Laursen R.A. Case S.T. Results and Problems in Cell Differentiation 19, Biopolymers. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1992: 55-74Google Scholar). The DOPA residues at the surface of the molecule may play a role in interacting with other Mgfp2 molecules or with other protein species including the foot protein 1. Thus, it is presumed that the basic conformation of Mgfp2, which is relatively resistant to proteolytic degradation, is formed mainly by the EGF-like structure and DOPA-containing terminal regions to promote the interaction among molecules and insolublization through cross-linking processes of DOPA residues. It is important to know the expression site of the gene to estimate its function. To examine whether Mgfp2 gene is expressed in other tissues, RNA blot analysis on major tissues was performed. As the result, it was shown that Mgfp2 gene is transcribed only in the foot, not in other organs examined (Fig. 4a). RNA blot analysis on developing larvae was also performed to examine the stage specificity of the expression of Mgfp2 (Fig. 4b), because some EGF-like genes known to promote the cell differentiation are expressed in specific stages of development(21Bisgrove B.W. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 526-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was found that Mgfp2 is undetectable during free swimming stages but became detectable at the pediveliger, foot formation stage. The structural features of Mgfp2 indicated that Mgfp2 is a secreted protein containing DOPA residues but has no amino acid residues implicated in the role of cell-cell interaction. RNA blot analysis on adult tissues indicated that the expression of the Mgfp2 gene is foot-specific (Fig. 4a). Similar analysis on developing larvae indicated that Mgfp2 gene expression starts with the foot formation (Fig. 4b). These structural and expression data suggest that Mgfp2 functions only as the matrix protein of the adhesive plaque and not as a growth or differentiation factor. It is supposed that Mgfp2 and other EGF family genes are derived from the same ancestral gene and only Mgfp2 has acquired the function to form an insoluble extraorganismic material by incorporating DOPA-containing sequences into its structure. Thus it seems appropriate to classify Mgfp2 as a novel class of EGF-like protein family. We thank Drs. J. H. Waite and S. Harayama for critical reading the manuscript, Dr. S.

INTRODUCTIONFibrillin-1 is a major structural component of connective tissue microfibrils that have an average diameter of 10 nm (Sakai et al., 1986). When visualized by rotary shadowing electron microscopy, these microfibrils have a distinctive “beads on a string” appearance with an average beaded periodicity of 50-55 nm (Kielty et al., 1993). Immunohistochemical data show that fibrillin monomers are assembled in a repetitive manner along the length of the microfibril, although the exact organization and molecular interactions remain undetermined (Sakai et al., 1991). The importance of fibrillin-1 in the maintenance of connective tissue architecture is emphasized by the linkage of the gene for fibrillin-1 to the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease of connective tissue that occurs at a frequency of at least 1 in 10,000 in the population (Lee et al., 1991; Dietz et al., 1991; Maslen et al., 1991).The presumed complete cDNA sequence ( ~8.6 kilobases) has been recently determined (Pereira et al., 1993; Corson et al., 1993) and shows fibrillin-1 to be a modular protein comprising 47 EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered saline. -like domains, 7 domains that have homology to transforming growth factor β1 binding protein (8-cysteine motif), 2 hybrid domains with features of both the transforming growth factor β1 binding protein motif and EGF-like domain motif, a proline-rich region, and 2 unique regions located at the predicted N and C terminus, respectively (Fig. 1). 43 of the 47 EGF-like domains contain the consensus sequence Asp-Asp/Asn-Glu/Gln-Asp∗/Asn∗-Tyr-Phe (where ∗ indicates a β-hydroxylated residue), which was shown to be required for effective calcium binding to an equivalent domain from human coagulation factor IX (Rees et al., 1988; Handford et al., 1991a). Mutations altering calcium binding consensus residues in the N-terminal factor IX EGF-like domain cause hemophilia B, demonstrating the physiological importance of this calcium binding domain (Handford et al., 1991a; Mayhew et al., 1992). We previously proposed that fibrillin EGF-like domains with a similar consensus sequence bound calcium and that disruption of calcium binding could be one cause of the Marfan syndrome (Handford et al., 1991b). Recently, mutations changing potential calcium binding consensus residues in EGF-like domains have been identified in patients with the Marfan syndrome (Dietz et al., 1993; Hewett et al., 1993; Kainulainen et al., 1994), and abnormal microfibrils have been isolated from fibroblast cultures established from one such patient (Kielty and Shuttleworth, 1993). Although recent data have indeed confirmed that fibrillin is a calcium binding protein (Corson et al., 1993; Maslen et al., 1993), the calcium binding properties of individual wild-type and mutant fibrillin EGF-like domains have not been investigated in detail.In this study, we have chemically synthesized a wild-type calcium binding EGF-like domain from fibrillin-1 (residues 2126-2165, numbering according to Pereira et al., 1993) and a mutant domain containing an Asn-2144 Ser amino acid change identified in a patient with Marfan syndrome (Hewett et al., 1993). We have used 1H-NMR techniques to demonstrate that the calcium binding properties of the fibrillin EGF-like domain are similar to those of the calcium binding EGF-like domains from coagulation factors IX and X (Persson et al., 1989; Handford et al., 1991a). We show that removal of one of the proposed ligands for calcium leads to a reduced affinity for calcium with a small conformational distortion of the calcium binding site. In addition, we have examined fibrillin-containing microfibrils from dermal fibroblasts derived from the patient and show that, although assembly of fibrillin into microfibrils is not prevented, the microfibrils have an altered interbead appearance. Finally, we have used molecular modeling to demonstrate that contiguous EGF-like domains in fibrillin-1 could form helical structures. We suggest a mechanism by which removal of a calcium ligand in a single EGF-like domain could result in altered fibrillin monomer interactions and microfibril structure, thus causing the Marfan syndrome, and we propose a model for the interaction of calcium binding EGF-like domains within the microfibril.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that a single EGF-like domain from fibrillin, with a consensus sequence associated with calcium binding, has similar ligand binding properties to equivalent EGF-like domains found in the coagulation proteins factor IX and factor X. The affinity of the isolated fibrillin domain is a moderate ~4 mM at physiological ionic strength and pH 7.4; this probably reflects the absence of one of the seven protein ligands required to complete the pentagonal bipyramidal coordination of calcium recently demonstrated in the crystal structure of the calcium binding EGF-like domain from human factor IX.2 Interestingly, the arrangement of calcium binding ligands within fibrillin EGF-like domains is different from that of the coagulation factors IX and X, with the positions of a carboxyamide side chain and a carboxylate side chain reversed (e.g. Asn-2144 in fibrillin-1, Asp-64 in human factor IX, Glu-2130 in fibrillin-1, Gln-50 in human factor IX). This has only a minor effect on the affinity of the isolated domain for calcium, a result that is compatible with the crystal structure since these ligands lie in a common plane adjacent to one other. These experiments confirm that an EGF-like domain with the consensus Asp-Asp/Asn-Gln/Glu-Asp∗/Asn∗-Tyr/Phe is a general extracellular calcium binding structure and not just a feature of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins, which have previously been studied.An Asn-2144 Ser amino acid change at a potential calcium binding residue within a fibrillin EGF-like domain has recently been identified in a patient with the Marfan syndrome (Hewett et al., 1993). This amino acid change causes a large reduction in the affinity of the isolated domain for calcium, consistent with the removal of a calcium ligand. From the analysis of one-dimensional NMR data, it is apparent that this amino acid substitution does not disrupt the fold of the domain (see Fig. 2 and “Results”). However, the reduced upfield shift of the Tyr resonance seen in the presence of saturating Ca2+ suggests that there is a small local change in the conformation of the mutant domain. Hence, we propose that the phenotype displayed by this Marfan patient is caused by a failure of the EGF-like domain to adopt a wild-type conformation, even in the presence of bound Ca2+. This is consistent with our microfibril analyses, which show that the mutant microfibrils retain a diffuse interbead region after treatment with 100 mM Ca2+ (see “Results”).The diffuse morphology has previously been observed in microfibrils isolated from a Marfan cell line (Kielty and Shuttleworth, 1993), which has an Asn-2144 Ser amino acid change within the same domain, also at a predicted calcium binding residue (Kainulainen et al., 1994). These data, taken together, localize this EGF-like domain to the interbead region of the microfibril.We have modeled the region of fibrillin-1 containing the Asn-2144 Ser and Asp-2127 Glu amino acid changes (see “Results” and Fig. 5a) to try and explain the morphological changes observed in the mutant microfibrils and to derive information about the role of calcium binding EGF-like domains in the organization of fibrillin monomers within a microfibril. Since Ca2+ ions are relatively buried within the structure, we suggest that calcium binding to EGF-like domains imparts a structural stability to each fibrillin monomer rather than cross-linking fibrillin monomers. This is consistent with the appearance of the interbead regions of mutant microfibrils examined in this study. In the normal microfibril, helical arrangements of EGF-like domains within each fibrillin monomer, predicted by recent crystallographic data,2 would be stabilized by calcium. Loss of a calcium ligand and any change in the conformation of the domain produced as a result would distort the helical structure of a mutant fibrillin monomer (increasing the flexibility of the polypeptide chain) and result in a disordered interbeaded region. Since this may increase the susceptibility of the monomer to proteolysis, it could provide an explanation for the collapsed assemblies present in our microfibril preparations (see “Results”).These data are consistent with the observation that the morphological changes that occur in normal microfibrils on treatment with EDTA are reversible (Kielty and Shuttleworth, 1993). The formation of helical arrays of calcium binding EGF-like domains would be dependent on the presence of calcium. Removal of calcium by EDTA treatment of microfibril preparations would destabilize helices, resulting in the frayed or diffuse appearance of the interbead region. Subsequent addition of calcium would promote helical formation, leading once more to a structured interbead region.Our structural model suggests that the association of calcium binding EGF-like domains is not the driving force for the assembly of microfibrils since the scattered distribution of charged and hydrophobic side chains preclude an obvious mechanism for association of fibrillin monomers through either hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions (Fig. 5a). Previous immunohistochemical data suggested that multiple fibrillin monomers might be arranged in a parallel head to tail alignment along the microfibril (Sakai et al., 1991). However, although a parallel alignment of fibrillin monomers would be possible if helical arrays of EGF-like domains form in vivo, the arrangement of helices observed in the crystal packing of the factor IX calcium binding EGF-like domain suggests an alternative anti-parallel model for the lateral association of fibrillin EGF-like domains in the interbead regions of the microfibril. This model retains the head to tail alignment of monomers and facilitates closer packing of calcium-stabilized EGF-like domain helices than would be achieved by a parallel alignment. The simplest arrangement of EGF-like domains would comprise two anti-parallel pairs of fibrillin monomers, which would form a 4-helix bundle (Fig. 6). The diameter across this bundle, based on dimensions of helix bundles within crystals of the factor IX calcium binding EGF-like domain, would be ~8 nm,2 without making an allowance for carbohydrate modifications. Since variable microfibril diameters have been reported (10-15 nm), a larger number of anti-parallel pairs of fibrillin monomers could comprise the core of the microfibril. Covalent cross-links and/or hydrophobic interactions between adjacent fibrillin monomers would be required to stabilize the structure. Recently, transglutaminase-derived cross-links localized to the interbead region of microfibrils have been reported (Glanville and Quian, 1994). We suggest that a staggered anti-parallel alignment of fibrillin monomers would maintain the close packing of helices formed by multiple calcium binding EGF-like domains (Fig. 6) while allowing N termini projecting from each 4-helix bundle to interact, thus providing a potential mechanism for polymerizing and stabilizing the microfibril. If this is correct, we would predict that fibrillin N termini are located in the beaded regions of the microfibril. We are currently conducting further experiments to test this model.Figure 6:A model for the interaction of multiple calcium binding EGF-like domains within the interbead region of the microfibril.

Although recent data have indeed confirmed that fibrillin is a calcium binding protein (Corson et al., 1993; Maslen et al., 1993), the calcium binding properties of individual wild-type and mutant fibrillin EGF-like domains have not been investigated in detail.In this study, we have chemically synthesized a wild-type calcium binding EGF-like domain from fibrillin-1 (residues 2126-2165, numbering according to Pereira et al., 1993) and a mutant domain containing an Asn-2144 Ser amino acid change identified in a patient with Marfan syndrome (Hewett et al., 1993). We have used 1H-NMR techniques to demonstrate that the calcium binding properties of the fibrillin EGF-like domain are similar to those of the calcium binding EGF-like domains from coagulation factors IX and X (Persson et al., 1989; Handford et al., 1991a). We show that removal of one of the proposed ligands for calcium leads to a reduced affinity for calcium with a small conformational distortion of the calcium binding site. In addition, we have examined fibrillin-containing microfibrils from dermal fibroblasts derived from the patient and show that, although assembly of fibrillin into microfibrils is not prevented, the microfibrils have an altered interbead appearance. Finally, we have used molecular modeling to demonstrate that contiguous EGF-like domains in fibrillin-1 could form helical structures. We suggest a mechanism by which removal of a calcium ligand in a single EGF-like domain could result in altered fibrillin monomer interactions and microfibril structure, thus causing the Marfan syndrome, and we propose a model for the interaction of calcium binding EGF-like domains within the microfibril."

We examine RC3•CaM and GAP-43•CaM interactions by circular dichroism spectroscopy using purified, recombinant RC3 and GAP-43, sequence variants of RC3 displaying qualitative and quantitative differences in CaM binding affinities, and overlapping peptides that cumulatively span the entire amino acid sequence of RC3. We conclude that CaM stabilizes a basic, amphiphilic α-helix within RC3 and GAP-43 under physiological salt concentrations only when Ca2+ is absent. This provides structural confirmation for two binding modes and suggests that CaM regulates the biological activities of RC3 and GAP-43 through an allosteric, Ca2+-sensitive mechanism that can be uncoupled by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation. More generally, our observations imply an alternative allosteric regulatory role for the Ca2+-free form of CaM.

Calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinPKCprotein kinase C9AC9-anthroylcholineMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTFEtrifluoroethanol. activates numerous proteins in response to Ca2+ fluxes. Its N- and C-terminal globular domains, which are connected by a flexible, α-helical “tether,” each contain a pair of helix-loop-helix-binding sites with slightly different Ca2+ affinities (for reviews, see Forsén et al., 1986; Means and Conn, 1987; Cohen and Klee, 1988; Means, 1988; Strynadka and James, 1989; McPhalan et al., 1991; Kretsinger, 1992; Weinstein and Mehler, 1994). Occupation of at least the high affinity pair by Ca2+ causes the flexible tether to bend, bringing the globular domains closer together to form a more compact structure. At the same time, more subtle rearrangements within each globular domain cause increased exposure of hydrophobic side chains (LaPort et al., 1980; Tanaka and Hidaka, 1980). Collectively, these conformational changes enable CaM to bind and activate many classes of proteins, including protein kinases, inositol triphosphate kinase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase, calcineurin, calcium pumps, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, cyclases, nitric oxide synthase, and cytoskeletal proteins (Kincaid and Vaughan, 1986; Tallant and Cheung, 1986; Ryu et al., 1987; Cohen and Klee, 1988; Means, 1988; Bredt and Snyder, 1990; Klee, 1991; Carafoli et al., 1992). Transient activations of some or all of these proteins are essential for the development, growth, and environmental adaptation of virtually all cell types, as well as for plasticity within the mammalian central nervous system. calmodulin protein kinase C 9-anthroylcholine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid trifluoroethanol. Two neuronal proteins are unusual because they bind CaM with a greater affinity in the absence of Ca2+ (Andreasen et al., 1983; Baudier et al., 1991). One is GAP-43, also known as neuromodulin or b-50, which is associated with prenatal axonal growth and can be induced in adults by axonal injury (for reviews see Skene, 1989; Liu and Storm, 1990; Benowitz and Perrone-Bizzozero, 1991; Coggins and Zweirs, 1991; Gispen et al., 1991; Strittmatter et al., 1992). GAP-43 associates with the cytoplasmic face of axonal growth-cone membranes and has been implicated in presynaptic events that contribute to synaptic development and such neuroplastic phenomena as neurite extension (Doster et al., 1991; Fitzgerald et al., 1991; Meiri et al., 1991; Sommervaille et al., 1991; Lin et al., 1992), modulation of neurotransmitter release (De Graan et al., 1991; Dekker et al., 1991) and long term potentiation (Lovinger et al., 1985; Gianotti et al., 1992). The second protein, known as RC3, neurogranin, or BICKS, is a neuron-specific, postnatal-onset protein which accumulates in forebrain dendritic spines, loosely associated with postsynaptic structures (Watson et al., 1990, 1992; Represa et al., 1990; Baudier et al., 1991; Coggins et al., 1991). It is probably involved in neonatal synaptogenesis and has been implicated in the post-synaptic second messenger cascade of long term potentiation (Klann et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1993a). Recently one other protein, the neuron-specific Drosophila protein igloo (Neel and Young, 1994) has been reported to interact preferentially with CaM when Ca2+ is absent. It contains three regions that are homologous with the overlapping PKC recognition and CaM-binding domains of RC3 and GAP-43. Other proteins have been described that bind to CaM regardless of ambient Ca2+, but these interactions are either Ca2+-independent or stronger when Ca2+ is present (Sharma and Wang, 1986; Ladant, 1988; Dasgupta et al., 1989). We will use the term “Ca2+ sensitive” to refer to interactions that require the absence of Ca2+. The CaM-binding regions of RC3 and GAP-43 share primary sequence similarities with those of proteins that interact with CaM only when Ca2+ concentrations are high: many basic amino acids, no acidic amino acids, and an abundance of hydrophobic residues with a periodicity suggestive of an amphiphilic α-helix (Anderson and Malencik, 1986; Blumenthal and Krebs, 1988; O'Neil and Degrado, 1990). In the presence of Ca2+, CaM binding stabilizes a basic, amphiphilic α-helix within target proteins that can be detected by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies (Cox et al., 1985; DeGrado et al., 1985; McDowell et al., 1985; Klevit et al., 1985; Seeholzer et al. 1986; MacLachlan et al., 1990; Ikura et al., 1992a, 1992b; Precheur et al., 1991, 1992; Vorherr et al., 1990; Munier et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993; Zhang and Vogel, 1994a, 1994b). The overlapping CaM-binding and PKC recognition domains of both RC3 and GAP-43 are predicted to form an α-helix when analyzed by the method of Garnier et al.(1978) or with the Gascuel and Golmard (1988) basic statistical method. A pair of strongly hydrophobic amino acids separated by 8 or 12 residues (Ile33 or Phe37, and Ile46 in RC3, Ile30 or Phe43, and Leu52 in GAP-43) may correspond to residues in Ca2+/CaM-activated proteins that interact with one or both of the pliant hydrophobic patches exposed by CaM in response to Ca2+ (Ikura et al., 1992a; Meador et al., 1993). RC3 and GAP-43 belong to a family of proteins that bind CaM or CaM-like molecules and share an IQ motif with a consensus sequence of IQxxxRGxxxR (Mercer et al., 1991; Cheney and Mooseker, 1992). The isoleucine in this consensus sequence corresponds to Ile33 in RC3 and Ile30 in GAP-43. This motif is found in p68 RNA helicase (Buelt et al., 1994) and in heavy chains of many myosins in regions that interact with light chains (light chains are structurally and functionally similar to CaM). Xie et al.(1994) solved the structure of scallop myosin and observed that the two light chains stabilize a long α-helix within the heavy chain containing its IQ motifs. We recently characterized the RC3•CaM interaction by fluorescence emission spectroscopy and proposed that RC3 acted as a capacitor for CaM availability within dendritic spines (Gerendasy et al., 1994). That study, which utilized purified recombinant RC3 and sequence variants containing amino acid substitutions within their CaM-binding domains (Gerendasy et al., 1995), suggested that there were two CaM-affinity forms of RC3, but did not address directly the structural basis of these binding modes. To evaluate the hypothesis that CaM binding stabilizes a helix within RC3 and GAP-43, we investigated the binding interactions by CD. We conclude that CaM mediates the Ca2+-sensitive stabilization of basic, amphiphilic α-helices within RC3 (residues 26-47) and GAP-43 (residues 31-52) under physiological salt concentrations. When Ca2+ is present, RC3 and GAP-43 associate with CaM with little or no detectable stabilization of structure. Our findings provide structural support for the notion of two CaM affinity forms of RC3 and, by extension, GAP-43, and further suggest a mode by which their activities might be regulated. More generally, they suggest that CaM induces a helical conformation within certain target proteins only when Ca2+ is low or absent, implying that the Ca2+-free form of CaM may also be an active regulatory molecule. Salt-free calmodulin from bovine brain (>98% purity) was obtained from Sigma and 9-anthroylcholine from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All solutions, proteins, and peptides used in these experiments were passed through Bio-Rex sample preparation discs containing Chelex Chelating Ion Exchange membranes (Bio-Rad) to strip remaining Ca2+ from CaM and to remove Ca2+ and other trace metals from the other reagents. Sequences corresponding to the protein coding region of RC3, its sequence variants, and GAP-43 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into pRK172, expressed, and purified as described, (Gerendasy et al., 1995). The identities of all proteins were verified and their purity and concentrations determined in duplicate by quantitative amino acid analyses using a Beckman model 6300 high performance analyzer modified with a 25-cm long cation exchange column for improved resolution. Nine peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of different regions of RC3 that, together, span the entire protein (Table 1), and the Ser-to-Ala variant of residues 25-47 were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer (model 430A) using solid-phase t-boc chemistry and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a VYDAC C-18 column. Absence of contaminating Ca2+ and other potentially confounding cations was verified by fast ion bombardment. Quantitative amino acid content analysis, performed in duplicate, was used to determine peptide concentrations. Because we were particularly interested in comparing the mean residue ellipticity of RC325-47 with S36A25-37, amino acid content analysis of each peptide was performed in quintuplicate, yielding concentrations with standard errors of 4.6 and 6.8%, respectively.Tabled 1 All CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 61DS spectropolarimeter calibrated with a standard solution of 10-camphorsulfonic acid. Spectra were measured in either a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.2 cm or in tandem quartz cells with path lengths of 0.437 cm. In mixing experiments using the tandem cuvette, 3.5 μM RC3 or 3.5 μM peptide was placed in one compartment, and 3.5 μM CaM was placed in the other. Mixing experiment involving GAP-43 required lower concentrations (1.25 μM) of each component to achieve an optimum signal. In all other experiments, protein concentrations ranged from 5 to 10 μM, while peptide concentrations ranged from 67 to 198 μM. All buffers contained 100 μM Tris, pH 7.5, and 20 μM EGTA or 5 mM CaCl2 unless otherwise indicated. Mean residue ellipticity was determined from the relationship [θ]MRE = (θ•100•Mr)/(c•d•Na) where θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees, c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, d is the path length in cm, Mr is the peptide molecular weight, and Na is the number of amino acid residues/peptide. When a tandem cuvette was used Mr, c, and Na of each component were averaged. Spectra were recorded with a 0.50-nm bandwidth, 0.5-nm step size, and a time constant of 4.0 s. Emission fluorescence spectroscopy of 9-anthroylcholine (9AC) was performed as described (LaPort et al., 1980) with an SPF-500C spectrofluorimeter at 24°C using a path length of 1 cm. The excitation beam (361 nm) was passed through a 2-nm slit, and the emitted spectrum (375-600 nm) was collected in 1-nm increments through a 7.5-nm slit. Each data point was sampled 32 times and averaged. Emission spectra were generated by 9AC (5 μM) dissolved in 50 mM MOPS, pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl containing 2 μM CaM and 1 mM EGTA or 2 mM CaCl2 as indicated. In two cases 2 μM RC3 was also included. Interactions between CaM and purified, recombinant RC3 or GAP-43, or a synthetic peptide corresponding to RC3 residues 25-47, were monitored by CD spectroscopy using a tandem cuvette. RC325-47 contains the CaM-binding site, PKC recognition domain, and region of homology of RC3 with GAP-43. In each case RC3, GAP-43 or RC325-47 was placed in one compartment of the cuvette while an equimolar concentration of CaM was placed in the other. A spectrum was obtained before and after mixing the contents of the two chambers, allowing detection of changes in spectra that resulted from molecular interactions between the components in the two chambers (Fig. 1, A and B). These experiments were performed in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Likewise, the effects of Ca2+ or KCl on the conformation of individual proteins was examined by collecting spectra before and after mixing a solution of the protein with buffer containing KCl or Ca2+ (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2:Effect of Ca2+, KCl, and intermolecular interactions on the conformations of RC3, GAP-43, and CaM. A and B, RC3 or CaM (indicated), in the presence of EGTA, was placed in one compartment of a tandem cuvette and buffer containing 5 mM Ca2+ (A) or 150 mM KCl (B) was placed in the other. CD spectra were collected before (solid lines) or after (dotted lines) mixing the components of each compartment. C and D, mixing experiments were performed between CaM and RC3 (C) or GAP-43 (D), as described in Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures,” except that increasing concentrations of KCl (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 mM) were included in both compartments of the tandem cuvette. CD spectra were collected before (open circles) or after (closed triangles) mixing the components of each compartment. Pre- and post-mix spectra generated in the absence of KCl are indicated. With increasing concentration of KCl, the pre-mix spectra tend to descend and the post-mix spectra tend to ascend when viewed between 205 and 240 nm. E, summary of mixing experiments displayed in panels C and D. Mean residue ellipticities, measured at 222 nm ([θ]MRE222) are plotted against concentration of KCl. Data derived from interactions between CaM and GAP-43 (ovals) or RC3 (rectangles) are indicated. Light stippling is used within symbols that represent pre-mix data points while dark stippling is used in symbols representing post-mix data points. F, fluorescence emission spectroscopy of 9AC in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, Ca2+/CaM+RC3, EGTA/CaM, or EGTA/CaM+RC3 was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The CD spectra generated individually by RC3, GAP-43, and RC325-47 showed marginal negative ellipticities at 222 nm (Fig. 1C; top spectrum in each panel) suggesting a general lack of structure for each species. The spectra generated by RC3 was not altered appreciably by KCl (Fig. 2B), the presence of reducing agents, changes in pH, or by changes in protein concentration (data not shown). Mixing RC3 (Fig. 2A) or GAP-43 (data not shown) with Ca2+ to a final concentration of 2 mM also had no appreciable effect. Examination of CaM by itself revealed conspicuous minima at approximately 222 and 205 nm, characteristic of an α-helical conformation, which increased significantly at 2 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). When RC3, GAP-43, or RC3 25-47 was placed in one chamber and equimolar CaM in the other, each spectrum corresponded to the sum of the spectra of the individual components (Fig. 1,A and B). Because RC3 and RC325-47 are small and relatively unstructured compared to CaM, their respective pre-mix spectra were dominated by that of CaM. On the other hand, GAP-43 which is larger and proportionately less structured makes a greater contribution to the pre-mix spectra. After mixing, no differences in spectra were observed in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1B); however, markedly different spectra were seen when Ca2+ was absent (Fig. 1A). The differences involved significant enhancement of negative ellipticities between wavelengths 205-240 nm, with minima at approximately 205 and 222 nm, characteristic of an increase in α-helical content. These enhanced spectra resembled those obtained when Ca2+ was present (Fig. 1B), which are dominated by the contribution from the Ca2+-CaM interaction (Fig. 2A). Calcium had little effect on the spectra generated by RC3 or GAP-43 alone, raising the disturbing possibility that the RC3, GAP-43, and RC325-47 preparations contained contaminating Ca2+ or the intriguing possibility that these proteins caused conformational changes in CaM by mimicking Ca2+. The first possibility is unlikely. During purification, RC3 and GAP-43 were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in buffers containing EGTA, and never again exposed to Ca2+. Furthermore, RC325-47 and other synthetic peptides were screened for ionic impurities by ion mass spectroscopy and found to be uncontaminated. Thus, the proteins themselves appear to be responsible for changes in conformation. The second possibility, that RC3 or GAP-43 induce conformational changes in CaM analogous to those caused by Ca2+, is inconsistent with the following experimental data: calcium induces both gross and fine conformational changes within CaM. At the gross level these changes can be imitated by salt, a phenomenon described previously by Hennessey et al.(1987). As salt-induced CaM α-helicity reaches saturation, the ability of Ca2+ to promote additional α-helicity disappears and, at physiological salt concentrations, Ca2+ fails to elicit a response that can be detected by CD spectroscopy. Whereas increasing ionic strength had no effect on RC3 α-helical content, it caused a detectable increase in that of CaM (Fig. 2B). To evaluate the effect of KCl on the structural consequences of complex formation, we performed a series of mixing experiments with RC3 or GAP-43 in one chamber of a tandem cuvette and CaM in the other and varied the concentrations of KCl equally in both chambers. Due to the strong contribution of CaM to the pre-mix spectra, the minima at 205 and 222 prior to mixing increased with salt concentration until saturation was reached (Fig. 2, C-E). The change in ellipticity that was caused by mixing CaM and GAP-43 diminished with increasing salt concentrations until a KCl concentration of 200 mM, at which point no difference could be discerned between pre- and post-mix spectra (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, the interaction between RC3 and CaM continued to produce a change in ellipticity, even when 400 mM KCl was present (Fig. 2E). At this concentration of salt, CaM does not exhibit increased negative ellipticity in response to addition of Ca2+. When similar mixing experiments were performed in the presence of Ca2+, little if any difference could be discerned between pre- and post-mix spectra (data not shown). Assuming KCl and Ca2+ have similar effects, the observed increase must have been caused either by the stabilization of an α-helical conformation within RC3 or structural changes within CaM that are fundamentally different than those caused by Ca2+. KCl does not cause CaM to activate Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes, so more subtle conformational changes must also be mediated by Ca2+ and these have been detected using various fluorescent probes (Forsén et al., 1986). For example, at physiological salt concentrations, Ca2+-induced conformational changes within CaM cause exposure of hydrophobic clefts within each globular domain that results in an increased quantum yield of the fluorescence probe (9AC) (LaPort et al., 1980). Since the exposure of a pliant hydrophobic face appears to be a prerequisite for the activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes, we tested RC3 for ability to induce such structural transformations by monitoring RC3-induced changes in emitted fluorescence from a mixture of CaM and 9AC (Fig. 2F). When Ca2+ was added to the mixture, the quantum yield increased as expected. Inclusion of RC3 in either the presence or absence of Ca2+ quenched the signals slightly, perhaps due to interactions between RC3 and CaM or to environmental effects. Nevertheless, RC3 did not increase fluorescence emission in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, interactions between CaM and RC3, GAP-43, or RC325-47 lead to an increased α-helicity within one or both molecules only when Ca2+ is absent, and the effect is different than that which occurs when Ca2+ binds to CaM. Many targets of CaM are highly fluid and fail to adopt a detectable helical conformation unless stabilized through interactions with Ca2+/CaM or helix-stabilizing agents such as trifluoroethanol (TFE) (Precheur et al., 1991; Vorherr et al., 1990, 1992; Munier et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993; Zhang and Vogel, 1994a, 1994b). Although random coiled conformations predominate within RC3, GAP-43, and RC325-47 (Fig. 1C, Table 1 and Table 2), addition of increasing concentrations of TFE causes dramatic increases in negative ellipticity indicating a strong predilection for an α-helical conformation in all three cases.Tabled 1 To map the region(s) of RC3 responsible for inducing global increases in negative ellipticity, we compared nine peptides, with amino acid sequences that, cumulatively, span the entire sequence of RC3, for their capacities to increase α-helicity when mixed with CaM (Fig. 3, 5A, and Table 1). In the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A), RC324-37 showed an 85% increase in negative ellipticity when mixed with CaM, while peptides RC334-51, RC340-55, and RC344-54 showed changes on the order of 40%. No appreciable changes were observed with the other five peptides when mixed with CaM in the absence of Ca2+, and none of the nine provoked responses greater than 10% when Ca2+ was present (Fig. 3B). CD spectra of each of the peptides were also obtained individually and in the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE (Fig. 3C, 5A, and Table 1). Prior to the addition of TFE, peptides RC31-20, RC312-24, and RC316-42 exhibited mean residue ellipticities (MRE[θ]222 expressed in deg cm2 dmol-1) of approximately −1.0 × 104, while peptides derived from more C-terminal sequences displayed mean residue ellipticities of approximately −0.4 × 104 to 0.4 × 104. The CD spectra of these peptides suggest a random coiled conformation (data not shown). When increasing amounts of TFE were added, RC316-42, RC325-47, RC334-51, RC340-55, and RC344-54 responded with increasing negative ellipticities, indicating a propensity for an α-helical conformation. The remaining four peptides showed no appreciable sensitivity to TFE. In the presence of 80% TFE, peptide RC316-42 exhibited the greatest helical content followed closely by that of RC325-47, while those of RC334-51, RC340-55, and RC344-54 were relatively small. Nevertheless, all five peptides showed large proportional responses in that 80% TFE induced negative ellipticities manyfold higher than that displayed in a completely aqueous environment. Thus, with the exception of RC316-42, which lacks crucial CaM-binding residues, the helical propensity and degree of fluidity displayed by individual peptides correlated closely with their ability to evoke a change in α-helicity when interacting with CaM in the absence of Ca2+. Control experiments performed in the presence of dithiothreitol ruled out the possibility that spectral changes resulted from the formation of cystine dimers (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that replacing RC3 Phe37 with Trp (F37W) caused an increased affinity for CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+, while substituting Ala for Ser36 (S36A) only caused a large increase in affinity when Ca2+ was absent (Gerendasy et al., 1994, 1995). Replacing Ser36 with Lys (S36K) had little effect under low ionic conditions while replacing it with Asp (S36D) mimicked the phosphorylation of RC3 by eliminating all detectable affinity for CaM. The biochemical phenotype of F37W suggested that Ca2+-independent binding was augmented by increasing the hydrophobic bulk of residue 37. We were, therefore, curious to learn whether the interaction between F37W and CaM would result in a Ca2+-sensitive, Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent increase in helicity. Comparison of RC3, its variants F37W, S36A, S36K and S36D, and GAP-43 revealed that each of the proteins except for S36D evoked large increases in negative ellipticity when mixed with CaM in the absence but not presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4, Table 2). If CaM stabilizes an α-helix within the CaM-binding domains of RC3 and GAP-43, mutations that enhance Ca2+-sensitive binding, such as the substitution of Ala for Ser36 in RC3 might be expected to do so by augmenting helical tendencies within the binding domain. To test this hypothesis we examined the negative ellipticities of RC3 and sequence variants F37W, S36A, S36K, and S36D with and without TFE. (Table 2). We also compared the ellipticities of peptide RC325-47 and one corresponding to the same region of S36A (S36A25-47) (Table 1). Although S36A and S36A25-47 appeared to exhibit greater negative ellipticities than RC3 and RC325-47, respectively, the differences fell within the standard errors of the amino acid content analysis used to determine protein and peptide concentrations. RC3 and GAP-43 participate in conformational changes involving the stabilization of an α-helix when they interact with CaM. These changes are only prominent when Ca2+ is absent. Although the observed shifts in CD spectra are virtually indistinguishable from those caused by Ca2+-induced conformational changes within CaM, fluorescence spectroscopy in the presence of 9AC and salt saturation experiments indicates that the spectral shifts caused by mixing RC3 or GAP-43 with CaM were caused by different phenomena. Additionally, the salt saturation experiments suggest that CaM is not the source of the spectral shift in the case of mixing experiments involving RC3. Spectroscopy of RC3 or GAP-43 alone indicates that their individual conformations are not significantly affected by Ca2+ or salt, despite their high degree of structural fluidity and strong predilection for the α-helical conformation, as demonstrated by TFE studies. Mapping experiments with peptides demonstrated, with one exception, a correlation between those regions exhibiting structurally fluid α-helical tendencies and those that elicit Ca2+-sensitive increases in negative ellipticity when interacting with CaM. The exception was RC316-42, which exhibited a high degree of fluidity and strong α-helical tendencies but failed to interact with CaM, almost certainly because of the absence of residues 43 through 47 (RKKIK). These residues are conserved in GAP-43 and required for its binding to CaM (Alexander et al., 1988; Baudier et al., 1991; Chapman et al., 1991). This highly basic stretch of amino acids is probably required for initial anchoring of RC3 or GAP-43 to CaM as discussed below. The data summarized above constitutes strong circumstantial evidence that an α-helix is stabilized within the CaM-binding domains of RC3 and GAP-43 upon binding to CaM when Ca2+ is absent and is consistent with the helical structure observed in the heavy chain of scallop myosin (Xie et al., 1994), another protein that contains an IQ motif. The conclusion is further supported by its ability to explain the dissimilar CaM binding affinities of sequence variants F37W and S36A in spite of the close proximity and similarly hydrophobic nature of their respective sequence substitutions (the former exhibits a greater Ca2+-independent affinity while the latter displays an increased Ca2+-sensitive affinity). One would expect that a Ser-to-Ala substitution would be helix stabilizing while a Phe-to-Trp substitution would not (Marqusee, et al., 1989; Padmanabhan et al., 1990). Increasing the hydrophobic bulk of residue 37 could enhance Ca2+-independent binding while replacing Ser36 with a helix-promoting residue would increase Ca2+-sensitive binding. Unfortunately, the methods used here lack the necessary precision to demonstrate increased α-helicity on the part of S36A. Interactions between F37W or GAP-43 and CaM generated only a small or undetectable increase in α-helicity, respectively, when Ca2+ was present, even though a significant portion of each would be expected to form a complex with CaM, independent of Ca2+ levels (both have micromolar dissociation constants in Ca2+). In low ionic environments such as those used here, RC3, S36K, and S36A also interact, although to lesser extents, in Ca2+ and induce small changes in ellipticity when they associate with CaM (S36D has the lowest affinity and elicits the smallest change in ellipticity). Alexander et al.(1987) have demonstrated that GAP-43-CaM affinity is Ca2+-independent when salt concentrations approach physiological levels (150 mM KCl). The salt sensitivity displayed by GAP-43 has been interpreted to imply a significant ionic component to the interaction, although the affinity appears to be inversely proportional to the induction by salt of conformational changes within CaM, implying a possible causal relationship between affinity and KCl-induced conformational changes. (Fig. 2E). We demonstrated that changes in ellipticity occur when CaM and GAP-43 interact in 150 mM KCl when Ca2+ is absent but not when present. As salt increased from 0 to 200 mM, the change in mean residue ellipticity decreased along with affinity, probably because fewer molecules formed complexes. Similar mixing experiments revealed negligible change in the presence of Ca2+ and salt (data not shown), indicating that the stabilization of helical structure within GAP-43 by CaM is Ca2+ sensitive even under circumstances that render its affinity Ca2+-independent. RC3•CaM interactions are less sensitive to salt, indicating either a smaller ionic component or less sensitivity to KCl-induced gross conformational changes within CaM. The data imply that an α-helix with a positively charged face and a hydrophobic face is stabilized within RC3 between residues 25 and 47 by CaM when Ca2+ is absent (Fig. 6). In the presence of Ca2+ or the absence of CaM, a randomly coiled state dominates, although the significant negative ellipticity elicited by TFE within RC316-42 and RC335-47 suggests that residues 25 through 35 occasionally sample the helical conformation, even when CaM is not present (Fig. 5E). This region appears to stabilize and be stabilized by interactions with CaM involving the previously determined CaM-binding domain C-terminal to Ser36. Coincident stabilization of an α-helix on both the N-terminal and C-terminal sides of Ser36 may be influenced by the ease with which an α-helix can be propagated through residue 36. Hence, the fraction of molecules sampling the helical conformation in the unbound state may increase when Ser36 is replaced with alanine and this, in turn, could translate into a greater Ca2+-sensitive affinity for CaM.Figure 5:Graphic representation of peptide data. A-C, nine overlapping peptides that collectively span the entire 78-residue sequence of RC3 are represented by rectangles. The data are extracted from Table 2. A, [θ]MRE222 of each peptide prior to the addition of TFE. B, [θ]MRE222 of each peptide in the presence of 80% TFE. C, percent change in [θ]MRE222 that occurred when each peptide was mixed with CaM in the presence of EGTA. The PKC recognition and minimal CaM-binding domains (Apel et al., 1990; Alexander et al., 1988; Baudier et al., 1991; Chapman et al., 1991; Houbre et al., 1991) are indicated at the top of each panel. D, primary structure of RC3 and homologous region of GAP-43. The overlapping PKC recognition and CaM-binding domains are indicated over the primary structure of RC3. The minimal CaM-binding domain as determined by Alexander et al.(1998) and Chapman et al.(1991) is indicated by a solid line while additional residues deemed to be important for Ca2+-sensitive interactions with CaM based on the data presented here are indicated by a dotted line. E, hypothetical secondary structure of the that region. The helical propensity exhibited by each peptide, inferred from its behavior in TFE, and each peptide's individual ability to elicit a Ca2+-sensitive increase in helicity when mixed with CaM, suggests that sequences N-terminal to Ser36, which occupy a predominantly random coiled conformation (left), are able to transiently sample a helical conformation (center). Direct binding of CaM, in the absence of Ca2+, to residues C-terminal to Ser36 are hypothesized to stabilize a helix on the C-terminal side. This propagates and is further stabilized by the formation of a helix N-terminal to Ser36 (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Negative ellipticities exhibited by RC325-47, RC334-51 but not RC340-55 when exposed to TFE or CaM suggest that amino acids N-terminal to Ser36 (ANAAAAKIQAS) contribute substantially to the formation of an α-helix. There are three chemically non-conservative amino acid differences between RC3 and GAP-43 in this region (Fig. 5D), which could account for their different affinities for CaM and the sensitivity of those affinities to salt. RC3 and GAP-43 differ from other known CaM-binding proteins in that their CaM-binding domains only assume a stable amphiphilic, α-helical conformation when interacting with CaM in the absence of Ca2+. Sequences N-terminal to Ser36 may be responsible for this unconventional behavior. Interactions between RC3 or GAP-43 and CaM, PKC, and possibly membrane phospholipids may be mediated through positively charged and hydrophobic faces of the α-helix (Fig. 6). This would be consistent with the hypothesis that ACTH antagonizes GAP-43•CaM and GAP-43•PKC interactions through its presumed ability to form a competing amphiphilic α-helix (Zweirs and Coggins, 1991). It is also consistent with the observation that RC3 and de-myristalted GAP-43 associate with liposomes composed of acidic phospholipids (Houbre et al., 1991). In this model, Lys32, His40, Arg43, Lys44, Lys45, and Lys47 constitute one positively charged surface that winds around one side of the helix, unbroken except for Ser36, the target of PKC. Phosphorylation of Ser36 or its substitution with aspartate would place a negative charge in the center of this positively charged face, possibly disrupting interactions with CaM. Residue 36 appears to be pivotal for the propagation of an α-helix, thus explaining how its phosphorylation or substitution with aspartate abrogates both low and high affinity binding. Chen et al.(1993) have demonstrated that Lys32 is important for PKC specificity, implying that the positively charged face is important for recognition by PKC. Ser36 also lies immediately adjacent to another continuous surface composed of hydrophobic residues Ala28-Ala31, Ile33, Phe37, Met41, Ala142, and Ile46. The amino acid differences in GAP-43 do not alter the nature of these surfaces. Mutagenesis and fluorescence binding studies with peptides and recombinant proteins indicate that at least one of the residues within the hydrophobic face, Phe37 in RC3 or Phe43 in GAP-43, interacts with CaM and with PKC (Alexander et al., 1988; Chapman et al., 1991, Chen et al., 1993; Gerendasy, et al., 1994). Masure et al.(1986) have concluded that GAP-43 is rod shaped based on its sedimentation rate during velocity centrifugation and that its CD spectrum indicated a predominantly random coiled configuration and very little α-helicity (1%). In partial agreement, Coggins et al.(1989) reported that they were unable to detect any α-helical structure in GAP-43 by proton nuclear magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. Gel filtration chromatography suggests that RC3 is also rod shaped (Huang et al., 1993). Based on CD spectra of peptides corresponding to the sequence of RC3, its N terminus (residues 1-30) appears to be somewhat more structured than its C terminus (residues 50-78), which is similar in sequence to collagen and forms a random coil conformation. The distinctive CD spectrum generated by the triple helix conformation of collagen is not evident in any of the spectra generated here. The central domain (residues 30-50) is unstructured but has a strong helical propensity that is stabilized by CaM. Thus, one might infer that both RC3 and GAP-43 are rod shaped but quite fluid within their CaM-binding domains. Stabilization of a helix within this region could decrease the freedom of motion at the ends as well as within the immediate binding domain resulting in a stiffer, more pronounced rod-like structure when Ca2+ levels are low. This structure and the less organized form may correspond to the two affinity states of RC3 which were previously inferred by fluorescence emission spectroscopy (Gerendasy et al., 1994). Alexander et al.(1987, 1988) and Liu and Storm (1990) proposed that GAP-43 sequesters CaM next to the inner leaf of the axonal growth cone membrane, releasing it with increasing Ca2+ and/or phosphorylation by PKC. We recently proposed that RC3 acts like a capacitor in dendritic spines, releasing CaM rapidly in response to large increases in Ca2+ and much more slowly in response to smaller increases. Neither of these functions precludes the possibility that RC3 or GAP-43 are themselves biologically active as has been suggested by Gispen(1986), Van Hoof et al.(1988), Strittmatter et al.(1990, 1992, 1993), and Cohen et al.(1993). The stabilization of a helix within RC3 and GAP-43 only by the Ca2+-free form of CaM suggests that CaM regulates their activities in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. Phosphorylation of either substrate by PKC would uncouple this regulation leading to constitutive Ca2+-independent activity. This hypothesis is consistent with a number of observations. Cohen et al.(1993) demonstrated that phosphorylated RC3 stimulates inositol triphosphate-mediated mobilization of Ca2+ in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors in Xenopus oocytes. They also recently observed that S36D but not S36A behaves the same as phosphorylated RC3. 2J. B. Watson, unpublished results. Strittmatter et al.(1990) demonstrated that the N terminus of GAP-43, which lacks a CaM-binding domain, is able to stimulate G0 in vitro and that GAP-43 had the same effect as RC3 in Xenopus oocytes (Strittmatter et al., 1993). We report here that CaM can stabilize a conformational state within RC3, S36A, and GAP-43 but not S36D when Ca2+ is absent. Together, these data argue that RC3 and GAP-43 are subject to Ca2+-sensitive, allosteric regulation by CaM that can be uncoupled by phosphorylation. Perhaps, more generally, calmodulin's ability to stabilize a basic, amphiphilic, α-helix within a specific class of target proteins, solely when Ca2+ is absent, implies that the Ca2+-free form of CaM has the potential to regulate the actions of other proteins through an allosteric mechanism similar to that employed by the Ca2+-containing form. Since RC3 may also regulate CaM availability, the model proposed here suggests that CaM and RC3/neurogranin regulate each other's activities.

This leader sequence has an Arg-Asn-Arg sequence immediately before the cleavage site; this is characteristic for transit peptides in prokaryotes. Comparison of this sequence with the leader sequence of the photosystem II-associated extrinsic 33-kDa protein from the same cyanobacterium showed an identity of 13 out of 25 residues. These results suggest that after synthesis of the apoprotein, cytochrome c-550 is transported into the thylakoid lumen. Using the cloned gene, insertion and deletion mutants of Synechocystis sp.

Atrazine binding and Western blot analysis showed that these mutants on a per-chlorophyll basis contained 53-67% of the amount of photosystem II as compared with wild type. The photosystem II-specific oxygen-evolving activity at saturating light intensity was reduced to about 40% of that in the wild type strain.

This cyt is water soluble and has a low redox potential (−260 mV). Since it can accept electrons from ferredoxin II in cell extracts in the presence of dithionite, it has been proposed that cyt c-550 functions in removing excess electrons generated in cells grown under anaerobic conditions by reducing ferredoxin(4Krogmann D.W.

We showed that this cyt is an extrinsic protein of PSII as it can be released from PSII particles by washing with high concentrations of divalent cations or Tris. Removal of cyt c-550 caused a decrease in oxygen-evolving activity that could be restored by rebinding of the cyt to PSII(7Shen J.-R. Inoue Y.

These results suggest a close contact of cyt c-550 with both the extrinsic 12- and 33-kDa proteins and hence imply a lumenal location of cyt c-550.This functional evidence was obtained with the thermophilic cyanobacterium, S. vulcanus, which grows at 55−60°C. The in vitro evidence for a reaction between ferredoxin II and cyt c-550 was obtained on cell extracts from a mesophilic bacterium(4Krogmann D.W. Smith S. Baltscheffsky M.

The apparent discrepancy might be due to a possible difference of the water-splitting system in thermophilic cyanobacteria as compared with that in mesophilic ones.

To clarify the function of cyt c-550 in vivo in mesophilic cyanobacteria, we have determined the N-terminal sequence of the protein and studied the in vivo effects of inactivation of the cyt c-550 gene in Synechocystis sp.

Our results indicate that cyt c-550 is synthesized with a leader sequence that has a high level of homology with the transit peptide of the PSII-associated extrinsic 33-kDa protein from the same cyanobacterium. We made insertion and deletion mutants lacking cyt c-550 and observed that the oxygen evolution and stability of PSII was affected upon deletion of the cyt. This indicates a lumenal or periplasmic location of mature cyt c-550 and infers a role of cyt c-550 in normal function and stabilization of the cyanobacterial PSII complex.

Another possible source of difference may be that there are different forms of cyt c-550 in cyanobacterial cells (one is a soluble form, and another is a membrane-bound form), as suggested by Kang et al.(8Kang C. Chitnis P.R. Smith S. Krogmann D.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that this is unlikely and all cyt c-550 is found in its membrane-bound form associated with PSII(3Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20408-20413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), again this was demonstrated for the thermophilic S. vulcanus. To clarify the function of cyt c-550 in vivo in mesophilic cyanobacteria, we have determined the N-terminal sequence of the protein and studied the in vivo effects of inactivation of the cyt c-550 gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our results indicate that cyt c-550 is synthesized with a leader sequence that has a high level of homology with the transit peptide of the PSII-associated extrinsic 33-kDa protein from the same cyanobacterium. We made insertion and deletion mutants lacking cyt c-550 and observed that the oxygen evolution and stability of PSII was affected upon deletion of the cyt. This indicates a lumenal or periplasmic location of mature cyt c-550 and infers a role of cyt c-550 in normal function and stabilization of the cyanobacterial PSII complex. We thank Dr. Masahiko Ikeuchi for help in determining the N-terminal sequence and also for providing antibodies against D1, D2, and CP43."

We examined mechanisms that underlie autoinduction of ET-1 in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. Incubation of mesangial cells with ET-1 resulted in an immediate and dose-dependent stimulation of preproET-1 mRNA expression as assessed by polymerase chain reaction coupled with reverse transcription. Within 1 h of exposure to ET-1 (10-7M), preproET-1 mRNA expression was increased to a maximal level of 465 ± 43% of the control value (p < 0.01), which was accompanied by significant stimulation of production of the immunoreactive ET-1 peptide. Nuclear run-off analysis revealed increases in the transcriptional rate of preproET-1 mRNA to 239 and 175% above the control values at 1 and 3 h of ET-1 stimulation, respectively. ET-1 also increased the stability of preproET-1 mRNA, resulting in an mRNA half-life of 60 min from 20 min seen in non-stimulated cells. Addition of an ETB-specific antagonist, RES701-1, at >10-θM abolished ET-1 stimulation of preproET-1 mRNA (p < 0.001), whereas an ETAspecific antagonist, BQ123, was without effects (up to 10-5M). The ETB agonist, sarafotoxin S6c (10-7M), significantly stimulated preproET-1 mRNA expression to 201 ± 14% above controls (p < 0.01), an effect that was lessened significantly by RES701-1 (p < 0.05). RES701-1 abolished the ET-1-induced production of the ET-1 peptide (p < 0.001). Taken together, we demonstrates that in mesangial cells, autoinduction of ET-1 occurs through the ETB receptor subtype via increases in both preproET-1 transcription and mRNA stability.

The LAR extracellular region, which is comprised of three Ig-like and eight FN-III-like domains, can be released from the cell surface as a result of a second proteolytic cleavage event at a site located near the transmembrane peptide(30Serra-Pages C.

HPTPδ, like LAR, has an ectodomain comprised of three Ig domains and eight FN-III-like domains and is expressed on the cell surface as a two-subunit structure derived by proteolytic processing of the proprotein at a furin-like cleavage site. The HPTPδ ectodomain is shed from the cell surface. Furthermore, evidence is presented for the existence of multiple HPTPδ isoforms that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. HPTPδ cDNA clones 40 and 52 were isolated from a λgt11 human placenta cDNA library(31Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3112-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Krueger N.X.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). HPTPδ cDNA was subcloned into plasmid vectors. DNA manipulations and DNA sequence determination using the chain termination method were done according to standard procedures (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The complete HPTPδ cDNA sequence appears in the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ nucleotide sequence data bases (accession number L38929). The putative initiation methionine residue shown in Fig. 2A is encoded by nucleotides 154-156. HPTPδ expression plasmids were generated by combining appropriate restriction fragments into the pSP65-SRα.2 expression vector(34Pulido R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. Streuli M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). pSP65-SRα.2.HPTPδ-fl encodes HPTPδ amino acids 1-1892 plus the signal peptide (see Fig. 2A), and pSP65-SRα.2.HPTPδ.ΔF4-7 contains the same sequence except that the sequences encoding amino acids 588-998 are deleted. The amino acid substitution mutants shown in Fig. 5 were generated by oligo-directed mutagenesis, and mutants were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A tissue Northern blot containing about 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane was obtained from Clontech and hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes using the hybridization conditions recommended by the supplier. The HPTPδ cDNA probe spans nucleotides 1-2144, which encode amino acids −20 to 645 of the full-length HPTPδ isoform. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human kidney and fetal brain tissue was obtained from Clontech. cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), using random hexamers as primers, and 10 ng of poly(A)+ RNA. Control PCR was done using appropriate HPTPδ cDNA. PCR reactions (35 cycles) consisted of sequential incubations for 1 min at 92°C, 2 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 75°C with a final extension of 5 min at 75°C. Products of RT-PCR or PCR were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. Synthetic oligonucleotide pairs used as PCR primers were as follows (HPTPδ nucleotide numbering is based on the complete HPTPδ nucleotide sequence): 1 (sense) (HPTPδ; residues 662-684), 5′-ACAACAATGGTCGTATTAAGCAG-3′; 1 (antisense) (HPTPδ; residues 913-933), 5′-CACGGCCACACAGGTGATATT-′; 2 (sense) (HPTPδ; residues 2295-2319), 5′-TCCTCGCAAAGTCGAGGTAGA-3′; 2 (antisense) (HPTPδ; residues 2593-2612), 5′-GTGGTGGACACCAGTTTGGG-3′; 3 (sense) (HPTPδ; residues 1681-1701), 5′-ATCACTCAGACAGGAGTACCA-3′; 3 (antisense) (HPTPδ; residues 3259-3279), 5′-CTCTGGAATCTCCCAAGACAG-3′. Anti-HPTPδ mAb D1.1 (IgG1, κ) was generated by immunizing Balb/c mice with a murine 300-19 pre-B cell line expressing a HPTPδ-LAR chimeric protein consisting of HPTPδ amino acids −20 to 1076 and LAR amino acids 1061-1881(35Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Expression of this chimeric protein in 300-19 cells was monitored using the anti-LAR mAb 11.1A(26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Splenocytes from immunized mice were fused to NS-1 myeloma cells, and culture supernatants from hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium-resistant hybridomas were screened for reactivity to the 300-19(HPTPδ-LAR) cell line used as immunogen and lack of reactivity to a 300-19 cell line expressing human LAR (300-19(LAR)). Screening was performed by flow cytofluorography using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse as secondary antibody on a Profile EPICS cell sorter (Coulter Immunology). Simian COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. COS-7 cells were transfected with the pSP65-SRα.2.HPTPδ expression plasmids or control pSP65-SRα.2 using the DEAE-dextran method as described(33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were cultured for 48-56 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in L-methionine-free RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum (0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine/5 × 105 cells). After labeling, cell culture supernatants were harvested, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Resulting cell lysates or culture supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (25 μl of slurry) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) prior to use for immunoprecipitation studies with the anti-HPTPδ mAb D1.1 or a control isotype-matched mAb (1 μl of ascites fluid or 5 μg of mAb/0.5 ml of lysate) and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% gels) using reducing conditions, followed by autoradiography. The relative amounts of HPTPδ 220-kDa proprotein (Pro) and 150-kDa E-subunit (E) were determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs using an Ultrascan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia). For determining the relative amount of HPTPδ proprotein processing, the values obtained by densitometric scanning were corrected for the number of methionine residues present in the various HPTPδ proteins, the amount of proprotein processing was calculated as E/(Pro + E), and resulting values were standardized to give a value of 1.0 for wild-type HPTPδ proprotein processing. Previously, we described the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the partial amino acid sequence of HPTPδ(32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Now we report the complete HPTPδ sequence as well as the sequence of a number of HPTPδ isoforms deduced from the sequence analysis of cDNA clones (Fig. 1). The longest composite cDNA (clones 243, 242, 139, and 52; Fig. 1) spans about 6.3 kb and contains an open reading frame of 5736 bp encoding a protein of 1912 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of this HPTPδ isoform is shown in Fig. 2A and is aligned with the sequence of the mouse homologue, MPTPδ (16Mizuno K. Hasegawa K. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Ichikawa T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar) , the 21st amino acid (glutamic acid) is predicted to be the amino terminus of the mature 1892-amino acid-long HPTPδ protein and is designated the +1 residue (Fig. 2A). A hydrophobic stretch of 25 amino acids located from residue 1246 to 1270 (underlined in Fig. 2A) is likely to be the transmembrane peptide. Sequence comparisons suggest that the 1245-amino acid extracellular region of HPTPδ is comprised of three Ig-like domains and eight FN-III-like domains and contains four putative N-linked glycosylation sites (indicated by # in Fig. 2A). The 622-amino acid-long HPTPδ intracellular region contains two PTPase domains that were previously demonstrated to be catalytically active in vitro(32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Overall, the HPTPδ and MPTPδ amino acid sequences are 95% identical, and HPTPδ and LAR are 72% identical. Thus, PTPδ is evolutionarily well conserved, and its overall architecture and sequence are very similar to the LAR PTPase. In addition to the cDNAs isolated that encode the HPTPδ sequence shown in Fig. 2A, several other cDNAs were isolated that encode shorter HPTPδ isoforms. Two cDNAs (Fig. 1, clone 70 and clone 73) lacking peptide sequences within the extracellular region of HPTPδ were found by screening a fetal kidney cDNA library. Clone 70 lacks sequences encoding two HPTPδ internal regions: a 9-amino acid-long sequence, provisionally designated the mini-exon A (meA) peptide (Fig. 2, A and B, residues 141-149) that is predicted to affect the length of a loop region between the D and E β-strands of the second Ig-like domain(37Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Clone 70 also lacks a 4-amino acid sequence designated the meB peptide (Fig. 2, A and B, residues 187-190) that is predicted to affect the length of the sequence between the second and third Ig-like domains. Clone 73 (Fig. 1) lacks another 9-amino acid sequence, designated the meC peptide (Fig. 2, A and B, residues 756-763), that is located within the fifth FN-III-like domain (Fig. 2B). Another clone (Fig. 1, clone 91) was isolated from a fetal brain cDNA library that lacks the sequence encoding the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains (Fig. 2, A and B, residues 568-978). Comparison of the sequences of the various HPTPδ cDNA clones suggests that the molecular basis for the observed variation is alternative splicing of the HPTPδ pre-mRNA. Supporting this possibility is the observation that the meA, meB, and meC peptide coding sequences are exactly inserted at exon-exon junctions of the HPTPδ-related lar gene and that alternative splicing of LAR exon 13, which encodes the LAR meC-like peptide, has been documented(20O'Grady P. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25193-25199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of cDNA clones encoding isoforms containing or lacking FN-III-like domains 4-7 has also been reported for the MPTPδ (16Mizuno K. Hasegawa K. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Ichikawa T. Yakura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5513-5523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PTPσ PTPases(14Pan M.-G. Rim C. Lu K.P. Florio T. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, generation of structural diversity of ectodomains of other transmembrane PTPases by alternative splicing has also been reported(12Streuli M. Saito H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25193-25199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of several HPTPδ isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing of the exons encoding the meA, meB, and meC peptides as well as the exons encoding the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains. The expression of HPTPδ mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from various human tissues and a cDNA probe corresponding to the HPTPδ ectodomain (Fig. 3A). HPTPδ mRNA was detected in the kidney and brain samples but not in the heart, placenta, liver, or skeletal muscle samples (Fig. 3A). In the kidney mRNA sample, there was a dominant HPTPδ mRNA of about 9.5 kb and a minor mRNA of about 8.5 kb, whereas in brain there was only an 8.5-kb mRNA. The expression of HPTPδ predominantly in brain and kidney is consistent with the finding that MPTPδ is also primarily seen in these tissues(16Mizuno K. Hasegawa K. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Ichikawa T. Yakura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5513-5523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in length of the 6.3-kb composite HPTPδ cDNA and the 8.5-9.5-kb mRNA suggests that additional 3′-untranslated sequences are not represented in the isolated HPTPδ cDNAs. Control hybridization of the Northern blot with a β-actin cDNA probe is shown in Fig. 3B. To examine the expression of HPTPδ mRNAs encoding the putative HPTPδ mRNA isoforms with or without the meA, meB, and meC peptide sequences or lacking the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains, RT-PCR analysis was performed using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human kidney and fetal brain (Fig. 3C). HPTPδ mRNA-derived cDNAs, or HPTPδ plasmid cDNAs used as standards, were amplified using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sequences flanking the alternatively used sequences, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig. 3C, PCR analysis of HPTPδ plasmid-derived cDNA lacking or containing the meA and meB peptide-encoding sequences gave the expected cDNA products of 232 bp (lane3) and 271 bp (lane4), respectively, using oligo-pair 1. For the meC peptide sequence, the expected PCR products of 290 bp (lane8) and 317 bp (lane9), respectively, were observed for the deletion or addition using oligo-pair 2. To assess the deletion of the sequences encoding the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domain, PCR primers corresponding to the second and eighth FN-III-like domains (oligo-pair 3) were used and gave the expected PCR product of 365 bp (lane13). The inclusion of the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains was assessed using oligo-pair 2, which detects the presence of the fifth FN-III-like domain. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the HPTPδ mRNA isolated from human kidney lacked the sequences encoding the meA and meB peptides (Fig. 3C, lane5) and that the majority of mRNA also lacked the sequences encoding the meC peptide (Fig. 3C, lane10), whereas mRNA isolated from fetal human brain contained the sequences encoding these peptides (Fig. 3C, lanes6 and 11, respectively). In contrast, both the brain and kidney samples contained the HPTPδ isoform mRNA that included the fifth FN-III-like domain (Fig. 3C, lanes10 and 11) and the HPTPδ-ΔF4-7 isoform (Fig. 3C, lanes14 and 15, respectively). These results suggest that a complex pattern of HPTPδ mRNA expression can be generated by tissue-specific alternative splicing of the HPTPδ pre-mRNA and that one tissue type can express multiple HPTPδ isoforms. Based on the cDNA cloning and RT-PCR data, there is thus evidence for the existence of at least four HPTPδ isoforms: the full-length isoform (meA+, meB+, meC+, and FN-III-4-7+), an isoform lacking the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains without the meA and meB peptides (meA-, meB-, and FN-IIIΔ4-7), an isoform lacking the fourth to seventh FN-III-like domains and containing the meA and meB peptides (meA+, meB+, and FN-IIIΔ4-7), and one isoform lacking the meA and meB peptides but containing the meC peptide (meA-, meB-, meC+, and FN-III-4-7+). Given the possibility of the combinatorial use of the alternatively used exons, there may also be additional PTPδ isoforms. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a molecular mechanism to generate functional diversity of a gene product. For a number of transmembrane PTPases, including CD45, LAR, PTPδ, PTPσ, PTPζ, and PTPα, alternative splicing appears to generate a number of various isoforms with distinct functional properties(12Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Matthews J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the CD45 PTPase, the developmental and tissue-specific alternative splicing of three exons encoding amino-terminal sequences of the CD45 PTPase has been extensively documented, and there exists a strong correlation between CD45 isoform expression and the functional phenotype of the cell(38Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A regulatory role for tissue-specific, alternatively used peptide sequences has been shown for the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM (39Small S.J. Akeson R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Brummendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the N-CAM VASE exon, which encodes a 10-amino acid peptide located within the fourth N-CAM Ig-like domain, regulates the neurite outgrowth promoting activity of N-CAM(41Doherty P. Moolenaar C.E.C.K. Ashton S.V. Michalides R.J.A.M. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1992; 356: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Small peptide insertions between the second and third Ig domains have also been reported for other cell adhesion molecules, including the neural adhesion molecules, Nr-CAM and neurofascin(42Grumet M. Mauro V. Burgoon M.P. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1399-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 43Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the HPTPδ meA, meB, and meC peptides play an active role in regulating the interaction between HPTPδ and its putative ligand(s). To study the biosynthesis of HPTPδ, we generated an anti-HPTPδ mAb, termed D1.1, by immunizing mice with a murine 300-19 pre-B cell line expressing an HPTPδ-LAR chimeric protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of the HPTPδ isoforms or HPTPδ mutants was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation studies using the anti-HPTPδ mAb D1.1. To this end, pSP.SRα-HPTPδ expression plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells, cells were grown for 48-56 h, and then cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Following labeling, cell extracts were prepared, and HPTPδ protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation and visualized by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the full-length HPTPδ (HPTPδ-fl) isoform was expressed as a proprotein (Pro) of about 220 kDa that, after a 1-h chase incubation, was processed into two products of 150 (E) and 85 kDa (P) (Fig. 4A). Because of the sequence similarity of HPTPδ with LAR (26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it was likely that the HPTPδ-fl isoform was synthesized as a proprotein of 220 kDa (Pro) that is cleaved intracellularly into two subunits of 150 and 85 kDa. The 150-kDa E-subunit is predicted to contain the three Ig-like and eight FN-III-like domains, whereas the 85-kDa P-subunit contains a short ectodomain segment, the transmembrane peptide, and the intracellular PTPase domains. The HPTPδ-ΔF4-7 isoform was synthesized as a smaller proprotein (Pro/ΔF4-7) of about 175 kDa, the HPTPδ-ΔF4-7 E-subunit (E/ΔF4-7) resolved poorly with a molecular mass between 95,000 and 125,000, and the P-subunit was 85 kDa (Fig. 4B). The ectodomains of both the HPTPδ-fl and -ΔF4-7 isoforms were present in the cell culture supernatants, demonstrating that the ectodomain of HPTPδ, like LAR(26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), can be shed from the cell surface (Fig. 4B). Ectodomain shedding has been observed for a number of transmembrane proteins and is thought to play a role in decreasing the responsiveness of the cells to the cognate ligands(44Ehlers M.R.W. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HPTPδ ectodomain shedding may be important for signal transduction, membrane localization, and/or internalization of the remaining portion of HPTPδ. Because the LAR PTPase proprotein is known to be processed at a furin-like cleavage site (RXXR )(45Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.-S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located 82 amino acids amino-terminal of the putative transmembrane peptide(26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Serra-Pages C. Saito H. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23632-23641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether the HPTPδ proprotein is also processed at a furin-like cleavage site (Fig. 5). To this end, amino acid substitution mutants were generated that substituted one or two basic residues between HPTPδ-fl residues located about 85 amino acids from the putative transmembrane peptide (Fig. 2A). Between residues 1155 and 1164 (RKRRSIRYGR) there are three potential furin cleavage sites: RKRR, RSIR, and RYGR (see Fig. 5C). Each of these potential sites was altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and resulting pSP.SRα-HPTPδ plasmid DNAs harboring the R1158A, R1161A, and R1164A mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and HPTPδ-fl proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE following immunoprecipitation with the anti-HPTPδ mAb D1.1. As seen in Fig. 5A and summarized in Fig. 5C, mutation of the potential cleavage site RKRR to RKRA (mutation R1158A) decreased proprotein cleavage about 2.5-fold, whereas mutation of the other two potential sites (RSIR to RSIA and RYGR to RYGA) did not significantly affect HPTPδ proprotein processing (R1161A and R1164A mutations, respectively). However, a double mutation, R1158/R1161A, that destroyed all three potential furin cleavage sites, completely blocked HPTPδ-fl proprotein cleavage (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, HPTPδ proprotein processing can occur at two or three overlapping furin-like cleavage sites located 81-87 amino acids NH2-terminal to the putative transmembrane peptide. Because there are no cysteine residues between the proprotein cleavage sites and the transmembrane peptide, the HPTPδ E- and P-subunits, like the LAR subunits(26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), are not disulfide-bonded. The functional significance of the HPTPδ two-subunit architecture is not known. Proprotein processing of HPTPδ and LAR is not essential for surface expression, since cleavage-defective LAR and HPTPδ mutants were expressed on the cell surface ((26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and data not shown). In the case of LAR, the two-subunit structure also does not appear to play a role in ectodomain shedding(30Serra-Pages C. Saito H. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23632-23641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that proprotein cleavage is a conserved feature of several PTPases, including LAR, HPTPδ, PTPσ, and PTPκ, as well as several adhesion molecules including Ng-CAM (48Burgoon M.P. Grumet M. Mauro V. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and Nr-CAM(49Kayyem J.F. Roman J.M. De la Rosa E.J. Schwarz U. Dreyer W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1259-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggests that this proteolytic processing plays an important role in the function of these molecules. Possibly, proprotein cleavage is required for correct conformation of the ectodomain, for localization within the plasma membrane, and/or for signal transduction. In the case of the insulin receptor, cleavage of the insulin proreceptor is necessary for high affinity insulin binding as well as efficient signal transduction following ligand binding(50Williams J.F.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences and structural properties of the LAR, HPTPδ, and PTPσ PTPases suggests that these molecules comprise a subfamily of transmembrane PTPases with highly conserved architecture and common alternative splicing patterns (Fig. 6). However, whereas LAR is expressed in most tissues (26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H.

It is conceivable that this subfamily of PTPases shares a common mechanism to regulate their catalytic activity but exerts its biological function by dephosphorylating tissue-specific substrates. Further studies with specific mAbs will be necessary to document in detail the differential expression of these enzymes. In addition, the expression of multiple alternative isoforms affecting the structure of the ectodomains may determine their differential ligand specificity in the distinct tissues. The identification of such ligands constitutes a key point in understanding the physiological function and regulation of this subfamily of transmembrane PTPases. We thank Drs. Paul Anderson, John Gribben, and Quintus Medley for critical review of the manuscript, Dr. Timothy Ernst for oligonucleotide synthesis, and Dr. Stuart F. Schlossman for encouragement and support."

J., and Schlegel, R.(1990) EMBO J. 9, 137-146; Goldstein, D. J., Finbow, [Abstract] M. E., Andresson, T., McLean, P., Smith, K., Bubb, V.

(1992) Virology 190, 889-893). We generated mutations within [Medline] the 16K protein to define binding domains for BPV-1 E5 as well as to characterize the role of 16K in cell transformation. 16K consists predominantly of 4 transmembrane (TM) domains. We showed that mutations within the TM4 domain severely inhibited E5 binding. More specifically, conversion of glutamic acid 143 to arginine within TM4 severely reduced 16K/E5 binding, suggesting that charged interactions facilitated efficient binding. This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that binding to the defective 16K arginine mutant could be restored by complementary charge mutations in E5; conversion of E5 glutamine 17 to glutamic acid or aspartic acid enhanced interactions with the 16K arginine mutant. Surprisingly, mutants in TM4 not only bound poorly to wild-type E5 but were converted into an oncoprotein and induced anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells. These data define glutamic acid 143 in the 16K TM4 domain and glutamine 17 within E5 as important contributors to E5/16K binding and suggest a role for the 16K protein in the regulation of cell proliferation. The 16K subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase binds specifically to the bovine (BPV) and human (HPV) papillomavirus E5 oncoproteins, and it has been suggested that this interaction may contribute to cell transformation (Goldstein, D.

We generated mutations within [Medline] the 16K protein to define binding domains for BPV-1 E5 as well as to characterize the role of 16K in cell transformation. 16K consists predominantly of 4 transmembrane (TM) domains. We showed that mutations within the TM4 domain severely inhibited E5 binding. More specifically, conversion of glutamic acid 143 to arginine within TM4 severely reduced 16K/E5 binding, suggesting that charged interactions facilitated efficient binding. This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that binding to the defective 16K arginine mutant could be restored by complementary charge mutations in E5; conversion of E5 glutamine 17 to glutamic acid or aspartic acid enhanced interactions with the 16K arginine mutant. Surprisingly, mutants in TM4 not only bound poorly to wild-type E5 but were converted into an oncoprotein and induced anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells. These data define glutamic acid 143 in the 16K TM4 domain and glutamine 17 within E5 as important contributors to E5/16K binding and suggest a role for the 16K protein in the regulation of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1999327808,"Reactive oxygen intermediates like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been shown to serve as messengers in the induction of NF-κB and, then, in the activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 in human cells. Because H2O2 can be converted into the highly reactive OH· at various locations inside the cells, we started to investigate the generation of Reactive oxygen intermediates by photosensitization. This technique is based on the use of a photosensitizer which is a molecule absorbing visible light and which can be located at various sites inside the cell depending on its physicochemical properties. In this work, we used proflavine (PF), a cationic molecule having a high affinity for DNA, capable of intercalating between DNA base pairs. Upon visible light irradiation, intercalated PF molecules oxidize guanine residues and generate DNA single-strand breaks. In lymphocytes or monocytes latently infected with HIV-1 (ACH-2 or U1, respectively), this photosensitizing treatment induced a cytotoxicity, an induction of NF-κB, and a reactivation of HIV-1 in cells surviving the treatment. NF-κB induction by PF-mediated photosensitization was not affected by the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine while strong inhibition was recorded when the induction was triggered by H2O2 or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Another transcription factor like AP-1 is less activated by this photosensitizing treatment. In comparison with other inducing treatments, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis factor α, the activation of NF-κB is slow, being optimal 120 min after treatment. These kinetic data were obtained by following, on the same samples, both the appearance of NF-κB in the nucleus and the disappearance of IκB-α in cytoplasmic extracts. These data allow us to postulate that signaling events, initiated by DNA oxidative damages, are transmitted into the cytoplasm where the inactive NF-κB factor is resident and allow the translocation of p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB to the nucleus leading to HIV-1 gene expression.

Considerable interest has been focused recently on the role that some host transcriptional factors may play in the initial activation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusPFproflavineLTRlong terminal repeatILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorROIreactive oxygen intermediateEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCHXcycloheximideNACN-acetyl-L-cysteine. gene expression by interacting with the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the integrated provirus(1Haseltine W. Control of Human Retrovirus Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the LTR depends largely on a major enhancer made of two directly repeated sequences able to respond to the transcription factor NF-κB(2Nabel G. Baltimore D.

Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The consensus recognition site for this factor is a decamer with two pentameric half-sites, each of which participates in the recognition and stabilization of binding of the NF-κB dimer (for a review, see Refs. 4 to 6). For this DNA binding to occur and HIV-1 transcription to be initiated, NF-κB usually associating p50 and p65 subunits must be translocated into the nucleus from the cytoplasm where it is normally retained by interaction with its inhibitory subunit named IκB(7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Related κB enhancers are present in the regulatory region of various cellular genes like interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 receptor-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and have further been shown to be functionally involved in the transcriptional induction by various T-cell stimulants(9Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Functionally active NF-κB complexes are induced after cellular activation in one of the following ways: through the CD3-T-cell receptor complex in T-lymphocytes, in response to antigen recognition (10Horvat R.T.

Treatment of T-lymphocytes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces NF-κB DNA binding activity and nuclear appearance of this factor (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar) followed by a transcriptional activation of the proviral DNA in cells latently infected with HIV-1 (17Legrand-Poels S. Vaira D. Pincemail J. Van de Vorst A. Piette J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB by treatment of T-cells with H2O2 appears to be a specific event because it occurs at low extracellular concentrations, and other DNA-binding proteins do not seem to be affected(16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar). Presumably, the mechanism involves a passive diffusion of H2O2 through the cell membrane where it would trigger indirectly IκB phosphorylation and its controlled proteolytic degradation, through a cytoplasmic chymotrypsin-like protease, providing therefore an irreversible NF-κB activation(18Henkel T. Machleidt Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) continuously as side products of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain reaction but also upon exposition to solar radiations (UV and visible light) or γ-rays (reviewed in (19Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar) and (20Davies K.J.A. Oxidative Damage and Repair. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1991Google Scholar)). Most inducers of NF-κB seem to rely on the production of ROIs as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of antioxidants such as cysteine derivatives (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar, 21Staal F. Roederer M. Raju P.A. Anderson M.T. Ela S.W. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. AIDS Res. Hum.

Commun. 1993; 189: 1709-1715Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has then been proposed that ROIs serve as common messengers in the activation of NF-κB (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar) and that NF-κB is primarily an oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor. The molecular pathways leading to the critical dissociation of NF-κB heterodimers from IκB are not yet fully elucidated, especially the nature of the biochemical events capable of initiating the redox controlled pathway. With UV, several authors have postulated that DNA damages can trigger the events leading to the activation of NF-κB and then to HIV-1 gene expression. The demonstration that the initial event in UV activation of HIV-1 could well be lesions induced to DNA has been obtained by (i) determining the action spectrum of UV-induced HIV-1 gene expression(25Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), (ii) demonstrating that the HIV-1 LTR is activated by much lower doses of UV when it is resident in a cell from the repair-deficient disease, xeroderma pigmentosum, than when it is in a repair-proficient cell(25Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and (iii) by abrogation of the viral gene activation when cells are fused with liposomes encapsulating T4 endonuclease V(26Yarosh D.B. Alas L. Kibitel J. O'Connor A. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 790-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a signal which leads to HIV-1 gene expression could be initiated in the nucleus by UV. It would migrate to the cytoplasm where it activates NF-κB by releasing its inhibitory subunit IκB and allowing p50/p65 subunits to translocate to the nucleus where they bind to their DNA responsive elements situated in the LTR of the HIV-1 provirus. However, it has also been shown(27Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 28Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) that the mammalian UV response is triggered by the activation of tyrosine kinases situated at the plasma membrane level, and, also, cells anucleated by cytochalasin B treatment are still fully responsive to UV in terms of NF-κB induction. Thus, HIV-1 activation by UV-C could well involve two distinct pathways, one being initiated by UV-products in DNA such as pyrimidine dimers, the other through oxidative damages induced in membranes. In this paper, we show that oxidative DNA modifications like 7,8-dihydro-oxyoguanine and single-stranded breaks, generated by a photosensitizer which intercalates between DNA base pairs(29Hoffman A.D. Banapour B. Levy J.A. Virology. 1985; 147: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar), can activate NF-κB and HIV-1 reactivation, supporting the idea that oxidative DNA damages would be molecular intermediates able to trigger a signaling pathway to the cytoplasm. The lymphocytic ACH-2 and the promonocytic U1 cell lines are both cultivated at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml. Exponentially growing cells were washed with PBSG (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, pH 7.4) and resuspended in this buffer at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. PF was added at different concentrations (between 1 and 0.1 mM) to cells suspended (in PBSG) for 15 min in the dark before irradiation to allow its penetration inside the cells. Before irradiation, cells were washed in PBSG to eliminate extracellular and nonintercalated PF. At various times of irradiation with filtered light (Osram XBO-150, Germany, λ > 360 nm, 40 watts/m2), cells were collected and replaced in culture. Between 30 and 240 min after the treatment, aliquots were removed and used to prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. After 24 and 48 h, cells were counted and aliquots of supernatant fluid were removed for the determination of the virus associated-reverse transcriptase activity. PF localization inside the cell was determined by fluorescence using either a conventional (Zeiss) or a confocal microscope (Meridian). The reverse transcriptase assay was done as described(29Hoffman A.D. Banapour B. Levy J.A. Virology. 1985; 147: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, the virus was purified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation of supernatant fluids (131,000 × g at 4°C for 2 h). Pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of TNE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and left on ice for 30 min. Then, 10 μl of the virus preparations were incubated at 37°C for 60 to 90 min with 40 μl of a solution containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 6.25 mM dithiothreitol, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 180 mM KCl, 0.06% Triton X-100, 0.375 mM glutathione, 0.325 mM EGTA, 31 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% ethylene glycol, 250 milliunits/ml poly(rA)-oligo(dT), and 125 μCi/ml [3H]deoxythymidine. The DNA resulting from the extension reaction carried out by the reverse transcriptase was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and filtered through 2.4-mm Whatman GF-A filters. Filters were rinsed with 0.01 M sodium pyrophosphate, dried with 95% ethanol, and then counted by liquid scintillation. Nuclear extracts were isolated as described by a rapid micropreparation technique based on the use of a hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) and which is derived from the large scale procedure of Dignam et al.(31Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9116) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed for 25 min at room temperature with 3-5 μg of total protein in 10 to 20 μl of 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (Eurogentech, Belgium). Oligonucleotides were labeled by end-filling with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) with [32P]dATP, [32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN), and cold dTTP + dGTP. Labeled probes were purified by spin chromatography on Sephadex G-25 columns. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe on native 6% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V in 0.25 M Tris, 0.25 M sodium borate, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray films at −80°C for 16 to 24 h. The amount of specific complexes were determined either by counting the radioactivity with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by photodensitometry (LKB) of the autoradiography. Supershift experiments were carried out as described (32Franzoso G. Bours V. Park S. Tomita-Yamagushi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Nature. 1992; 359: 207-210Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and following the same EMSA protocol as described above except that the gel concentration is 4%. The sequences of the probes used in this work are: Wild-type NF-κB probe: 5'-GATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG TCCCTGAAAGGCGACCCCTGAAAGGTCCTAC-5'Mutated NF-κB probe: 5'-GATCACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAG TGAGTGAAAGGCGACGAGTGAAAGGTCCTAG-5' IκB-α subunit was detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at various times after the PF-mediated photosensitization by hypotonic lysis, pelleting of the nuclei, and collecting the supernatant fraction(32Franzoso G. Bours V. Park S. Tomita-Yamagushi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Nature. 1992; 359: 207-210Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic proteins were added to a loading buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue), boiled, and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Filters were incubated in primary antibody for 60 min at 37°C (1:2000 dilution), then in peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution) for 60 min at 37°C, and finally analyzed using Amersham's enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) (Amersham) using Fuji x-ray films. Promonocytic and lymphocytic cell lines were cultivated as described above. Irradiation in the presence of PF (0.25 and 1.0 μM) or rose bengal (1.0 and 2.5 μM) was carried out in PBSG on ice in a shallow dish (106 cells/ml). Subsequent damage analysis by alkaline elution analysis is described elsewhere(33Epe B. Pflaum M. Boiteux S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 34Epe B. Hegler J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); it follows essentially the protocol of Kohn et al.(35Kohn K.W. Erickson L.C. Ewig R.A.G. Friedman C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4629-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) with an additional incubation with a repair endonuclease solution (3 μg/ml formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase protein) which was applied after cell lysis and prior to treatment with proteinase K. To quantify strand breaks, this incubation was carried out without endonuclease. An oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 can lead to the HIV-1 reactivation (17Legrand-Poels S. Vaira D. Pincemail J. Van de Vorst A. Piette J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) through the activation of the cellular factor NF-κB(16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar, 22Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 36Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radicals Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Several authors speculated that H2O2 can passively cross the plasma membrane and, within the cell, is either converted by catalases into H2O and O2, or, by the Fenton reaction into hydroxyl radicals (OH·). Because H2O2 can be converted into the highly reactive OH radical at various cellular localizations, it was unclear from these data what type of cellular oxidative damage triggers NF-κB activation and then HIV-1 reactivation. To try to clarify whether or not DNA oxidative damages can participate in the NF-κB activation pathway, we have used photosensitization reactions to generate ROIs in the DNA of lymphocytic (ACH-2) or monocytic (U1) cell lines latently infected by HIV-1. The photosensitizer used in this work is proflavine (PF) (Fig. 1A) which is a water-soluble cationic chromophore having an important affinity for DNA (37, see (38Waring M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 159-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) for review). PF intercalates between DNA base pairs, and, when mixed with ACH-2 or U1, it binds to DNA and is localized in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1B). No chromophore fluorescence was detected outside the cell nucleus either by classical fluorescence microscopy or by confocal microscopy using a highly sensitive camera even in the presence of a large molar excess of PF compared to the concentrations used in the following experiments (Fig. 1B). No PF fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm or in membrane and the nuclear restriction of PF is particularly striking when compared with a membrane-associated chromophore such as merocyanine 540 (Fig. 1B). Promonocytic U937 and lymphocytic CEM T-cells, which are the parental cell lines used to generate U1 and ACH-2 cell lines, respectively, were mixed with PF to characterize and quantify DNA damages induced by PF-mediated photosensitization. The irradiation of PF with visible light is known to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) by an energy transfer mechanism (type II reaction) and a so-called type I reaction causing electron transfer from guanine to PF (see (39Piette J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1991; 11: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and (40Piette J. Merville M.P. Decuyper J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1986; 44: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) for reviews). These two photochemical pathways are known to generate guanine oxidation products and single-strand breaks(41Cadet J. Vigny P. Morrison H. Bioorganic Photochemistry. Wiley, New York1990: 1-272Google Scholar). In order to clarify the specificity of DNA oxidation products induced by PF-mediated photosensitization, the amount of DNA lesions induced by this treatment was compared to those obtained by photosensitization with rose bengal which is an anionic photosensitizer known to enter inside cells and to localize predominantly in the cell cytoplasm(42Rück A. Köllner T. Dietrich A. Strauss W. Schnecknburger H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1992; 12: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rose bengal photosensitization generates singlet oxygen but also superoxide anion which can be dismutated into H2O2(43Lee P.C.C. Rodgers M.A.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 45: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). DNA single-stranded breaks and DNA modifications sensitive to the repair endonuclease formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase protein were quantified by means of an alkaline elution technique. Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase protein is known to recognize 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine residues in DNA, in addition to sites of base loss and formamidopyrimidines(44Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 45Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Results obtained are shown in Fig. 2 for both cell lines. In the reactions photosensitized by PF, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase-sensitive sites (0.75 and 0.3 modifications per 106 base pairs for U937 and CEM cells, respectively) are induced in high excess of single-stranded breaks (0.18 and 0.08 modifications per 106 base pairs for U937 and CEM cells, respectively). The predominant formation of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase-sensitive base modifications (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) is characteristic for the DNA damage induced by singlet oxygen and type I photosensitization and was described for L1210 cells exposed to acridine orange plus light, a photosensitizer closely related to PF(33Epe B. Pflaum M. Boiteux S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case of rose bengal, single-stranded breaks and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase-sensitive modifications are induced in almost the same amount (Fig. 2). This confirms that DNA damages by rose bengal were generated indirectly, e.g. via hydroxyl radicals formed in a Fenton reaction or via nucleases, which would be activated by damage to membranes or calcium stores. These indirect mechanisms are consistent with the prominent localization of rose bengal in the cytoplasm. Cell survival is strongly affected by the PF-mediated photosensitization reaction. Fig. 3A shows that this treatment induces an important lethal effect which increases with the irradiation time. ACH-2 cells turns out to be somewhat more sensitive than the U1 cell line. For each cell line, the level of cytotoxicity is also proportional to PF concentration up to 1.5 μM (Fig. 3B). Cell irradiation with visible light only does not lead to any cytotoxicity demonstrating that a chromophore is required to induce a lethal damage. Among the cells surviving PF photosensitization, HIV-1 reactivation can be detected by measuring reverse transcriptase activity in the cell supernatant 24 and 48 h after the phototreatment (Fig. 4). After 24 h, the level of reverse transcriptase activity is still relatively low (data not shown), but becomes maximal 48 h after photosensitization. Two important results can be deduced from reverse transcriptase measurements: (i) reverse transcriptase values increase as a function of stress intensity, and (ii) for similar survival fractions, reverse transcriptase activities are somewhat higher for ACH-2 than for U1 cells. These results indicate also that the cells have to be cultured for at least 48 h after the stress to release virus particles in the supernatant. 30% survival seems to correspond to a stress intensity leading to the optimal virus reactivation. In other words, when the survival fraction is too low, there are not enough viable cells in culture to proliferate and to reactivate HIV-1. ACH-2 cells are widely used not only for studying HIV-1 reactivation (14Clouse K.A. Powell D. Washington I. Poli G. Strebel K. Farrar W. Barstad P. Kovacs J. Fauci A.S. Folks T.M. J.

Because an oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 is known to strongly activate NF-κB(16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

ACH-2 cells were incubated in PBSG in the presence of various concentrations of PF before being irradiated with visible light for 10 min. After the photosensitization, the cells were replaced in culture for at least 120 min before preparing nuclear extracts and analyzing DNA binding to a NF-κB probe using EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5A, PF-mediated photosensitization induced an activity that retarded, in native gels, a 32P-labeled DNA probe encompassing the decameric NF-κB motif from the HIV-1 enhancer. The NF-κB activity was already significantly increased at a very low PF concentration (0.25 μM) corresponding to one PF molecule intercalated per several hundreds of DNA base pairs to be maximum at 1.0 μM (Fig. 5B). Above this concentration, the stimulation of the NF-κB activity starts to decrease probably because of the shielding effect of PF molecules stacked along the sugar-pho"

We have previously described the mapping of transcriptional regulatory regions in the 5′-flanking sequence of the peripherin gene by 5′-deletion mapping(4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two positive regulatory elements are necessary for full induction by NGF: a distal positive element approximately 2400 bp upstream of the transcription start site and a proximal constitutive element within 111 bp of the transcriptional start site. In addition, there is a negative regulatory element (NRE) centered at −173 whose deletion results in elevated basal expression of the gene. We have proposed a two-step model of transcriptional activation of peripherin by NGF in which dissociation of a repressor from the protein complex at the NRE, coupled with a positive signal from the distal positive element, results in complete activation of the gene. We have previously shown that a unique sequence, GGCAGGGCGCC, in the NRE, is specifically recognized by a DNA-binding protein. Methylation interference footprinting of the NRE demonstrates that the specific nucleotides contacted by protein are identical in undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cell nuclear extracts. Mutagenesis of the footprinted nucleotides in a peripherin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct results in increased expression of the reporter gene in undifferentiated PC12 cells and in 3T3 cells. This result is consistent with the proposed function of the NRE as the binding site of a repressor. DNA mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide probe containing the footprinted sequence demonstrate prominent DNA-protein complexes in nuclear extracts from undifferentiated PC12 cells that migrate with slower mobility than the complexes produced using differentiated PC12 cell nuclear extract. The slowly migrating complexes are also formed in EMSA assays using nuclear extract from nonneuronal cell lines (liver and mouse erythroleukemia cells). In summary, the proteins binding at the NRE are altered during the process of NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation, whereas the methylation interference footprinting pattern is invariant. These observations taken together suggest the following hypothesis: protein(s) directly contacting the NRE are similar in undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, whereas a repressor protein participates in the complex via protein-protein interactions in undifferentiated PC12 cells and nonneuronal cell types(4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We are particularly interested in understanding how NGF-triggered events relieve the repression of the peripherin gene during the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. As a first step in understanding this mechanism, we have purified the DNA-binding protein forming the basis of the protein complex at the NRE. In this paper, we report the purification of a 33-kDa protein that specifically recognizes the NRE. Microsequencing of this protein reveals identity with NF1-L, a member of the CTF/NF-1 transcription factor family. In addition, fractionation experiments suggest that non-DNA binding proteins interact with NF1-L to form a multiprotein complex at the NRE. Stock cultures of PC12 cells were maintained as described previously(24Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PC12 cells grown for nuclear extract preparation were plated on plastic culture dishes coated with collagen (Celtrix Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) at a density of 3 × 106 cells/150-mm dish. NGF was added 24 h after plating (50 ng/ml; 2.5 S, Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% defined and supplemented calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Rat liver extracts were prepared according to the method of Gorski et al.(25Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Each buffer in the preparation contained the following additives, added immediately before use: 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM 4-amidinophenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mM NaF. Frozen rat livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats (average weight, 10 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were thawed on ice in treated homogenization buffer, blended in a Waring blender, homogenized using a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer, and then filtered through cheesecloth. After purification and lysis of the nuclei, the KCl concentration was adjusted to 0.42 M by the addition of nuclear lysis buffer + 1 M KCl. After 45 min shaking at 4°C, the chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation in a TLA100.3 rotor at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against BC100 (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF) for 4 h with one change of buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared from PC12 cells according to the method of Dignam (26Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 14: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) as described previously(4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Differentiated PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 6 days prior to harvesting for nuclear extract preparation. The conditions for the DNA-protein binding reactions were essentially as described previously (4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Poly(dI-dC) was reduced to 0.1-0.5 μg/reaction when partially purified protein fractions were used. Competition experiments included 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide unless otherwise indicated. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5 or 7% polyacrylamide gels (30:0.8, acrylamide/bis-acrylamide), using conditions described previously(27Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Supershift assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with 1 μl of anti-NF1 antibody (partially purified by elution from a protein A-Sepharose column) or preimmune serum for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of the DNA probe. Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed as reported previously (50Spandau D.F. Lee C-H. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) except that reactions were scaled up to a 45-μl final volume, with 90,000 cpm (0.5 ng) of 32P-labeled DNA probe. The DNA probe was generated by primed synthesis using [32P]dCTP (800 Ci/mmol) from a single-stranded M13 template into which the WTRS oligonucleotide (see Table 1) had been cloned. After cleavage with HindIII, the 32P-labeled probe was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted overnight at 37°C in 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, followed by two ethanol precipitations.Tabled 1 The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then irradiated with the output of a frequency-quadrupled, 266-nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA). The net energy output of the laser was 9 mJ/s. Cross-linking was performed with 405 mJ, after which the samples were immediately placed on ice. This laser was made available to us by Dr. Joseph Beecham, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The reactions were then boiled in SDS loading buffer and DNA-protein adducts separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Methylation interference footprinting with the purified protein fraction was performed essentially as described previously(4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, a BamHI-StyI 147-bp restriction fragment containing the NRE (−245 to −98 of the peripherin promoter) was used as probe. Reactions contained 1 μl (approximately 20 fmoles) of purified protein. After EMSA, DNA was eluted from gel pieces containing bound or free DNA in 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA. The rest of the procedure was performed as described by Baldwin (28Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, Brooklyn, NY1987Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in DNA mobility shift assays were synthesized on a Milligen Biosearch Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer and gel purified. For protein purification, BCxx buffers were used where x denotes mM KCl in the following buffer: 20 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mM NaF. Approximately 700 mg of liver nuclear extract was passed over a 120-ml bed volume column of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in two separate runs. The column was loaded at 1 ml/min and washed with 2 column volumes (CV) of BC150 buffer. Step elution of proteins was performed with 2.5 CV of BC350 buffer, and 5 ml fractions were collected. 5-μg aliquots of flow-through and eluent fractions were assayed for PPRS DNA-binding activity by EMSA (see Table 1). Positive fractions were pooled, adjusted to 100 mM KCl with BC00, and concentrated in Centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon). Aliquots of the positive heparin-Sepharose column eluent fractions (30 mg each) were loaded onto a 10 ml of calf thymus DNA-Sepharose column at 0.2 ml/min. The calf thymus DNA-Sepharose was prepared by coupling calf thymus DNA to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose-CL2B, according to the procedure described by Kadonaga and Tjian(29Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of KCl (0.1-1.5 M; 36 ml), and 2-ml fractions were collected. The majority of PPRS-binding activity eluted between 200 mM KCl and 700 mM KCl. Active fractions were pooled and brought to 150 mM KCl with BC00, and insulin was added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. The PPRS affinity column was prepared by coupling concatenated double-stranded PPRS oligonucleotides to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL2B as described by Kadonaga and Tjian(29Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), yielding 75 μg of coupled DNA/ml resin. The pooled fractions from the calf thymus DNA-Sepharose column were incubated with 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC)/5 μg of protein (Pharmacia) for 10 min at 4°C and spun at 10,000 rpm. This protein was then incubated with 2 ml of the PPRS-Sepharose resin for 30 min with gently rocking at 4°C. The extract-resin slurry was then allowed to settle in a 10-ml column. The flow-through was collected and passed over the affinity column a second time. The column was washed with 10 CV of BC200 and eluted with 10 CV of BC1500, followed by 5 CV of BC3000. 1.5-ml fractions from the wash step and 1-ml fractions from the high salt elution were collected in siliconized tubes. Aliquots of every other fraction were tested for activity by EMSA, and active fractions were pooled, concentrated with Centricon-10 microconcentrators (Amicon), and adjusted to 150 mM KCl with BC00. The pooled active fractions were passed over the PPRS affinity column a second time as above except that the preincubation was with 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)/ml of protein, and the protein was loaded directly onto the preformed PPRS affinity column. Elution was performed with 12 CV BC2000 and 4 CV of BC3000. Eluent fractions were assayed by EMSA with the PPRS probe, pooled, concentrated, and diluted to 150 mM KCl. Aliquots of protein at various stages of purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% gel), and protein bands were visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus). In order to test the hypothesis that the DNA-binding core of the complex at the NRE is common to undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, we performed EMSA assays under conditions that might disrupt protein-protein but not protein-DNA interactions. We reasoned that such conditions might dissociate the unique components of the slowly migrating complexes found in undifferentiated cells, producing the differentiated pattern of complexes. Deoxycholate was used in a first attempt to disrupt protein-protein interactions, with no effect (data not shown). Next we asked whether high salt would differentially affect protein-protein interactions. This experiment was performed with a mutant NRE oligonucleotide in which three point mutations outside the contact nucleotides make the binding site a perfect palindrome (PPRS; Table 1). DNA-protein complexes formed with the PPRS oligonucleotide are identical to those formed with the wild-type oligonucleotide (WTRS; Table 1) in EMSA analysis (compare Fig. 1A, lanes1-2 with 1B, lanes1-2). However, the DNA-protein interaction can withstand higher salt conditions (compare Fig. 1A, lane3 with 1B, lane5). This enables the salt titration shown in Fig. 1A to be performed. Under normal EMSA conditions (67 mM KCl), a pattern of complexes A, B, and C is obtained with undifferentiated PC12 cell extract, whereas complexes C, D, and E predominate in differentiated PC12 cell extract (Fig. 1A, compare lanes1 and 2). As the KCl concentration is increased above 250 mM KCl in reactions performed with undifferentiated PC12 cell extract, complexes A and B disappear concomitant with the appearance of complexes D and E. At 750 mM KCl, the complexes formed with both extracts migrate similarly (lanes7 and 8). Thus high salt conditions selectively disrupt the slowly migrating complexes unique to undifferentiated PC12 cell extract, leaving intact a constitutively present protein core. In order to facilitate purification of the protein(s) directly binding to the NRE, we considered that mutation of the NRE binding sequence from an imperfect to a perfect palindrome might increase the affinity of the DNA-binding protein for this site. This approach was successfully used by Treisman in the purification of SRF(31Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The PPRS oligonucletide (Table 1) shown above to form complexes resistant to high salt was used for this purpose. Off-rate analysis was performed to obtain a qualitative measure of the relative stability of complexes formed with the wild-type or perfect palindromic DNA oligonucleotides. Complexes formed with undifferentiated PC12 cell nuclear extract and either labeled WTRS or PPRS probes were incubated with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled WTRS or PPRS competitor DNA, respectively, for varying times before analysis of DNA-protein complex formation by EMSA. Densitometric analysis of the resultant autoradiograph demonstrated that after 30 min of incubation with cold competitor, only 23% of the labeled WTRS-protein complexes remain, whereas 86% of the labeled PPRS-protein complexes remain (data not shown). DNA-protein complexes formed with the PPRS probe exhibit identical specificity in competitor analysis to those formed with the wild-type NRE (Fig. 1C). Complexes formed with either the WTRS or PPRS probe and PC12 cell nuclear extract are ineffectively competed away by an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide that has been mutated in four of the contact nucleotides determined by methylation interference footprinting (RM3; Table 1; (4Thompson M.A. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Unlabeled PPRS and WTRS oligonucleotides effectively compete for protein binding to either probe. Since the PPRS is GC-rich (Table 1), we additionally tested several GC-rich competitors (SP1 binding site (32Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor GCF binding site(33Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)) in EMSA with the PPRS probe. These competitors could not effectively compete for specific protein binding either to the WTRS or the PPRS oligonucleotides (data not shown). In order to characterize the proteins comprising the repressor complex at the NRE, we decided to first purify the protein that directly contacts the DNA. To facilitate the purification of the NRE binding protein, we utilized the findings that the PPRS sequence has higher affinity for the protein complex, and binding is resistant to high salt. In addition, we tested whether rat liver, a tissue in which peripherin expression is repressed, would be a convenient source for large scale purification of the repressor proteins. Fig. 2 shows that proteins in liver extract produce the same slowly migrating complexes (A and B) that are present in undifferentiated PC12 cell nuclear extract, consistent with the repressed state of the peripherin gene in both of these cell types (compare lanes2 and 3 with 4-6). It is of interest that liver nuclear extract also forms the faster migrating complexes that predominate in differentiated PC12 cells. (A possible explanation for this is that the multiprotein complexes might partially dissociate in the longer procedure of preparing nuclear extract from tissue.) Additionally, the titration of binding activity with increasing protein concentration in the EMSA assay in Fig. 2 suggests a greater abundance of NRE-binding proteins in rat liver. Purification of the NRE binding protein was accomplished by DNA affinity chromatography(29Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The EMSA assay (34Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35Fried A. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) was used to follow DNA-binding activity through the purification steps. Rat liver nuclear extract was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column and step-eluted at 0.35 M KCl, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Active fractions were then passed over a calf thymus DNA-Sepharose CL2B column in order to remove high affinity nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. In order to purify the proteins binding specifically to the NRE, we prepared an affinity matrix consisting of concatemerized PPRS oligonucleotides coupled to activated Sepharose CL2B(29Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pooled active fractions eluted from the calf thymus DNA column were incubated with poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA prior to loading on the PPRS oligonucleotide affinity column. Flow-through fractions were collected, followed by a low salt wash at 200 mM KCl, and high affinity proteins were eluted at 1.5 M and 3 M KCl. Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for DNA binding activity. Active fractions were pooled, adjusted to 150 mM KCl, and passed over the PPRS affinity column a second time to achieve greater enrichment for the DNA-binding protein. Fig. 3 demonstrates EMSA analysis of fractions from the first and second pass over the PPRS affinity column. The flow-through and low-salt wash are negative for specific NRE binding activity, whereas the majority of the DNA binding activity elutes at 1.5 M KCl. A single DNA-protein complex is formed with the protein eluted from the affinity column. This complex migrates with similar mobility to band E, the fastest migrating complex formed with crude differentiated PC12 cell extract. The specific activity of protein fractions at each stage of purification is shown in Table 2. An approximate 15,000-fold purification was achieved.Tabled 1 To evaluate the purity of the fractions eluted from the PPRS affinity column, aliquots of active fractions were taken after each successive round of purification, loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized with silver stain. Fig. 4 demonstrates the selective enrichment of a single 33-kDa protein. Maximum enrichment of the 33-kDa protein and diminution of nonspecific proteins occurs after elution of protein fractions from the second pass over the PPRS affinity column (compare lane"

Modifier of pma1 (mop) mutants were isolated as enhancers of the mutant phenotypes of pma1 mutants. mop2 mutations reduce the abundance and activity of Pma1 protein on the plasma membrane without affecting the abundance of other prominent plasma membrane proteins. The MOP2 gene encodes a 108-kDa protein that has previously been identified both as a gene affecting the yeast cytoskeleton (SLA2) (Holtzman, D.A., Yang, S., and Drubin, D. G.(1993) J. Cell Biol. 122, 635-644) and as a gene affecting endocytosis (END4) (Raths, S., Roher, J., Crausaz, F., and Riezman, H.(1993) J. Cell Biol. 120, 55-65). In some strains, MOP2 (SLA2) is essential for cell viability; in others, a deletion mutant is temperature sensitive for growth. mop2 mutations do not reduce the transcription of PMA1 nor do they lead to the accumulation of Pma1 protein in any intracellular compartment. An epitope-tagged MOP2 protein behaves as a plasma membrane-associated protein whose abundance is proportional to its level of gene expression. Over-expression of MOP2 relieved the toxicity caused by the over-expression of PMA1 from a high copy plasmid; conversely, the growth of mop2 strains was inhibited by the presence of a single extra copy of PMA1.

We conclude that MOP2 (SLA2) encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein that is required for the accumulation and/or maintenance of plasma membrane H+-ATPase on the cell surface. The plasma membrane proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for the maintenance of intracellular pH and the large electrochemical gradient that is necessary for the transport of many nutrients (Goffeau and Slayman, 1981; Bowman and Bowman, 1986; Slayman, 1986; Goffeau and Dufour, 1988; Serrano, 1988). Yeast H+-ATPase is structurally and functionally analogous to the mammalian cation-translocating P-type ATPases including Na+/K+-, H+/K+-, and Ca2+-ATPase (Shull et al., 1985; MacLennan et al., 1986; Brandl et al., 1986). A comparison of the sequence of these enzymes has shown extensive homology that includes most functional domains (Serrano et al., 1986; Serrano, 1988). Like other P-type ATPases, the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase has a catalytic subunit of ∼100 kDa, hydrolyzes ATP via a transient aspartylphosphate intermediate, and is inhibited by low concentrations of vanadate. The H+-ATPase is a major cell protein, representing about 15% of the plasma membrane protein and 0.3% of total yeast protein (Serrano, 1991; Serrano, 1988; Bowman et al., 1981). Genetic studies have shown that the PMA1 gene encoding the H+-ATPase is essential (Serrano et al., 1986). The abundance of the yeast H+-ATPase in the plasma membrane appears to be tightly regulated, as over-expression of the PMA1 gene on multicopy plasmids in yeast yields no significant increase in the amount of PMA1 protein (Pma1) in the plasma membrane (Eraso et al., 1987). This regulation does not appear to occur at the transcriptional level but must occur at any one of a number of steps during its proper entry into and progress through the entire secretory pathway or in its maintenance in the plasma membrane. Many membrane proteins exist as part of homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric structures. Many of the animal P-type ATPases form an active holoenzyme containing two subunits, a ∼100-kDa α subunit and a smaller ∼40-60-kDa glycoprotein β subunit (Lingrel et al., 1988). The α subunit is considered the catalytic subunit while the β subunit appears to be involved with the folding and maturation of the α subunit (Geering et al., 1987). The association of the α subunit with an appropriate β protein is required for exit from endoplasmic reticulum (Jaunin et al., 1992) and subsequent transport to the plasma membrane (Noguchi et al., 1987; Takeyasu and Kawakami, 1989). For example, functional expression of Na+/K+-ATPase in various expression systems such as Xenopus oocytes or stably transfected cell lines requires the co-expression of a compatible endogenous or exogenous β subunit (Noguchi et al., 1987; Takeyasu et al., 1988; Lemas et al., 1992). The requirement for the expression of both α and β subunits is also seen when the mammalian Na+/K+-ATPase genes are expressed in yeast (Horowitz et al., 1990). In the case of the Na+/K+-ATPase, the β subunit appears to play an important role in catalysis and in interactions with extracellular inhibitors (Geering, 1990). A β subunit is not required for the catalytic activity of the Ca2+-ATPases (Wuytack and Racemackers, 1992). The yeast H+-ATPase does not appear to require a β-like protein for its maturation, transport, or functional expression on the plasma membrane. Although there is a 115-kDa glycoprotein tightly associated with the H+-ATPase during the purification (Vai et al., 1988), the activity of the enzyme is normal in a mutant strain lacking the glycoprotein (Serrano et al., 1991). Previous research has demonstrated that the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity is regulated in response to growth conditions, increasing severalfold during glucose metabolism (Serrano, 1983) and in an acid medium (Eraso et al., 1987). This regulation is likely to occur by one of several mechanisms of post-translational modification. Protein phosphorylation, caused by several protein kinases, has been demonstrated both for the Ca2+-ATPase (Caroni and Carafoli, 1981) and for the yeast H+-ATPase (Chang and Slayman, 1991). In addition, the C-terminal domain of the mammalian Ca2+-ATPase can interact with calmodulin to regulate its activity (Carafoli, 1992). Allosteric regulation of the plant H+-ATPase enzyme by a synthetic C-terminal peptide has also been reported (Palmgren et al., 1991). Both mutation or deletion of the analogous C terminus of the yeast H+-ATPase leads to the loss of glucose activation (Portillo et al., 1989). Whether such regulation in yeast depends on another interacting protein is unknown. In this paper, we describe the identification and characterization of MOP2, a gene that is essential in some strains and nearly so in others. MOP2 protein behaves as a plasma membrane-associated protein. Mutations in MOP2 reduce dramatically the activity and abundance of Pma1 in the plasma membrane without affecting the abundance of other prominent plasma membrane proteins. Over-expression of MOP2 can rescue the inhibitory effect on cell growth caused by high expression of PMA1. Surprisingly, MOP2 has recently been identified in two very different searches of new yeast mutants. Holtzman et al. (1993) have identified mutations in the same gene as SLA2, synthetic lethal mutation in combination with a deletion of an actin binding protein. At the same time, Raths et al.(1993) have identified the same gene as END4, essential for endocytosis. 1H. Riezman, personal communication. These results suggest that MOP2 (SLA2) plays a central role in the maintenance and distribution of integral membrane proteins, including Pma1. All yeast strains were isogenic derivatives of Y55 (HO gal3 MAL1 SUC1). The isolation and characterization of pma1-114 was described earlier (McCusker et al., 1987). Strain SN53 (MATaho::LEU2 ura3-1 arg4-1 mop2-2) was derived from a stable segregant of diploid SN46, which was created by crossing wild type SH89 (MATaho:LEU2 ade6-1 arg4-1 trp5-1 ura3-1 leu2-1) with MATα spores of diploid Y55-300 (HO ade6-1 mop2-2). The diploid strain Y55-296 (HO ura3-1 leu2-1) was used to study the over-expression of MOP2, PMA1, or both. Strain YPS3-2A (ho MATaleu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ63, pma1-Δ::HIS3, pma2-Δ::TRP1) was provided by A. Goffeau. Yeast strains were transformed using the lithium acetate procedure of Ito et al.(1983) as modified by Schiestl and Gietz(1989). A haploid-viable, temperature-sensitive derivative of a mop2::URA3 deletion was obtained by transforming diploid DDY288 (Holtzman et al., 1993) with the URA3-marked disruption of MOP2 (SLA2) in plasmid pSN101, described below. The media used in these experiments have been previously described (Perlin et al., 1989). Cells were grown in YEPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose, pH 5.5) or standard defined media lacking uracil or leucine. The ability of cells to grow under conditions of low external pH was tested in YEPD medium adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl. Hygromycin B resistance was scored using YEPD containing 300 or 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cycloheximide hypersensitivity was scored using YEPD containing 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide. The MOP2 gene was originally obtained as a genomic DNA insert into the multicopy plasmid YEp24. The MOP2 containing clone recovered from the screening of a genomic DNA library was designated pSN12. A restriction map is shown in Fig. 1. Plasmids with different deletions of MOP2 were derived from pSN12 as follows. Plasmid pSN33 was constructed by cutting pSN12 with BglII and ligated so that a 3.6-kb 2The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. BglII-BglII fragment was deleted from the insert DNA. Plasmid pSN35 was constructed by cutting pSN12 with PvuII and ligated so that a 2.9-kb fragment was deleted. Plasmid pSN42 was constructed by inserting a 4.6-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment from pSN12 into YEp24 digested with BamHI and NheI. Plasmid pSN47 was constructed by inserting a 3.4-kb BglII-BglII fragment from pSN12 into BamHI-digested YEp24. pSN48 was constructed by inserting the 4.6-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment from pSN12 into BamHI and XbaI-digested pBluscript KS(-) (Stratagene). A MOP2 null mutation was created by cutting pSN48 with SphI, end-filling with Klenow fragment, and then ligating with a blunt-ended 1.1-kb BamHI-BamHI fragment of the URA3 gene, creating plasmid pSN101 (Fig. 1B). kilobase(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pSN117 is identical to pSN42 except for the addition of the c-Myc epitope at the C terminus of the MOP2 open reading frame. Epitope tagging of Mop2 was performed by inserting an 11-amino acid c-Myc epitope at the C terminus of Mop2 between amino acid residues 904 and 905 (Mop2::c-Myc). Two complementary oligomer DNAs, with 30 nucleotides encoding the c-Myc epitope flanked on both ends by six nucleotides that define the unique PflMI restriction site, were synthesized. The DNA sequence of the coding strand is 5′-GAGCAAAAATTGATTTCTGAGGAGGACTTGAATGTC-3′. pSN48 was digested with PflMI, gel purified, and then ligated with the annealed c-Myc epitope oligomers, creating plasmid pSN110. Insertion of the c-Myc epitope was checked by both restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. To test if Mop2::c-Myc was fully functional, plasmid pSN117 was transformed into the mop2-2 mutant strain SN53, to test the ability of Mop2::c-Myc to complement all mop2 phenotypes. Plasmid pSN145 is a LEU2-marked high copy plasmid in which the BamHI-XbaI fragment of plasmid pSN117 carrying the epitope-tagged MOP2 gene was inserted in place of the BamHI-NheI fragment of plasmid YEp21. Plasmid pNS146 is a derivative of pNS110 containing a 1.1-kb URA3 fragment inserted at an NruI site in the 3′-non-coding region of the epitope-tagged MOP2 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the MOP2 gene was determined by DNA sequence analysis of the 4.6-kb genomic BamHI-XbaI fragment, which fully complements all mop2 phenotypes. Nested deletions of this insert in pSN48 were generated with the Erase-a-BaseTM system according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Single-stranded DNA was made following infection with helper phage M13K07. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) modified for single-stranded and double-stranded template with sequenase as described by the enzyme supplier (U. S. Biochemical). Protein homology searches were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Blast network service (Altschul et al., 1990). The accession number L12352 has been assigned to the MOP2 sequence by GenBank. For the preparation of plasma membranes, cells were grown overnight in 5-ml cultures in either YEPD or selective media for plasmid retention. 1 ml of the saturated culture was transferred to 100 ml of the same media and grown to a cell density of ∼5.0 × 106. 50 ml of these cells were then subcultured into 1 liter of YEPD. Cells were harvested when they reached an A600 = 4-5 absorbance units. Yeast plasma membranes were purified by differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation (Perlin et al., 1989). ATPase activity was assayed as described (Perlin et al., 1989). Total protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method. Abundance of H+-ATPase in purified plasma membrane preparations was examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated at 37°C for 10 min before loading on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or by Western blotting. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Transfer buffer was 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 10% methanol, 0.03% SDS, pH 8.4. Transfer was carried out for 1.5 h at a constant current of 275 mA. Protein on immunoblots was detected using a chemiluminescence detection system according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). The effect of mop2 on the abundance of Pma1 was determined by comparing a wild type (SN197) and a mop2-2 mutant (SN53) strain. Cells were grown at 25°C in YEPD media as described above. When cells reached an A600 = 1, the cultures were divided into three flasks. Growth was continued in one flask at 25°C for 4 h and for either 2 or 4 h at 37°C in the other two flasks. Cells were harvested, and plasma membranes were prepared. Solubilization of Mop2 from plasma membranes was carried out by treating the purified plasma membrane with chemical reagents. 100 μg of purified plasma membranes from SN330 (transformant of Y55-296 with pSN117) were resuspended in 200 μl of one of the following solubilizing reagents: 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1% Zwittergent-14 (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 M urea, or 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11. Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. As a control, plasma membrane was incubated with membrane buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) under the same conditions. Each mixture was subjected to sedimentation for 1 h at 100,000 rpm in a table top ultracentrifuge. Each pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Equivalent amounts of the high speed supernatant and the solubilized pellet were then analyzed by Western blot, probed with the 9E10 anti c-Myc monoclonal antibody. Staining of fixed yeast cells by indirect immunofluorescence was carried out as described by Davis and Fink(1990). Purified plasma membranes were diluted to 1.0 mg/ml with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) (Ip buffer). 100 μl (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated overnight with 10 μg of purified anti-Pma1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 500 μl of Ip buffer, and the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were heated at 37°C for 10 min and subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was carried out as described above. Mutations in the PMA1 gene encoding the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase cause a sensitivity to lowered pH and a reduction in cellular membrane potential, with a consequent resistance to hygromycin B. Modifier of pma1 (mop) mutants were isolated as enhancers of the mutant phenotypes of several pma1 mutations. Three spontaneous mutations were initially discovered that increased the hygromycin B resistance of strains carrying a pma1 mutation from 300 to 500 μg/ml. All three of these mutations proved to confer hypersensitivity to cycloheximide, preventing growth at 0.5 μg/ml, a concentration at which both wild type and pma1 mutants can grow. All three mop mutants (mop1, -2, and -3) were shown to be unlinked to pma1 by crossing the mop pma1 strains to a wild type strain and following the segregation of hygromycin B resistance, sensitivity to acid-loading conditions (0.2 M acetate, pH 5.0 or 4.8), and cycloheximide hypersensitivity. The cycloheximide hypersensitivity of the mop2 mutants segregated as a Mendelian trait (2:2) and segregated independently of the sensitivity to acid-loading conditions that marked pma1 (McCusker, 1986). While pma1 by itself is resistant to hygromycin B at 300 μg/ml, resistance on plates containing 500 μg/ml was only seen for segregants carrying both mutations. mop mutants are not, by themselves, hygromycin B resistant (Fig. 2). Complementation tests showed that the three mop mutations defined separate complementation groups. Further analysis of mop1 and mop3 will be described elsewhere. Three additional mop2 alleles (mop2-2, mop2-3, and mop2-4) were subsequently isolated by their hyper-hygromycin B resistance of pma1-114. Both mop2-2 and mop2-4 were also found to be temperature sensitive for growth at 37°C. Strains carrying mutations in both MOP2 and PMA1 have several interesting phenotypes that are absent in the mop2 and pma1 mutants. Although some severe pma1 alleles are unable to grow at pH 3.0 and are sensitive to osmotic stress (McCusker et al., 1987), pma1-114 is resistant to both of these conditions, although it is hygromycin B resistant and sensitive to acid loading (YEPD + 0.2 M acetate, pH 4.8). mop2 pma1-114 strains are sensitive to low external pH (YEPD, pH 3.0) and high osmotic medium (YEPD plus 2 M glycerol) in addition to showing higher resistance to hygromycin B (Fig. 2). This proved to be true of both mop2-1 and mop2-3 and for the temperature-sensitive mop2-2 and mop2-4 alleles grown at their permissive temperature of 25°C. Plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a very abundant membrane protein representing about 15% of total plasma membrane proteins (Bowman et al., 1981). All four mop2 alleles caused a remarkable reduction in the activity of Pma1. At the permissive temperature, the abundance of Pma1 in a mop2-2 mutant was estimated to be 60% of wild type. At the non-permissive temperature, a decrease in the abundance of both wild type and mop2-2 was observed. The decrease in abundance of wild type Pma1 has been previously reported in heat-stressed cells (40°C) (Panaretou and Piper, 1992). They showed that the reduction of Pma1 is accompanied by the induction of a 30-kDa heat shock protein. The enrichment of a 30-kDa protein is also seen in our strains at 37°C (Fig. 3A). However, the induction of this protein is more pronounced in the mop2-2 mutant. There are other low molecular weight proteins that are also enriched in the mop2-2, but not wild type. Western blots probed with the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Fig. 3B), as well as a panel of anti-Pma1 polyclonal antibodies (data not shown), indicated that there was no reactivity to any of the low molecular weight bands. We conclude that these low molecular weight proteins are not degradation products of Pma1. The decreased abundance of Pma1 in the plasma membrane could be due to alterations in the transcription, translation, or post-translational processing of the protein. To investigate the effect of mop2 on transcription, we carried out a primer extension analysis of the abundance of PMA1 mRNA in wild type and temperature-sensitive mop2-2 cells. There was no difference in PMA1 mRNA abundance between wild type and the mop2-2 mutant at either the permissive or non-permissive temperature (data not shown). This indicates that Pma1 reduction by mop2 was not caused by reducing PMA1 transcription. Similarly, the effect of mop2 mutants could not be suppressed by introducing additional copies of the PMA1 gene; in fact, extra copies of PMA1 were highly toxic to mop2 strains (see below). A further experiment was done by replacing the PMA1 promoter with the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (Cid et al., 1987) to test whether the effect of mop2 on the abundance of the Pma1 could be suppressed by placing the PMA1 gene under the control of another promoter. Strain SN225 was constructed by crossing the mop2-2 strain, SN234 (MATα ho::LEU2 ura3-1 leu2-1 arg4-1 mop2-2 GAL3), with a MATα spore of strain SH132, which contains PMA1 under galactose-inducible promoter. The correct haploid meiotic segregants, confirmed by both Southern blot and scoring for the mop2-2 spore colonies that grow on galactose, were used for measurement of Pma1 abundance in plasma membranes. SDS protein gels of the purified plasma membrane showed that abundance of Pma1 was still reduced by mop2 to the same extent as the cells with the normal PMA1 promoter (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that MOP2 does not act at the level of PMA1 transcription. The MOP2 gene was cloned by complementation of the mop2-2 allele for its temperature sensitivity (YEPD at 37°C) and cycloheximide hypersensitivity (YEPD plus 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide) at 25°C. The mop2 mutant strain, SN53, was transformed with genomic DNA libraries made in both the centromere vector YCp50 and the multicopy vector YEp24. Ura+ transformants were replica plated onto YEPD plus 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide grown at 25°C and onto YEPD at 37°C. 2 out of 900 Ura+ transformants (one each from the single copy and multicopy library) were found to complement the mop2 phenotypes. Restriction mapping reveals that both clones had overlapping genomic DNA insertions. All subsequent work was carried out with the YEp24 clone, designated pSN12 (Fig. 1A). MOP2 was mapped to chromosome XIV by probing a Southern blot of a yeast chromosome separating gel (data not shown) using 32P-labeled cloned MOP2-containing DNA fragment. Tetrad analysis was then carried out to establish that MOP2 lies approximately 7 centimorgans proximal to RAD50 on the left arm of chromosome XIV (data not shown). There are no other known genes in this vicinity (Mortimer et al., 1992). In the clone from the YEp24 genomic bank, MOP2 was contained in a 10-kb insert. To narrow down the fragment that encodes MOP2, several deletions of the MOP2 clone were made and tested for their functional complementation (Fig. 1A). The smallest fragment that complemented a mop2 mutant was the 3.47-kb BamHI-PflMI fragment. However, DNA sequencing of MOP2 shows that the Mop2 open reading frame extends 63 amino acids beyond the PflMI site (see below). This suggests that at least the last 63 amino acids of C terminus are not essential for Mop2 function. Moreover, an insertion of c-Myc epitope at the PflMI site of MOP2 did not affect the function of Mop2 (see below). The nucleotide sequence of the 4.6-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment, which complemented the mop2 phenotypes showed that MOP2 encodes an open reading frame of 968 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced Mop2 polypeptide predicts a single putative membrane-spanning segment (Fig. 1C). A search of the data base revealed that the same gene has recently been cloned and sequenced under the name SLA2 (Holtzman et al., 1993). The two different versions of the same sequence are virtually identical. There are no amino acid differences, but at positions 910 and 911, our sequence reads GC while that of Holtzman et al.(1993) is CG. The protein has several motifs that are characteristic of DNA binding proteins, including stretches of polyglutamic acids and a putative leucine zipper, although Mop2 is not involved in transcription. The most striking homology revealed by searching the data base was found for the last 190 amino acids of the C terminus of Mop2 (amino acid residues 689-968), which are highly homologous (33% identity) to the C terminus of the integral membrane-associated mammalian protein talin (Reed et al., 1990); however, since a deletion of the terminal 63 amino acids of Mop2 is fully functional (see above), it is not clear if this homologous region is important for Mop2 function. To demonstrate that we had indeed cloned the MOP2 gene rather than a suppressor of mop2-2, we integrated a linear fragment carrying the MOP2 gene with a URA3 gene inserted in the 3′-non-coding region. Approximately half of the Ura+ transformants of temperature-sensitive mop2-2 strain SN53 became Ts+, while the rest remained Ts-. Southern blot analysis (not shown) demonstrated that all of the insertions were in the same location. Thus, approximately half of the time, the targeted insertion of URA3 co-converted the adjacent mop2-2 allele to wild type, as expected if the cloned sequence integrated at mop2-2. A null mutation of MOP2 was created by removal of almost the entire protein coding sequence and replacement of this segment with the selectable marker URA3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This construct, mop2Δ::URA3, was transformed into a derivative of diploid strain, Y55 (HO ura3-1). Stable Ura+ transformants were selected, and the deletion of MOP2 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). A Ura+ diploid was sporulated and dissected. Only two viable spores were obtained in each tetrad, all of which were Ura-, indicating that MOP2 encodes an essential protein for cell growth. This result is in contrast to that of Holtzman et al.(1993), who found that a virtually identical deletion of the same gene in a different strain yielded viable haploids that were temperature sensitive for growth. It was likely that our strains, based on strain Y55 (McCusker and Haber, 1988), harbor a genetic difference from those used by Holtzman et al.(1993). To confirm this genetic difference, we transformed the same mop2::URA3 deletion construct we had introduced into our strain Y55 into strain DDY228 used by Holtzman et al.(1993). Tetrads of Ura+ derivatives of DDY228 were sporulated and dissected at 25°C. After 3 days, there were only two visible (Ura-) segregants. However, in contrast with strain Y55, by 5 days two Ura+ colonies become visible. These very slow growing colonies proved to be unable to grow at 37°C, in agreement with Holtzman et al.(1993). Thus, there appears to be a genetic difference between the two strains so that deletions of MOP2 (SLA2) are lethal in one strain but viable (though very debilitated) in another. To establish the intracellular localization of Mop2 and to gain some insight into its in vivo function, we marked the C terminus of Mop2 with the c-Myc epitope (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1C). Yeast strain Y55-296 (HO leu2-1 ura3-1) was transformed with pSN117 containing the epitope-tagged MOP2::Myc construct. Cells transformed with pSN42 containing untagged MOP2 were prepared in parallel as a control. To determine the nature of the membrane association of Mop2, the purified plasma membranes from strain SN330, containing a high copy plasmid with MOP2::c-Myc, were treated with a variety of reagents and resedimented at 100,000 rpm. Equivalent portions of the resulting supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mop2 protein was found exclusively in the membrane fraction. No immunoreactivity was found in the high speed supernatant fraction (Fig. 4B, lane2). The results showed that Mop2 is partially extracted by the reagents known to extract peripherally associated membrane proteins and is efficiently extracted by SDS and Zwittergent-14 known to solubilize integral membrane proteins (Fig. 4B). Triton X-100 is less efficient compared with the other two detergents. Taken together, these data indicate that Mop2 itself is a plasma membrane-associated protein. In some preparations we find two bands, approximately 92 and 108 kDa, that were highly stained with anti c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Fig. 4A). The size of 108 kDa is consistent with the predicted molecular size from the MOP2 sequence. The 92-kDa band is most likely a proteolytic digestion product of Mop2. Another protein of approximately 100 kDa is found both in cells expressing MOP2::c-Myc and those expressing an untagged Mop2 protein. This second protein is most likely Pma1, as shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-Pma1 antibodies (data not shown). Immunoreactivity of anti-c-Myc antibody with this protein has been seen previously (Kuchler et al., 1993). Immunoprecipitation of Pma1 does not precipitate the 108-kDa Mop2::c-Myc protein (data not shown). The strength of anti-c-Myc immunoreactivity with Pma1 is strain dependent, as it is less evident in strains"

These processes respond to micromolar fluctuations of cytosolic calcium in the presence of a large excess of magnesium. The metal binding sites present in these proteins are either calcium-specific (regulatory sites) or capable of binding both calcium and magnesium (structural sites). Using site-directed mutagenesis we were able to convert the single Ca2+/Mg2+ site present in chicken smooth muscle myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) into a Ca2+-specific site. The replacement of the aspartic acid present in the 12th position (-Z coordinating position) of the metal binding loop with a glutamic acid increases calcium affinity and abolishes magnesium binding, rendering the site calcium-specific. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that restrictions on the ability of side chains to change conformation, contributing one (for Mg2+ binding) or two (for Ca2+ binding) coordinations could alter the metal specificity in EF-hands. Other mutations which decrease or abolish calcium binding have also been characterized. When used to substitute the endogenous scallop myosin RLC, these mutants were capable of restoring the Ca2+ regulation to the actin-activated myosin ATPase demonstrating that in these hybrid myosins, the regulatory function of the Ca2+-specific site (present on the essential light chain) does not depend on the occupancy of the Ca2+/Mg2+ site (present on the regulatory light chain).

We identified five cDNA clones encoding receptor tyrosine kinases for which the ligand is known (fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, epithelial growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and insulin-like growth factor receptor), two putative receptor tyrosine kinases for which the ligand remains to be identified (the products of ryk and the mouse klg homolog), and a novel tyrosine kinase. We cloned cDNAs encoding both the murine and human homologs of this kinase, the sequences of which were subsequently published under the names sky (Ohashi, K., Mizuno, K., Kuma, K., Miyata, T., and Nakamura, T.(1994) Oncogene 9, 699-705) and rse (Mark, M. R., Scadden, D. T., Wang, Z., Gu, Q., Goddard, A., and Godowski, P. J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10720-10728). Mouse sky RNA levels are abundant in mammary tumors derived from transgenic mice that express wnt-1, fgf-3, or both oncogenes in their mammary glands. However, little or no expression of sky is detected in mammary glands from virgin animals or in preneoplastic mammary glands from wnt-1 transgenic mice. Moreover, we find that the human homolog of sky is expressed at elevated levels when normal human mammary epithelial cells are rendered tumorigenic by the introduction of two viral oncogenes. Transient transfection of the human SKY cDNA into the quail fibrosarcoma cell line QT6 reveals that SKY is an active tyrosine kinase that augments the level of cellular phosphotyrosine. Introduction of murine Sky into RatB1a fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer results in morphological transformation, growth in soft agar, and the formation of tumors in nude mice. These data raise the possibility that the Sky tyrosine kinase is involved in the development and/or progression of mammary tumors.

Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTKsprotein tyrosine kinasesPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutininFBSfetal bovine serumMEFmouse embryo fibroblastsHMEChuman mammary epithelial cellsDME mediaDulbecco's minimal essential mediabpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. are key players in many of the signal transduction pathways used to control cell growth, differentiation, and division. PTKs can be divided into two general categories based on sequence similarities: receptor tyrosine kinases, transmembrane proteins stimulated by cognate ligands (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including members of the src, fps, and abl gene families(2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Genes encoding several PTKs from each category have been transduced to generate oncogenic retroviruses(3Bishop J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 23-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and mutations of others have been implicated in human malignancies and cell transformation(4Cantley L.C. Auger K.R.

Receptor tyrosine kinases possess an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic catalytic domain. In the presence of the appropriate ligand, many receptor PTKs form dimers, an event which triggers a receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and leads to autophosphorylation, thereby transducing an external signal to the inside of the cell(6Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In many cases, these autophosphorylated tyrosine residues are targets for binding by cytoplasmic proteins, including PTKs, via SH2 (src homology region 2) domains. These steps initiate an array of signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to the nucleus, eliciting a variety of cellular responses and activities. We are interested in studying the signal transduction pathways involved in mammary carcinogenesis, particularly as results from the expression of the wnt-1 gene. It is well established that wnt-1 is a mammary oncogene. wnt-1 was first identified in murine mammary tumors as a locus at which a mouse mammary tumor virus provirus is frequently integrated, causing ectopic expression of wnt-1(7Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1982; 31: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a mouse mammary tumor virus-wnt-1 transgene in mammary glands results in hyperplasia and development of mammary tumors(8Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The mouse mammary epithelial cell line C57MG (9Vaidya A.B. Lasfargues E.Y. Sheffield J.B. Coutinho W.G. Virology. 1978; 90: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has been useful for studying the effects of the wnt-1 gene. Introduction of wnt-1 into C57MGs results in a marked morphological transformation, extended growth past confluence, and focus formation(10Brown A.M.C. Wildin R.S. Prendergast T.J. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1986; 46: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, many aspects of C57MG cells have not received much attention, especially the identity of the signaling molecules used by these cells. Toward this end, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach to identify receptor PTKs expressed in C57MG cells. This method takes advantage of the high degree of conservation of amino acid residues within the approximately 270-amino acid catalytic domain of all tyrosine kinases(2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Our analysis identified the known tyrosine kinase receptors for insulin, fibroblast growth factor, epithelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor as well as the receptor-type tyrosine kinases Klg and Ryk, the ligands for which are not yet known. In addition, we cloned a cDNA for a receptor-like tyrosine kinase that at the time was unreported. Recently, the sequence of this cDNA, cloned from both murine and human sources, has been published under the names sky(11Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar) and rse(12Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Goddard A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These papers have stated that the sky mRNA is expressed most abundantly in the brains of humans and rats and that this message encodes a putative receptor tyrosine kinase possessing two immunoglobulin-like and two fibronectin type III domains in the extracellular region(11Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Goddard A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter characteristics place Sky in the ufo/axl family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The amino acid sequence of the human (SKY) and murine (Sky) homologs are 90% identical, although the human protein contains an additional 10 amino acid residues in the putative signal peptide sequence(12Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Goddard A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mark et al.(12Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Goddard A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that a version of SKY engineered with a heterologous signal sequence and amino-terminal epitope tag is located at the cell surface and exhibits tyrosine kinase activity. In this report, we show that sky mRNA is significantly more abundant in mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice than in hyperplastic mammary glands and mammary glands of virgin females. In addition, SKY mRNA levels are up-regulated in human mammary epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts after transformation with SV40 large T antigen and v-Ha-ras. We also demonstrate that the native human SKY gene product is an active tyrosine kinase that undergoes glycosylation and oligomerization, like other transmembrane PTKs. Furthermore, RatB1a fibroblasts overexpressing murine Sky exhibit a transformed morphology, grow as colonies in soft agar, and form tumors when injected into nude mice. These data raise the intriguing possibility that this signaling protein, the Sky tyrosine kinase, may be involved in the development and/or progression of certain mammary tumors. QT6 quail fibrosarcoma cells were grown in M-199 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% chicken serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and antibiotics. QT6 cells were transfected at approximately 40% confluence in a 100-mm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation method(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar), with the amount of plasmid DNA stated in the figure legends. Plasmid DNA used in transfections was purified either by banding twice on CsCl density gradients or using Qiagen column chromatography (Qiagen). C57MG mammary epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential (DME H-21) media supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), and antibiotics. Primary and oncogene-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) and 293T and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in DME H-21 media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. RatB1a fibroblasts were grown in DME H-21 media supplemented with 7.5% calf serum, 2.5% FBS, and antibiotics. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from C57MG cells either by the SDS/proteinase K method (14Hirsch R. Colgrove R. Ganem D. Virology. 1988; 167: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or from total RNA prepared by the guanidinium/CsCl method(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Total RNA from human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (reviewed in (15Stampfer M.R. Yaswen P. Milo G.E. Casto B.C. Shuler C.F. Transformation of Human Epithelial Cells: Molecular and Oncogenetic Mechanisms. CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, FL1992: 118-140Google Scholar); see also “Results”) was isolated from subconfluent cultures by the guanidinium/CsCl method(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Total RNA from mouse organs and mammary tumors was prepared with RNazol (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratories International) following the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, oligo(dT)-cellulose (Collaborative Research) was used to select poly(A)+ RNA. For the experiment depicted in Fig. 1, mammary gland numbers 2 and 4 were dissected from virgin (age 4 weeks), pregnant, lactating, and post-lactating FVB/N female mice. The day of plug was considered day 0 of gestation, the day of birth was considered day 0 of lactation, and the day the pups were weaned was considered day 0 of mammary gland involution. 4 μg of C57MG poly(A)+ RNA was primed with a dT18-NotI oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) and converted into cDNA using 800 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Second-strand cDNA was synthesized with 25 units of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and 5 units of RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.). EcoRI adaptors were ligated onto the double-stranded cDNA, and the cDNA subsequently was digested with NotI. Digested cDNA was size selected (≥1 kb) by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen), which was digested with NotI and EcoRI and gel purified twice. The cDNA library was electroporated into strain MC1061/P3. A second C57MG cDNA library was constructed essentially as described above except that BstXI adaptors were used, the vector was pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with NotI and BstXI, and the electroporated strain was JM109. A human ovary cDNA library was constructed as above using commercially available poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). The cDNA was blunt-end cloned into pcDNAI that was digested with EcoRV, and the library was electroporated into MC1061/P3. sky was identified in a PCR-based screen for protein tyrosine kinase genes expressed in the C57MG mammary epithelial cell line. 1 μg of the pcDNAI-based C57MG library was amplified with degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of the kinase domain of protein tyrosine kinases. The primers used were 5′-CGGGATCCAC(A/C)G(G/A/T/C)GA(C/T)(C/T)T(G/A/T/C)GC(G/A/T/C)GC(G/A/T/C)(A/C)G-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCA(C/T)(G/A/T/C)CC(A/G)(A/ T)A(G/A/T/C)(G/C)(A/T)CCA(G/A/T/C)AC(A/G)TC-3′. The restriction enzyme sites, BamHI and EcoRI, respectively, that were included in these primers are underlined. Amplification conditions were 30 cycles of 1 min, 95°C; 5 min, 37°C; and 5 min, 63°C. The resulting 210-base pair fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, ligated into the vector pBS- (Stratagene) that was digested with the same enzymes, and transformed into JM109. 144 colonies were prepared for double-stranded sequencing of their plasmid DNA. Redundant clones were identified and eliminated by single-base sequencing all PCR inserts by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and ddTTP. The non-redundant PCR inserts were sequenced in their entirety and compared to Genbank using the BLAST program of the NCBI (National Institutes of Health). One clone was novel and was pursued. The pcDNA3-based C57MG cDNA library was screened using the PCR fragment as a probe and hybridization buffer (500 mM Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA) at 65°C. A clone containing a 3.6-kb cDNA insert was isolated. This cDNA was sequenced by creating an ExoIII deletion series(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and gaps in the sequence were filled using oligonucleotide primers. The human homolog of this cDNA was isolated from the pcDNAI-based human ovary cDNA library using a 1.2-kb BamHI fragment of the mouse cDNA as a probe and hybridization buffer at 55°C. The human cDNA was sequenced similarly using the chain termination method. Either total or poly(A)+ RNA from mouse organs, tissues, mammary tumors, or cell lines was resuspended in 1 × gel running buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 2% formaldehyde, 35% deionized formamide, and 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel in 1 × gel running buffer. Gels were blotted onto Hybond N (Amersham Corp.) in 10 × SSC and UV cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene). For the experiment depicted in Fig. 4A, 10 μg of each total RNA sample was denatured, fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1.3% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde slab gel, and capillary blotted onto a nylon filter for hybridization. All hybridizations were performed at 65°C in hybridization buffer, and blots were washed with hybridization wash buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS). Probes were prepared with a Rediprime random priming kit (Amersham). Quantitations were performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Blots were stripped in 70% formamide, 1 × SSC at 65°C for 60 min with one change. The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted in-frame via PCR at the extreme 3′ terminus of the open reading frame in the human SKY cDNA, using a 3′-oligonucleotide primer complementary to the human SKY cDNA that also encoded the HA epitope and an XbaI restriction site. The 5′-PCR primer ended at base pair 2592 of the human SKY cDNA. The resulting 150-bp PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and Bpu1102I, an internal unique site. This fragment then was used to reconstruct the human SKY cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector. The resulting construct was sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced. Since this HA-tagged construct removed the entire 3′-untranslated region of the SKY cDNA, an analogous untagged version of SKY was made by truncating the SKY cDNA at the unique AflII restriction site at bp 3054. An in-frame internal deletion in the conserved kinase domain was created in both the HA-tagged and untagged versions of SKY by removing a BspEI restriction fragment from these constructs and religating. This internal deletion removes amino acids 590-754, inclusive of the SKY open reading frame. To reduce the GC content of the 5′-end of the human SKY cDNA, the following complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized (Oligos Etc. Inc.): 5′-AATTCCGCCGATGGCATTAAGAAGAAGTATGGGAAGACCAGGATTACCACCATTACCATTACCACCACCACCGC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGGTGGTAATGGTAATGGTGGTAATCCTGGTCTTCCCATACTTCTTCTTAATGCCATCGGCGG-3′. When annealed, the duplex creates EcoRI and SacII restriction site overhangs (underlined). This duplex was then ligated into the pcDNA3-based human SKY HA-tagged and untagged constructs at the unique SacII site at bp 70. Transfected QT6 cells were lysed 36-48 h post-transfection in TENT buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) or RIPA buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Immunoprecipitations with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5E; Babco) were performed by adding 2 μl of 12CA5E ascites fluid to TENT or RIPA lysates and incubating for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added subsequently, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for an additional 30 min. Immunocomplexes were washed with TENT or RIPA buffer, resuspended, and boiled in SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) by electroblotting. Blots were blocked in 2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). All washes were performed with TBS and 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST). 12CA5E was diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA in TBST, with probing at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4°C. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:20,000 in TBST was used as the secondary antibody. Incubations were performed at room temperature for 1 h, and blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham) and exposed to autoradiography film (Hyperfilm, Amersham). For anti-phosphotyrosine analysis, 50-100 μg of whole cell lysate was electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted. Blots were blocked in 2% BSA in TBST. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was diluted 1:4 in 2% BSA in TBST, with probing and detection identical to the conditions described above for 12CA5E, except that the secondary antibody was diluted in 2% BSA in TBST. QT6 lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with 12CA5E as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer and two times with in vitro kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2, and 10 μM ATP). For autophosphorylation assays, 10 μCi of [ γ-32P]ATP was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature. For exogenous substrate reactions, 10 μg of poly(Glu,Tyr) was included. Samples were quenched with electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on a 7.5% (Fig. 9) or 10% (Fig. 6) SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak X-AR or Amersham Hyperfilm).Figure 6:The SKY gene product is an active tyrosine kinase. QT6 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the HA-tagged wild-type (SKY-HA) and ΔKinase (SKYΔK-HA) expression constructs. A vector control was transfected as well. Lysates prepared 2 days after transfection were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5E antibody directed against the HA epitope, and the immunocomplexes were divided into three equal portions. A, immunocomplexes were assayed for in vitro kinase activity as described under “Materials and Methods” in the absence (lanes1-3) or presence (lanes4-6) of the synthetic substrate poly(Glu,Tyr). Radiolabeled complexes were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. B, the third portion of each immunocomplex was analyzed by immunoblot using the 12CA5E antibody as described in Fig. 5.

An EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pMV7-SrcA was inserted into the pSRMSVTKNEO vector between its EcoRI and HindIII sites. These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells with pSV-psi--E-MLV, a construct which expresses the murine leukemia virus ecotropic envelope protein(17Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.-M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Virus was collected over 3 days and used to infect RatB1a fibroblasts for 2 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. 2 days later, cells were trypsinized and counted. 500 and 5000 cells were assayed for colony formation in soft agar (see below), 250,000 cells were passaged to observe morphology, and 106 cells (in 100 μl) were injected into both of the hind flanks of two nude mice to assay for tumor formation. The remaining cells were analyzed for Sky protein expression by lysing in RIPA and precipitating with concanavalin A followed by anti-HA immunoblot analysis. For concanavalin A precipitation, RIPA lysis buffer was supplemented with 2 μg/ml MnCl2, and the cleared lysates were incubated with 50 μl of concanavalin A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. Soft agar assays were performed in 6-well dishes. Cells (in 1.25 ml) were mixed 1:1 with 0.7% low melting point agarose (Seaplaque, FMC BioProducts) in complete DME H-21 media and layered over a cushion (2.5 ml) of solidified 0.7% agarose in media. After solidification, the agarose/cell layer was covered with an additional 2.5 ml of 0.7% agarose in media. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 12 days before photographs were taken. QT6 cells were transfected as described above. Approximately 48 h post-transfection, cells were pretreated with various concentrations of tunicamycin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C in DME media lacking cysteine. The media was then replaced with DME lacking cysteine, supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.4 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Amersham) and antibiotics. Tunicamycin again was added at various concentrations, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated as described above, except that the cell lysates were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4°C prior to the addition of the 12CA5E antibody and fresh beads. We used PCR to identify receptor tyrosine kinase genes expressed in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line C57MG(9Vaidya A.B. Lasfargues E.Y. Sheffield J.B. Coutinho W.G. Virology. 1978; 90: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To bias our search against members of the src gene family, the upstream degenerate oligonucleotide primer encoded the amino acids HRDLAAR from the conserved region of the kinase domain of tyrosine kinases(2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 18Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Andres A.-C. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11818-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The downstream primer encoded the kinase domain residues DVMS(F/Y)G(V/I). A cDNA library constructed from C57MG poly(A)+ RNA was used as the DNA substrate for the amplification reaction. Sequence analysis of the PCR subclones revealed identities to known receptor tyrosine kinase (platelet-derived growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, epithelial growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, and insulin receptor), to putative receptor kinases encoded by the murine ryk gene and the mouse homolog of the chicken klg gene, as well as to the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases Csk and Fer. One of the 144 PCR products analyzed appeared to be a fragment of a novel gene and was studied further. Using the PCR product insert as a probe, a 3607-base pair cDNA clone was isolated from the C57MG cDNA library and sequenced. This murine clone was used to probe a cDNA library constructed from human ovary poly(A)+ RNA, and a 3702-bp human cDNA was isolated and sequenced. During the course of this work, the sequences for both the murine and human cDNAs were published under the names sky(11Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar) and rse(12Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Goddard A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since sky was the initial designation reported, that convention will be used in this paper. As an initial effort to determine the role, if any, of sky in mammary gland development, we examined the expression of this gene in mammary glands isolated from virgin females as well as from females at various stages of pregnancy, lactation, and mammary gland involution (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from these glands revealed low levels of sky RNA in mammary glands from virgin females (lane1). sky RNA levels increased slightly during pregnancy (lanes2-4), decreased during lactation (lanes5-8), and achieved highest levels during mammary gland involution (lanes 9-11). To assess the integrity of the RNA and to control for variations in the amounts of RNA loaded, the blot was hybridized with a probe for the housekeeping gene GAPDH. However, since expression of GAPDH is known to decrease during lactation(19Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the blot also was hybridized with a probe for mRNA encoding the secreted milk protein β-casein. RNA harvested from C57MG cells was included to verify that sky is expressed in the cell-type from which its cDNA was cloned (lane12). The levels of sky, β-casein, and GAPDH RNA in C57MG cells most closely resemble those observed in"

Sites A and C bind various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including the orphan nuclear receptor apolipoprotein regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1); site B binds the liver-enriched factor hepatic nuclear factor-3. The immediate early growth response factor (Egr-1), which is transiently expressed in various pathophysiologic states of the liver, activates the apoAI enhancer and overcomes ARP-1-mediated repression of the enhancer in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. Deletion mapping analysis revealed two Egr-1 binding sites, E1 and E2, flanking site A. Egr-1 bound efficiently to both E1 and E2. Sp1 in HepG2 nuclear extracts bound to E2 but not E1. In HepG2 cells, E1 functioned as an Egr-1 response element, whereas E2 had high basal activity and was not further induced by Egr-1. Mutations that prevent Egr-1 binding to the apoAI enhancer abolished its responsiveness to Egr-1, while they had only minor effects on its constitutive activity. These mutations also diminished the ability of Egr-1 to overcome ARP-1-mediated repression. Elimination of transcription factor binding to sites A, B, or C reduced enhancer activity without affecting Egr-1-dependent activation. We argue that Egr-1 is recruited to the apoAI enhancer complex under unusual circumstances, such as those prevailing during liver regeneration, to maintain apoAI transcription levels by overriding prior transcriptional controls.

Tissue-specific and developmental expression of eukaryotic genes is regulated by multiprotein complexes assembled on enhancer and promoter sequences (reviewed in (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar)). Modular organization of target sites for transcriptional factors within the enhancers is believed to be a device for integrating signals transduced by the factors during the course of establishment and maintenance of the tissue-specific phenotype(2Xanthopoulos K.G.

The architectural requirements for these interactions are fulfilled by a tissue-specific enhancer located in the −222 to −110 region of the apoAI gene promoter(4Sastry K.N. Seedorf U.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that repression mediated by ARP-1 may facilitate switching between alternative transcriptionally active states induced by different stimuli(8Widom R.L. Rhee M. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3380-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the early growth response factor, Egr-1, was identified as a transcription factor that could overcome ARP-1-mediated repression of the apoAI gene and restore elevated activity of the enhancer(9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper demonstrates that Egr-1 activates apoAI gene transcription through two sites in the enhancer, which bind Egr-1 and display significant homology to the consensus Egr-1 binding site. It is further shown that Egr-1 contributes to the transcriptional activation of the apoAI enhancer in the absence of functional sites A, B, or C. These findings raise the possibility that control of apoAI gene transcription by Egr-1 may be a mechanism for overriding pre-existing regulatory constraints. The double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the apoAI promoter between the nucleotides −214 to −192 (oligo A), −178 to −148 (oligo B), −136 to −114 (oligo C), and −196 to −174 (oligo E1) were previously described(5Widom R.L.

Oligonucleotide E1m, GATCCGCCCTGCAGCACCCGCAGCTTGCT, differs from oligonucleotide E1 by one nucleotide (underlined). E2 spans the −226 to −209 region of the apoAI promoter. The double-stranded oligonucleotide E2m, GATCTCCTCCCGCACCCACTGAA, differs from oligonucleotide E2 by one nucleotide (underlined). A double-stranded oligonucleotide (oligo Egr) containing two Egr consensus sequences (CGCCCCCGC) separated by one nucleotide, an oligonucleotide (oligo Egrmut) containing two mutated Egr consensus sequences (CGCCCTAGC), and an oligonucleotide containing the AP-2 cognate site were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for transcription factors AP-1, Oct-1, and Sp1 were from Promega.

The CAT reporters containing C to A substitutions in the apoAI promoter at nucleotides −186 in site E1 (−256(E1m)AI.CAT), at nucleotide −218 in site E2 (−256(E2m) AI.CAT), or both (−256(E1m.E2m)AI.CAT) were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and cloning of the polymerase chain reaction products into the HindIII site of pUC9CAT(4Sastry K.N.

The E1-41AI.CAT, E1m-41AI.CAT, E2-41AI.CAT, and E2m-41AI.CAT reporters were produced by subcloning the double-stranded oligonucleotides E1, E1m, E2, and E2m into the BamHI site of −41AI.CAT(4Sastry K.N.

Human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells were transfected with various CAT and pRSVβ-galactosidase reporters with or without the Egr-1 expression vector (pCMV5-Egr-1) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (23Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar) and assayed as described(5Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell.

Binding assays utilizing in vitro translated Egr-1 (Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate system) and oligonucleotides E1 and E2 as probes were performed as described (10Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assays using HepG2 nuclear proteins (10Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were similarly performed except that reactions were incubated on ice since retardation complex formation with the E2 probe was temperature sensitive. Antibodies (Egr-1, C/EBP, and Sp1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We previously observed that Egr-1 stimulates expression of an apoAI promoter/enhancer CAT reporter in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells(9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To map the Egr-1-responsive element(s), several CAT reporters containing 5′- or 3′-truncations of the apoAI promoter/enhancer were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of the Egr-1 expression vector pCMV5-Egr-1, and the -fold activation of each reporter by Egr-1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 1, the reporter −256AI.CAT, which contains the apoAI enhancer and promoter in their natural arrangement, was activated by Egr-1 nearly 6-fold, consistent with our previous results(9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter −192AI.CAT also responded to Egr-1 showing a more than 4-fold activation, while the reporter −133AI.CAT was completely unresponsive. Reporters analogous to −256AI.CAT but lacking the −80 to −42, −133 to −42, or −192 to −42 promoter/enhancer regions were activated by Egr-1 3.5-, 5.3-, and 1.9-fold, respectively. A reporter containing the −203 to −140 region upstream of the apoAI basal promoter (at nucleotide position −41) was activated by Egr-1 1.8-fold while a similar reporter containing the −187 to −140 region was completely unresponsive. Collectively, these data indicate that the −256 to −133 apoAI promoter/enhancer region contains all the necessary elements for maximal responsiveness of the apoAI gene to Egr-1. In addition, the data suggest that this region is composed of more than one subregion, each contributing to the full responsiveness to Egr-1. Specifically, the −203 to −140 subregion responded to Egr-1, but the −187 to −140 did not. This suggests that sequences in the −203 to −187 region may be a part of an Egr-1-responsive element. This is consistent with the observation that deletion of the −256 to −192 region in the reporter −192AI.CAT reduces Egr-1 responsiveness. However, it does not explain why the responsiveness of the −203 to −140 region is less than half that of the −256 to −133 region. These findings argue for the presence of additional Egr-1-responsive elements either at −256 to −203, −140 to −133, or both. Comparison of sequences in and around −256 to −203, −203 to −187, and −140 to −133 with the established consensus sequence for Egr-1 binding CGCCCCCGC (24Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) revealed two sites, site E2 CGCCCCCAC (at positions −221 to −213) and site El AGCCCCCGC (at positions −189 to −181) each deviating by a single nucleotide (underlined) from the Egr-1 consensus sequence(24Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The region around −140 to −133 did not contain sequences with recognizable homology to the Egr-1 consensus (see Fig. 2A). EMSA was employed to examine if Egr-1 binds to sites E1 and E2. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, Egr-1 expressed in vitro bound efficiently to oligonucleotide probes containing either site E1 or E2 (lanes2). This binding was specific because excess unlabeled homologous oligonucleotides in the binding reaction mixture inhibited retardation complex formation (lanes3-6), whereas a large excess of unrelated oligonucleotides corresponding to the apoAI gene sites A, B, or C (see Fig. 2A) did not (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes9; data not shown). In contrast, excess amounts of an oligonucleotide containing two copies of the Egr-1 binding site consensus sequence inhibited retardation complex formation (lanes7), while excess amounts of a similar oligonucleotide containing a mutated version of the Egr-1 consensus (CGCCTAGC) did not (lanes8). Addition of Egr-1 antiserum, but not of a control serum, to the binding reactions supershifted these retardation complexes (lanes11 and 12). Thus, it appears that Egr-1 can bind to sites E1 and E2. This was further confirmed as follows. Based on the DNA recognition properties of Egr-1(24Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), we predicted that C to A substitutions at nucleotide positions −186 and −218 in E1 and E2, respectively (see Fig. 2A) would prevent Egr-1 binding to the corresponding oligonucleotide probes. Indeed, excess amounts of oligonucleotides E1m (AGCACCCGC) or E2m (CGCACCCAC) that incorporate these nucleotide substitutions (underlined) in sites E1 and E2, respectively, did not inhibit retardation complex formation with the corresponding wild-type probes (lanes10). To determine whether E1 and E2 are bound by Egr-1 or other related factors in HepG2 cells, nuclear extracts prepared from these cells were subjected to EMSA analysis with the E1 and E2 oligonucleotide probes. The results in Fig. 2D, representative of binding reactions performed under various conditions using different preparations of HepG2 nuclear extracts, showed little, if any, nuclear factor binding to the E1 probe (lane1). In contrast, incubation of the nuclear extracts with the E2 probe resulted in multiple retardation complexes (lane2). To identify the factor(s) in HepG2 cells that bind(s) preferentially to E2 despite the similar affinities of sites E1 and E2 for Egr-1 (data not shown), we undertook a systematic competition EMSA analysis using as competitors various double-stranded oligonucleotides containing binding sites for previously characterized transcription factors. As can be seen in Fig. 2D, the retardation complex formed with probe E2 was inhibited by excess unlabeled E2 oligonucleotide (lane3) but not by excess E2m oligonucleotide (lane4). Retardation complex formation was not inhibited by excess apoAI site A (lane5) or site E1 (lane6) oligonucleotides nor by excess Egr-1 consensus oligonucleotide (lane7). Together with the observation that the factors capable of binding to site E1 are absent in HepG2 nuclear extracts, these data provided strong support for the notion that the factor(s) that bind(s) to site E2 are different than Egr-1. This was further confirmed by supershift analysis of probe E2 retardation complexes using Egr-1-specific antiserum (lane13). The possible identity of this factor with the transcription factor Sp1 was indicated by the substantial inhibition of retardation complex formation by excess amounts of an oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 binding consensus sequence (lane8). Excess amounts of oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites for the transcription factors AP-2, AP-1, and Oct-1, on the other hand, did not interfere with retardation complex formation (lanes9-11). Supershift analysis using Sp1-specific antiserum (lane12) confirmed the presence of Sp1 in probe E2 retardation complexes. Indeed, upon re-inspection of the site E2 sequence, it was apparent that it contains two extensively overlapping transcription factor binding motifs, one for Egr-1 and another for Sp1 (see Fig. 2A). Note also that the C to A substitution in the mutated version of E2, i.e. E2m, affects both Egr-1 and Sp1 binding motifs, explaining the inability of the mutated site to bind either Egr-1 or Sp1. To assess the functional significance of E1 and E2, we cloned oligonucleotides containing these sites immediately upstream of the apoAI core promoter (at nucleotide location −41) and tested the activity of the resulting reporter constructs in HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of cotransfected Egr-1 expression vector. The results in Fig. 3A show that in the absence of Egr-1, the activity of the construct containing site E1 is comparable with that of the apoAI basal promoter (−41AI.CAT). In the presence of Egr-1, however, the activity of this construct was induced 3-4-fold. An analogous construct containing two copies of site E1 was induced more than 8-fold (data not shown). The construct containing site E2, on the other hand, was constitutively active irrespective of the presence or absence of cotransfected Egr-1. This is presumably due to Sp1, which is present in HepG2 cells and could activate this construct by binding to site E2. Thus, Egr-1 responsiveness of site E2 could not be assessed in cells expressing high levels of endogenous Sp1 (or Egr-1). The mutated versions of E1 and E2, E1m and E2m, respectively, were also cloned upstream of the apoAI basal promoter and tested for their ability to respond to Egr-1 as described above. The results in Fig. 3A show that neither of these mutants exhibited higher activity in the presence of cotransfected Egr-1 compared with that in the absence of Egr-1. Thus, as expected, in the absence of Egr-1 binding to these sites, Egr-1-dependent activation of the nearby basal promoter is prevented. The reason for the substantial basal activity of the E1m containing construct relative to that of its wild-type counterpart is currently unknown. To evaluate the functional significance of sites E1 and E2 in the context of the activation of the apoAI enhancer by Egr-1, the E1 and E2 sites in −256AI.CAT were replaced by the mutant sites E1m and E2m, respectively, either each one alone or both in combination (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting reporters −256(E1m)AI.CAT, −256(E2m)AI.CAT, and −256(E1m.E2m)AI.CAT were then tested for their ability to respond to Egr-1 in transient cotransfection assays in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, the basal activity of each of these reporters did not differ significantly from that of −256AI.CAT, suggesting that sites E1 and E2 are not involved in maintenance of the basal activity of the apoAI enhancer in HepG2 cells. In contrast, the Egr-1-induced activation of −256AI.CAT (5.8-fold) was significantly compromised in −256(E1m)AI.CAT (1.9-fold) and −256(E2m)AI.CAT (4-fold), while −256(E1m.E2m)AI.CAT was totally unresponsive to Egr-1. These data indicate that both E1 and E2 sites are required for maximal responsiveness of the apoAI gene enhancer to Egr-1. Transcriptional repression of the apoAI enhancer by the orphan nuclear receptor ARP-1 can be overcome by transcriptional activators including Egr-1(9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol.

To distinguish between a direct role of Egr-1 in reversing ARP-1 repression from a secondary effect such as through induction of another factor, the −256AI.CAT reporter and its derivatives containing the mutant sites E1 and E2 were examined for Egr-1 responsiveness in the presence of inhibitory amounts of the ARP-1 expression vector pMT2-ARP-1. Consistent with our earlier observations (Fig. 4), the constitutive activity of the −256AI.CAT reporter declined in the presence of ARP-1 but was fully reversed in the presence of Egr-1(7Ladias J.A. Karathanasis S.K. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 8Widom R.L. Rhee M. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3380-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent of this reversal was attenuated when either the E1 or E2 was replaced by E1m or E2m in −256(E1m)AI.CAT and −256(E2m)AI.CAT, respectively. Thus, in the presence of ARP-1, Egr-1 restored the activity of these reporters to only ~20 and ~50%, respectively, of that expressed by −256AI.CAT. When both E1 and E2 were replaced by E1m and E2m simultaneously in −256(E1m.E2m)AI.CAT, the ability of Egr-1 to overcome ARP-1-mediated repression was completely abolished. We conclude that Egr-1 overcomes ARP-1 repression via direct interactions with both sites E1 and E2. Given the previously documented requirement of apoAI enhancer sites A, B, and C for high level hepatocyte-specific expression of the apoAI gene(5Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined a series of enhancer reporter constructs containing nucleotide substitutions that prevent protein binding to these sites for their ability to support Egr-1 inducibility. Consistent with earlier results (5Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutations in sites A, B, or C within the apoAI enhancer resulted in a significant decrease of constitutive CAT reporter activity to 9.5, 23, and 52%, respectively, of the wild-type enhancer reporter (Fig. 5). By contrast, Egr-1 activated these constructs by 11.7-, 7.3-, and 3.6-fold, respectively, thereby restoring their expression to levels comparable with that of the non-mutagenized enhancer. These data indicate that transcriptional activation by Egr-1 is not dependent upon transcription factors functioning through sites A, B, or C and suggest that Egr-1 activation of the apoAI gene occurs by overriding all previously imposed transcriptional controls. The growing list of transcription factors that function through the 110-nucleotide span of the apoAI enhancer includes nuclear hormone receptors(6Rottman J.N. Widom R.L. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V.

Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Because many of these transcription factors belong to families consisting of multiple members, we suggested that there are several, possibly overlapping, multiprotein configurations of the fully assembled enhancer(10Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this scheme, a dynamic state of the functional enhancer complex and its capacity to assimilate signals transduced by individual family members are also implicit. Factor exchange is predicted to involve disruption of pre-existing protein-DNA and protein-protein contacts. Therefore, we further suggested that this process may entail binding of ARP-1 to site A, which results in formation of transient, transcriptionally inert complexes susceptible to modulation by the incoming factor(8Widom R.L. Rhee M. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3380-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ge R. Rhee M. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13185-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Egr-1 activation of the apoAI gene displays no dependence upon enhancer modules other than sites E1 and E2. Furthermore, Egr-1 can efficiently overcome ARP-1-mediated repression, and activation by Egr-1 is not dependent upon prior repression by ARP-1. It therefore appears that Egr-1 is essentially insensitive to the transcription factor configuration of the apoAI enhancer and is consequently optimally suited to function as a device for overriding apoAI transcriptional controls in special situations (see below). The apparent dispensability of Egr-1-responsive sites E1 and E2 for constitutive enhancer function further reinforces the notion that they are contingent enhancer modules that can be mobilized only in selected situations such as during development or in periods of unusual stress (see below). This is reminiscent of LFA1 (HNF-4) binding to its cognate site in the α-1-antitrypsin promoter where the factor is essential for the activity of this promoter in HepG2 cells, fetal liver, and the yolk sac but not for expression in adult liver(34Tripodi M. Abbott C. Vivian N. Cortese R. Lovell-Badge R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, HNF-4 binds to sites in the transthyretin gene promoter in vitro, although in vivo footprinting revealed that the same sites were vacant(35Mirkovitch J. Darnell J.E. Genes and Dev. 1991; 1: 256-267Google Scholar). This implied that HNF-4 recruitment to its cognate site may also occur only under specialized circumstances. Experiments designed to determine whether E1 and E2 are occupied by Egr-1 or other related factors in HepG2 cells revealed that site E1 is vacant while E2 is occupied by the transcription factor Sp1 (Fig. 2D). The E2 sequence is composed of extensively overlapping Egr-1 and Sp1 motifs, which suggests that Egr-1 and Sp-1 bind E2 in a mutually exclusive fashion. While this has not been formally proven for E2, a similar situation has been documented for a regulatory site nearly identical to E2 in the murine adenosine deaminase promoter(36Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the E2 site where replacement of Sp1 by Egr-1 stimulates the activity of the apoAI promoter, replacement of Sp1 by Egr-1 in the context of the adenosine deaminase promoter results in transcriptional repression(36Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), exemplifying that the capacity of Egr-1 to function as an activator or repressor is dependent upon the gene promoter and cell-type contexts(37Wang Z.Y. Madden S.L. Deuel T.F. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21999-22002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single nucleotide substitution in E2 that abolishes its ability to bind either Egr-1 or Sp1 has little impact on the basal activity of the apoAI enhancer in HepG2 cells, although it reduces its responsiveness to Egr-1. Thus, although Sp1 binding to E2 contributes very little to the overall transcriptional activity of the apoAI promoter in HepG2 cells, it is tempting to speculate that it may also represent a contingency mechanism required for some hitherto unidentified mode of expression of the apoAI gene. What physiological conditions would lead to recruitment of Egr-1 to the apoAI enhancer? Egr-1 control of the apoAI enhancer obviously reflects some specialized program that is not called upon during routine circumstances. Egr-1 was originally defined as a gene whose expression is induced in response to mitogenic signals in all mammalian cells tested(26Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.-H. Stamenkovitch D.

Hoffman-Lieberman B. Lieberman D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since Egr-1 is expressed in murine peritoneal macrophages (50Henderson S.A. Lee P.H. Aeberhard E.E. Adams J.W. Ignarro L.J. Murphy W.J. Sherman M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25239-25242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mature human myeloid leukemic (51Merryman P.F. Clancy R.M. He X.Y. Abramson S.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and cardiac cells(52Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may play additional roles in more terminally differentiated cells(49Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman-Lieberman B. Lieberman D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of its early induction during hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy, Egr-1 has not been implicated in any signaling cascades regulating the behavior of mature hepatocytes. Our data predict that induction of Egr-1 in mature hepatocytes could reprogram the transcriptional apparatus of the apoAI gene (or other genes) leading to appropriate alterations in gene expression that result in sustained production of apoAI. It is therefore interesting that during liver regeneration, apoAI gene transcription remains nearly unchanged (53Panduro A. Lin-Lee Y. Chan L. Shafritz D.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8430-8435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) despite major alterations in the levels of transcription factors involved in apoAI gene regulation(13Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Flodby P. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Together with our current results, this suggests that under these conditions, Egr-1 takes over apoAI gene regulation by overriding previously imposed transcriptional constraints. This implies that apoAI may play an as-yet unknown role in liver regeneration. We thank V. Sukhatme for the Egr-1 vectors, N. Papanicolaou and E. Ferris for expert technical assistance, and N.

INTRODUCTIONThe Neurospora plasma membrane electrogenic, proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase) 1The abbreviations used are: H+-ATPaseplasma membrane electrogenic, proton-translocating ATPasePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSRPsignal recognition particlebpbase pair(s). transduces the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into a transmembrane proton-motive force (Addison and Scarborough, 1981). The latter functions to drive the uptake and extrusion of various ions and molecules through chemiosmotic coupling devices called porters (Mitchell, 1967). The Neurospora H+-ATPase belongs to a family of P-type cation-motive ATPases that includes the Na+/K+, the H+/K+, and the Ca2+ motive ATPases from higher eukaryotic cells (Addison, 1986). We know a great deal about the reaction mechanisms and the physiological roles of these cation-motive ATPases. Their primary structure is known mainly because of the methods of gene cloning and DNA sequencing. Yet little is known about the structure-function relationships of these remarkable energy transducers.Knowledge of the membrane topology of P-type ATPases is essential to gaining insights into their structure-function relationships. Such knowledge, unfortunately, is not easy to obtain. Membrane topological models of P-type ATPases are based almost exclusively on hydropathy analysis of their primary structure. There is confusion about the actual number of transmembrane segments. Most agree these enzymes contain either 8 or 10 segments. Because of these uncertainties, a method is needed to verify if a predicted segment is within the membrane. One method is to study the topogenesis of P-type ATPases. The molecular mechanisms by which polytopic integral membrane proteins achieve their membrane topology are poorly understood, however. Topogenesis of membrane proteins is presumed to occur by sequential insertion of topogenic signals into the endoplasmic reticulum (Blobel, 1980). Transmembrane segments serve as the topogenic signals; odd-numbered segments initiate translocation of the carboxyl-terminal residues across the membrane, while the even-numbered segments stop the translocation process.Using the Neurospora H+-ATPase as a model P-type ATPase, we are investigating the integration of this P-type ATPase into its cognate membrane (Addison, 1990, 1991, 1993; Lin and Addison, 1994). We constructed fusion proteins flanked by hydrophilic amino acids of the amino and carboxyl termini of the H+-ATPase containing putative transmembrane segments. RNA transcripts of these constructs were translated in a Neurospora in vitro system supplemented with homologous microsomes (Addison, 1987). The results demonstrate that transmembrane segments of Neurospora H+-ATPase, when assayed out of context, have various degrees of effectiveness as a topogenic signal and provide functional evidence for a novel integration signal that is composed of two transmembrane segments. In considering the results obtained, a model is presented of how the amino-terminal third of the H+-ATPases achieves its membrane topology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were synthesized at the Molecular Resource Center of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). Restriction endonucleases, mung bean nuclease, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow fragment, and N-glycosidase F were from New England Biolabs. pBluescript II KS+, T3 RNA polymerase, and RNase Block I were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Proteinase K, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and emetine were from Sigma. L-[35S]Methionine (1,120 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Bio-Gel P-4 (200-400 mesh) was from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). The molecular mass markers were from Bio-Rad or Life Technologies, Inc. The other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available.Constructing PlasmidsAll constructs contained portions of the Neurospora H+-ATPase gene cloned between the HindIII and SacII sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the control protein (pΔM) was encoded from a DNA construct containing 1) a DNA fragment containing 170 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 345 bp encoding amino acid residues 1-115 of the H+-ATPase; 2) a 12-bp fragment containing PstI-BamHI restriction sites encoding Pro-Ala-Gly-Ser; 3) an 180-bp fragment of the yeast invertase (In) gene encoding residues 73-132 of the invertase precursor, a stretch that contains three N-linked glycosylation sites; 4) a 6-bp fragment containing a XbaI restriction site encoding Ser-Arg; and 5) a 144-bp fragment encoding the last 42 amino acid residues of the H+-ATPase followed by a stop codon and 15 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. For pM1, pM2, pM3, pM4, and pM3M4, additional fragments of the H+-ATPase gene, were inserted into(2Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17031-17037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 1. For pM1M2, the fragment (1Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14896-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the DNA construct for pΔM was replaced by a 659-bp fragment containing 170-bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 489 bp encoding amino acid residues 1-163 of the H+-ATPase. For pM1M4, the fragments (1Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14896-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (2Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17031-17037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the DNA construct for pM4 were replaced by a 599-bp fragment containing 170 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 429 bp encoding amino acid residues 1-143 of the H+-ATPase.pM1InM2 was made by inserting between the DNA fragments (2Addison R.

Acta. 1990; 1030: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) of the construct for pΔM a 69-bp fragment encoding amino acid residues 116-138 (M1) of the H+-ATPase and between DNA fragments (3Addison R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17031-17037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (3Addison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) of the construct for pΔM a 69-bp fragment encoding amino acid residues 292-314 (M3) of the H+-ATPase and between the DNA fragments (3Addison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and (4Addison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) a 69-bp fragment encoding amino acid residues 322-354 (M4) of the H+-ATPase. The overhang ends of DNA fragments were either filled-in using Klenow fragment or deleted using mung bean nuclease to maintain the correct reading frame of some inserts. All constructions introduced DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues Gly-Ser-Ile at the 3′ end of M2 and M4, DNA fragment encoding Ser-Ala-Glu at the 5′ end of M2, and DNA fragment encoding Ser-Ala-Ala at the 5′ end of M4.For the energy-dependent studies, we used RNA transcripts transcribed from DNA constructs for pM1M2 and pM3M4 without a stop codon based on the reason described under “Results.” These were generated by replacing DNA fragment (5Addison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) in the constructs with a 126-bp fragment that codes for the last 42 amino acid residues of the H+-ATPase. The recombinant plasmids were restricted with PvuII. The resultant transcripts contained no stop codon and encoded an additional 45 amino acid residues derived from the plasmid.For all constructs, DNA fragments that encoded for the amino acids indicated in Fig. 1 by asterisks were introduced with the oligonucleotide primers for the PCR. The single strand DNA that served as template for the PCR was generated from the recombinant phagemid pBluescript II KS+ as described by the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR products were generated using the Perkin Elmer's GeneAmp kit and DNA Thermal Cycler 480 according to protocols from supplier (Perkin Elmer). Primers were removed from the PCR mixtures using the PrimeErase Quick push column from Stratagene. The resultant products were digested with restriction endonucleases. The resultant mixtures were resolved on an agarose gel; the product of the expected size was excised and eluted from the gel using Glassmilk or Glassfog (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). The PCR product was cloned into the plasmid as outlined above. All plasmid constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al., 1980).Translating RNA TranscriptsPurified plasmids were linearized with PvuII and then transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase as described by the supplier (Stratagene). The resultant transcripts were translated in a Neurospora in vitro system in the presence or absence of homologous microsomes (Addison, 1987). Afterward, reactions were placed on ice and then were either treated with proteinase K or fractionated into a soluble fraction and a membrane pellet, as described below.Digesting Proteins with Proteinase KTranslation mixture (20 μl) was adjusted to 10 mM CaCl2, 150 or 300 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 1 h at 0°C. The digestion was terminated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 25 mM from a 0.5 M stock in Me2SO and then adding an equal volume of 25% trichloroacetic acid. Where indicated, Triton X-100 was present at 1% (v/v). Samples were prepared for urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described previously (Burr and Burr, 1983), except that the resolving gel was 15% acrylamide and 0.13% bisacrylamide with a 5% stacking gel that was made from a stock solution of 30% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide without urea; the sample disaggregation buffer contained 15 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.Other MethodsMethods of N-glycosidase F digestion, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE and subsequent fluorography of the dried gels were as described previously (Lin and Addison, 1994). Microsomes were digested with trypsin as described by Addison(1993). Five μl of the trypsin- or mock-treated microsomes were added co-translationally to the 20-μl translation mixture. Mock-treated microsomes were obtained by adding premixed trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to microsomes and were incubated similarly as the trypsin-treated microsomes. For fractionation on sucrose step gradient, an equal volume of 0.2 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, was added to the translation mixture and then fractionated as described (Lin and Addison, 1994). An estimate of the relative quantity of integrated or glycosylated protein was performed by densitometric analysis of autoradiograms by a Bio Image Radioanalytic Imaging System (MilliGen/Biosearch, Bio Image, Ann Arbor, MI).RESULTSTopological models of the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase are based mainly on hydropathic plots of the primary sequence that predict either eight (Hager et al., 1986), 10 (Addison, 1986), or 12 (Rao et al., 1991) transmembrane segments. This method predicts transmembrane segments by scanning the primary sequence for stretches of hydrophobic residues long enough to span the lipid bilayer as α-helices. The eight- and 10-segment models agree that the amino-terminal third of the H+-ATPase contains four transmembrane segments. The relative position of these transmembrane segments is supported by trypsin digestion of the reconstituted Neurospora H+-ATPase (Rao et al., 1991). Integration of the H+-ATPase and truncated forms of the H+-ATPase into microsomes suggests the presence of internal signal sequences (Addison, 1990, 1991). Also, a fusion protein with transmembrane segment number 3 (M3) of the H+-ATPase integrated into microsomes as a type II integral membrane protein (Lin and Addison, 1994). The objective of this report is to determine how M1, M2, and M4 of the H+-ATPase are integrated into the membrane.Using the PCR (Scharf, 1990), fusion proteins were constructed containing sequences of putative transmembrane segments. The hydrophilic amino acid residues of the amino and carboxyl termini of the H+-ATPase flanked the fusion proteins (Fig. 1). Carboxyl-terminal to the putative transmembrane segment was engineered a segment of invertase that contains three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (Taussig and Carlson, 1983) to serve as a reporter of translocation. In constructing the fusion proteins, we used primary sequence of transmembrane segments as predicted by the 10-segment model (Addison, 1986). Complementary DNA of fusion proteins was transcribed in vitro by T3 RNA polymerase; the resultant transcripts were translated in a Neurospora in vitro system with or without homologous microsomes. The proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation using rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against carboxyl-terminal residues of the H+-ATPase. Integration of proteins into microsomes was determined by monitoring formation of glycosylated products, cosedimentation of products with microsomes after alkaline treatment, and digestion of products by protease.Integrating Proteins with One Transmembrane Segment into MicrosomesIn the absence of microsomes, RNA transcripts for pΔM, pM1, pM2, pM3, or pM4 yielded one product (Fig. 2, lane1). The control protein (pΔM) had a Mr of 34,200 when resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane1). The relative molecular mass of all fusion proteins was about 4,500 above what was expected based on the number of residues found in each. The exact reason for their aberrant migration in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel is not apparent. In the presence of microsomes, there was no change in the Mr of pΔM (Fig. 2, lane3), nor did pΔM cosediment with microsomes (Fig. 2, lane4). These results are consistent with models that predicted no transmembrane segment within the first 115 nor the last 42 amino acid residues of the H+-ATPase.Figure 2:Translation and membrane integration of in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled pΔM, pM1, pM2, pM3, and pM4. Transcripts were translated in Neurospora in vitro system with microsomes (nRM) at 3 A280 units/ml as indicated. Translation mixtures were extracted with 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and fractionated into soluble (S) fraction and membrane pellet (P) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel with SDS and visualized by fluorography. Glycosylated protein is indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the presence of microsomes, there was no change in the relative molecular mass of pM1, pM2, or pM4 (Fig. 2, lanes1 and 3) as well as no significant increase in the quantity of proteins found in the pellet fraction after alkaline treatment (Fig. 2, lanes2 and 4). In the absence of microsomes, a small percentage of product is found in the pellet fraction (lane2). This is caused most likely by aggregate forms of the products that sediment under these conditions (Addison, 1990). Fractionation of products using sucrose step gradients containing 0.15 M KOAc gave similar results (data not shown), precluding the possibility that pM1, pM2, and pM4 were bound to but not integrated into microsomes. Only pM3 showed a change in its relative molecular mass in the presence of microsomes; one product had a Mr of 36,100, and the other had a Mr of 42,700 (Fig. 2, lane4). All of the Mr 42,700 product and about 60% of the Mr 36,100 product were found in the pellet fraction after extracting the microsomes with 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and then fractionating the products through a sucrose step gradient containing 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5 (Fig. 2, lanes3 and 4). Alkaline extraction converts closed microsomes into opened sheets concomitantly extracting proteins from the exposed faces of the sheets (Fujiki et al., 1982). Peripheral membrane and lumenal proteins are found in the supernatant, but integral membrane proteins sediment with the sheets or membrane remnants. When the translational mixture with pM3 was treated with N-glycosidase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc of oligosaccharide chains and the asparagine residue, only the Mr 36,100 product was observed on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This demonstrated that the increase in the relative molecular mass of pM3 was caused by adding N-linked oligosaccharide side chains to the invertase segment as it was translocated into the lumen of the microsomes.Integrating Proteins with Two Transmembrane Segments into MicrosomesThe sequential insertion model predicts that M1, like M3, should initiate translocation of the carboxyl-terminal residues of the fusion protein. M1 did not, implying that it is not a topogenic signal. Indeed, results with pM1 and pM2 were unexpected, for a truncated H+-ATPase containing M1 and M2 was integrated into microsomes in earlier experiments (Addison, 1993). This implied the presence of a topogenic signal. Maybe M1 and M2 do serve as topogenic sequences, but only with native flanking sequences. To evaluate this possibility, we made a protein containing M1 and M2 (Fig. 1).In the absence of microsomes, the transcripts for pM1M2 yielded one product (Fig. 3, lane1). In the presence of microsomes, approximately 50% of the product cosedimented with microsomes after alkaline extraction (Fig. 3, lanes3 and 4). The presence of pM1M2 in the pellet fraction implies that this protein has topogenic information for integration. Less than 10% of pM1M2 is glycosylated by microsomes. When we engineered about 20 additional native residues carboxyl-terminal to M2 in pM1M2, glycosylation of the resultant protein by microsomes was not observed (data not shown). Clearly, combining M1 and M2 created a topogenic signal. Joining M1 and M2 may have created a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues. In the primary sequence of M1 and M2 (Fig. 1), the longest continuous stretch of hydrophobic amino acids is 10, and this is located in M2. As demonstrated, pM2 did not sediment with microsomes after alkaline extraction (Fig. 2). Alternatively, M1 and M2 may have created a structure that served as the topogenic signal. If so, this implies a crucial role for the proximity of the transmembrane segments. To disrupt this putative structure of the transmembrane segments, we inserted the invertase segment (see Fig. 1) between M1 and M2. Integration effectiveness of the resultant protein pM1InM2 was reduced to 20% of that of pM1M2 (Fig. 3, lanes3 and 4), and it did not become glycosylated. This was interpreted to imply that the topogenic information for integration is a function of the proximity of the transmembrane segments.Figure 3:Translation and membrane integration of in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled pM1M2, pM3M4, pM1InM2, pM3InM4, and pM1M4. Transcripts were translated with microsomes (nRM) as indicated. Mixtures were extracted with 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and fractionated into soluble (S) fraction and membrane pellet (P) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel with SDS and visualized by fluorography. Glycosylated protein is indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)pM4 did not sediment with microsomes after alkaline extraction. M4 is a presumed stop-transfer signal. To evaluate this possibility, we constructed pM3M4 (Fig. 1). M4 partially blocked transfer of the invertase segment into microsomes (compare Fig. 3, lane4, with Fig. 2, lane4). To make charge differences in the residues flanking the segments in pM3M4 similar to that of the native protein, hydrophilic residues flanking the segments were engineered into the construct (see Fig. 1). Despite this precaution, about 30% of pM3M4 had an increase in the relative molecular mass of 2,400, suggesting the addition of one N-linked oligosaccharide side chain to the invertase segment. It is not apparent why only one site in the invertase segment was glycosylated. The appearance of glycosylated pM3M4 demonstrated that the four lysines carboxyl-terminal to M4 (Fig. 1) could not completely block transfer of the invertase segment into the lumen of microsomes. When 29 native residues (residues 364-392 of the H+-ATPase) were engineered carboxyl-terminal to M4 in pM3M4, the resultant protein was still glycosylated. When native residues 262-283 were engineered amino-terminal to M3 and residues 364-392 carboxyl-terminal to M4, the resultant protein was not glycosylated (data not shown). This was interpreted to suggest that factors other than difference in the charge of residues flanking the transmembrane segments and the presence of positively charged residues dictate orientation of segments in the membrane. These results were unexpected and apparently add an additional level of complexity as to the nature of the factors controlling orientation of transmembrane segments in the membrane.Although M4 did not function independently, it functioned as a stop-transfer signal when engineered carboxyl-terminal to M3. Did the activity of M4 in pM3M4 depend on its proximity to M3? To evaluate this, we inserted the invertase segment between the segments in pM3M4 to give pM3InM4. In the presence of microsomes, pM3InM4 gave a slower migrating product on SDS-PAGE with a Mr of 44,200 that sedimented with microsomes after alkaline extraction (Fig. 3, lanes3 and 4). N-glycosidase F converted the slower migrating product to a product with Mr of 38,100 (data not shown), implying that the invertase segment was glycosylated. To determine if M4 blocked transfer of the carboxyl terminus into the lumen of the microsomes, pM3InM4 was digested by proteinase K in the absence or presence of microsomes (Fig. 4). The protected fragment observed only when microsomes were present in the mixture was not immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies directed against the amino or the carboxyl-terminal residues (Fig. 4, lanes4 and 5). These results demonstrate that pM3InM4 was integrated into microsomes as a polytopic IMP, implying that the decoding of M4 in pM3InM4 is independent of its proximity to M3.Figure 4:Analysis of pM3InM4 by proteinase K digestion. pM3InM4 was synthesized in the absence or presence of microsomes (nRM) and then digested by proteinase K at 150 μg/ml as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Triton X-100 (TX-100) was present at 1% during the proteinase K (lane3). Digested mixtures were either precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (lanes1-3) or immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies (Ab) directed against amino (N, lane4) or carboxyl (C, lane5) terminal residues. Molecular mass markers are hen egg white ovalbumin, bovine carbonic anhydrase, and soybean trypsin inhibitor with Mr of 42,700, 31,000, and 21,500, respectively. Precipitates were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gel with SDS; product was visualized by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The integration efficiency of pM1M2 was reduced by inserting amino acids between the segments. This suggests that decoding the segments in pM1M2 is a function of the proximity of M1 and M2. Does the putative association of M1 and M2 represent specific interactions between these segments? Can another segment in the proximity of M1 create the structural motif that is decoded as an integration signal? To answer this question, we replaced M2 with M4 to give the resultant protein pM1M4 (Fig. 1).Without microsomes in the translation mixture, transcripts for pM1M4 yielded one product (Fig. 3, lane1). With microsomes in the translation mixture, there was no change in the relative molecular mass of pM1M4, but about 40% of the product sedimented with microsomes after alkaline treatment (Fig. 3, lanes3 and 4). This implies that M4, like M2, could form with M1 the structural motif that functioned as a topogenic signal, albeit not as effectively.Protease Protection AnalysisResistance of the proteins to extraction by 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, suggests that these had become integral components of the microsomes. To further test this, proteins were digested with proteinase K in the absence or presence of microsomes. Membrane-integrated transmembrane segments should resist digestion by protease. Indeed, proteinase K digestion of pM1M2 in the presence of microsomes gave a fragment with a relative molecular mass of about 5,000 (Fig. 5, lane2). The number of residues in M1M2 is 45. This should give a fragment of about Mr 5,700. The size of the protected fragment is close to this expected value. This fragment was not immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies against either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal residues of the H+-ATPase (data not shown). This implies that the termini were exposed to the cytosol, suggesting that pM1M2 was integrated into microsomes as a polytopic integral membrane protein. No protected fragment was observed for pM1M2 in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 5, lane1), supporting the conjecture that the observed protected fragment (lane2) contains the transmembrane segments. In the presence of Triton X-100 (a nondenaturing detergent) (lane3), approximately 20% of the fragment resisted digestion by proteinase K. This protection is apparently caused either by phospholipids that are tightly associated with the transmembrane segments or by the formation of transmembrane segments-Triton X-100 complex (Li and Deber, 1993).Figure 5:Digesting pM1M2 and pM3M4 with proteinase K. RNA transcripts for pM1M2 and pM3M4 were translated in the in vitro system with microsomes (nRM) as indicated. pM1M2 or pM3M4 was digested with 300 or 150 μg/ml of proteinase K, respectively, as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Triton X-100 (TX-100) was present at 1% during the proteinase digestion (lanes3 and 6). The molecular mass markers are bovine trypsin inhibitor with a Mr of 6,200 and insulin with a Mr of 3,000. Proteins were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and 0.1% SDS; radioactive bands were visualized by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When digested by proteinase K in the absence or presence of microsomes, pM3M4 gave similar results (Fig. 5, lanes4-6).

The observed relative Mr of the protected fragment is close to the expected Mr. This protected fragment could not be immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies against amino- or carboxyl-terminal residues (data not shown).

Biochem. 1981; 118: 527-531Google Scholar); in many cases, the cis-acting elements that mediate the responses to inducers have been identified. However, the presence of such elements varies among MT genes in one family and among different species. For example, of the multiple members of the human MT gene family, only the hMT-IIA gene promoter has been shown to have a glucocorticoid-responsive element, and binding sites for AP1, AP2, and AP4, which mediate responses to activators of protein kinase C and protein kinase A pathways(9Imbert J. Culotta V.C. Furst P. Gedamu G. Hamer D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1990; 8: 140-150Google Scholar). However, metals are the common inducer of MT genes, and all MT promoters from Drosophila to humans contain multiple copies of a semiconserved sequence that is responsible for induction by metals, called a metal-responsive element (MRE)(9Imbert J. Culotta V.C. Furst P. Gedamu G. Hamer D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1990; 8: 140-150Google Scholar). MREs are 12-15- base pair sequences consisting of a highly conserved heptanucleotide core, TGC(A/G)CNC, and less conserved flanking nucleotides(9Imbert J. Culotta V.C. Furst P. Gedamu G. Hamer D.

However, we are interested in MRE sequence contributions to transcription in the context of native promoter sequences, orientation and distance from the TATA box. The rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) (t)MT-B gene provides a convenient tool for this purpose. The tMT-B promoter lacks the numerous basal and inducible cis-acting elements that interpose and surround the MREs of mammalian MT promoters(9Imbert J. Culotta V.C. Furst P. Gedamu G. Hamer D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1990; 8: 140-150Google Scholar). Further, the tMT-B gene has only two MRE sequences within 250 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence, whereas the analogous regions of mammalian MT promoters contain four to six MREs (9Imbert J.

Because of this apparent simplicity, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis of the tMT-B promoter to determine the contribution of each MRE to transcription activity. By transient transfection of rainbow trout hepatoma (RTH-149) cells, we demonstrate here that the two MREs of the tMT-B proximal 5′-flanking sequence cooperate for a high level of metal induction. However, each MRE contributes differentially to basal and metal-induced promoter activity, and this variance is partly due to sequence differences within the MRE consensus. In mammalian cell lines, the differential contributions of each MRE for basal and metal-induced transcription are observed, but differences in the function of the tMT-B promoter suggest that additional or functionally distinct factors interact with the promoter in mammalian cells. With this in mind, the rainbow trout and mammalian nuclear factors that bind to the tMT-B promoter sequences vary in apparent molecular mass. The construction of the tMT-B promoter deletions at −49, −84, and −137 from transcription initiation was described previously(12Zafarullah M. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4469-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated for the XmnI-HindIII (−137) tMT-B promoter fragment subcloned in M13mp18 using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as in Imbert et al.(13Imbert J. Zafarullah M. Culotta V.C. Gedamu L. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5313-5323Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and(14Vandeyar M.A. Weiner M.P. Hutton C.J. Batt C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Double mutants were obtained by stepwise mutagenesis at each site. PCR mutagenesis was used to substitute MREa and MREb sequences for the −137/dMREa (d= deletion) and −137/dMREb constructs. For −137/dMREa, the PCR employed the SP6 primer, which anneals to vector sequences at the 5′-end of the −137 fragment, and a 3′-primer, which anneals to nucleotides upstream to and including MREa with the sequence 5′-TCTAGAGAGCTCAGTCTCGCGTTCAGACG-3′. This primer replaced MREa with a SacI restriction site (underlined) for ligation to the BanI-HindIII tMT-B TATA box(−49) fragment. After these manipulations, the MREa region was mutated at eight sites. For −137/dMREb, two complimentary primers were synthesized for overlapping PCR mutagenesis, which mutated MREb at six sites. The tMT-B promoter organization and sequence of the various tMT-B −137 fragment MRE point mutants and substitutions are compiled in Fig. 1 for convenience. All tMT-B wild type and mutant promoter fragments were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors pMEV1R and pMEV35R, which were constructed in our laboratory(15Shworak N.W. O'Conner T. Wong N.C.W.

Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 and treated with 0.13 μg/cm2 test plasmid and an equal mass of the carrier plasmid pGEM or pUC13. After a 24-h recovery from glycerol shock, the transfected cells were treated with metal for 48 h for RTH-149 cells or 24 h for mouse L and HepG2 cells(12Zafarullah M. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Mol. Cell.

Zinc was chosen for metal induction since it is the most efficient inducer of the endogenous and transfected tMT-B gene in RTH-149 cells, eliciting the fastest, highest, and longest lived transcription response compared with cadmium and copper(12Zafarullah M. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4469-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Price-Haughey J. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 908: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At 100 μM ZnCl2, there are minimal cytotoxic effects and growth inhibition without compromising the level of transcription activation(21Price-Haughey J. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 908: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in cell lysis buffer (Promega Biotech.), and cell protein was quantified using Coomassie Blue Assay Reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For measurement of CAT activity, 100 μg of cell protein was assayed as described by Gorman et al.(16Gorman C.M. Moffat L.M. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), and nonacetylated and acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN) were resolved by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography(22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.L. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The activity of each tMT-B-CAT construct was measured as percent acetylation as determined by densitometer scanning (LKB Ultrascan XL). LUC assays were performed according to the protocol of de Wet et al.(17de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). The LUC activity for each transfection plate was an average from three measurements using a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The numerous constructs used in this study were assayed from two to six times with each reporter gene, and the results were found to be consistent. Basal and zinc-induced values of reporter gene activity were normalized by considering that the metal-induced activity of the −137 promoter fragment had a value of 100. After normalization, basal and metal-induced values for different trials of the same construct were averaged and are presented as units of relative activity. The standard deviations of trials for the different constructs under basal and metal-induced conditions were generally 5-15% of the average. The LUC assay system allowed a larger range from minimum to maximum detection limits. Because of this increased sensitivity, quantitative values are presented for LUC for comparison with the qualitative results of a representative trial using CAT. However, the effects of mutations on metal fold induction using CAT assays are stated under “Results” from the average of three transfections. The trout promoter fragment from −137 to −30 was obtained by PCR from(−137)-CAT (pMEV1R) and (−137/−91T/−60A)-CAT using the SP6 primer at the 5′-end of the vector multiple cloning site and a 3′-primer (5′-TAGCGTCAGGGACAGACGGG-3′) designed to remove sequences 3′ to and including the TATA box region. Complimentary oligonucleotides corresponding to the tMREa sequence and the tMREa/−60A point mutant were synthesized (Pharmacia LKB Gene Assembler Plus) with the upper strand sequences of the oligonucleotides as follows. tMREa 5'-GACTGTTTGCACAGGCACC-3'tMREa/-60A 5'-GACTGTTTAGCACGGCACC-3' The annealed double oligonucleotides and the tMT-B promoter PCR products were purified by elution from 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and end labeled to a specific activity of 108 cpm/μg as per accepted protocols(23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Trout liver extracts were prepared by the method of Gorski et al.(24Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from mouse L cells and HepG2 cells were prepared as described previously(25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (50 μg) were fractionated using 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose(22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.L. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Blots were soaked in binding buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (26Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic S. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) along with 6 M guanidinium isothiocyanate for 10 min at room temperature and then transferred to 4°C for all further steps. The denaturant was diluted 1:1 in binding buffer containing 100 μM ZnCl2 for 10 min and then diluted four more times in a similar fashion. After the final dilution step the blots were washed in binding buffer with zinc and then blocked 16 h in binding buffer with zinc and 5% nonfat milk. End-labeled probe was added to a concentration of 106 cpm/ml binding buffer with zinc and 0.25% nonfat milk for 7 h at 4°C. The blots were washed twice in binding buffer with zinc for 10 min, air dried, and then exposed to x-ray film. The proximal 250 base pairs of tMT-B promoter contains only two MRE sequences, MREa (−62 to −51) in forward orientation and MREb (−89 to −100) in reverse orientation (12; Fig. 1). Using transfection of RTH-149 cells, the −49 fragment, containing the TATA box, was not metal-inducible, whereas the −137 fragment, which includes both MREs, displayed 4.0-fold induction measured using a CAT reporter gene (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Deletion from −137 to −84 removed the more distal MREb sequence and allowed only 1.7-fold metal induction (Fig. 2). This deletion also decreased the basal level to that of the TATA box alone (−49) and metal-induced activity to 20% of the −137 fragment (Fig. 2). We chose to confirm the activities of the tMT-B deletions with a LUC reporter gene, since the 4.0-fold zinc induction was considerably lower than has been observed for the endogenous tMT-B gene in RTH-149 cells (27Zafarullah M. Olsson P.-E. Gedamu L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using LUC, the basal levels of expression for −84 and −137 fragments were comparable, whereas metal-induced levels were increased significantly for −137 (Fig. 2, top panel). As a result, −84 displayed 3.5-fold metal induction, whereas −137 generated a 12.5-fold metal response. The greater metal inducibility observed using LUC is because this assay system displays a greater range from minimum to maximum detection limits compared with CAT. As a result of lower background expression from pMEV35R (LUC), measurement of basal activity is more easily determined. For example, the TATA box alone(−49) displays only 1% of metal-induced −137 activity, whereas this is an average of 15% using CAT. This decrease in basal expression values results in an increase in fold induction which more closely approaches that of the endogenous gene. Results of both CAT and LUC assays suggested that both MREa and MREb are active for metal regulation since zinc inducibility increased with the addition of each MRE-containing promoter fragment to the TATA box. However, the fragment containing both MREs(−137) had metal-induced levels much greater than if MREb contributed to induction equivalent to MREa alone(−84). This suggested either that MREb makes larger contributions to metal induction than MREa, or MREa and MREb interact in a cooperative manner. To investigate possible cooperative interactions of MREa and MREb as well as their independent contributions to regulation of the tMT-B promoter, single point mutations were generated in both MREs in an attempt to inactivate their metal-inducible activity. The −137/−60A construct contains a substitution of the normal T nucleotide with A at the −60 position (Fig. 1). This mutates the first nucleotide of the conserved core of MREa, while the analogous mutation of MREb is −137/−91T (T because of the reverse orientation of MREb; Fig. 1). A substitution of T to A at this position of the conserved MRE core previously has been shown to abolish its metal regulatory function in the context of a synthetic promoter(11Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, both MREs are mutated in the −137/−60A/−91T construct (Fig. 1). The results of both CAT and LUC assays of promoter activity in RTH-149 cells are combined in Fig. 3. Using LUC, the inactivating mutation of MREa (−60A) actually resulted in a substantial increase in metal induction from 12.5-fold for the wild type promoter to 16.7-fold. This was paralleled by the results of CAT assays which also revealed an increase in induction from 4.0 to 6.6-fold because of this mutation. Although this mutation was created to reduce the metal responsiveness of the promoter, the actual consequence was an extreme decrease in basal activity to the level of the TATA box(−49), increasing the difference between basal and induced activity. From this observation, MREa could be considered the dominant basal element in the −137 promoter fragment which concurs with the lack of other recognizable elements in the promoter(12Zafarullah M. Bonham K. Gedamu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4469-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The analogous mutation of MREb (−91T) was much less devastating to overall promoter activity, decreasing the basal level by only 15%, but reducing induction to 9.5-fold using LUC. Similarly, the fold induction of the analogous CAT construct also decreased compared with the native promoter. This confirms that the MREb sequence also contributes to the metal responsiveness of the tMT-B promoter. The double mutant, −137/−60A/−91T, displayed the same low basal activity expected from the result of the single MREa (−60A) mutation. In addition, zinc-induced levels measured by LUC were reduced to only 4% of the wild type promoter. However, in spite of mutation of both MREs, this construct still exhibited 3.1-fold induction with LUC and 1.9-fold induction with CAT. From this result, the single point mutations intended to inactivate MRE function still allow metal induction in the context of the tMT-B promoter. This contrasts previous studies with synthetic promoters where mutation at this first MRE core nucleotide completely inactivated MRE function(10Searle P. Stuart G. Palmiter R. Experientia (Basel). 1987; 52 (suppl.): 407-414PubMed Google Scholar, 11Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since the point mutated MREs were still partially active, the independent and cooperative contributions of the MREs to tMT-B promoter function were not well defined. Additional mutants were constructed, −137/dMREa and −137/dMREb, where each MRE sequence was substituted at numerous nucleotides so that it was unrecognizable as an MRE while maintaining the position of the second MRE and other possibly important sequences (Fig. 1). Substitution of MREa (−137/dMREa) was devastating to the basal activity of the promoter, expected from the result of −137/−60A mutant promoter (Fig. 3). However, zinc-induced levels also decreased to nearly undetectable levels. Without MREa, 2.1-fold induction of promoter activity was observed with LUC, whereas no inducibility was observed with CAT assays. The substitution of the MREb sequence was not as devastating to promoter activity compared with substitution of MREa since −137/dMREb-LUC still displayed activity well above the TATA box alone (−49) and an induction of 3.7-fold. For CAT, basal level was the same as the native −137 promoter fragment, but metal-induced activity was reduced, resulting in a metal induction of 1.3-fold. For both assay systems, the metal fold induction of −137/dMREb is comparable to that of −84 which also contains only MREa. The use of these substitutions of MREa and MREb were more revealing than the single point mutants in regard to the role of each MRE in tMT-B promoter activity. MREa appears to be able to function in an independent manner since substitution of MREb still allows basal activity above the TATA box alone and elicits a significant response to metals. However, substitution of MREa devastates basal promoter activity and allows only nominal metal induction, indicating that MREb cannot function efficiently independent of MREa. Both MREs must cooperate for a response to metals since the sum of the fold inductions generated by each MRE when the other was substituted does not equal that of the native promoter. Previous studies with synthetic MRE sequences have shown that cooperativity between MREs is required for metal induction, similar to our observations with the tMT-B MREb. The mouse MT-I gene MREd is the only sequence that has been shown to have independent activity assayed by transfection, with basal activity partially justified by its homology to an SP1 transcription factor binding site (10Searle P. Stuart G. Palmiter R. Experientia (Basel). 1987; 52 (suppl.): 407-414PubMed Google Scholar, 11Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Meuller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this sense, the observed basal activity and independent metal inducibility of the tMT-B MREa are novel. We considered that the observed differential function of MREa and MREb for basal and metal-induced tMT-B activity could be due to position relative to the TATA box, orientation, or subtle sequence differences between the MREs. MREa and MREb differ by only one nucleotide (underlined), TTTGCACNCGG, which is −55A in MREa and −96G (C in forward orientation) in MREb (Fig. 1). This position is the least conserved nucleotide of the MRE consensus since all 4 bases have been found to occupy this position in natural MREs (9Imbert J. Culotta V.C. Furst P. Gedamu G. Hamer D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1990; 8: 140-150Google Scholar). To determine if this nucleotide was responsible for differential basal and metal-induced MRE activity, reciprocal point mutants were made to alter MREa to the MREb core sequence, −137/−55C, and MREb to the MREa core sequence, −137/−96T (Fig. 1). If this nucleotide difference was responsible for the observed basal activity of MREa, then −55C should reduce the basal activity of MREa, and therefore the promoter, while −96T should increase the basal contributions of MREb. The effects of these mutations on tMT-B promoter activity are shown in Fig. 4. For both CAT and LUC, mutation of MREa to TGCACCC (−137/−55C) caused a significant decrease in basal promoter activity but had little effect on metal-induced activity. As a result, the induction was increased 12.5-17.5-fold for LUC, and 4.0-11.2-fold for CAT. The opposite mutation of MREb to the MREa sequence (−137/−96T) increased basal activity above that of the native promoter. For LUC, the metal-induced levels were also increased nearly 1.5-fold, whereas for the CAT assays, metal-induced levels were not affected significantly. As a result of the increased basal level, metal inducibility was decreased compared with the native promoter, from 12.5- to 10.2-fold for LUC and from 4.0- to 3.3-fold for CAT. The effect of MRE core sequence on basal promoter activity was investigated further using the MRE reverse mutations, −55C and −96T, in concert with the inactivating point mutants of the opposite MRE. The devastating effect of the MREa mutation (−60A) on basal activity was partially rescued by altering MREb to an MREa sequence for the construct, −137/−96T/−60A (compare Figure 3:, Figure 4:). This was a 2.6-fold increase in basal expression for LUC compared with the −137/−60A construct and a smaller but visible increase for CAT. Conversely, the basal activity of −137/−55C/−91T was decreased compared with −137/−91T (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). All of the above constructs served to show that the N position of the MRE core sequence is an important determinant of MRE contributions to basal activity. When both MREs have the sequence of MREa, the basal activity of the promoter is increased; the opposite is true when both MREs have the MREb sequence. This is consistent with the results of the MRE point mutants which suggest that MREa is an important contributor to basal level expression. However, the mutation of MREb to an MREa sequence could not confer independent activity on MREb, since the −96T mutation did not completely rescue the basal activity of the −60A mutant. Because of this observation, it was important to determine if the orientation and position of the MREs were also important. The double mutant, −137/−96T/−55C, is"

https://openalex.org/W2052337263,"We have examined coupled reactions with the RecA protein of Escherichia coli, which can mediate DNA strand exchange in vitro between homologous DNA molecules, and the RecJ exonuclease, a 5′ to 3′ single-stranded DNA exonuclease. In RecA-mediated strand-transfer reactions between circular single-stranded and duplex linear DNA, we have found that RecJ stimulates the rate of heteroduplex product formation. Because RecJ must be present concurrent with strand transfer and RecJ does not detectably stimulate the synapsis stage of the reaction, we believe that RecJ stimulates specifically the branch migration phase of the RecA strand-transfer reaction. RecJ also dramatically enhances the efficiency with which RecA is able to traverse regions of non-homology in the substrates. We propose a model where RecJ degrades the displaced strand produced by strand exchange which competes for pairing with the transferred strand, thus driving forward the unidirectional branch migration mediated by RecA protein. This suggests a new role for exonucleases in genetic recombination, facilitating the strand-transfer reaction itself."

A constant stretch of nucleotides located at the 3′ end of the 6 kb cDNA was found to be connected, by alternative RNA splicing, to four different upstream sequence positions. The deduced hydrophobic sequence of the spliced-in exon could replace the IX or the XI trans-membrane domain of the exchanger protein in two spliced isoforms. The new exon sequence was not completely included in the pTB11 insert, i.e. these two products were artificially truncated. The RNA processing of these two alternative 5′-splicing sites also occurred in tissues, as shown by RNase protection analysis.

The deduced hydrophobic sequence of the spliced-in exon could replace the IX or the XI trans-membrane domain of the exchanger protein in two spliced isoforms. The new exon sequence was not completely included in the pTB11 insert, i.e. these two products were artificially truncated. The RNA processing of these two alternative 5′-splicing sites also occurred in tissues, as shown by RNase protection analysis. In a third type of isoform the splicing took place downstream of the originally proposed stop codon, whereas in a fourth type a stop codon was introduced after the V hydrophobic segment in the large intracellular loop."

DNA tumor viruses and many human cancers employ different mechanisms to overcome the negative effects of p53 on cell proliferation (for a review, see (7Prives C. Cell. 1994; 78: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Whereas the viruses encode oncoproteins that inactivate the braking effects of p53 on the cell cycle, the natural forms of cancers almost universally contain mutations in the p53 gene. Mostly, they are single missense point mutations located within the conserved regions 2-5 of p53 protein. Furthermore, many of these mutants act in a trans-dominant fashion to promote neoplastic processes by forming hetero-oligomers with wild type p53, therefore abrogating its function(8Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biological activities of p53 are still the subject of intensive study, several lines of evidence indicate that p53 functions in the regulation of transcription. For example, p53 binds to specific DNA sequences termed p53-responsive elements (or PREs) 1The abbreviations used are: PREp53-responsive elementsRCArelative CAT activityNLSnuclear localization signalsCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseND and CD mutantsamino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, respectively.

Paradoxically, p53 also represses transcription of many viral and cellular genes that apparently do not have PREs (17Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Lin D. Appella E. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

How p53 down-regulates gene transcription is not well understood, although a number of studies have shown that p53 interacts with the TATA binding protein, and, depending on the promoter context (20Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), may somehow repress transcription. p53-responsive elements relative CAT activity nuclear localization signals chloramphenicol acetyltransferase amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, respectively. Like typical eukaryotic transcription factors, p53 is endowed with several distinct functional domains, including those for transactivation, for DNA binding, and for the responsiveness to regulatory signals (for a review, see (21Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). An acidic activating region is located at codons 20-42. The sequence-specific DNA binding domain (i.e. the so-called core domain) has been roughly mapped to the central portion, approximately corresponding to residues 100-300. In addition, oligomerization and nuclear localization activities have been assigned to the carboxyl terminus. Nonetheless, a systematic study of the structure and functions of p53 is still missing, as is a description of the collective interactions among its functional domains, which result in modulating the transcriptional activity of p53. Deletion and domain-swapping approaches have been routinely and successfully employed to define various functional domains of proteins that have versatile biochemical activities. This testifies, in general, to the modular nature of proteins (for a review, see (22Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press & Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar)). Using these approaches to perform a systematic genetic analysis of p53, we report here the identification and characterization of several new transcriptional regulatory activities of p53. The functional communications among these domains as well as superimposed effects of the DNA target sites and the cellular environment profoundly influence how p53 performs its transcriptional activity. Plasmids pE1BCAT, pG5E1BCAT, pSG424, pSGVP, and pSGE1A have been previously described(23Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Plasmids p1PREcCAT and p3PREcCAT were cloned by inserting one and three copies, respectively, of a consensus p53 binding site oligomer (PREc) 5′-AGCTAGGCATGTCTAGACATGCCT-3′ (12el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar) into the HindIII site of pE1BCAT. p1PRErCAT and p3PRErCAT were made similarly by replacing the above oligomer with the one (PREr) that is found in a region upstream of the transcription start site for the human ribosomal gene cluster (10Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) and has the sequence 5′-AGCTTGCCTGGACTTGCCTGGCCTTGCCTTTTC-3′. For expression of p53 derivatives and GAL4-p53 fusion proteins in mammalian cells, polymerase chain reaction-generated p53 DNA fragments were cloned between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pCEP4 (Invitrogen) and pSG424, respectively. Plasmid pSGC67 was constructed by ligating a DNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of p53 between the KpnI and XbaI sites of pSG424, resulting in an in-frame fusion between the GAL4 and p53 modules. Plasmids pSGVPC67, pSGE1AC67, pSGProC67, and pSGGlnC67 were cloned by inserting DNA fragments encoding the activating regions of HSV VP16 (residues 413-490)(24Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C.

Plasmids pSGPro and pSGGln were constructed by deleting the 67 amino acids of p53 from plasmids pSGProC67 and pSGGlnC67. Finally, for the expression of p53 protein in bacteria, pHisp53 was constructed by inserting the p53 protein coding sequence between the NdeI and BamHI sites of plasmid 8His-pET11d(27Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Saos-2, HepG2, Hep3B, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection was performed as previously described(28Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 340: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that 5 μg each of the CAT reporter and activator plasmids were used and 2 μg of a LacZ reporter plasmid were included to monitor the transfection efficiency. CAT activity was measured and quantified according to Carey et al.(29Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from Saos-2 and HepG2 cells transiently transfected with the mammalian expression plasmids of interest. Cells from a 100-mm diameter plate were lysed by briefly mixing them in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were pelleted at 3,000 × g for 3 min and then resuspended and extracted on ice in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 0.42 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. For bandshift assays, the probe was the 32P end-labeled HindIII-EcoRI fragment of pMH100(23Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). 1 μg of nuclear proteins was used per reaction. All other methods concerning bandshift assays have been previously described(30Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays for the DNA binding activity of p53 derivatives were performed as described(10Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), except that probes were the 32P end-labeled XhoI-SalI fragment of p3PREcCAT and p3PRErCAT and that 400 μg of proteins of nuclear extracts from transiently transfected cells and 10 μl of the polyclonal anti-p53 anti-serum described below were used. Nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation was done as follows. Saos-2 cells from a transiently transfected 100-mm diameter plate were lysed on ice in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain, and chymostatin) plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 by pipetting up and down a few times. 2 M sucrose was immediately added to a final concentration of 0.25 M, and nuclei were pelleted at 1,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4°C. The supernatant (i.e. the cytosol fraction) was further spun at 12,000 × g for 2 min to remove contaminating nuclei. Nuclei were washed three times in hypotonic buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then lysed in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer plus 1% SDS. After addition of an equal volume of 2× protein sample buffer, the nuclear fraction was sonicated to reduce its viscosity. These nuclear fractions were used for the immunoblotting studies shown in Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B.Figure 2:The carboxyl terminus of p53 also possesses a target site-dependent transcriptional modulator. A, the experiments were performed as described in Fig. 1A, except that activators are the CD mutants of p53 shown below the autoradiogram. B, protein levels of p53 derivatives.

The His-tagged p53 protein was expressed in and purified from bacteria JM109DE3 (Promega) by the published procedure(27Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The purified protein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies against human p53 protein in rabbits according to standard protocols. For immunoblotting, approximately 50 μg of nuclear proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All other methods concerning Immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting assays were as previously described(23Lillie J.W. Green M.R.

Partly because p53 binds to several dissimilar DNA sequences(6Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and partly because its DNA binding domain, located approximately between amino acids 100 and 300, is structurally distinct from other known DNA binding domains(32Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar), we asked whether any regions outside the central DNA binding domain influenced the transactivation activity of p53. Since the p53 activation domain has been mapped to its amino-terminal end, to facilitate studies on amino-terminal deletion mutants (or ND mutants) we decided to fuse the VP16 activation domain of herpes simplex virus to the carboxyl-terminal end of p53. The VP16 fusion apparently caused no detriment to the transactivation activity of p53 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes1 and 3). Mutants p53ND50-VP and p53ND100-VP, which have a deletion of 50 and 100 amino acids, respectively, from the amino-terminal end of the fusion protein, showed a 3-4-fold reduction in activity toward a reporter gene containing one copy of the consensus PRE (or PREc) in the promoter. The reduction in activity was probably due to a difference in the level of protein being made (Fig. 1C, lanes2-5) and in the number of activation domains (see below). Interestingly, although the protein level of p53ND100-VP was about one-third of that of p53ND50-VP, both stimulated transcription almost equally well. It suggested that even the low level of p53ND100-VP being expressed was probably sufficient to saturate all of the PREc sites. A further deletion of 25 amino acids completely eliminated the transactivation activity of the fusion protein, although the protein was made to a level about half of that of p53-VP (Fig. 1C, compare lanes2 and 5). Thus, our data demonstrate that the amino-terminal boundary of p53 required for specific DNA binding toward the PREc is located between amino acids 100 and 125. The yeast transcriptional activator HAP1 binds, as p53 does, to several dissimilar sequences ((33Kim K.S. Pfeifer K. Powell L. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and references therein). Deletions of HAP1 have distinct effects on its transactivation activity via different target sites(33Kim K.S. Pfeifer K. Powell L. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This prompted us to look into the influence of the amino-terminal deletions of p53 on other PREs. We chose the one found in a region upstream of the transcription start site of the human ribosomal gene cluster (PREr) because it is well characterized. Fig. 1A shows that p53 and p53-VP did not distinguish PREr from PREc (compare lanes1 and 3 to lanes7 and 9). Surprisingly, both deletion mutants, p53ND50-VP and p53ND100-VP, failed to activate transcription via PREr (Fig. 1A, lanes10 and 11). The experiments above used reporters containing one copy of PRE. Since the amino-terminal end of p53 possesses a transactivation activity, the abrupt drop in activity toward PREr observed from p53-VP to p53ND50-VP or to p53ND100-VP might merely reflect the difference in the number of activation domains (two in p53-VP but one in each of mutants p53ND50-VP and p53ND100-VP). If this were correct, then an increase in the number of p53 binding sites would compensate the loss via the mechanism of transcriptional synergism(29Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 34Lin Y.S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, whereas the activity of p53ND50-VP and p53ND100-VP approached that of the parental p53-VP16 when the number of PREc increased from one to three, only a marginal increase in their activity was observed when the same assays were repeated with three copies of PREr. In other words, the data collected from the above study of transcription synergism suggest that the low transcriptional activity of the two ND mutants toward PREr is unlikely due to a difference in the number or strength of their activation domains. These data clearly demonstrated that the p53 amino-terminal region containing the first 100 residues is not required for the core domain to activate transcription via PREc but is indispensable for its transactivation via PREr. Thus, our experiments uncovered a novel function of the amino-terminal end of p53: a target site-dependent transcriptional modulator. In a parallel study, the transactivation activity of a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (or CD mutants) of p53 was measured. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, mutants containing carboxyl-terminal deletions of up to 95 amino acids were expressed to a level about double that of wild type p53. Fig. 2A shows that wild type p53 and these mutants exhibited similar transcriptional activity toward PREc. We noted a discrepancy between the levels of proteins being made and their transcriptional activity. For instance, p53 and p53CD55 stimulated transcription approximately equally, though the latter was about twice as high in protein concentration as the former. We have no reasonable explanation for this, except for mutant p53CD30, whose high activity was probably due to the deletion of a repression domain ((35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and see below). Note that p53CD55, p53CD75, and p53CD95 do not contain the oligomerization domain but still stimulated transcription quite well, indicating that the oligomerization domain is dispensable for the transactivation activity of p53 via PREc. p53CD115 was completely inactive, although the protein was expressed and localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2B and data not shown). By densitometer, the level of p53CD115 expressed was about 73% that of wild type p53, a reduction too small to account for the inaction of p53CD115. The experiment done with p53CD115 thus suggested that the carboxyl-terminal boundary of p53 required for specific DNA binding toward PREc was located between amino acids 278 and 298. In addition, since activator p53CD95 lacks all three previously identified nuclear localization signals (NLSI, residues 316-322; NLSII, residues 369-375; and NLSIII, residues 379-384) ((21Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and references therein) but was still able to stimulate transcription, this implied that all three NLSs are not required for p53 derivatives to be localized to the nucleus. When the same CD mutants were assayed with a reporter driven by PREr, a different result was obtained. Activators p53 and p53CD30 behaved similarly, regardless of which PRE they were assayed with (Fig. 2A, compare lanes2 and 3 with lanes9 and 10). Interestingly, p53CD55, p53CD75, and p53CD95 exhibited hardly any significant transactivation activity toward PREr. Thus, in analogy to its amino terminus, the p53 carboxyl-terminal region between residues 298 and 363 also contained a target site-dependent transcriptional modulator. We imagined that the transcriptional modulators may influence the transactivation activity of p53 derivatives by modulating the DNA binding activity of the core domain. To test this idea, we compared the PRE binding activity of mutants p53CD30 and p53-VP with that of mutants p53CD95 and p53ND50-VP, respectively, because of their obvious difference in transactivation activity toward PREr. To quantitatively reflect the affinity of each protein to the PRE sites, the amount of nuclear extract was titrated so that the incubation was carried out within the linear range of the protein-DNA interaction. As shown in Fig. 3, all four p53 derivatives seemed to bind PREc equally well (lanes4, 6, 8, and 10). Unexpectedly, they also exhibited similar activity in binding to PREr (lanes3, 5, 7, and 9). The binding of p53 derivatives to PREs was specific as demonstrated by the result that a nuclear extract of Saos-2 cells transfected with vector alone showed only residual binding (lanes1 and 2). Thus, our results did not support the idea that the modulator regions may augment transcription by increasing the DNA binding activity of p53 core domain toward PREr. The existence of an inhibition domain in p53 protein has been proposed(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 2A) demonstrated that removal of 30 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of p53 caused an increase in its transactivation activity. Partly because of the rapid degradation of p53 (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B) and partly to search for other p53 inhibition domain(s), which may overlap with the DNA binding domain and therefore cannot be characterized in the p53 background, a new assay system is needed. Fortunately, the GAL4-p53 hybrid seems to be a useful system because it has been shown to be relatively stable(36Raycroft L. Schmidt J.R. Yoas K. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the GAL4 module can provide a DNA binding activity. Furthermore, two lines of evidence indicate that there is probably little change in the configuration and activity of p53 when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. First, it is known that various p53 mutants and their corresponding GAL4-p53 hybrids behave similarly in terms of transcriptional activation(36Raycroft L. Schmidt J.R. Yoas K. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, the temperature-sensitive feature of the Val-135 mutant of p53 is maintained in the background of GAL4-p53 hybrid, regardless of which site (either a PRE or GAL4 binding site) it is assayed with(36Raycroft L. Schmidt J.R. Yoas K. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Scharer E. Iggo R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, it should be appropriate and relevant to transfer conclusions drawn from studies of the fusion protein to p53. As shown in Fig. 4A, fusion protein GAL4-p53 barely stimulated transcription from the reporter pG5E1BCAT. A deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids increased the transactivation activity about 40-fold (compare lanes3 and 4). Since the fusion protein binds DNA via the GAL4 module, the low transcriptional activity of GAL4-p53 was incompatible with the argument that the region containing the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids inhibits transcription by reducing the DNA binding activity of p53(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Rather, our results suggested that a repression domain, I1, exists in the carboxyl terminus of p53. More support for this conclusion is provided below. Derivatives of the fusion protein with a deletion of up to carboxyl-terminal 95 amino acids showed only a minor reduction in their transactivation activity (compare lanes4-7 in Fig. 4A). Another transcriptional inhibitory domain, however, was revealed when the carboxyl-terminal truncation proceeded beyond 95 amino acids. This second inhibitory domain, or I2, presumably resides quite close to the amino-terminal end of p53, because GAL4-p53CD223, a fusion protein with only the amino-terminal 170 amino acids of p53 left, still failed to enhance transcription. The carboxyl-terminal boundary of domain I2 was localized to between amino acids 145 and 170 of p53 since a further deletion of 25 amino acids produced a strong activator, GAL4-p53CD248 (compare lanes11 and 12 in Fig. 4A). All of the above experiments were done with osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. However, it has been demonstrated that transcriptional inhibitory domains can function in a cell-specific manner. For instance, the δ domain of c-jun is a cell-specific transcriptional inhibitor (38Baichwal V.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the activity of I1 and I2 in another cell line. Fig. 4B shows that, in contrast to the results obtained from Saos-2 cells, fusion proteins GAL4-p53 and GAL4-p53CD223 were able to activate transcription to a high level in HepG2 hepatoma cells (see lanes2 and 4).

Enzymological studies using receptor in rod outer segment membranes stripped of peripheral proteins reveal that the phosphorylation is independent of receptor conformation or liganded state; the half-time for phosphorylation of unbleached (dark-adapted) rhodopsin, bleached (light-activated) rhodopsin, and opsin (chromophore removed) is the same. The phosphorylation by protein kinase C is Ca2+ and lipid regulated; the Km for Ca2+ decreases with increasing concentrations of membrane, consistent with known properties of Ca2+-regulated protein kinase Cs. The Km for ATP is 27 μM, with an optimal concentration for MgCl2 of approximately 1 mM. The phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C is inhibited by the protein kinase C-selective inhibitor sangivamycin. Proteolysis by Asp-N reveals that all the protein kinase C phosphorylation sites are on the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Cleavage with trypsin indicates that Ser338, the primary phosphorylation site of rhodopsin kinase, is not phosphorylated significantly; rather, the primary phosphorylation site of protein kinase C is on the membrane proximal half of the carboxyl terminus.

The protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of rhodopsin is analogous to the ligand-independent phosphorylation of other G protein-coupled receptors that is catalyzed by second messenger-regulated kinases. Second messenger-regulated kinases and substrate-regulated kinases provide two desensitizing mechanisms in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors. Most notably, the β adrenergic receptor is desensitized at low ligand levels primarily by phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase A, and possibly C, and at high ligand levels by phosphorylation mediated by the β adrenergic receptor kinase(1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Recent evidence implicates both types of kinases in regulation of olfactory receptors (2Dawson T.M.

Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10127-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these signaling pathways, phosphorylation by two differently regulated kinases allows exquisite fine tuning of receptor function. In phototransduction, it has been clearly established that a G protein-coupled receptor kinase, rhodopsin kinase, phosphorylates and deactivates light-activated rhodopsin(5Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this pathway, absorption of a photon induces isomerization of the receptor's covalently bound ligand, 11-cis retinal, thus effecting a conformational change that exposes cytoplasmic surfaces on the receptor to allow interaction with transducin(6Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These exposed surfaces also promote binding of rhodopsin kinase and subsequent phosphorylation on the receptor's carboxyl terminus. The primary phosphorylation sites by rhodopsin kinase in vitro have been recently identified as Ser338 and Ser343(7McDowell J.H. Nawrocki J.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4968-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on the carboxyl terminus decreases the interaction with transducin, an interaction that is effectively quenched when arrestin binds the polyphosphorylated carboxyl tail(10Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Similar to other G protein-coupled receptor kinases, rhodopsin kinase displays strict specificity for the active conformation of the receptor. Mounting evidence implicates phosphorylation by an additional kinase, protein kinase C, in the phosphorylation of rhodopsin. First, hyperactivation of protein kinase C in the intact retina, by treatment with phorbol esters, alters the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in a light-dependent manner(11Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4749-4757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation has been shown to uncouple the receptor from transducin(13Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4749-4757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the allosteric activator of protein kinase C, diacylglycerol, has been shown by many groups to be produced in response to light(14Ghalayini A.J. Anderson R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Das N.D.

Shortridge R.D. Pak W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of rhodopsin phosphorylation to protein kinase C activators in situ and the light-dependent generation of diacylglycerol in rod outer segments support a role for protein kinase C in visual transduction. This contribution provides a kinetic and structural analysis of the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C. Our data reveal that the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C is mechanistically similar to the phosphorylation of other G protein-coupled receptors by second messenger-regulated kinases. Most importantly, the phosphorylation is independent of the liganded state of the receptor, and the primary phosphorylation site, although on the carboxyl terminus, differs from that of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase.

Isolation of Rod Outer Segment Membranes-Rod outer segments were isolated from 60 dark-adapted bovine retinas using sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously(23Azarian S.M. Schlamp C.L. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 787-798PubMed Google Scholar). These were resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 20 μM leupeptin, 200 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, at 4°C (lysis buffer) to effect osmotic lysis. The cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation at 245,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C. The membranes were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer and either urea-stripped or stored dark-adapted at −70°C. The cytosol was stored in 50% glycerol and used as the source of rhodopsin kinase. All procedures were carried out under dim red light (Kodak filter 1). Membranes were stripped of peripheral proteins based on the procedure of Lee et al.(24Lee R.H. Ting T.D. Lieberman B.S. Tobias D.E. Lolley R.N. Ho Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25104-25112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dark-adapted membranes from 30 retinas (approximately 12 mg of rhodopsin) were centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 4 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, at 4°C (Buffer A) and centrifuged again at 500,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The wash with Buffer A was repeated for a total of 3 times. After the final centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, at 4°C (Buffer B) and again washed 3 times in this buffer. The dark-adapted, stripped membranes were stored at −70°C in 20 μM leupeptin and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4°C; the rhodopsin concentration in this stock varied from 100 to 200 μM. The concentration of rhodopsin in octylglucoside-solubilized (1%) samples was determined spectrophotometrically at 500 nm using ε = 42,700 M-1 cm-1(25Hong K. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1972; 69: 2617-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out under dim red light (Kodak filter 1). The phospholipid/rhodopsin concentration was 90 ± 7 mol phospholipid/mol of rhodopsin as determined by phosphate analysis (26Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of chloroform/methanol-extracted lipids(27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42656) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin was regenerated based on the procedure of McDowell(28McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Stripped membranes (50 μl of 100-200 μM rhodopsin) were incubated at 30°C in 1 ml of solution containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, at 30°C, with 2 μl of 11-cis retinal (17.6 mM stored in 100% ethanol) in the dark overnight at 4°C and then stored at −70°C. The final concentration of ethanol in the regeneration tube was less than 1%. Protein kinase C was purified from 60 dark-adapted bovine retinas by sequential Q Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and phenyl-Superose chromatography, essentially as described for purification of rod outer segment protein kinase C(29Newton A.C. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 261-270Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (typically 500 nM; 8 ml) was stored at −20°C in 50% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (4°C). In one experiment (see Fig. 2), protein kinase C was further purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column. Retinal protein kinase C (1-4 pmol) was incubated in a 64-μl reaction volume containing urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes (20 pmol of rhodopsin, unless otherwise stated) and phosphorylation initiated by the addition of 16 μl of a solution containing [ γ-32P]ATP (250 μM; 0.45 Ci mmol-1 ATP) and MgCl2 (25 mM) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The final concentrations of species in a typical reaction mixture were as follows: 150 μM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM [ γ-32P]ATP, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM leupeptin, 13 mM KCl, 25 μM EDTA, 25 μM EGTA, 6% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (30°C). For some experiments, rhodopsin, MgCl2, ATP, or Ca2+ concentrations were varied as indicated in figure legends. In other experiments, 0.8 μl of PMA (100 nM in Me2SO) was added to the reaction volume prior to addition of ATP and vortexed immediately. The final concentration of PMA (1 nM) corresponded to 0.003 mol % relative to the lipid. Experiments in which Ca2+ concentrations were varied were conducted in the presence of 525 μM EGTA to buffer the Ca2+. Samples were incubated at 30°C for 10 min unless indicated otherwise. Phosphorylations catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase (in rod outer segment cytosol or partially purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography) were carried out under the same conditions except that partially purified rhodopsin kinase replaced the protein kinase C, and 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM EGTA replaced the CaCl2 in the assay to inhibit contaminating protein kinase C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.25 M Tris, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 20%β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat film) or analysis on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Rhodopsin bands were excised from gels, added to 2.5 ml of scintillation fluid (Biosafe II, Research Products International Corp.), and 32P incorporation was detected by scintillation counting. Alternatively, reactions were quenched with 25 μl of 0.1 M cold ATP and 0.1 M EDTA and spotted on Whatman P-81 ion-exchange paper. The papers were washed 4 times in 0.4% (v/v) phosphoric acid and once in 95% ethanol and then added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Incorporation of 32P into protein (>95% into rhodopsin) was detected by scintillation counting. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4, the rate of phosphorylation of a protein kinase C selective peptide (FKKSFKL-NH2; (22Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) was measured as described(30Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that rod outer segment membranes provided the lipid to stimulate protein kinase C rather than phosphatidylserine/diacyglycerol vesicles. Opsin was generated from rhodopsin as described by Hofmann et al.(31Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regenerated rod outer segment membranes (200 μl of 7 μM rhodopsin) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature under 150-watt lights with 200 μl of 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM hydroxylamine, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (30°C). The membranes were centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed 3 times by resuspension in 200 μl of 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4°C and centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4°C. Bleached rhodopsin was generated by exposure of rhodopsin to room light; phosphorylation reactions were initiated 10 min after light exposure. Rod outer segment membranes were phosphorylated by protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase, as described above, and the 32P incorporation was inhibited by diluting the reaction 2.8-fold with 0.1 M EDTA and 0.1 M ATP (not radioactive). The membranes were centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 20 min to remove the chelator, DTT, and ATP and resuspended in 50 μM CaCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (30°C), to a concentration of 0.30 μM receptor. The membrane-containing solution (0.25 μM receptor) was incubated with endoproteinase Asp-N (2.5 μg ml-1) at 30°C for 45 min. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and autoradiography. To visualize the rhodopsin, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and labeled with antibodies to opsin via incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG and detection by chemiluminescence(32Thorpe G.H.G. Kricka L.J. Mosely S.B. Whitehead T.P. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes were phosphorylated and centrifuged as described for the proteolysis with the endoproteinase Asp-N. The phosphorylated membranes were resuspended in 50 μM CaCl2 and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (4°C). Trypsin (2-20 μg ml-1; 1.2 × 104 BAEE units mg-1) was added to the solution (0.25 μM receptor) and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The proteolysis was stopped with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), autoradiography, and Western blotting, as described for the Asp-N proteolysis. The dependences of the rate of protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of rhodopsin on Ca2+, ATP, and rhodopsin concentrations were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation or a modified Hill equation (33Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the program Grafit(34Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Free calcium concentrations were calculated using a computer program provided by Claude Klee (35Jean T. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that takes into account pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, EGTA, and ATP concentrations. Urea-stripped membranes containing unbleached rhodopsin, bleached rhodopsin, or opsin were incubated with [32P]ATP in the presence or absence of retinal protein kinase C, Ca2+, and PMA. The autoradiogram in Fig. 1A shows that protein kinase C catalyzed a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of all three forms of rhodopsin (lanes4, 10, and 16). Addition of PMA had no significant effect on the Ca2+-dependent incorporation of 32P into rhodopsin (lanes5, 11, and 17), indicating that the membranes provided saturating concentrations of diacylglycerol. In support of this, analysis of membranes revealed approximately 1 mol % diacylglycerol (data not shown), sufficient for maximal activity of protein kinase C(36Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) . Autophosphorylation of protein kinase C, a good indicator of the intrinsic catalytic activity of protein kinase Cs(37Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) , was also dependent on Ca2+ and was not additionally stimulated by phorbol esters (e.g.lanes4 and 5), providing further support that the membranes provided an optimal environment for activation of this enzyme. No detectable 32P was incorporated into receptor in the absence of added protein kinase C (lanes6-8, 12-14, and 19-20), indicating that the membranes had no associated kinase activity. Of particular importance was the lack of phosphorylation of bleached membranes (lanes12-14), revealing that rhodopsin kinase was not associated with the membranes. In contrast to the phosphorylation by protein kinase C, the phosphorylation catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase was specific for the bleached conformation of rhodopsin. Fig. 1B shows that unbleached rhodopsin (lanes3-5) and opsin (lanes15-17) were not substrates of rhodopsin kinase, whereas bleached rhodopsin was (lanes9-11). The phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase was not sensitive to Ca2+ (lane10) or phorbol esters (lane11) under the conditions of the experiment. Note that less than 0.1 μM recoverin was present in the reaction mixture, based on Coomassie staining of gels, and thus recoverin-dependent Ca2+ effects would not be expected(38Kawamura S. Hisatomi O. Kayada S. Tokunaga F. Kuo C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14579-14582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares time courses for phosphorylation of unbleached rhodopsin, bleached rhodopsin, and opsin. For the concentrations of protein kinase C and receptor examined in this figure, the half-time of phosphorylation was approximately the same for all species of receptor: 57 ± 9 min for unbleached rhodopsin and opsin (weighted average ± S.E. for both sets of data) and 52 ± 3 min for bleached rhodopsin. The final stoichiometry for phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin by retinal protein kinase C varied from 0.6 to 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor, depending on membrane preparation, and was typically 4-fold less than the maximal phosphorylation catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase (data not shown). In general, unbleached rhodopsin and opsin incorporated 80-100% of the phosphate incorporated by bleached rhodopsin. Addition of fresh protein kinase C to the reaction mixture after phosphate incorporation had plateaued did not result in a significant increase in phosphorylation, revealing that 32P incorporation had plateaued because phosphorylation sites were no longer available. The receptor present in these experiments was quantitatively proteolyzed by endoproteinase Asp-N to generate a 32-kDa truncated form (see Fig. 7B). Because this protease cleaves the cytoplasmic (carboxyl) terminal tail of rhodopsin, all receptor molecules were oriented with their cytoplasmic surface exposed to the solution. Fig. 3 shows the rate of rhodopsin phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase as a function of increasing amounts of stripped rod outer segment membranes. Because the relative concentration of substrate in the membrane was the same for all rhodopsin concentrations (i.e. same rhodopsin/lipid ratio), a Km for rhodopsin cannot be interpreted from these data (i.e. because of the reduction in dimensionality, once the kinase binds the first substrate, the local concentration of substrate near the kinase is the same for all conditions). However, the data do reveal that 1) protein kinase C has a higher affinity for rod outer segment membranes than does rhodopsin kinase and 2) under the conditions of these assays, 70 ± 2 nM rhodopsin (approximately 6 μM phospholipid) resulted in half-maximal activation of protein kinase C. The Ca2+ dependence for the activation of retinal protein kinase C was measured for two substrates and as a function of membrane concentration. The concentration of Ca2+ resulting in half-maximal activity toward rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) or phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (Fig. 4B, opencircles) was the same (14 ± 3 μM or 14 ± 2 μM, respectively) in the presence of 32 μM lipid. Note that this concentration of lipid and rhodopsin (0.35 μM) result in stimulation of protein kinase C to 90% of its maximal rate (see Fig. 3). The identical Ca2+ requirement for phosphorylation of two different substrates is consistent with this cation allosterically modulating the membrane binding and catalytic activity of protein kinase C (39Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 40Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than substrate binding. Fig. 4B shows that the Km for Ca2+ decreased to 4.6 ± 0.3 μM when the concentration of rod outer segment membranes was increased to 320 μM lipid. The drop in Km that occurred upon a 10-fold increase in lipid concentration reflects an increase in affinity of protein kinase C for these membranes. Mosior and Epand (40Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the apparent binding constant of conventional protein kinase Cs for membranes is linearly proportional to Ca2+ concentration between 100 nM and 0.5 mM Ca2+. Because the binding of Ca2+ to protein kinase C depends on the total lipid concentration, mol % phosphatidylserine, and mol % diacylglycerol(39Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 40Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the Km for Ca2+ measured in vitro is relative to the specific assay conditions. 2As an example of high concentrations of one activator reducing the regulation by Ca2+, rhodopsin reconstituted in membranes containing 95 mol % phosphatidylserine and 5 mol % diacylglycerol is phosphorylated by protein kinase C in the absence of Ca2+(11Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ requirement for phosphorylation of unbleached rhodopsin or opsin was not significantly different from that of bleached rhodopsin (not shown). The Km for ATP for the phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin by protein kinase C was 27 ± 3 μM ATP (Fig. 5A). This number is similar to the Km for ATP of known isozymes when measured using phosphorylation of synthetic peptides, 3L. M. Keranen and A. C. Newton, unpublished data. and slightly higher than the reported Km for phosphorylation of histone (5-10 μM ATP,(42Burns D.J. Bloomenthal J. Lee M.-H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12044-12051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). A concentration of 50 μM ATP was included in subsequent phosphorylation assays. The dependence on Mg2+ for the phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin by protein kinase C is presented in Fig. 5B. The maximal rate of phosphorylation of rhodopsin required 1-5 mM MgCl2, with higher concentrations resulting in inhibition of the kinase. This stimulation is consistent with the Mg2+ requirements reported for the known Ca2+-dependent protein kinase Cs; Burns and Bell (42Burns D.J. Bloomenthal J. Lee M.-H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12044-12051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase C α, βII and γ are half-maximally stimulated by 0.9, 0.6, and 0.7 mM Mg2+, respectively. Subsequent phosphorylation assays were conducted in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2. Fig. 6 shows that sangivamycin selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin catalyzed by protein kinase C compared with the phosphorylation catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase. Although this nucleoside analogue competes with ATP for the ATP-binding site, it displays significant selectivity for protein kinase C's active site compared with that of other kinases(43Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1682-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase C was half-maximally inhibited by 13.4 ± 0.7 μM sangivamycin in the presence of 50 μM ATP; the IC50 for this concentration of ATP agrees with the Ki of 11 μM reported for Ca2+-dependent protein kinase Cs(43Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1682-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, rhodopsin kinase was considerably less"

https://openalex.org/W2031530785,"We have used an in vitro RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) inhibition-restimulation assay to investigate the inability of a form of RNAP II (RNAP IIB) that lacks the conserved, C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) to transcribe the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) promoter. Our previous studies demonstrated promoter-specific responses to RNAP IIB in the inhibition-restimulation assay and suggested the existence of cis-acting elements that alleviate the requirement for the CTD. We have now identified elements from two different classes of promoters that can convert dhfr to a CTD-independent promoter. First, addition of a consensus TATA box to the dhfr promoter resulted in a promoter capable of CTD-independent transcription and increased the promoter's affinity for the general transcription factor TFIID. These results suggest that high affinity for TFIID correlates with an ability to be transcribed by RNAP IIB, supporting a proposed interaction between the CTD and TFIID. Second, transfer of a combination of two elements (located at −25 and +1) from the rep-3b promoter, which does not contain a consensus TATA box but can nonetheless be transcribed by RNAP IIB, into the dhfr promoter also allowed CTD-independent transcription. These elements do not constitute a high affinity binding site for TFIID, indicating that an additional mechanism exists to allow CTD-independent transcription. Thus, elements from two classes of CTD-independent promoters that can obviate a requirement for the CTD appear to function via distinct mechanisms.

Formation of the preinitiation complex, containing RNAP II and the general transcription factors (required for the transcription of all RNAP II promoters), requires RNAP II containing an unphosphorylated CTD (RNAP IIA)(10Lu H.

In contrast to the essential role of the CTD for cell viability, initial studies suggested that the CTD is not required for transcription in vitro.

Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The in vitro results can be reconciled with the in vivo results with the suggestion that some promoters would require the CTD for transcription in vitro. In support of this, Thompson et al.(17Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that reacts with the CTD to inhibit transcription in vitro and then demonstrated that the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) promoter is active with RNAP IIA, but not RNAP IIB. We extended these results by demonstrating that several other promoters also displayed this CTD-dependent transcription in vitro(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that the CTD plays a critical role in transcription from some, but not all, promoters. The result with the dhfr promoter has been confirmed by Kang and Dahmus(11Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that RNAP IIA, but not RNAP IIB, can restore activity to the dhfr promoter in whole cell extract fractions depleted of RNAP II activity by anion-exchange chromatography. The promoter-specific responses to RNAP IIB suggest the existence of cis-acting elements that influence a requirement for the CTD. We reasoned that identification and characterization of such elements would provide insight into the role of the CTD during transcription. Herein we describe the identification of two distinct elements that, when transferred into the dhfr promoter, allow CTD-independent transcription in vitro. Our results suggest that these elements function by distinct mechanisms, and are consistent with a proposed role for the CTD during the formation of the transcriptional preinitiation complex.

To construct the dhfr+TATA promoter, mutations at −28, −26, −24, −23, and −22 were introduced into dhfr promoter DNA using a polymerase chain reaction assay (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Reactions containing everything except labeled probe were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of the labeled probe and a second, identical incubation. The reactions then were electrophoresed for 2 h at 180 V (constant voltage) on a 4% (39:1) polyacrylamide gel with a 0.25 × TBE (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) running buffer. Prior to loading the samples, the gel had been prerun at 180 V for 15-30 min. Detection of TBP-containing protein-DNA complexes was by a modification of the GMSA protocol described by Purnell and Gilmour(22Purnell B.A. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The probe was a NruI-PvuII fragment containing sequences from −50 to +65 of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter. The probe fragment and specific competitor DNA fragments described below were isolated from nondenaturing, 4% polyacrylamide gels by incubating gel slices in an excess of Tris-EDTA (pH 7.6) overnight at 65°C. Specific DNA competitors (115-130 bp) in the GMSA included: the unlabeled hsp70 probe, a fragment containing rep-3b promoter sequences from −192 to −81, and a fragment containing dhfr or dhfr+TATA promoter sequences from −64 to +61. Additional competitors (used in the experiment described in Fig. 9) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction and contained promoter sequences from −49 to +14 (rep-3b), −64 to +17 (dhfr), or −64 to +14 (pDR-30/−18, pDR-5/+14, and pDR-30/−18/−5/+14). These fragments contained additional vector DNA such that the fragments extended from approximately −65 to +90 (or to +120 for the dhfr competitor). Binding reactions (12.5 μl total volume) contained 0.5 μl of DEAE-52 protein fraction (approximately 1.5 μg of protein), 20,000-40,000 cpm end-labeled probe (approximately 4 ng), 100-200 ng of MspI-digested pBR322 DNA or HindIII-digested λ DNA (New England Biolabs), 0-200 ng of specific competitor DNA, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 90 mM KCl, 0.8 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Supershift experiments also contained 130 ng of affinity-purified mAb, either TBP-18 that reacts with human TBP 3N. E. Thompson and R. R. Burgess, unpublished data. or NT73 that reacts with the β′ subunit of Escherichia coli RNAP(30Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All components of the reaction were mixed and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The reactions then were electrophoresed for 4-5 h as previously described(22Purnell B.A. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have used a RNAP II inhibition-restimulation assay (Fig. 1) (18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to investigate promoter-specific responses to RNAP II that lacks the CTD (RNAP IIB). RNAP II activity in nuclear extract was inhibited by incubation with a mAb that reacts with the CTD. The specificity of the inhibition of in vitro transcription is demonstrated by the ability to restimulate inhibited transcription by the addition of RNAP IIA(17Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell.

Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, RNAP IIB restimulates inhibited transcription only from a subset of promoters(17Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that the CTD plays an essential role in the in vitro transcription from these promoters. In our previous work(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we contrasted the response of the dhfr and rep-3b promoters to RNAP IIB in the inhibition-restimulation assay; both promoters are Sp1-activated (29Farnham P.J. Cornwell M.M. Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 137-148PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) and lack a consensus TATA box 30 bp upstream of the start sites of transcription. However, unlike the dhfr promoter, the rep-3b promoter can be transcribed by RNAP IIB (18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequences contained in the approximately 65-bp minimal promoter regions of the dhfr and rep-3b promoters determine the response of each of these promoters to RNAP IIB(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We postulated that protein binding to distinct sites, the HIP site in dhfr and the RIP site in rep-3b, within each minimal promoter sequence is responsible for the difference in the ability to be transcribed by RNAP IIB. To test this hypothesis, we needed to identify mutations in the HIP and RIP sites that block the binding of proteins present in transcription extracts. Recent work has demonstrated that the HIP site is a binding site for the E2F family of transcription factors (31Kollmar R. Farnham P.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 203: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Farnham P.J. Slansky J.E. Kollmar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and is necessary for a regulated increase in transcription from the dhfr promoter following serum-stimulation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells(19Means A.L.

Cell. Biol. 13,1610 -1618; Correction (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol., 13, 7201.Google Scholar). Mutations that block E2F binding to the HIP site have been described(19Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To analyze protein binding to the RIP site in the rep-3b promoter, gel mobility shift experiments (GMSA) were performed with HeLa cell nuclear extract. Using a probe containing rep-3b sequences from −23 to −5, we confirmed earlier findings (34Means, A. L., 1991, Identification, Purification, and Characterization of HIP1: A Protein That Positions Transcription Initiation of the Dihydrofolate Reductase Gene. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison.Google Scholar) that specific protein-DNA complexes can form on this region of the promoter (Fig. 2). We mutated the region protected in the previous DNase footprinting assays and then determined that protein binding to the RIP site probe was not blocked by an excess of RIPmt oligonucleotide (Fig. 2; see also Fig. 3A for the sequence of the RIP site mutation). We next compared the ability of RNAP IIB to restimulate mAb 8WG16-inhibited transcription from wild-type and mutated dhfr and rep-3b promoters (Fig. 3). Mutation of the HIP (E2Fmt) and RIP sites did not affect significantly the level, or the location of the start sites of uninhibited transcription relative to that from the wild-type dhfr and rep-3b promoters (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that protein binding to these sites in the dhfr and rep-3b promoters is not necessary for the formation of competent transcription complexes. Additionally, neither mutation affected the response of the promoter to RNAP IIB in the inhibition-restimulation assay. Similar to the response of the wild-type promoter, transcription from the dhfr promoter with a mutated HIP (E2Fmt) site was not restimulated by addition of RNAP IIB (Fig. 3B). Transcription from both the wild-type rep-3b promoter and from the promoter with a mutated RIP site was restimulated by the RNAP IIB (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that binding of these factors to the sites in the dhfr and rep-3b promoters is not necessary for the promoter's response to RNAP IIB in the inhibition-restimulation assay.Figure 3:Mutation of the RIP site in rep-3b and the E2F site in dhfr has no effect in the inhibition/restimulation assay.

Uninhibited reactions (U) for each promoter are in lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10. Reactions in lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11 were inhibited with 150 μg/ml of mAb 8WG16 (I). Reactions in lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12 received the mAb and 500 ng of RNAP IIB (+pIIB). RNAs were visualized by primer extension analysis. The size of individual marker bands (M) for each panel are indicated. The signal in lane 11 appears lower than that in lane 8 due to loss of sample during processing. In other experiments, the wild-type rep-3b and the rep-3b RIPmt promoters responded similarly to the mAb 8WG16.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, we reported that the presence of a consensus TATA box in a promoter is not sufficient to allow transcription by RNAP IIB. This conclusion was based on our finding that transcription from the human histone H2b promoter, although it contains a consensus TATA box, was not restimulated by RNAP IIB in the inhibition-restimulation assay(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in recent experiments, RNAP IIB could restimulate transcription from the H2b promoter (Fig. 4). We have attempted to reconcile the difference between our published and current results by testing the response of the H2b promoter in the inhibition-restimulation assay with multiple preparations of mAb 8WG16, RNAP IIB, DNA template, and nuclear extract. In each experiment, inhibited transcription from the H2b promoter was restimulated with RNAP IIB (data not shown). Additionally, we retested several other promoters from our previous analysis in the RNAP II inhibition-restimulation assay. As reported, transcription from the CAD and Raf-1 promoters, previously classified as nonresponsive to RNAP IIB (18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was not restimulated by RNAP IIB (Fig. 4). These promoters do not contain a consensus TATA box(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also as reported, RNAP IIB did restimulate transcription from the Irf1 and c-myc promoters (Fig. 4, and data not shown), previously classified as responsive to RNAP IIB(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The c-myc, but not the Irf1, promoter contains a consensus TATA box(18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the response to RNAP IIB of all the retested promoters, except the H2b promoter, remained as published. Although we were unable to identify the cause of the difference in our results with the H2b promoter, we cannot rule out that a specific inhibitor of H2b was introduced during previous experiments or during manipulations of previous preparations of mAb or RNAP II. Those preparations no longer exist. Given the current results, we conclude that the H2b promoter can be transcribed by RNAP IIB. Although the presence of a consensus TATA box in a promoter is not required for restimulation by RNAP IIB in our assay (Figure 3:, Figure 4:) (18Buermeyer A.B. Thompson N.E. Strasheim L.A. Burgess R.R. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2250-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), all of the promoters tested that contain a consensus TATA box were transcribed by this form of RNAP II. We postulated, therefore, that the presence of a consensus TATA box in a promoter would be sufficient to allow transcription in the absence of the CTD. To test this hypothesis, we created a mutant dhfr promoter (dhfr+TATA), containing a consensus TATA box located 30 bp upstream of the wild-type start sites of transcription (Fig. 5A). In uninhibited extracts, the transcriptional activity of this promoter was approximately 3-fold greater than the wild-type dhfr promoter. Initiation utilized the same sites as the wild-type promoter, although transcription at a downstream start (at approximately +12; see Fig. 8A for the sequence in that region) was increased. We have not investigated the differential utilization of the start sites by these promoters, because, for each promoter, both start sites behaved similarly in the inhibition-restimulation assay (see below).

A recently established cell-free assay for DNA transfer (DTA) was applied to study nuclear extracts from normal and SCID-derived cells. The recombination deficiency was reflected in the cell-free system: SCID lymphocyte and fibroblast extracts showed reduced levels of DTA activity on a variety of DNA substrates. Analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from wild-type thymocytes and B cells representing different stages in lymphocyte ontogeny revealed the highest activities at the most immature stages. With progression of development, DTA activity decreased. Corresponding to their early developmental arrest, V(D)J rearrangement-incompetent RAG-2-/- lymphocyte extracts show high DTA activity. In contrast, extracts from SCID early lymphocytes express very low DNA transfer activity. Induction of V(D)J rearrangement in vivo in a normal preB cell line lead to a co-induction of the cell-free recombination activity. This indicates a development stage specificity of cell-free DNA recombination, which temporally parallels V(D)J recombination.

This protein, SRSP (SCID Recombination Stimulatory Protein), migrates as a single band of approximately 72 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In lymphocyte ontogeny, T and B cell precursors rearrange their antigen receptor or immunoglobulin gene loci to form diverse cell surface receptors by a site-specific recombination process, V(D)J recombination. While V(D)J recombination has been analyzed in detail as a developmentally regulated process in vivo, much less is known about the biochemical processes which drive V(D)J recombination (for reviews, see Lieber(1991, 1992), Gellert(1992), Schatz et al.(1992), Taccioli et al.(1992), Jessberger(1994)). Several proteins have been detected to bind and possibly bend DNA sequences which contain the V(D)J signal sequences (Aguilera et al., 1987; Li et al., 1989; Matsunami et al., 1989; Andrews et al., 1993; Wu et al., 1993b). A direct function in recombination, however, could not yet be assigned to these proteins. Two genes (recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) were identified which, following transfer into fibroblasts, mediate V(D)J recombination of plasmid DNA substrates (Schatz et al., 1989; Oettinger et al., 1990). The crucial role of these genes has been demonstrated in mice which carry a homozygous mutation in either the RAG-1 (Mombaerts et al., 1992) or the RAG-2 (Shinkai et al., 1992) gene. RAG-deficient lymphocyte precursors do not initiate the rearrangement of their antigen receptor genes and remain arrested at early stages of development. However, it is still unknown, whether the RAG genes directly participate in the recombination reaction or whether they are signal factors which indirectly trigger the activation of a recombination machinery. Although not essential for V(D)J rearrangement, the only defined enzyme which has been shown to take part in the reaction is terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Landau et al., 1987; Komori et al., 1993), which creates the N-region diversity by adding nucleotide monophosphates to the coding ends at the V to J and J to D junctions. Taken together, the enzymology of V(D)J joining is still largely unknown. Similarly, little is known about the mammalian enzymatic activities which are involved in DNA double-strand break repair through end-joining or homologous recombination (West, 1992). Another phenotype similar to that one observed in RAG-deficient mice is found in the well characterized Severe Combined Immune Deficiency syndrome (SCID) (for review, see Bosma and Carroll(1991)). SCID thymocytes and early B cells are developmentally arrested at early, immature stages. In contrast to the RAG deficiencies, in SCID lymphocytes V(D)J joining is initiated, but no functional coding joints are formed (Lieber et al., 1988b). Large, unrepaired deletions around the V(D)J recombination sites have been observed in SCID cells. Signal joint formation occurs, but is also altered such that a high percentage of imprecise signal joints are formed (Lieber et al., 1988b). The SCID mutation is thought to affect a late step in the V(D)J joining pathway (Malynn et al., 1988), probably the resolution of reaction intermediates in coding joint formation (Roth et al., 1992a, 1992b). Very recently, evidence was obtained for the identification of the SCID gene as the gene for DNA-dependent protein kinase (Carter et al., 1990; Lees-Miller et al., 1990). 1C. Kirchgessner and J. M. Brown, personal communication. 2S. P. Jackson and P. Jeggo, personal communication. A number of investigators have described another defect associated with the SCID mutation: an elevated sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other agents which generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). 3The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakTLCKNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketoneDTADNA transfer assayTCRT cell receptorRCrecombination complexFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatebpbase pair(s)FPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyEPPS4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. SCID fibroblasts, myeloid, intestinal crypt, and bone marrow cells are not able to repair DNA double-strand breaks as efficiently as wild-type cells (Fulop and Philips, 1990; Biedermann et al., 1991; Hendrickson et al., 1991; Pergola et al., 1993; Taccioli et al., 1993).

Two other genetic complementation groups of non-lymphocyte hamster cell lines have been described which also display a deficiency in both, the repair of x-ray-induced DSBs and V(D)J recombination (Pergola et al., 1993; Taccioli et al., 1993). Cells of the xrs group (group 5) lack a DNA end-binding factor identified as protein Ku (Paillard and Strauss, 1991; Getts and Stamato, 1994; Rathmell and Chu, 1994; Smider et al., 1994; Taccioli et al., 1994). Ku protein is composed of an 86- and a 70-kDa subunit, binds to a variety of DNA structures, and is associated with DNA-dependent protein kinase (Gottlieb and Jackson, 1993). SCID and the V3 hamster cell line constitute one other complementation group (group 9), and the third group is represented by XR-1 (group 4). There are at least two ways in which a cell might repair DNA double-strand breaks. One is end-joining, the religation of DNA ends of various structures without the possibility to repair deletions or insertions at the site of the break. The alternative is the repair of DSBs by recombination with the homologous allele. Homologous recombinational repair, although more complex than rejoining of the ends, is the only known way to accurately repair deletions or gaps, which might have been generated by nucleolytic removal of deoxynucleotides at the DNA ends of a DSB (Szostak et al., 1983; Haber, 1992). It should be noted that despite a possible factor-sharing, homologous, nonhomologous, and V(D)J recombination remain three distinct reactions with unique and independent features. Recently, a cell-free assay for intermolecular DNA recombination was developed (Jessberger and Berg, 1991). This assay, named DNA transfer assay (DTA), directly measures the transfer and stable incorporation of donor plasmid DNA into recipient plasmid DNA in vitro. In the set up reported here, the recipient DNA molecules bear a deletion either with or without a double-strand break (DSB) at that site. Transfer of homologous donor DNA is an essential feature of all pathways of homologous recombination as described by the double-strand break repair model (Szostak et al., 1983), the single-strand annealing model (Lin et al., 1990a, 1990b), or the Meselson-Radding model (Meselson and Radding, 1975). Transfer of DNA strands may occur also during heterologous recombination including end-joining. In the DTA reaction, tritium-labeled donor DNA becomes covalently incorporated into the digoxigeninylated recipient DNA. The recipient DNA is subsequently recovered through binding to affinity beads. The radioactivity, originating from the donor DNA, and present after transfer in the recipient DNA on the affinity beads, allows the direct measurement of the DNA transfer between the two DNAs (Jessberger and Berg, 1991). The DTA measures the sum of all the recombination events leading to a stable strand transfer (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Discussion”). Depending on the nature of the DNA substrates and protein fractions, these reactions include, but are not limited to, crossover and non-crossover pathways of homologous recombination (Jessberger and Berg, 1991; Jessberger et al., 1993), as well as end-joining, heterologous (Jessberger and Berg, 1991), and sequence-specific reactions. 4M. Wabl and R. Jessberger, submitted for publication. The DTA has been used to purify and characterize a high molecular weight protein complex (RC-1; recombination complex 1) from fetal calf thymus, which catalyzes DNA recombinational repair of gaps and deletions in homologous plasmid DNA substrates (Jessberger et al., 1993). An in vitro assay measuring the activity of nuclear extracts to mediate intermolecular DNA transfer should facilitate the molecular analysis of mutations in the enzymatic machinery which affect DSB repair such as the SCID mutation. The recombination deficiency of SCID is reproduced in the cell-free system, where nuclear extracts prepared from SCID lymphocytes and fibroblasts show significantly decreased activity. A protein (SRSP; Scid Recombination Stimulatory Protein) has been purified from normal mouse thymus which stimulates the DTA activity specifically in SCID thymocyte and proB cell nuclear extracts. Highly purified SRSP appears as a protein of approximately 72 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SRSP has no obvious functional relationship to a variety of DNA metabolic enzymes. C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Olac. RAG-2 deficient, CB.17, and CB.17scid mice were bred at our own animal facilities from breeding pairs originally obtained from F. Alt (The Childrens' Hospital, Boston) and M. Bosma (Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase, Philadelphia), respectively. The CB.17- and CB.17scid-derived fibroblast cell lines were obtained from J. M. Brown (Stanford University) and cultured as described (Biedermann et al., 1991). The CB.17scid fibroblasts proliferated about twice as fast as the CB.17 fibroblasts. The following primary monoclonal antibodies were used in this study: FITC-coupled 145-2C11 (anti-CD3), phycoerythrin-coupled GK1.5 (Ogawa et al., 1991) (anti-CD4, Becton Dickinson), Red613-coupled 53-6.7 (anti-CD8, Life Technologies, Inc.), + (anti-CD4 + CD8 monoclonal antibody for complement lysis). The monoclonal antibodies were FITC-labeled using fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC “Isomer I”) (Molecular Probes) using standard procedures. The specific reactivity of the antibodies was analyzed by FACS, and the optimal antibody dilutions were used. Anti Ku p80 (86-kDa subunit) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and polyclonal anti Ku p70 and p80 antibodies were gifts from S. Jackson, Cambridge. To enrich CD4-CD8- thymocytes from total adult thymus, 2 × 108 thymocytes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NaHCO3 were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against CD4 and CD8 for 10 min at 37°C and subsequently incubated with complement for 45 min at 37°C (Low-Tox-M, Rabbit Complement Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada). The CD4/CD8 double negative cells were isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll density gradient. To exclude the possibility that the complement treatment would alter the activity of nuclear extracts, DN thymocytes were also enriched by removal of CD4 and CD8 expressing thymocytes through magnetic beads. 1 × 108 thymocytes were incubated with anti-CD4 (α-L3T4, Ceredig et al.(1985)) and anti-CD8 antibodies (α-Lyt-2; Sarmiento et al.(1980)) coupled to the magnetic microbeads and processed on the column as described by the supplier (MACS system, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Subsequently, enriched DN populations were further purified into CD3-CD4-CD8- thymocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see below). For T cell sorting, 5 × 107 thymocytes were stained with anti-CD3-FITC (5 μg/ml), anti-CD4-PE (1:250 dilution), and anti-CD4-Red613 (1:100 dilution) and separated into CD3-CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+, and CD4+CD8-subpopulations, respectively, at a flow rate of approximately 3000 cells/s using a FACStar Plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Sorted cell populations were reanalyzed for their purity and were found to be >99% pure. The procedure used in prepurifying and sorting of the DN cells did not influence the results in the cell-free recombination assay. Extracts were made from 1 to 6 million cells and equal amounts of protein compared for their cell-free DNA transfer activity. The bone marrow-derived pro-, pre-, immature, and mature B cells were sorted as follows: bone marrow was deprived of sIg+ B cells by the use of sheep anti-mouse Ig-coated Dyna beads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway) as recommended by the supplier. The remaining cells were stained with the FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody RA3-6B2 (anti-B220; Pharmingen) and phycoerythrin-coupled Acky (anti-c-kit; McCormack et al.(1989)), and separated into B220+, c-kit+ proB cells and B220+, c-kit- preB cells. For sorting of immature and mature B cells, total bone marrow cells were stained with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and the phycoerythrin-coupled monoclonal antibody 1.19 (anti-IgD). Immature sIgM+, IgD- B cells and mature sIgM+, IgD+, and the proB and preB cells were sorted using the FACStar Plus cell sorter. The stromal cell and IL-7-dependent preB cell line bcl-2-5 was derived from a Eμ-bcl-2 transgenic mouse and was cultured on irradiated stromal cells in the presence of IL-7 as described previously (Rolink et al., 1993). For differentiation, the bcl-2-5 preB cells were cultured on irradiated stromal cells in the absence of IL-7. The nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described in Jessberger et al. (1993). FACS-sorted cells (1 - 5 × 106) were washed twice with approximately 10 ml of buffer A (10 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM sucrose, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, at 0°C, 0.5 mM spermidine, and the proteinase inhibitors 10 mM Na2S2O5, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml TLCK). The cells were than resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer B (buffer A minus sucrose) and subjected to homogenization in a 1-ml Dounce homogenizer, using pestle B (loose, 10-15 strokes). The nuclei were collected by a 3-min centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4°C. The supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclei were resuspended in 0.25 ml of buffer C (10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5 at 0°C, and the proteinase inhibitors 30 μg/ml TLCK, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM Na2S2O5) to which 1/10 volume of 2.5 M ammonium sulfate solution, pH 7.4, was added. After a 30-min incubation, the remaining nuclei were pelleted by ultracentrifugation in the Airfuge (Beckman Instruments, rotor A-95; approximately 170,000 × g) for 15 min at 4°C. The clear supernatant was collected, glycerol was added to 10%, and the extract was stored in aliquots at −70°C (Fraction I, 0.25 ml, 0.05 to 0.3 mg/ml protein). For concentration, samples of the extracts were dialyzed against buffer C containing 50% glycerol and 50 mM ammonium sulfate. For preparation of nuclear extracts from organs and tissues, the material (between 0.5 and 15 g) was washed once in buffer A (1500 rpm centrifugation at 4°C for 3 min.), homogenized in a blender to produce a cell suspension, again washed in buffer A (2500 rpm centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min), and the cells were resuspended in buffer B. They were then treated as described above, except that the volumina had to be adopted respectively. The protein concentrations were between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml. The tissues and organs were derived from strain- and age-matched mice. The nuclear extracts did contain low amounts of nucleic acids (<2%) as judged by optical density measurements at 260 and 280 nm (Warburg and Christian, 1941), presumably mostly ribonucleic acids. As often experienced for nuclear salt extracts from mammalian cells, no major double-strand DNA-degrading activities were present. The DTA has been carried out with minor variations as described (Jessberger and Berg, 1991; Jessberger et al., 1993) and is only briefly summarized here. The DNA substrates, their modification by digoxigeninylation, or in vivo labeling with [3H]thymidine, the preparation of antidigoxigenin polyacrylamide beads, and the bacterial strains used in these studies have been described before (Jessberger and Berg, 1991). For most experiments, the donor DNA was uniformly 3H-labeled pSV2neo supercoiled plasmid DNA, the recipient DNA was a deletion derivative of pSV2neo, bearing a deletion of 70 bp or 248 bp in length (pSV2neoΔ70 or -Δ248). Unless otherwise noted, both DNAs were used in their circular form in equal amounts of 0.1 μg of each substrate. For some experiments, the recipient DNA has been linearized at the site of the deletion by treatment with XhoI restriction endonuclease. The DTA measures the stable transfer of radioactively labeled donor DNA into the recipient DNA. Tritium-labeled donor DNA was incubated in the nuclear extract (0.03-1.2 μg of protein) with digoxigeninylated recipient DNA in a solution containing 10 mM EPPS, pH 7.8, 15 mM ammonium sulfate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM spermidine, 0.1 mM concentration of each of the four dNTPs, and 1 mM ATP. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37°C, terminated by the addition of SDS to 0.05% and EDTA to 80 mM, and the DNA was re-extracted by phenol:chloroform (1:10). Heating of the protein-free DNA in the presence of SDS and EDTA to 70°C or 95°C did not significantly affect the results. The recipient DNA was then bound to anti-digoxigenin antibodies covalently attached to polyacrylamide beads. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, the amount of radioactivity associated with the recipient DNA was determined by counting the bead-bound DNA in a scintillation counter. DTA activity is expressed as percentage of input 3H radioactivity stably transferred into the recipient DNA on the beads. The DTA measures the total of all DNA strand transfer reactions, which take place in a given sample. The complete repair of deletions and gaps in the recipient DNA has been shown by polymerase chain reaction analysis, where crossover and non-crossover products of homologous recombination have been observed (Jessberger and Berg, 1991; Jessberger et al., 1993). Recombination between nonhomologous DNA substrates, end-joining, and recombination stimulated by specific DNA sequences can also be measured in the assay.4 Thus, if any one of the above-mentioned recombination reactions comprises a significant proportion of the total strand transfer events in a particular set up, the assay will detect a deficiency in that pathway. The DNA polymerase assays and topoisomerase assays were performed as described earlier (Jessberger et al., 1993). The DNA substrates for the DNA polymerase assays were either DNaseI-treated, nicked plasmid DNA, or single-primed M13 single-strand DNA. For DNA nuclease assays, uniformly 3H-labeled plasmid DNA, either linearized or supercoiled, was used. Either the liberation of [3H]dNMPs or the conversion to nicked circular or linearized forms was measured. The x-ray survival assay on exponentially growing fibroblast cells was performed essentially as described (Biedermann et al., 1991). About 25 mg of nuclear extract protein (Table 1) was prepared as described above from 8 g of normal (CB.17 or C57Bl/6), 6- to 10-week-old mice thymus. Fraction I was concentrated by precipitating with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 4°C for 30 min. The pellet was redissolved in buffer E-80 (80 mM ammonium sulfate in buffer E, which contains 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5 at 0°C, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and the proteinase inhibitors as described for buffer C). Fraction II (3 ml, 22 mg of protein) was applied to a Superdex 200 FPLC gel filtration column (Pharmacia, Sweden), and the column developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in buffer E-80. The peak of stimulatory activity eluted around 54% column volume, corresponding to a molecular mass of a globular protein of approximately 300 kDa. Fraction III (1.5 mg of protein, 7 ml) was diluted 1:8 with buffer E to a final concentration of 10 mM ammonium sulfate in buffer E, and this solution was applied to a Mono Q 10/10 FPLC column (Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 10 to 300 mM ammonium sulfate in buffer E, and the peak of stimulatory activity eluted at about 70 mM ammonium sulfate (Fraction IV, 0.6 mg of protein, 3 ml). The protein solution was diluted 1:2 with buffer E and applied to 0.7 ml of Macro S (Bio-Rad) resin, packed into a 10/10 FPLC column (Pharmacia). Elution was performed at a 1 ml/min flow rate with a linear gradient of 50 to 500 mM ammonium sulfate in buffer E. The stimulatory activity eluted around 220 mM ammonium sulfate (Fraction V, 0.01 mg of protein, 1.4 ml). Fraction V was 2- to 4-fold concentrated by dialyzing against buffer E containing 60% glycerol and 50 mM ammonium sulfate. The final preparation was stored at −70°C for long term and at −20°C after the first thawing. It was stable at −20°C for a few weeks.Tabled 1 Gel electrophoresis of proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, measurements of protein concentration (Warburg and Christian, 1941; Bradford, 1976), and silver staining of protein gels have been described earlier (Jessberger et al., 1993). Nuclear extracts prepared from thymi of age-matched normal (CB.17 or C57Bl/6), SCID, and RAG-2-/- mice (see “Experimental Procedures”) were analyzed for their potential to mediate DNA transfer between recipient (pSV2neoΔ70) and donor ([3H]pSV2neo) DNA substrates in vitro. From each cell population, equal amounts of nuclear proteins were titrated into the assay, and the amount of 3H-labeled DNA recovered from each reaction was measured. In Fig. 1, the titration of each nuclear extract is shown versus its recombinational activity. The activity is expressed as percentage of input (total) counts/min, which is recovered with the recipient DNA on the beads. Both normal and RAG-2-/- thymus extracts show linear dose-response curves for the recombination activity (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, SCID-derived nuclear extracts did only weakly catalyze the reaction over the range of protein concentrations tested. The background in this assay was 0.1%3H counts/min (50-100 cpm). To control the functional (enzymatic) integrity of the protein preparations, the extracts were analyzed in DNA polymerase assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). All three extracts showed nearly identical levels of total DNA polymerase activity (0.33 ± 0.05 pmol incorporation of dNMP per 0.5 μg of protein extract). In addition, the DNA topoisomerase I and II activities were tested and found to be similar in all three extracts (data not shown). In addition, nuclease assays were performed and demonstrated very low double-strand endo- and exonuclease activities in the nuclear extracts described here (data not shown). Comparable assays have been carried out with all nuclear extracts described in this communication. The use of recipient DNA which had been linearized at the site of the deletion (pSV2neoΔ70-XhoI) did not yield significantly different results: 34% counts/min in normal and 5% counts/min in SCID extracts (1.2 μg of protein each) compared with 46% counts/min and 4.5% counts/min for circular substrates. Recipient DNA substrates with or without homology to the pSV2neo donor DNA were compared in the DTA using normal and SCID thymus extracts (Table 2). Two homologous (pSV2neoΔ70 and -Δ248) and three heterologous (RF form of M13mp10, φX174, and λ) recipient DNA substrates were used. Overall, wild-type extracts are on average 19-fold more active than SCID extracts. Both normal and SCID extracts showed a 2- to 3-fold preference for homologous DNA substrates.Tabled 1 The cytoplasmic fraction of the extracts was also tested for recombination activity but found inactive in every case. These results show a specific deficiency in recombination in the SCID thymus-derived cell extracts as determined by the DTA. In normal mice, the thymus consists to ~5% of CD4-CD8- (DN), ~80% of CD4+CD8+ (DP), ~10% of CD4+CD8- (SP), and ~5% of CD4-CD8+ (SP) thymocytes. Intrathymic development follows phenotypic changes from the most immature, T cell receptor (TCR)-/- DN stage through the TCR-/low DP stage, where thymocytes undergo repertoire selection, to the most mature, TCRhigh CD4 or CD8 SP stage. TCR gene rearrangements by V(D)J recombination are most active at the DN stage and continue into the DP stage. Mature SP cells cease to rearrange their antigen receptor genes. The expression of the RAG genes is regulated accordingly. Thymocytes in SCID mice, where V(D)J recombination can not be completed, and in RAG-2-/- mice, which maintain their DNA in germline configuration, are arrested at the TCR- DN stage in development (Kronenberg et al., 1986; Lieber et al., 1987). To analyze whether lymphocyte precursors undergoing V(D)J recombination simultaneously express elevated levels of strand transfer activity, nuclear extracts were prepared from purified TCR- (CD3-negative) DN, DP, and CD4 SP wild-type thymocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Subsequently, equal amounts of nuclear protein extracts, 0.1 μg each, were tested in the recombination reaction (Fig. 2). The most active extract was derived from DN cells, followed by the DP subset, while extracts prepared from the most mature SP cells showed the lowest activity. Data in Fig. 2 represent one of three experiments. Hence, there is a directly measurable DNA transfer activity in nuclear extracts with the highest levels at the earliest stage and decreasing activity with progression of development. However, SCID thymocytes, which are of the DN phenotype, did not yield any significant recombination activity (Fig. 1; Table 2). To determine whether the developmental regulation of DNA recombination activity, as detected for T cells, is also found during B cell development, various stages of B cell differentiation ex vivo or ex vitro were analyzed by DTA. Cells from the B lineage were sorted from wild-type (C57Bl/6) bone marrow according to the following cell surface phenotypes: 1, B220+, c-kit+, sIg-(pro); 2, B220+, c-kit-, sIg-(pre); 3, sIgM+, sIgD- (immature); and 4, sIgM+, sIgD+ (mature B cells) (for review, see Rolink and Melchers(1993)). Extracts from each stage of development were analyzed for their capacity to mediate cell-free DNA transfer. Analogous to the results obtained from thymocyte subsets (Fig. 2), the DNA recombination activity is most active in the earliest developmental stage, the proB cell population, and it decreases as B cells mature (Fig. 3). B cell development in both RAG-2-/- and SCID mice is arrested at the proB cell stage (B220+IgM-). To distinguish whether the observed DNA recombination activity in early B cell precursors is correlated with active V(D)J rearrangements or early development, and to look for a recombination defi"
