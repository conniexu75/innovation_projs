https://openalex.org/W2055620557,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a widely studied model of neuronal plasticity. The induction of LTP is known to require processes in the postsynaptic neuron, while experimental evidence suggests that the expression of LTP may occur in the presynaptic terminal. This has led to speculation that a retrograde messenger travels from the post- to the presynaptic cell during induction of LTP. Extracellular application or postsynaptic injection of two inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, N-nitro-L-arginine or NG-methyl-L-arginine, blocks LTP. Extracellular application of hemoglobin, which binds nitric oxide, also attenuates LTP. These findings suggest that nitric oxide liberated from postsynaptic neurons may travel back to presynaptic terminals to cause LTP expression."
https://openalex.org/W1994772282,"Binding of ligand or antibody to certain cell-surface proteins that are anchored to the membrane by glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) can cause activation of leukocytes. However, it is not known how these molecules, which lack intracellular domains, can transduce signals. The GPI-linked human molecules CD59, CD55, CD48, CD24, and CD14 as well as the mouse molecules Thy-1 and Ly-6 were found to associate with protein tyrosine kinases, key regulators of cell activation and signal transduction. A protein tyrosine kinase associated with the GPI-linked proteins CD59, CD55, and CD48 in human T cells, and with Thy-1 in mouse T cells was identified as p56lck, a protein tyrosine kinase related to Src. This interaction of GPI-linked molecules with protein tyrosine kinases suggests a potential mechanism of signal transduction in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2049151427,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium which grows in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. In murine systems CD8+ T lymphocytes have been shown to be important effectors of acquired protective immunity against L. monocytogenes. Class I MHC-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which lyse J774 macrophage-like targets infected with L. monocytogenes, are induced following in vivo injection of live organisms. Natural peptide epitopes derived from L. monocytogenes can be acid-extracted from heavily infected BALB/c spleens and detected by CTL. A CTL clone, B9, derived from a (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 (H-2dxb) mouse, recognizes one of these natural epitopes in an H-2Kd-restricted fashion. B9 also recognizes P815 (H-2d) mastocytoma cells transfected with the listeriolysin gene. To identify the region of the listeriolysin recognized by CTL we used the H-2Kd peptide-binding motif described by Rammensee and colleagues to synthesize 11 nonamer peptides. One of these peptides, listeriolysin 91-99, was recognized very efficiently by B9. This represents the first identified class I MHC-restricted epitope of bacteria and demonstrates the utility of the allele-specific motif for predicting CTL epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W1483990664,"The synthesis of nitric oxide (.NO) from L-arginine has been demonstrated in a number of cell types and functions either as a cell signaling agent or as a key component of the cell-mediated immune response. Both constitutive and inducible activities have been described. Herein we report the purification of inducible .NO synthase (EC 1.14.23) from activated murine macrophages using a two-column procedure. Crude 100,000 x g supernatant was passed through a 2'-5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B affinity column followed by a DEAE-Bio-Gel A anion exchange column. The .NO synthase ran as a band of Mr = 130,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration experiments using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column estimated the native molecular weight to be 260 +/- 30 kDa, indicating that the native enzyme exists as a dimer. Activity was dependent upon L-arginine (Km = 16 +/- 1 microM at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5) and NADPH. Both (6R)-tetrahydro-L-biopterin and FAD enhanced activity, whereas Mg2+ and FMN had no effect on activity. Fluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of one bound FAD and one bound FMN per subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2051804495,"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is characterized by skin blistering due to basal keratinocyte fragility. In one family studied, inheritance of EBS is linked to the gene encoding keratin 14, and a thymine to cytosine mutation in exon 6 of keratin 14 has introduced a proline in the middle of an alpha-helical region. In a second family, inheritance of EBS is linked to loci that map near the keratin 5 gene. These data indicate that abnormalities of either of the components of the keratin intermediate filament heterodipolymer can impair the mechanical stability of these epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047956182,"In Drosophila embryos, graded activity of the posterior determinant nanos (nos) generates abdominal segmentation by blocking protein expression from maternal transcripts of the hunchback (hb) gene. When active inappropriately at the anterior pole, nos can also block expression of the anterior determinant bicoid (bcd). We show that both regulatory interactions are mediated by similar sequences in the 3' untranslated region of each transcript. These nos response elements (NREs) are both necessary and sufficient to confer nos-dependent regulation, the degree of regulation determined by the number and quality of the elements and the level of nos in vivo. Based on these and other results, we argue that nos acts as a morphogen, controlling hb expression (and hence abdominal pattern) as a function of its concentration-dependent interaction with the NREs."
https://openalex.org/W2079790654,"Neurogenesis in Drosophila begins with the formation of neuronal precursors, which give rise to neurons of individual identity. To find out whether there are genes that are expressed in most or all neuronal precursors and are involved in controlling particular aspects of neuronal differentiation, we used the enhancer-trap method to screen for such “neuronal precursor genes.” One gene of this group is prospero. Our mutant analysis indicates that prospero regulates other neuronal precursor genes and is essential for the axonal outgrowth and pathfinding of numerous central and peripheral neurons. prospero encodes a large nuclear protein with multiple homopolymeric amino acid stretches and is expressed in neuronal precursors early during their formation. It is probably generally required for proper neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1579070247,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by a number of cells from a guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine by the action of either constitutive or inducible NO synthases, both of which form citrulline as a co-product. We have determined the source of the oxygen in both NO and in citrulline formed by the constitutive NO synthase from the vascular endothelium and brain and by the inducible NO synthase from the murine macrophage cell line J774. All these enzymes incorporate molecular oxygen both into NO and into citrulline. Furthermore, activated J774 cells form NO from omega-hydroxyl-L-arginine, confirming the proposal that this compound is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of NO."
https://openalex.org/W2041705218,"We identified a naturally occurring hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) variant, whose predicted sequence extends only through the second kringle domain of this plasminogen-related molecule. This smaller molecule, derived from an alternative HGF transcript, lacked mitogenic activity but specifically inhibited HGF-induced mitogenesis. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that the truncated molecule competes with HGF for binding to the HGF receptor, which has been identified as the c-met protooncogene product. Thus, the same gene encodes both a growth factor and its direct antagonist."

https://openalex.org/W1483740421,"Regulation of myelin basic protein (MBP) gene expression by thyroid hormone has been investigated in rodent brain. Quantitation of the 4 major alternatively spliced transcripts by RNase protection assay showed that the individual mRNAs, corresponding to MBP isoforms 21.5, 18.5, 17, and 14 kDa, were decreased from 2- to 17-fold at all ages studied (4-60 days) in hypothyroid animals when compared to euthyroid, but the timing of onset of expression was not altered. MBP mRNA was also reduced in young adult rats thyroidectomized at the age of 5-6 weeks and was restored to normal by thyroxine administration. Nuclear run-off assays showed that the rate of MBP gene transcription is dependent on thyroid state. Co-transfection of MBP (-256/+1)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric gene with a plasmid expressing thyroid hormone receptor alpha, and in the presence of 3,5,3‘-triiodothyronine, into NIH3T3 or NG108-15, increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression 4-fold. Using a footprinting technique and Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) nuclear extract infected with baculovirus expressing TR alpha, we have identified a single DNA-binding site (-186/-163) for the receptor. A part of this region contains the AGGACA sequence found in thyroid hormone-responsive elements of other 3,5,3‘-triiodothyronine-regulated genes. Our finding of a specific hormone-receptor interaction with the MBP promoter region is the first direct demonstration of a thyroid hormone-responsive element in a brain-specific gene."

https://openalex.org/W1579448734,"The roles of selected amino acid residues of human 14-kDa beta-galactoside-binding lectin were studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Ten mutant lectin proteins were produced, in each of which one of the residues regarded as possibly related to the stability of the lectin (6 cysteine residues) or one of those highly conserved in the vertebrate beta-galactoside-binding lectin family (Asn46, Trp68, Glu71, and Arg73), was substituted. All the mutant lectins in which one of the cysteine residues had been substituted with serine (C2S, C16S, C42S, C60S, C88S, and C130S) proved to have sugar binding ability comparable with that of the wild-type lectin. In addition, one of the mutants in which Cys2 was substituted (C2S) was found to have become considerably more stable under non-reducing conditions. It retained asialofetuin binding activity for over a week in the absence of beta-mercaptoethanol, while the wild-type lectin lost it within a day. This suggests that oxidation of Cys2 could be a key process in the inactivation of human 14-kDa lectin. Substitution of highly conservative Trp68 to tyrosine (W68Y) slightly reduced lactose binding ability, but the mutant was still adsorbed strongly on asialofetuin-agarose. Other mutant lectins in which conservative hydrophilic amino acids were substituted (N46D, E71Q, and R73H) failed to bind to the asialofetuin agarose, with no sign of retardation. Thus, conservative hydrophilic residues proved to be more important in carbohydrate recognition than the cysteine and tryptophan residues, contrary to the widely accepted concept that these latter residues are essential."
https://openalex.org/W1991630622,"Although multiple related genes encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits have been identified, how each of these subunits contributes to AChRs in neurons is not known. Sympathetic neurons express four classes of AChR channels and six AChR subunit genes (alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, alpha 7, beta 2, and beta 4). The contribution of individual subunits to AChR channel subtypes in these neurons was examined by selective deletion with antisense oligonucleotides. An alpha 3 antisense oligonucleotide decreased the number and altered the properties of the normally expressed ACh-activated channels. The remaining AChR channels have distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties that indicate an important functional contribution of the alpha 7 subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2017024770,"All of the ribose-phosphate linkages in yeast tRNA(Phe) that could be cleaved without affecting the folding of the molecule have been determined in a single experiment. Circular permutation analysis subjects circular tRNA molecules to limited alkaline hydrolysis in order to generate one random break per molecule. Correctly folded tRNAs were identified by lead cleavage at neutral pH, a well-characterized reaction that requires proper folding of tRNA(Phe). Surprisingly, most of the circularly permuted tRNA molecules folded correctly. This result suggests that the tRNA folding motif could occur internally within other RNA sequences, and a computer search of Genbank entries has identified many examples of such motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1560567906,"The binding of fibronectin (Fn) to several integrins involves the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence. However, linear synthetic RGD peptides do not completely mimic the cell attachment activity of intact Fn or certain large Fn fragments. This suggests that the integrin-Fn interaction involves a more extended surface of Fn than that provided by the RGD sequence. To test this possibility, three novel monoclonal anti-Fn antibodies that inhibit its binding to a purified integrin, alpha IIb beta 3, were developed. The epitopes of these three antibodies mapped to a region at least 55 residues amino-terminal of the RGD sequence. Further, recombinant fragments of Fn containing these epitopes and lacking the RGD site also inhibited the binding of Fn to purified alpha IIb beta 3. These fragments, which spanned Fn residues 1359-1436, bound to alpha IIb beta 3 in a divalent cation-dependent manner. In addition, this region of Fn bound specifically to alpha IIb beta 3 on thrombin-stimulated but not resting platelets. These results demonstrate the presence of additional sequences in Fn that interact with integrin alpha IIb beta 3 and suggest that multiple sites in Fn are involved in its recognition by this integrin."
https://openalex.org/W1528159645,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a potent mito-inhibiting substance that is thought to play an important function in regulating hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration. In this investigation, we have shown by immunohistochemistry that hepatocytes containing significant intracellular concentrations of TGF-beta 1 12 h after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy. This increase in hepatocyte TGF-beta 1 concentration was initially confined to those cells that resided in the periportal region of the liver. The elevation of intracellular TGF-beta 1 was, however, transient, and within 36 h, the hepatocytes positive for TGF-beta 1 had changed in a wavelike fashion from the periportal to the pericentral region of the liver lobules. By 48 h, most hepatocytes no longer contained TGF-beta 1. Interestingly, this temporary increase in TGF-beta 1 always preceded the onset of hepatocyte replication by approximately 3-6 h. Since TGF-beta 1 mRNA has been shown to be absent from hepatocytes normally and throughout liver regeneration, these results imply that the increase in intracellular TGF-beta 1 resulted from an augmented uptake. We have further shown that the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/Man-6-P) receptors were up-regulated during liver regeneration and that the increased expression of this receptor co-localized in those hepatocytes containing elevated concentrations of TGF-beta 1. The latent TGF-beta 1 phosphomannosyl glycoprotein complex has been shown to bind to the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor. Therefore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that this latent complex is internalized through the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor to the intracellular acidic prelysosomal/endosomal compartments where the mature TGF-beta 1 molecule could be activated by dissociation from the latent complex."
https://openalex.org/W1980771298,"We have generated a monoclonal antibody, termed 1E8, that is specific for myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells in mature chickens. 1E8 first stains cells at the edge of the neural crest; later, cells located between the neural tube and somites and in the sclerotome are immunopositive. Double labeling with HNK-1 indicates that these 1E8-positive cells represent a subset of neural crest cells in the ventral migratory pathways. 1E8-positive cells are later associated with the dorsal and ventral roots and with extending nerve trunks. In Western blots, 1E8 reacts with proteins comigrating with P0. Immunodepletion experiments establish that all P0 molecules carry the 1E8 determinant. The developmental distribution of P0, as determined by 1E8 immunoreactivity, differs from that reported for P0 in mammals and suggests that, in chicken, P0 is an early marker for the Schwann cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2016553217,"The protein tyrosine kinase activity of the cellular Src protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 527 (Tyr527). It has not been established whether this regulatory modification of Src is mediated by autophosphorylation or by another cellular protein kinase. The phosphorylation of a modified form of c-Src that lacks kinase activity was examined in mouse cells that do not express endogenous Src (because of the targeted disruption of both src alleles). Phosphorylation of the inactive form of Src on Tyr527 occurred to a similar extent in cells lacking endogenous Src as it did in cells expressing Src. Therefore, Tyr527 phosphorylation, and thus negative control of Src kinase activity, is mediated by another cellular protein tyrosine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1510408074,"It has been widely assumed that the interaction of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) with its serum-binding protein, alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), mediates the rapid clearance of TGF-beta 1 from the circulation. To test this, we have analyzed the effect of TGF-beta 1 binding on the conformational state of alpha 2M. Our results demonstrate that the binding of TGF-beta 1 to alpha 2M does not lead to the conformational change in the alpha 2M molecule that is required for the clearance of the alpha 2M.TGF-beta 1 complex via the alpha 2M receptor. Furthermore, endogenous TGF-beta 1 is associated with the conformationally unaltered slow clearance form of alpha 2M. Clearance studies in mice show that the half-life of 125I-TGF-beta 1 in the circulation (1.6 +/- 0.71 min) is not affected by blocking the alpha 2M receptor with excess conformationally altered alpha 2M. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is rapidly cleared from the circulation after injection by a pathway not involving alpha 2M."
https://openalex.org/W1998393951,"The pancreas-specific transcription factor PTF1 is a heterooligomer that exists as two variants, alpha and beta, both of which bind DNA. The nucleus contains exclusively alpha while the cytoplasm contains both forms. Alpha and beta differ in protein composition. Reconstitution of alpha in vitro requires, in addition to the DNA-binding subunits common to both forms, a 75 kd glycosylated protein that apparently does not bind DNA. Here we show that this protein is essential for targeting PTF1 to the nucleus. Upon injection into frog oocytes, alpha is translocated quantitatively to the nucleus while beta remains in the cytoplasm. However, if beta is coinjected with purified 75 kd protein or a particular size fraction of pancreatic mRNA, it can be converted to alpha and imported into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1501486266,"GMP-140, a receptor for myeloid cells that is expressed on surfaces of thrombin-activated platelets and endothelial cells, is a member of the selectin family of adhesion molecules that regulate leukocyte interactions with the blood vessel wall. Each selectin contains an N-terminal domain homologous to Ca(2+)-dependent lectins and mediates cell-cell contact by binding to oligosaccharide ligands in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The mechanisms by which Ca2+ promotes selectin-dependent cellular interactions have not been defined. We demonstrate that purified GMP-140 contains two high affinity binding sites for Ca2+ as measured by equilibrium dialysis (Kd = 22 +/- 2 microM). Occupancy of these sites by Ca2+ alters the conformation of the protein as detected by a reduction in intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity (Kd = 4.8 +/- 0.2 microM). This Ca(2+)-dependent conformational change exposes an epitope spanning residues 19-34 of the lectin domain that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody capable of blocking neutrophil adhesion to GMP-140 (half-maximal antibody binding at approximately 20 microM Ca2+). Furthermore, a synthetic peptide encoding this epitope, CQNRYTDLVAIQNKNE, inhibits neutrophil binding to GMP-140. Mg2+ also alters the conformation of the protein, but not in a manner that will support leukocyte recognition in the absence of Ca2+. There is a strong correlation between the Ca2+ levels required for neutrophil adhesion to GMP-140, for occupancy of the two Ca(2+)-binding sites, for the fluorescence-detected conformational change, and for exposure of the antibody epitope in the lectin domain. We conclude that binding of Ca2+ to high affinity sites on GMP-140 modulates the conformation of the lectin domain in a manner that is essential for leukocyte recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1564714436,"Studies of cGMP binding to both the native cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase and to two unique isolated chymotryptic fragments lacking the catalytic domain suggest that the enzyme contains two noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites/homodimer. In the presence of high concentrations of ammonium sulfate, 2 mol of cGMP are bound/mol of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase homodimer. Under these conditions, linear Scatchard plots of binding are obtained that give an apparent Kd of approximately 2 microM. The inclusion of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine produces a curvilinear plot. In the absence of ammonium sulfate, the dissociation of cGMP from the holoenzyme is rapid, having a t1/2 of less than 10 s, and addition of ammonium sulfate to the incubation greatly decreases this rate of dissociation. The native enzyme is resistant to degradation by chymotrypsin in the absence of cGMP; however, in its presence, chymotrypsin treatment produces several discrete fragments. Similarly, in the presence but not in the absence of cGMP, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide causes an irreversible activation of the enzyme without cross-linking the nucleotide to the phosphodiesterase. Both observations provide evidence that a different conformation in the enzyme results from cGMP binding. Only the conformation formed upon cGMP binding is easily attacked by chymotrypsin or permanently activated by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. One major chymotryptic cleavage site exposed by cGMP binding is at tyrosine 553, implying that this region takes part in the conformational change. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that these noncatalytic binding sites are located within a region of internal sequence homology previously proposed to include the cGMP-binding site(s) and that they retain a high affinity and specificity for cGMP independent of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The products formed by partial proteolysis can be separated into individual catalytically active and cGMP-binding fractions by anion exchange chromatography. Gel filtration and electrophoresis analysis of the isolated fractions suggest that the cGMP-binding peak has a dimeric structure. Moreover, it can be further resolved by polyethyleneimine high performance liquid chromatography into two peaks (Peaks IIIA and IIIB). Peak IIIA binds 2 mol of cGMP/mol of dimer with an apparent Kd of 0.2 microM. Peak IIIB, however, has greatly reduced cGMP binding. Further digestion of these fragments with cyanogen bromide show that the differences between Peaks IIIA and IIIB are due to one or more additional proteolytic nicks in IIIB that remove a few residues near its C terminus, most probably residues 523-550 or 534-550. This in turn suggests that this region is essential for cGMP-binding activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

(Edde, B., Rossier, J., Le Caer, J. P., Desbruyeres, E., Gros, F., and Denoulet, P. (1990) Science 247, 83-85), consists of the successive addition of glutamyl units to the Glu445. To characterize their linkage mode mouse tubulin was posttranslationally labeled with [3H]glutamate. After digestion of [3H]tubulin with thermolysin, up to eight radioactive peaks were separated on an anion exchange column (DEAE). Combined use of Edman degradation sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of the first 6 one indicated that they all correspond to the same COOH-terminal sequence 440VEGEGEEEGEE450 bearing one to six glutamyl units on the Glu445. The first glutamyl residue is amide-linked to the gamma-carboxyl group of Glu445, but the additional residues can be linked to the gamma- or alpha-carboxyl groups of the preceding one. All possible linkages for the biglutamylated tubulin peptides (gamma 1 alpha 2, gamma 1 gamma 2) and triglutamylated (gamma 1 alpha 2 alpha 3, gamma 1 alpha 2 gamma 3, gamma 1 alpha 2 gamma 2, gamma 1 gamma 2 alpha 3, gamma 1 gamma 2 gamma 3) were synthesized. These different peptides were successfully separated on a C18 5-micron reverse phase column. We found that the bi- and triglutamylated tubulin peptides behave as the gamma 1 alpha 2 and gamma 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 synthetic peptides, respectively. These results indicate that the second and third glutamyl residues of the polyglutamyl side chain are amide-linked to the alpha-carboxyl group of the preceding unit."

The enzyme, peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase or peptide:N-glycosidase (PNGase), was partially (2090-fold) purified, and the reaction site at which this enzyme acts was specified by analysis and identification of the reaction products. This is the first demonstration showing PNGase in animal sources, although the presence of PNGases was reported in a variety of plant extracts and bacteria. Thus, the commonality of this type of enzyme is now demonstrated, and the possible physiological role of PNGase in de-N-glycosylation as a basic biologic process is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1596599336,"The major soluble protein in the lenses of most birds and reptiles is delta-crystallin. In chickens and ducks the delta-crystallin gene has duplicated, and in the duck both genes contribute to the protein in the lens, while in the chicken lens there is a great preponderance of the delta 1 gene product. Purified delta-crystallin has previously been shown to possess the enzymatic activity of argininosuccinate lyase. In order to determine the enzymatic properties of the two duck delta-crystallins their corresponding cDNA molecules were placed in yeast and bacterial expression plasmids. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of each crystallin was assessed by transformation of the expression plasmids into a strain deficient for argininosuccinate lyase activity. The ability of the resulting yeast to grow on arginine deficient medium was used as a measure of enzymatic activity. Yeast expressing the duck delta 2-crystallin protein grew rapidly, while those expressing delta 1-crystallin failed to grow. Enzyme activity measurements confirmed the presence of activity in the delta 2-crystallin-expressing yeast, and no detectable activity could be demonstrated in the delta 1-crystallin-expressing yeast. Northern blotting of RNA from the transformed yeast revealed equal levels of mRNA species from the two constructs. For further analysis, the delta 2-crystallin cDNA was placed in the bacterial expression plasmid, pET-3d. The delta 2-crystallin protein produced in Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity and analyzed to determine the kinetic properties. A Km of 0.35 mM was determined for argininosuccinate and a Vm of 3.5 mumols/min/mg was determined. These data demonstrate that, following duplication of the primordial argininosuccinate lyase gene, one of the genes maintained its role as an enzyme (delta 2-crystallin) while also serving as a crystallin and the other has evolved to specialize as a structural protein in the lens (delta 1-crystallin), presumably losing most or all of its catalytic capacity."

Because this induction occurs after a time lag of several hours and is blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, it exemplifies a delayed secondary response to steroid hormones. In this report, we show that a region of RUG-transcribed DNA (approximately +1800 to +2174) contains multiple footprint sites for glucocorticoid receptor that are, apparently, organized into at least three independent binding clusters. The DNA sequences bound by the receptor and the location of binding sites were determined. A family of sequences related to half-sites of the consensus primary glucocorticoid response element (GRE) is discernible at each cluster of sites. Compared to the consensus GRE, which contains two pseudo-palindromic hexanucleotides arranged in a tail-to-tail fashion and separated by three bases, the arrangements of hexanucleotides within this segment of RUG DNA are unusual and heterogeneous. Methylation interference of a binding cluster containing three receptor footprints demonstrates that certain guanines of the GRE-like hexanucleotides are essential for efficient receptor binding. A synthetic 29-base pair (bp) RUG element, containing one receptor footprint from this cluster, selectively binds the receptor. Within this 29-bp element, six nucleotides separate two directly repeated copies of GRE-like hexanucleotides. RUG DNA fragments containing all or part of the three binding clusters, including the 29-bp element, confer a delayed secondary hormone responsiveness upon a linked heterologous promoter and reporter gene in stably transfected cell lines. We speculate that the unusual DNA sequence motifs of the receptor-binding sites are crucial for the generation of certain delayed secondary responses."
https://openalex.org/W1510644600,"Escherichia coli endonuclease IV and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Apn1, two DNA repair enzymes for free radical damages, were previously shown to be inactivated by metal-chelating agents. In the present study, atomic absorption spectrometry of endonuclease IV revealed the presence of 2.4 zinc and 0.7 manganese atoms, whereas Apn1 contained 3.3 zinc atoms and no significant manganese. EDTA-inactivated endonuclease IV retained 0.7 zinc atom but little detectable manganese. ZnCl2 reactivated 1,10-phenanthroline-treated Apn1, but was ineffective with endonuclease IV treated with either 1,10-phenanthroline or EDTA. In contrast, enzymatic activity was restored to both enzymes after EDTA treatment by incubation with CoCl2 and to a lesser extent by MnCl2. Endonuclease IV, reactivated with CoCl2 or MnCl2, regained all of the activities characteristic of the native enzyme. MnCl2 was as effective as CoCl2 at restoring activity to the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzymes. The results indicate that intrinsic metals play critical roles in both endonuclease IV and Apn1 and that manganese may perform a special function in endonuclease IV. Possible mechanistic roles for the metals in these DNA repair enzymes are discussed."

The protein folds into its native state at temperatures up to 30 degrees C without polyanions with an activation energy of approximately 14 kcal/mol, but does not acquire native structure above this temperature. When heparin, inositol hexasulfate, or sulfate ion are present, aFGF refolds below 30 degrees C with a slightly reduced activation energy (10-11 kcal/mol). In addition, the protein now also renatures between 30 and 50 degrees C with activation energies of 1-2 (heparin), 16 (inositol hexasulfate), and 7 (sulfate) kcal/mol. Trace heavy metals appear to inhibit the refolding process, but a molecular chaperone (bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein) and a peptidylprolyl isomerase (the FK506-binding protein) have no effect. It is concluded that the rate of refolding of aFGF at physiological temperatures is probably controlled by the interaction of a native-like state of the protein with an unknown polyanionic species."
https://openalex.org/W1599126682,"In humans, the H1 RNA, the RNA subunit of RNase P, is synthesized by RNA polymerase III. We have used block replacement mutagenesis to identify the sequences necessary for in vitro transcription of H1 RNA. We find that multiple cis-acting elements located in the H1 RNA 5'-flanking region are necessary for H1 RNA synthesis; no internal sequences are essential. Required cis-acting elements include sequences resembling proximal sequence element, distal sequence element, and TATA motifs. In this respect, the H1 RNA promoter is similar in structure to the promoters of the genes encoding the U6 snRNA, the 7 SK RNA and the MRP RNA. However, our mutational analysis indicates that the H1 promoter is unexpectedly complex, with several additional cis-acting elements spanning nearly 70 base pairs of the H1 RNA gene 5'-flanking sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1509482268,"Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is being used successfully to treat various forms of neutropenia. To define functionally important regions of G-CSF, we have prepared 37 monoclonal anti-G-CSF antibodies and mapped the regions of G-CSF recognized by different antibody groups. Antibodies recognizing similar epitopes were identified by competition assays, neutralization assays, conformation dependence and cross-reactivity with canine G-CSF. Seven of eight neutralizing antibodies fell into two related epitope groups and were conformation-dependent. The eighth was unrelated and conformation-independent. Peptides of G-CSF were generated by chemical or enzymatic digestion and tested for antibody reactivity. One of the neutralizing antibodies (LMM351) recognized a small, disulfide-bonded peptide from the V8 protease digest (residues 34-46). A synthetic peptide (residues 20-58) was recognized by all the neutralizing antibodies, implicating this disulfide-bonded loop in receptor binding. The epitopes recognized by nonneutralizing antibodies were found throughout G-CSF. Thus, regions of G-CSF that are not involved in receptor binding have also been defined. A CNBr peptide (residues 1-121) had greatly reduced biological activity, indicating that the COOH terminus is required for receptor binding. We predict that residues 20-46 and the COOH terminus bind to the G-CSF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1511994212,"Abstract In order to understand further the autogenous regulation of Escherichia coli secA translation, we have set up a purified system to study the binding of SecA protein to portions of its mRNA. Specific SecA protein-RNA binding was demonstrated by UV cross-linking, filter binding, and gel shift assays. Use of the filter binding assay allowed optimization of binding, which was influenced by Mg2+ and ATP concentrations, and a measurement of the affinity of this interaction. A nested series of RNAs lacking either 5' or 3' portions of geneX-secA sequences were used to localize the SecA protein binding site to sequences around the geneX-secA intergenic region. These studies imply that SecA protein directly regulates its own translation by a specific RNA binding activity that presumably blocks translational initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1575072417,"Changes in the expression of several genes play critical roles in cell growth and tumor transformation. A number of proteases are increased in some tumors, and the level of these enzymes correlates with the metastatic potential of several cancer cell lines. Stromelysin, with the widest substrate specificity, can degrade the extracellular matrix conferring metastatic potential to tumor cells. The mechanisms whereby growth factors and oncogenes control the expression of stromelysin are beginning to be characterized. In the study shown here we also identify a region in the stromelysin promoter which is involved in the induction of stromelysin in response to platelet-derived growth factor, phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C, and ras oncogene. Our results are consistent with the notion that platelet-derived growth factor/phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C induces stromelysin gene expression through a phorbol myristate acetate/protein kinase C-independent mechanism by acting through elements in the stromelysin promoter distinct from the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element."
https://openalex.org/W1584412432,"Metal chelate affinity chromatography has been used to follow reconstitution of the 66- and 51-kDa human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) subunits into heterodimer, as well as chimeric enzymes comprised of heterologous subunits. By adding a small N-terminal polyhistidine extension to the 51-kDa subunit of either enzyme, reconstituted RT could be recovered from a cell lysate by chromatography on Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose. Homologous RT subunits rapidly associated to form the respective heterodimers (1-p66.1-p51 and 2-p66.2-p51) when bacterial lysates containing the individual components were mixed. Under the same conditions, association of p66 HIV-2 and p51 HIV-1 RT was inefficient and could be improved slightly by prolonged incubation of the respective p66 and p51 subunits. In contrast, HIV-1 p66 RT rapidly associated with the 51-kDa subunit of the HIV-2 enzyme. RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was associated with all reconstituted enzymes, and the response of each chimeric RT to an inhibitor selective for the HIV-1 enzyme indicated that sensitivity to inhibition was determined by the source of its 66-kDa subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1568228057,"Dynamic video-imaging microscopy was used to investigate the spatial and temporal nature of Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ influx in acutely dissociated, fura-2-loaded, rat gonadotropes. Addition of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) to an isolated gonadotrope stimulated a wave of Ca2+ originating from a specific locus of the cell. This probably reflects Ca2+ mobilization from an intracellular store, since this response was unaffected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Application of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 (Bay K) stimulated a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in the rat gonadotrope. This response was blocked by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ and probably reflects the influx of Ca2+ across the cell membrane. High speed (30 frames.s-1) imaging of the Bay K-induced Ca2+ influx revealed a wave of Ca2+ originating from a localized part of the cell membrane, which, in general, was spatially distinct from the LHRH-induced Ca2+ wave produced in the same cell. This suggests that Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane may be clustered in a specific area of the cell membrane. The velocity of the LHRH-induced Ca2+ mobilization wave was faster (mean = 79 +/- 5 microns.s-1, n = 9) than the Bay K-induced Ca2+ influx wave (39 +/- 7 microns.s-1, n = 9) (p less than or equal to 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test) measured in the same cells. Thus, both Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx through the cell membrane appear to be spatially localized in the rat gonadotrope. These findings may have important implications in the intracellular regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent cell functions such as hormone biosynthesis and secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1684433692,"Four murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with distinctive regions of the hexose core domain of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were generated and their epitope specificities were delineated. MAST 56 (IgG1) and MAST 50 (IgG3) antibodies elicited by immunizations with Salmonella typhimurium Rb1 and Rb2 mutants, reacted selectively in enzyme immunoassay with the LPS from rough mutants. In contrast, MATy 1 (IgM) and MATy 2 (IgG2b) antibodies raised by an attenuated Salmonella typhi 620 Ty strain were reactive with LPS from both smooth and rough Salmonellae. Immunoblotting analysis showed that MATy 1 distinguished only the bottom bands (naked LPS core) among the heterogeneous LPS populations, whereas MATy 2 gave a ladder pattern (reactive with both naked and O-chain-substituted LPS cores). Differential binding specificities of MATy 1 and MATy 2 antibodies to the naked and capped LPS cores were further analyzed utilizing S. typhimurium polysaccharide fractions with different O-chain:core ratios which were obtained after separation by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Steric effects on the antibody reactivity by the bulky O-polysaccharide chain were detected. The use of chemically defined native and synthetic saccharides as inhibitors, in combination with the conformation of the Salmonella core oligosaccharide, permitted the definition of antigenic determinants carried in the core domain recognized by each antibody: (i) the branches I and VIII are essential for MATy 1 recognition, (ii) the backbone III-IV-V for MATy 2, (iii) the backbone II-III-IV-V for MAST 56, and (iv) the backbone plus the branch III-IV-V-VIII for MAST 50.

https://openalex.org/W1575037296,"Abstract Octamer sequence elements were analyzed for their capacity to induce the 7S K core promoter in vivo. The U6 distal sequence element (DSE) which contains a consensus sequence octamer, was able to support efficient 7S K expression in vivo. In contrast, no such function could be attributed to the octamer-like element alone, which is present within the 7S K DSE. However, conversion of this octamer-like element (ATTTaGCAT) to the octamer consensus sequence ATTTGCAT generated a potent DSE, even in the absence of the CACCC box, which constitutes the major functional element of the 7S K DSE. Both the consensus and the octamer-like sequences revealed no cooperativity with the CACCC box. Together, these results demonstrate that the octamer-like element of the wild-type 7S K DSE is definitely not functional in vivo. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that in contrast to the RNA polymerase II-transcribed small nuclear RNA genes, in intact cells a single functional DSE motif is necessary and sufficient for maximal transcription by RNA polymerase III of the 7S K RNA gene."
