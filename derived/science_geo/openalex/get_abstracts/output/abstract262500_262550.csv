https://openalex.org/W2070184849,"Primary cilia are essential for transduction of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal in mammals. We investigated the role of primary cilia in regulation of Patched1 (Ptc1), the receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Ptc1 localized to cilia and inhibited Smoothened (Smo) by preventing its accumulation within cilia. When Shh bound to Ptc1, Ptc1 left the cilia, leading to accumulation of Smo and activation of signaling. Thus, primary cilia sense Shh and transduce signals that play critical roles in development, carcinogenesis, and stem cell function."

We demonstrate a colloidal route to synthesizing CdS-Ag 2 S nanorod superlattices through partial cation exchange. Strain induces the spontaneous formation of periodic structures. Ab initio calculations of the interfacial energy and modeling of strain energies show that these forces drive the self-organization of the superlattices. The nanorod superlattices exhibit high stability against ripening and phase mixing. These materials are tunable near-infrared emitters with potential applications as nanometer-scale optoelectronic devices."

To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in Arabidopsis thaliana , we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and ∼4% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in A. thaliana ."
https://openalex.org/W2063317473,"Virally encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been discovered in herpesviruses. However, their biological roles are mostly unknown. We developed an algorithm for the prediction of miRNA targets and applied it to human cytomegalovirus miRNAs, resulting in the identification of the major histocompatibility complex class I–related chain B (MICB) gene as a top candidate target of hcmv-miR-UL112. MICB is a stress-induced ligand of the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor NKG2D and is critical for the NK cell killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. We show that hcmv-miR-UL112 specifically down-regulates MICB expression during viral infection, leading to decreased binding of NKG2D and reduced killing by NK cells. Our results reveal a miRNA-based immunoevasion mechanism that appears to be exploited by human cytomegalovirus."

https://openalex.org/W2055708395,"Reduced insulin-like signaling extends the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila . Here, we show that, in mice, less insulin receptor substrate–2 (Irs2) signaling throughout the body or just in the brain extended life span up to 18%. At 22 months of age, brain-specific Irs2 knockout mice were overweight, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant; however, compared with control mice, they were more active and displayed greater glucose oxidation, and during meals they displayed stable superoxide dismutase–2 concentrations in the hypothalamus. Thus, less Irs2 signaling in aging brains can promote healthy metabolism, attenuate meal-induced oxidative stress, and extend the life span of overweight and insulin-resistant mice."
https://openalex.org/W2156093768,"Honey bee queens mate with many males, creating numerous patrilines within colonies that are genetically distinct. The effects of genetic diversity on colony productivity and long-term fitness are unknown. We show that swarms from genetically diverse colonies (15 patrilines per colony) founded new colonies faster than swarms from genetically uniform colonies (1 patriline per colony). Accumulated differences in foraging rates, food storage, and population growth led to impressive boosts in the fitness (i.e., drone production and winter survival) of genetically diverse colonies. These results further our understanding of the origins of polyandry in honey bees and its benefits for colony performance."

https://openalex.org/W1985446591,"PDZ domains have long been thought to cluster into discrete functional classes defined by their peptide-binding preferences. We used protein microarrays and quantitative fluorescence polarization to characterize the binding selectivity of 157 mouse PDZ domains with respect to 217 genome-encoded peptides. We then trained a multidomain selectivity model to predict PDZ domain-peptide interactions across the mouse proteome with an accuracy that exceeds many large-scale, experimental investigations of protein-protein interactions. Contrary to the current paradigm, PDZ domains do not fall into discrete classes; instead, they are evenly distributed throughout selectivity space, which suggests that they have been optimized across the proteome to minimize cross-reactivity. We predict that focusing on families of interaction domains, which facilitates the integration of experimentation and modeling, will play an increasingly important role in future investigations of protein function."

https://openalex.org/W1971817019,"Oligodendrocytes myelinate axons for rapid impulse conduction and contribute to normal axonal functions in the central nervous system. In multiple sclerosis, demyelination is caused by autoimmune attacks, but the role of oligodendroglial cells in disease progression and axon degeneration is unclear. Here we show that oligodendrocytes harbor peroxisomes whose function is essential for maintaining white matter tracts throughout adult life. By selectively inactivating the import factor PEX5 in myelinating glia, we generated mutant mice that developed normally, but within several months showed ataxia, tremor and premature death. Absence of functional peroxisomes from oligodendrocytes caused widespread axonal degeneration and progressive subcortical demyelination, but did not interfere with glial survival. Moreover, it caused a strong proinflammatory milieu and, unexpectedly, the infiltration of B and activated CD8+ T cells into brain lesions. We conclude that peroxisomes provide oligodendrocytes with an essential neuroprotective function against axon degeneration and neuroinflammation, which is relevant for human demyelinating diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2100989243,"Halogens influence the oxidizing capacity of Earth's troposphere, and iodine oxides form ultrafine aerosols, which may have an impact on climate. We report year-round measurements of boundary layer iodine oxide and bromine oxide at the near-coastal site of Halley Station, Antarctica. Surprisingly, both species are present throughout the sunlit period and exhibit similar seasonal cycles and concentrations. The springtime peak of iodine oxide (20 parts per trillion) is the highest concentration recorded anywhere in the atmosphere. These levels of halogens cause substantial ozone depletion, as well as the rapid oxidation of dimethyl sulfide and mercury in the Antarctic boundary layer."
https://openalex.org/W1970701525,"The serine/threonine kinase human Pim1 (hereafter PIM1) cooperates with human c-Myc (hereafter MYC) in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. However, the nature of this cooperation is still unknown. Here we show that, after stimulation with growth factor, PIM1 forms a complex with the dimer of MYC with MAX (Myc-associated factor X) via the MYC BoxII (MBII) domain. MYC recruits PIM1 to the E boxes of the MYC-target genes FOSL1 (FRA-1) and ID2, and PIM1 phosphorylates serine 10 of histone H3 (H3S10) on the nucleosome at the MYC-binding sites, contributing to their transcriptional activation. MYC and PIM1 colocalize at sites of active transcription, and expression profile analysis revealed that PIM1 contributes to the regulation of 20% of the MYC-regulated genes. Moreover, PIM1-dependent H3S10 phosphorylation contributes to MYC transforming capacity. These results establish a new function for PIM1 as a MYC cofactor that phosphorylates the chromatin at MYC-target loci and suggest that nucleosome phosphorylation, at E boxes, contributes to MYC-dependent transcriptional activation and cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2056991518,"It has generally been thought that the first dinosaurs quickly replaced more archaic Late Triassic faunas, either by outcompeting them or when the more archaic faunas suddenly became extinct. Fossils from the Hayden Quarry, in the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation of New Mexico, and an analysis of other regional Upper Triassic assemblages instead imply that the transition was gradual. Some dinosaur relatives preserved in this Chinle assemblage belong to groups previously known only from the Middle and lowermost Upper Triassic outside North America. Thus, the transition may have extended for 15 to 20 million years and was probably diachronous at different paleolatitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2009193365,"The high crystallinity of many inorganic materials allows their band structures to be determined through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Similar studies of conjugated organic molecules of interest in optoelectronics are often hampered by difficulties in growing well-ordered and well-oriented crystals or films. We have grown crystalline films of uniaxially oriented sexiphenyl molecules and obtained ARPES data. Supported by density-functional calculations, we show that, in the direction parallel to the principal molecular axis, a quasi-one-dimensional band structure of a system of well-defined finite size develops out of individual molecular orbitals. In contrast, perpendicular to the molecules, the band structure reflects the periodicity of the molecular crystal, and continuous bands with a large dispersion were observed."

https://openalex.org/W2034038074,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that long term treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, decreases the risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD). However, statin-mediated AD protection cannot be fully explained by reduction of cholesterol levels. In addition to their cholesterol lowering effects, statins have pleiotropic actions and act to lower the concentrations of isoprenoid intermediates, such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. The Rho and Rab family small G-proteins require addition of these isoprenyl moieties at their C termini for normal GTPase function. In neuroblastoma cell lines, treatment with statins inhibits the membrane localization of Rho and Rab proteins at statin doses as low as 200 nm, without affecting cellular cholesterol levels. In addition, we show for the first time that at low, physiologically relevant, doses statins preferentially inhibit the isoprenylation of a subset of GTPases. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically cleaved to generate β-amyloid (Aβ), which is the major component of senile plaques found in AD. We show that inhibition of protein isoprenylation by statins causes the accumulation of APP within the cell through inhibition of Rab family proteins involved in vesicular trafficking. Moreover, inhibition of Rho family protein function reduces levels of APP C-terminal fragments due to enhanced lysosomal dependent degradation. Statin inhibition of protein isoprenylation results in decreased Aβ secretion. In summary, we show that statins selectively inhibit GTPase isoprenylation at clinically relevant doses, leading to reduced Aβ production in an isoprenoid-dependent manner.

Nascent APP is trafficked via the common secretory pathway and undergoes post-translational modifications including N- and O-glycosylation. Following delivery to the cell surface, APP is trafficked to late endosomes, and either recycled to the cell surface or degraded within the lysosome. APP is cleaved by the β-or α-secretase to generate either a C99 or C83 C-terminal fragment (CTF), respectively. γ-Secretase cleaves the C99 CTF to form Aβ, whereas cleavage of C83 results in the production of a non-amyloidgenic p3 fragment. β- and γ-secretase complexes are found in multiple cellular compartments including the endoplasmic reticulum, late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and plasma membrane, although there is significant debate with regard to the magnitude of APP processing within individual subcellular compartments and their quantitative contribution to Aβ production (5Kim S.H.

Importantly, we show that while at high doses statins universally impair GTPase function, at low doses statins preferentially impair the isoprenylation and membrane localization of only a subset of GTPases. These GTPases may represent specific, clinically relevant targets of statin action. We also show that statins impact APP metabolism through Rab- and Rho-dependent mechanisms, leading to reduced Aβ production. In summary, we show that statins can selectively inhibit the isoprenylation of GTPases at physiologically relevant doses, and suggest that statins may act by cholesterol-independent mechanisms to lower Aβ production and limit AD pathogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—Simvastatin and lovastatin were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. The statins were converted to the active form by dissolving them in absolute EtOH, followed by the addition of 1 m NaOH to a final concentration of 100 mm. This solution was stored at–20 °C until use. Immediately before use, the statin solution was neutralized with 1 m HCl, and diluted in vehicle (50% EtOH, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate triammonium salt and farnesyl pyrophosphate triammonium salt were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mevalonic acid was purchased from Sigma and reconstituted in 100% ethanol. Clostridium difficile Toxin A was purchased from List Labs (Campbell, CA). Cell-permeable C3 exoenzyme was obtained from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay kit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies to APP (22c11) and the APP C-terminal fragment were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Antibodies to Rac and Rab4 were obtained from Upstate (Waltham, MA).

Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.Cell Culture—Mouse N2a (parental) neuroblastoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). N2a.Swe cells were obtained from Dr. Gopal Thinakaran (University of Chicago). APPsw-293 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Vassar (Northwestern University). N2a and APPsw-293 cells were cultured in 50% Opti-MEM, 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.H4.APPWT and H4.HPLAP neuroglioma cells were maintained in Opti-MEM plus 4% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% Zeocin. H4.APPWT cells overexpress wild type human APP under an actin promoter (45Murphy M.P. Uljon S.N. Fraser P.E. Fauq A. Lookingbill H.A. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Lewis P.A. McLendon D.C. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26277-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). H4.HPLAP express endogenous levels of APP, but overexpress the human APP C-terminal fragment fused to human placental alkaline phosphatase. All cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Neuron Culture—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15–16 C57BL/6 mouse embryos as described (50Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, embryo cortices were dissected, and meninges were removed. Tissue was digested, mechanically dissociated, and suspended in neurobasal medium (B27 supplement, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 25 μm glutamate), and plated densely onto poly-d-lysinecoated 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well). Neurons were maintained under serum-free conditions in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement prior to drug treatment.Drug Treatments—Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates, and allowed to grow for 1 (for 48 h treatment) or 2 days (for 12–24 h treatment) before drug treatment. H4 cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 6-well plates. Cells were then treated with the indicated compounds for 12–48 h.Western Blotting—Cells were collected and lysed with radio-immuno precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were sonicated for 2 × 10 s on ice and cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213161) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled under reducing conditions then resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels or NuPage 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking in a 5% milk or 5% normal goat serum solution, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Bands were visualized by incubation of blots with anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; 90 min at room temperature) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Protein loading was evaluated by probing with anti-ERK2 (1:3000) or anti-GAPDH (1:5000) antibodies. Images were scanned using Adobe Photoshop and band intensities quantified using Image-Pro Plus software package (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Springs, MD). Band densities were normalized for protein loading by comparison with ERK2 or GAPDH band densities. Mean ± S.E. were calculated. Pairwise comparisons were determined using the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test.Quantification of Secreted Aβ Peptide Levels by ELISA—Following drug treatments, the culture medium was collected, a protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride was added, and medium was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Media from H4.APPWT cells were diluted 1:5 and assayed by ELISA specific for Aβ1–40 from BIOSOURCE/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). H4.APPWT cells do not produce detectable levels of Aβ1–42.Membrane Localization and Western Blotting for GTPases— N2a cells were plated into 6-well plates and 24 h later were treated with simvastatin for 24 or 48 h. Cellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (47Zhao X. Bey E.A. Wientjes F.B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25385-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, following statin treatment the cells were lysed by incubation in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3) on ice for 15 min followed by a 10-s sonication. Cells were cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman-Coulter ultracentrifuge (SW50.1 rotor). The resulting supernatant was removed (cytosolic fraction), and the membrane pellet was then resuspended in relaxation buffer (membrane fraction). The protein concentration from each fraction was measured using the BCA protein assay from Pierce. Standard Western blotting procedures were used to separate the fractions and transfer them to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies for the individual GTPases, as well as markers for cytosolic (GAPDH, ERK2) and membrane (flotillin, calnexin) fractions.RESULTSSelective Effects of Statin Treatment on G-protein Isoprenylation and Abundance—We investigated whether statins act uniformly to inhibit the isoprenylation of members of the Rho and Rab families of G-proteins in N2a neuroblastoma cells. We initially monitored statin-mediated effects by decreased electrophoretic mobility of non-prenylated versus prenylated forms of GTPases as examined by SDS-PAGE. It has been reported previously that Ras and Rab (42Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ivessa N.E. Gravotta D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19937-19941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not the Rho family proteins (49Cicha I. Schneiderhan-Marra N. Yilmaz A. Garlichs C.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) exhibit altered electrophoretic mobility depending upon protein prenylation status, although we have reported altered isoprenoid-dependent Rac electrophoretic mobility in some cell types (41Cordle A. Koenigsknecht-Talboo J. Wilkinson B. Limpert A. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34202-34209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In statin-treated N2a cells we observed lowered mobility of Rab family proteins after statin treatment but not of the Rho family proteins Rac, Rho, or Cdc42 (Fig. 1A). The statin-dependent change in electrophoretic mobility of these protein families likely reflects the fact that Rab family proteins have two geranylgeranyl moieties added to them, whereas Rho family proteins possess only one lipid moiety. We find that after exposure of N2a cells to high doses of statins (10 μm), the Rab GTPases Rab1b, Rab4, Rab5, and Rab6 are converted entirely into the lower mobility, non-prenylated species (Fig. 1A). Statins reduced the levels of Rab6, requiring overexposure of the blots to visualize the unprenylated Rab6 band. Similar results were observed in H4 neuroglioma cells (data not shown). Provision of mevalonate allows restoration of the isoprenyl intermediate pools, without significant effects on cholesterol synthesis (20Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G.

Consistent with previous reports that show electrophoretic shifts are a result of loss of protein isoprenylation, we observe that changes in electrophoretic protein mobility caused by statin treatment were reversed upon provision of exogenous mevalonate, demonstrating that these effects are dependent upon protein isoprenylation (Fig. 1A). Statins do not alter cellular cholesterol content when serum is present in the media, as has been reported previously (data not shown) (52Cole S.L. Grudzien A. Manhart I.O. Kelly B.L. Oakley H. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18755-18770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 53Cordle A. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).One remarkable outcome of these experiments was the effect of the statins on Cdc42. We find that in N2a cells, statins cause a dramatic increase in Cdc42 levels (Fig. 1A, B). Similar results were found in H4 cells (data not shown). Elevated Cdc42 levels were seen in N2a cells at doses of statins as low as 50 nm (Fig. 1B). Cdc42 mRNA levels were not increased after statin treatment (data not shown), suggesting that isoprenylation may be required for the normal turnover of this protein.Statins Block the Membrane Association of Ras Superfamily GTPases—The isoprenoid modification of the small GTPases is esse"

The biochemical and genetic experiments reported here demonstrate that iron-sulfur proteins are greatly affected in cobalt-treated Escherichia coli cells. Exposure of a wild-type strain to intracellular cobalt results in the inactivation of three selected iron-sulfur enzymes, the tRNA methylthio-transferase, aconitase, and ferrichrome reductase. Consistently, mutant strains lacking the [Fe-S] cluster assembly SUF machinery are hypersensitive to cobalt. Last, expression of iron uptake genes is increased in cells treated with cobalt. In vitro studies demonstrated that cobalt does not react directly with fully assembled [Fe-S] clusters. In contrast, it reacts with labile ones present in scaffold proteins (IscU, SufA) involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. We propose a model wherein cobalt competes out iron during synthesis of [Fe-S] clusters in metabolically essential proteins.

We propose a model wherein cobalt competes out iron during synthesis of [Fe-S] clusters in metabolically essential proteins. Cobalt is required as a trace element in procaryotes and eucaryotes to fulfill a variety of metabolic functions. Even though this metal is less frequently encountered in metalloenzymes than iron, manganese, copper or zinc, it is an important cofactor in vitamin B12-dependent enzymes and in some other enzymes in animals, yeast, bacteria, Archaea, and plants (1Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). At high intracellular concentration the redox active metal ion Co2+ is highly toxic. Cobalt toxicity is, for example, associated with various human diseases such as contact dermatitis, pneumonia, allergic asthma, and lung cancer (2Barceloux D.G. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Cobalt was also shown to be immunogenic and to act as a hapten in the induction of bronchial and dermal hypersensitivity (3Sjogren I. Hillerdal G. Andersson A. Zetterstrom O. Thorax. 1980; 35: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Even though cobalt toxicity was attributed to cobalt-thiol group interaction of enzymes (4Jarvis, J. Q., Hammond, E., Meier, R., and Robinson, C. (1992) J. Occup. Med. 34, 620–626Google Scholar), surprisingly, very little has been done to investigate the mechanisms of this toxicity and to identify the principal targets of elevated intracellular concentrations of Co2+. The general strategy used by living cells to prevent damage caused by metallic toxics seems to reside in the expression of proteins that export or chelate metals. For example, the Escherichia coli rcnA gene encoding a membrane-bound polypeptide specific for nickel and cobalt resistance is induced under cobalt stress and allows cobalt efflux (5Rodrigue A. Effantin G. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2912-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cobalt stress selectively induces a genetic response strikingly similar to that observed during iron starvation (6Stadler J.A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39649-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The overexpression of iron transporters leads to a slight increase of intracellular iron concentration, which is supposed to limit cobalt toxic effects by favoring iron binding in iron enzymes (6Stadler J.A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39649-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests a link between cobalt and iron metabolism and competition between cobalt and iron at iron-binding sites. An important class of iron-containing proteins is that of iron-sulfur [Fe-S] enzymes involved in a variety of critical biological functions, including electron transfer, substrate binding/activation, regulation of gene expression, and redox and non-redox catalysis (7Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The active site is made of the combination of iron and sulfur atoms mostly in the form of [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S], and [2Fe-2S] clusters. Formation of intracellular [Fe-S] clusters requires a complex biosynthetic machinery. In E. coli three different types of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis systems have been identified so far, namely the ISC, SUF, and CSD systems (8Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 10Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Lascoux D. Forest E. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26760-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whereas the ISC system is thought to mature [Fe-S] proteins under normal growth conditions, the SUF machinery is thought to work under stress conditions (iron limitation and oxidative stress, which results in [Fe-S] cluster degradation) (11Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12Nachin, L., Loiseau, L., Expert, D., and Barras, F. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 427–437Google Scholar). Whether the CSD system intervenes under specific conditions remains unknown. These different machineries have in common the involvement of a cysteine desulfurase (IscS, SufSE, and CsdAE), which allows the use of cysteine as a source of sulfur atoms. Furthermore, both the ISC and SUF systems contain scaffold proteins (IscU, IscA, SufA) that are proposed to provide an intermediate assembly site for [Fe-S] clusters or [Fe-S] cluster precursors (13Ollagnier-de-Choudens, S., Sanakis, Y., and Fontecave, M. (2004) J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 9, 828–838Google Scholar, 14Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, some ATP-hydrolyzing proteins (HscA/HscB, SufBCD) participate in the process (12Nachin, L., Loiseau, L., Expert, D., and Barras, F. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 427–437Google Scholar, 20Silberg J.J.

In this report we show that (i) exposure of E. coli cells to intracellular cobalt results in the inactivation of [Fe-S] enzymes, (ii) E. coli mutant strains lacking suf genes are much more sensitive to Co, and inactivation of aconitase is more severe in a sufC mutant, (iii) Co-treated cells respond by increased expression of Fur-repressed genes, and (iv) in vitro cobalt has a direct and specific effect on clusters chelated by scaffold proteins involved in [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis. Together these observations indicate that cobalt toxicity is related to its effect on iron metabolism and, in particular, on the [Fe-S] cluster assembly process during de novo synthesis or repair. The majority of strains used in this paper were derivatives of E. coli K-12 MG1655. MG1655 sufC::aphA3 and MG1655 iscS::aphA3 were described in Nachin et al. (12Nachin, L., Loiseau, L., Expert, D., and Barras, F. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 427–437Google Scholar) and Gully et al. (21Gully D. Moinier D. Loiseau L. Bouveret E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), respectively. MG1655 sufA::aphA3, MG1655 sufB::aphA3, MG1655 sufD::aphA3, MG1655 sufE::aphA3, MG1655 sufS:: aphA3, MG1655 iscA::aphA3, MG1655 iscUA::aphA3, and MG1655 iscSUA::aphA3 were constructed by using the method described in Datsenko and Wanner (22Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment containing the suf or isc genes was amplified by PCR from E. coli MG1655 chromosomal DNA. Sequence of oligonucleotides used for PCR are presented in (Table 1) PCR product was subsequently inserted into pGEMT vector (Promega) or pGEM-T deleted for the Hinc2 restriction site (only for iscUA::aphA3) by the T/A cloning method. The suf or isc genes were disrupted by inserting an aphA3 cassette (kanamycin resistance) in the coding region (at the NsiI site for sufA; NruI site for sufB; EcoRV site for sufD; AflII site for sufS; between two BsmI sites for sufE; EcoRV site for iscA; between two Hinc2 sites for iscUA). The construction of iscSAU::aphA3 was done as follows. The pGEM-TiscS::aphA3 was double-digested by EcoRV/NdeI to get rid of the C terminus of iscS and a part of the aphA3 cassette. This was replaced by a DNA fragment containing the C terminus of iscA and the other part of the aphA3 cassette, obtained by double-digesting the pGEM-tiscA::aphA3 by EcoRV/NdeI. The result was plasmid pGEM-tiscSΔ::aphA3ΔiscA. The resulting suf::aphA3 or isc::aphA3 mutant genes were excised by restriction and electroporated into E. coli BW251113/pKD46 strain, and KnR clones were selected.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotides used for strain and plasmid constructionsOligonucleotides5′-3′ sequence5sufA5′-GCATGAATTCATGGACATGCATTCAGGAACC-3′3sufA5′-GCCTCTCGAGCTATACCCCAAAGCTTTCGCCACAGCC-3′5sufB5′-GCATGAATTCATGTCTCGTAATACTGAAGCAAC-3′3sufB5′-CCTCTCGAGTTAACCGACGCTGTGTTCAAGACTGATGGC-3′5sufD5′-GCATGAATTCATGGCTGGCTTACCGAACAGC-3′3sufD5′-CCTCTCGAGTCATCTTGCACCTCCTGGCAGCCG-3′5sufS5′-CCGCATATGATTTTTTCCGTCGACAAAGTGC-3′3sufS5′-GTTCTCGAGTTATCCCAGCAAACGGTGAATACG-3′5sufE5′-CCGCATATGGCTTTATTGCCGG-3′3sufE5′-GTTCTCGAGGCTAAGTGCAGCGGCTTTGGC-3′5iscS5′-GCATGAATTCATGAAATTACCGATTTATCTCG-3′3iscS5′-GCCTCTCGAGTTAATGATGAGCCCATTCGATGC-3′5iscA5′-CCTAGGAATTCATGTCGATTACACTGAGCGAC-3′3iscA5′-GCCTTCTCGAGTCAAACGTGGAAGCTTTCGCC-3′5iscU5′-GCATGAATTCATGGCTTACAGCGAAAAAGT-3′ Open table in a new tab All marked deletions were transduced by P1 transduction (23Miller Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh M9 supplemented medium and grown until the A600 = 0.3 at 37 °C. Cultures were then diluted 105 times, and 10-μl spots of these dilutions were spotted onto MJS supplemented plates containing different CoCl2 concentrations and incubated 3 days at 37 °C. Aconitase Activity—Aconitase activity was assayed following a published protocol (30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were grown in LB at 37 °C (1 liter culture), harvested in early stationary phase (A600 = 0.8), and washed with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer. Because anaerobiosis is essential for maintenance of the full activity of aconitase, cell extracts were prepared with an anaerobic extract buffer (cell pellets were diluted in 6 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 μg/μl lysozyme in an anaerobic chamber). Three rounds of frozen/thawed were performed. Assays were performed by adding cell extracts (300 μg of protein) to 0.6 mm MnCl2, 25 mm citrate, 0.25 mm NADP+, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in a 500-μl final volume. Aconitase activity was assayed by following the formation of NADPH by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Activity—Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was assayed either with same cellular extracts as above or with commercial pure protein from Sigma. In the former case 300 μg of protein extracts were mixed with 30 mm isocitrate, 0.25 mm NADP+, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in a 500-μl final volume. In the second case isocitrate dehydrogenase (5 μm) was mixed with 30 mm isocitrate, 0.25 mm NADP+ in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was monitored by the formation of NADPH followed at 340 nm. As a control experiment we also checked that the isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was unaffected by the presence of cobalt. MiaB Activity—Modified nucleosides were analyzed from isolated tRNAs as described previously (31Connolly D.M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3233-3246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Buck M. Connick M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). tRNAs were digested to nucleosides with nuclease P1. From the resulting hydrolysate 50–100 μg of tRNAs were loaded onto Zorbax SB-C18 column connected to a HP-1100 HPLC 3The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; i6A, 6-N-isopentenyladenosine; ms2i6A, 6-N-isopentenyl-2-methythioadenosine; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; WT, wild type. system. The short gradient profile developed by Gehrke and Kuo (33Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was used to separate the different nucleosides. In vitro enzymatic activity, performed with pure [Fe-S]-containing MiaB, was done as already described (34Pierrel F. Douki T. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47555-47563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (4Jarvis, J. Q., Hammond, E., Meier, R., and Robinson, C. (1992) J. Occup. Med. 34, 620–626Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Activity—β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (35Lamrani S. Ranquet C. Gama M.J. Nakai H. Shapiro J.A. Toussaint A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Iron and sulfide content were determined by Fish (37Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and Beinert (38Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) methods. Cobalt content was measured colorimetrically according to McCall and Fierke (39McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This method uses the feature that coordination of Co2+ alters the absorbance spectrum of 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol at 514 nm. Briefly, the protein solution was mixed with 4 m guanidine and 7.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and incubated at room temperature for a few minutes. A freshly prepared solution of 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (final concentration 100 μm) was then mixed with the sample, and the absorbance was immediately recorded at 514 nm (ϵ, 50 m–1 cm–1). Cobalt concentration was determined using a standard curve (0–100 nmol of Co). Cobalt content was also determined by atomic absorption (atomic absorption optical spectrometer). Equal quantities of protein were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were incubated with anti-aconitase (A and B) antibodies (gifts from D. Downs, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Immunoblots were developed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad). E. coli competent C41(DE3) strain were transformed with a pET-derived plasmid overexpressing the His-tagged FhuF protein (pKF191 plasmid (24Muller K. Matzanke B.F. Schunemann V. Trautwein A.X. Hantke K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm CoCl2 to an A600 of 0.5. Expression was then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Eurogentec) for 3 h at 37°C. The bacterial pellets obtained from these aerobic cultures were resuspended into a glove box (Jacomex B553 (NMT)) in deaerated buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.6 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, then transferred into ultracentrifuge tubes. The solution was frozen quickly (outside the glove box) and thawed (inside the glove box). This procedure was repeated 3 times and followed by an ultracentrifugation (4 °C, 45,000 rpm, 1.5 h). After anaerobic streptomycin treatment (2%), the clear supernatant solution was loaded anaerobically onto a Ni-NTA column (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. After an extensive washing (1 liter of buffer A) FhuF was eluted with buffer A containing 0.4 m imidazole. Pure fractions were concentrated and stored at –80 °C. IscU and SufA were purified as already described (14Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

For the [Fe-S]-containing proteins the reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy following the decrease in the 300–700-nm absorption range. After 1 h of incubation at 18 °C, proteins were desalted and analyzed for their cobalt and iron content according to McCall and Fierke (39McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Fish (37Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) procedures. A UV-visible spectrum was recorded for each protein. IscU scaffold (2 mg) was prepared as described above contained 0.8 iron, 0.6 cobalt, and 1.5 sulfur atoms/monomer and was incubated with E. coli apoMiaB (0.8 mg). After 2 h of incubation, proteins were separated onto a Ni-NTA column on which MiaB was retained since it contains a His tag at its N terminus. IscU was recovered in the run-through fraction during extensive washing with buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl), whereas MiaB was collected in the 400 mm imidazole fraction. The presence of IscU and MiaB in separated fractions was checked by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Mixed iron-Co-S complex transfer was monitored by assaying each fraction for iron, cobalt, and sulfur content. The same protocol was used with ferredoxin as a target (0.8 mg), except that in this case the His-tagged protein was IscU and not the target. 200 μl of FhuF proteins (150 μm) were reduced anaerobically with 2 mm dithionite for 30 min, and EPR tubes were frozen inside the glove box. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX (9.5 GHz) or ER200D EPR spectrometers equipped with an ESR 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Double integrals of the EPR signals and spin concentration were obtained through the Win-EPR software using the spectrum of a 1 mm Cu (EDTA) standard recorded under non-saturating conditions. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. Inhibition of E. coli Growth by CoCl2—Fig. 1 shows a typical growth curve of E. coli MG1655 in minimal M9 media at 37 °C in the absence or presence of cobalt (100 μm). In the presence of CoCl2 bacterial growth was dramatically impaired because cell density reached a A600 value of 1 as compared with 3.5 for the control culture (Fig. 1). Soluble extracts of E. coli cells grown in LB containing 200 μm cobalt were analyzed for cobalt content by colorimetric assays and atomic absorption; they contained 105–130 μm Co, whereas untreated cells contained 5–10 μm (Table 2). In contrast, E. coli corA– strain, known to be devoid of the major cobalt transporter CorA (40Park M.H. Wong B.B. Lusk J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showed no increase of intracellular cobalt when cultivated with CoCl2 (Table 2).TABLE 2Cobalt and iron contents in WT and corA- strainsWild typecorA--Co+Co200 μm-Co+Co200 μmIntracellular cobalt content UV (μm)101301510 Atomic absorption (μm)5105——Intracellular iron content (%)1004710043 Open table in a new tab Perturbation of Iron Homeostasis in Co-treated Cells—The addition of iron citrate partially protected the cells from cobalt toxicity, suggesting a competition between intracellular cobalt and iron (Fig. 1). Moreover, cells treated with CoCl2 (200 μm) showed a 50% decrease of intracellular iron as compared with untreated cells (Table 2). This was further supported by the observation of an increased expression of the Fur repressed fhuF gene (encoding ferrichrome reductase) when cells were exposed to 200 μm CoCl2 in an experiment using a fhuF:lacZ fusion to quantitate the expression of fhuF (41Braun V.

Their action leads to the generation of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane or in specific cellular membrane compartments. Interaction between these lipids and distinct structural motifs such as pleckstrin homology and FYVE domains can regulate the activity of different proteins through their membrane targeting or direct modulation of their enzymatic activity. Not surprisingly then, PI3Ks play key roles in many physiological events, including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, and membrane trafficking (1Rameh L.E.

Although in vitro they can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2, it is generally accepted that PtdIns-4,5-P2 is their main substrate in vivo. The only member of the class III PI3K family is the human homolog of the yeast vesicular protein-sorting protein Vps34, a monomer that is generally considered to be responsible for generation of the constitutive pool of PtdIns-3-P in endosomes and to be involved in intracellular trafficking. Class II PI3Ks were first identified by sequence homology to other PI3Ks (6MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr.

The three members of class II (PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ) are monomers of high molecular weight due to extensions at both the N and C termini. One feature of these enzymes is their insensitivity to PI3K inhibitors, with the α-isoform exhibiting high resistance to treatment with both wortmannin and LY294002 (9Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S.

Much remains to be understood regarding the activation of the class II PI3Ks in other signaling pathways and their mechanism of activation. For example, it is known that insulin can activate PI3K-C2α in adipocytes and muscle cells (10Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Soos M.A. Jensen J. Brown R.A. O'Rahilly S. Shepherd P.R. Whitehead J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the physiological consequences of such activation are still not defined. Similarly, the in vivo product of PI3K-C2α in insulin signaling and its mechanism of regulation remain to be clarified. Glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, a critical event for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis within the body, requires the insulin-mediated translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (23Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 24James D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GLUT4 translocation involves several steps, including reorganization of actin, formation of GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs), and movement of GSVs close to the plasma membrane. Once at the cell periphery, a regulated process of tethering, docking, and fusion of the vesicles allows the insertion of GLUT4 into the membrane and externalization, finally leading to glucose transport. With numerous molecules reported to be involved in this process, GLUT4 translocation/insertion/externalization is one of the most complicated and tightly regulated intracellular events, requiring a fine cross-talk between signaling and trafficking processes through mechanisms that are still poorly defined. It is well established that GLUT4 translocation/externalization requires the activation of both a class I PI3K (25Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and the small GTPase TC10 (26Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The involvement of the class I PI3K target protein kinase B/Akt was proposed/demonstrated almost 10 years ago (27Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 17: 4484-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, there are still few examples of downstream effectors of TC10 activation (34Chang L. Adams R.D. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12835-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Chiang S.H. Hwang J. Legendre M. Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A.R.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this latter respect, we have demonstrated previously that insulin-mediated TC10 activation leads to generation of a pool of PtdIns-3-P at the plasma membrane of insulin-responsive cells (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), identifying this lipid as a downstream mediator of TC10 signals. We also reported that exogenous PtdIns-3-P is able to induce GLUT4 translocation (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that the insulin/TC10-dependent pool of PtdIns-3-P could play a role in this process. The importance of PtdIns-3-P in glucose transport was subsequently confirmed by the observation that overexpression of myotubularin, a specific PtdIns-3-P phosphatase, impairs insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (39Chaussade C. Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Blondeau F. Brenz-Verca S. Tronchere H. Portis F. Rusconi S. Payrastre B. Laporte J. Van Obberghen E. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 6065-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although the role of the endogenously generated, insulin-dependent pool of PtdIns-3-P in GLUT4 translocation remains unclear. By directly analyzing the phosphoinositides, we here identify PtdIns-3-P as the sole lipid product generated through PI3K-C2α activation in the insulin signaling pathway. This is the first time that such analysis has been performed upon activation of a class II PI3K by in vivo metabolic labeling of cells and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Our data also indicate that activation of PI3K-C2α involves its insulin-dependent targeting to the lipid raft subdomains of the plasma membrane and is mediated by the small GTPase TC10. Finally, we demonstrate that PI3K-C2α plays an important role in regulating GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, identifying, for the first time, the role of both this isoform and the endogenously generated, insulin-dependent pool of PtdIns-3-P in insulin signaling. Materials—Anti-PI3K-C2α antibody for confocal microscopy was a kind gift of Dr. Marcus Thelen (Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona, Switzerland), and anti-PI3K-C2α antibody for immunoprecipitation has been described (10Brown R.A.

Insulin was from Sigma, or alternatively, the human insulin analog Actrapid™ from Novo Nordisk was used. Plasmids—Two distinct constructs were generated to specifically knock down PI3K-C2α. First, the following oligomers, designed based on the sequence of rat PI3K-C2α, were sub-cloned into a pSuper vector: PI3K-C2α short hairpin RNA (shRNA), 5′-GATCCCCGTCCAGTCACAGTGCAAAGTTCAAGAGACTTTGCACTGTGACTGGACTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGTCCAGTCACAGTGCAAAGTCTCTTGAACTTTGCACTGTGACTGGACGGG-3′ (reverse).

Scrambled sequences in the pSuperior vector were also generated. TC10 mutant constructs were a kind gift of Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY). HA-GLUT4 from pBABE-puro-HA-GLUT4 (43Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was cloned into pBABE-hygro via restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI and SalI. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-GLUT4 has been described (44Li C.H. Bai L. Li D.D. Xia S. Xu T. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures and Transfection—L6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine. Transfection of the pSuper-based recombinant vectors was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. Single clones were selected in medium supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. To generate pSuperior-scrambled shRNA and pSuperior-shRNA PI3K-C2α, L6 cells were infected with retroviral stocks generated by transfection of pVSVG (Clontech), pGag-pol (Clontech), and pSuperior-based vectors into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Mixed cell populations were selected in medium supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. Electroporation of EGFP-GLUT4 DNA was performed as described (45van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a confluent 10-cm dish were washed twice with α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and then resuspended in 600 μl of cytomix (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.6), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mm EGTA (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutathione) before use. Cells were added to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) containing 100 μg of DNA, and electroporation was carried out at room temperature at 200 V, one pulse, and 10 ms with a BTX ECM 830 pulse generator. Cells were finally resuspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and plated in 2 × 6-cm dishes. HPLC Analysis—Cells plated in a 12-well plate were labeled with 15 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in inositol-free medium M199 containing antibiotics and glutamine. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin, and phospholipids were extracted at different times of stimulation. After deacylation, samples were separated by HPLC on a PartiSphere 5-μm strong anion exchange column (Whatman) using a nonlinear gradient of 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) and 1.3 m (NH4)2HPO4 + 1 mm EDTA (pH 3.8) (buffer B) (0-1 min, 0% buffer B; 1-40 min, 0-5% buffer B; 40-41 min, 5-15% buffer B; 41-75 min, 15-24% buffer B; 75-76 min, 24-33% buffer B; 76-95 min, 33-60% buffer B; 95-96 min, 60-100% buffer B; 96-100 min, 100% buffer B; 100-101 min, 100 to 0% buffer B; and 101-121 min, 0% buffer B wash). The levels of glycero-PtdIns-3-P in each sample were normalized to the levels of glycero-PtdIns that were unaffected by insulin treatment or PI3K-C2α knockdown. For the experiment shown in supplemental Fig. S2, parental L6 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and labeled with 30 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol. Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Microscopy was performed as described (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope system connected to an Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope and a Zeiss 63× objective. Images were acquired and loaded using the TCS NT program (Version 1.6.587). No further processing of the images was done except for changes in brightness/contrast to better visualize the data. Images were collected at 3.5 μm from the bottom, and all conditions were imaged at the same distance from the glass. Quantitative analysis of cells displaying localization of the green fluorescent protein-fused double FYVE domain from the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (GFP-2×FYVEHrs) to the plasma membrane was performed as described (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Detergent-free Cell Fractionation—For subcellular fractionation, cells were scraped in 255 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors and lysed by 12 passages with a 23-gauge needle. Crude plasma membranes were collected as a pellet after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at +4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at +4 °C to pellet the high density membranes. An additional centrifugation step of the corresponding supernatants (50,000 × g, 75 min, +4 °C) separated the low density membranes from the cytosol. Separation of lipid raft fractions by detergent-free cell fractionation was performed as described (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PI3K-C2α in Vitro Assay—PI3K-C2α was immunoprecipitated from Myc- or Myc-TC10 mutant-transfected cells using a specific antibody, and in vitro assay was performed as described (10Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). EGFP-GLUT4 Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) Analysis—EGFP-GLUT4-expressing cells were grown on 42-mm No. 1 glass coverslips and starved for 2 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Coverslips were gently washed with warm 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer (from a 10× Krebs-Ringer/HEPES stock of 1.36 m NaCl, 47 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 12 mm CaCl2·2H2O, and 200 mm HEPES) and mounted in a pre-warmed ROC chamber (PeCon, Erbach, Germany) with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer in an insert P heated stage (PeCon) on a Axiovert 200M microscope fitted with an XL incubator (PeCon). Single isolated cells were identified and chosen with differential interference contrast and epifluorescence (excitation, 488/10 nm; and emission, 525/25 nm). For TIRFM imaging, cells were excited with the 488-nm line of a 100-milliwatt argon ion laser introduced at the appropriate incident angle through the TIRF slider and an alpha Plan-FLUAR 100×/1.45 oil objective and imaged (emission, 525/25 nm) using a Zeiss AxioCam MRm digital camera. Single or multiple (up to 20) cells were imaged every 0.5 min for 15 min; insulin (100 nm) was introduced (100 μl of a 10 × stock); and cells were imaged for an additional 30 min. Images were taken with an exposure time of 40 ms using ∼12.5% maximal laser output. Under such conditions, no reduction in detected fluorescence through “bleaching” was observed (data not shown). Image stacks were background-subtracted using Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), and blinded, cells and regions of interest were chosen to exclude any excessive movement and increases in cell area seen after insulin stimulus. Approximately one-third of either scrambled or PI3K-C2α knockdown cells from a single experiment were not further processed. Total fluorescence within the area of interest at each time point was normalized to the average total fluorescence of pre-stimulated cells (-5 to 0 min, f0). Representative images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. HA-GLUT4 Translocation and Glucose Uptake Assays—HA-GLUT4 translocation assay was performed as described (43Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Glucose transport was determined by a method adapted from Ref. 46Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. Myoblasts in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 2 h and then incubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin with or without 100 nm insulin. Glucose uptake was measured over 10 min in the presence of 40 μm 2-deoxy[3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/well). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% SDS. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, extracts were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Protein determination was by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Nonspecific glucose uptake was determined using 10 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from the total rates observed. PI3K-C2α Generates an Insulin-dependent Pool of PtdIns-3-P—We have reported previously that insulin generates a pool of PtdIns-3-P at the plasma membrane of muscle cells and adipocytes through activation of a PI3K more resistant to treatment with the inhibitors wort-mannin and LY294002 (38Maffucci T. Brancaccio A. Piccolo E. Stein R.C. Falasca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4178-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).

Aspects of this gene reprogramming suggest the involvement of epigenetic processes. We used THP-1 human promonocytes, which mimic gene silencing when rendered endotoxin-tolerant in vitro, to test whether TNFα proximal promoter nucleosomes and transcription factors adapt to an activation-specific profile by developing characteristic chromatin-based silencing marks. We found increased TNFα mRNA levels in endotoxin-responsive cells that was preceded by dissociation of heterochromatin-binding protein 1α, demethylation of nucleosomal histone H3 lysine 9 (H3(Lys9)), increased phosphorylation of the adjacent serine 10 (H3(Ser10)), and recruitment of NF-κB RelA/p65 to the TNFα promoter. In contrast, endotoxintolerant cells repressed production of TNFα mRNA, retained binding of heterochromatin-binding protein 1α, sustained methylation of H3(Lys9), reduced phosphorylation of H3(Ser10), and showed diminished binding of NF-κB RelA/p65 to the TNFα promoter. Similar levels of NF-κB p50 occurred at the TNFα promoter in the basal state, during active transcription, and in the silenced phenotype. RelB, which acts as a repressor of TNFα transcription, remained bound to the promoter during silencing.

RelB, which acts as a repressor of TNFα transcription, remained bound to the promoter during silencing. These results support an immunodeficiency paradigm where epigenetic changes at the promoter of acute proinflammatory genes mediate their repression during the late phase of severe systemic inflammation. Gene reprogramming during severe systemic inflammation generates, among other patterns, silencing of acute proinflammatory genes, such as TNFα 2The abbreviations used are:TNFαtumor necrosis factor αsiRNAsmall interfering RNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationHP1heterochromatin-binding protein 1ILinterleukinLPSlipopolysaccharide and IL-1β, that initiate acute systemic inflammation and damage to multiple organs (1McCall C.E.

Mier J.W. Orencole S.F. Kaplanski G. Lynch E.A. Ye K. Vannier E. Wolff S.M. Dinarello C.A. J.

Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S64-S73Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Gene silencing as a result of disrupted transcription occurs in circulating and tissue leukocytes during severe systemic inflammation in animals and humans (2Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. Shock. 2000; 13: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5McCall C.E. Grosso-Wilmoth L.M. LaRue K. Guzman R.N. Cousart S.L. J. Clin.

Immunol. 1991; 21: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The silenced component of gene reprogramming is characterized by a tolerance to endotoxin and can persist for days or even weeks (5McCall C.E. Grosso-Wilmoth L.M. LaRue K. Guzman R.N. Cousart S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Endotoxin tolerance is defined by the repressed expression of a set of proinflammatory genes in response to the stimulation of the Toll-like receptor 4 by endotoxin. Endotoxin tolerance is constitutively present in blood leukocytes obtained from humans and animals with severe systemic inflammation and can be generated in vitro by using endotoxin as a primary stimulus of macrophages (7LaRue K.E.

At the level of chromatin, covalent modifications of the NH2-terminal tails of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) play an essential role in both activating or silencing gene expression (8Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar, 9Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). These modifications account for a “histone code” that generates specific binding sites for proteins that regulate both chromatin structure and transcription (10Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Well characterized histone modifications associated with transcriptional regulation and activation include H3 phosphorylation of Ser10, demethylation of Lys9, and acetylation of Lys9 and Lys14 through the concerted activity of some known and many as yet unidentified mediators (11Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 12Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). For example, acetylation of histone on lysine residues relaxes the compact structure of the nucleosome and activates transcription, whereas histone deacetylation represses transcription (13Berger F. Gaudin V. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, methylation of histone H3 on Lys9 facilitates DNA methylation, heterochromatin formation, and gene silencing (14Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 correlates with activation of immediate response genes of which many acute proinflammatory proteins can be included (13Berger F. Gaudin V. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This supports a chromatin-based “phosphorylation/methylation switch” where phosphorylation of histone residue adjacent to a methylation mark parallels a loss of binding of negative factors accompanied by the demethylation of that residue and the subsequent recruitment of transcription factors and co-activating proteins and gene activation (18Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This binary switch may also play a negative role through recruitment of co-repressors such as the heterochromatin protein HP1, which also binds to methylated lysines on H3 and contributes to gene silencing by establishing heterochromatin formation (19Dormann H.L. Tseng B.S. Allis C.D. Funabiki H. Fischle W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These changes in chromatin structure contain a molecular imprint that may underlie cell memory and epigenetic inheritance of cell progeny. Chromatin remodeling influences the activity of transcription factors, such as members of the NF-κB family (20Natoli G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications influence the transcription potential of NF-κB (21Cheung W.L. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin.

For example, phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 at Ser276 and histone H3 at Ser10 by MSK1 has been associated with activation of IL-6 promoter (26Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 27Vanden B.W. Vermeulen L. Delerive P. De B.K. Staels B. Haegeman G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 544: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Many if not all acute proinflammatory genes are regulated, at least in part, by NF-κB, and we reported changes in NF-κB binding that are associated with the silencing of IL-1β expression during endotoxin tolerance (28Chan C. Li L. McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TNFα plays a pivotal role in coordinating host defense against infection (29Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar) and is a crucial contributor to the patho-physiology of severe systemic inflammation and septicemia (30Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Regulation of human TNFα in monocytes is complex and involves transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (31Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Its expression is silenced in blood leukocytes during severe systemic inflammation (1McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The silencing can be mimicked in normal monocytes or THP-1 promonocytes by inducing endotoxin tolerance in vitro (2Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. Shock. 2000; 13: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5McCall C.E. Grosso-Wilmoth L.M. LaRue K. Guzman R.N. Cousart S.L. J. Clin.

Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism of TNFα gene silencing by comparing endotoxin-responsive with endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. We report that epigenetic changes and formation of heterochromatin marks occurred during TNFα silencing. These include sustained binding of HP1α and methylation of H3(Lys9), reduced phosphorylation of H3(Ser10), and disrupted recruitment of NF-κB RelA/p65 to the TNFα promoter. RelB also bound to the TNFα promoter and acted as a transcription repressor during gene silencing. Cell Culture and Induction of LPS Tolerance—The human promonocytic cells, THP-1, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mML-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For induction of tolerance (7LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), cells were incubated for 16 h with 1 μg/ml Gram-negative bacterial LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma). LPS-tolerant and LPS-responsive (normal) cells were washed with minimal medium, cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated times. TNFα Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The levels of total (intracellular and secreted) TNFα proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The samples were assayed in duplicate. The minimal detection limit of the assay was 1.6 pg/ml. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed to assess NF-κB and modified histone protein binding to the TNFα promoter using the ChIP assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly after stimulation, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (to cross-link DNA-proteins) for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linked chromatin was isolated and sheared with an enzyme mixture for 15 min at room temperature. These conditions generate chromatin fragments containing DNA ranging in size from 200 to 500 bp. The sheared chromatin was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The chromatin solution was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4°C. Ten microliters of the chromatin solution were reserved as “input” sample. The remaining chromatin was immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C overnight with antibodies specific to NF-κB p65, p50, RelB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), HP1α, total histone H3, phosphohistone H3 (p-H3(Ser10)), or dimethylhistone H3 (me2-H3(Lys9)) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The immunoprecipitated complexes were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose, washed, and then eluted in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. The immunoprecipitated and input sample cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight. The resulting DNA was washed in a column and recovered in 100 μlofH2O. Semiquantitative PCR—PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 5 μl of ChIP DNA, a 1 μm concentration of each primer, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm dNTPs, and 0.04 units/μl AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94, 58, and 72 °C for 30 s each; and a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were run on a 1.2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, and images were captured using a Quantity One imager (Bio-Rad). The primers used in PCR were designed to amplify a sequence in the human TNFα proximal promoter region containing the κB3 site at –98 bp relative to the transcription start site (34Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and were as follows: TNFακB3 forward (5′-TACCGCTTCCTCCAGATGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTGGCTGGGTGTGCCAA-3′). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed to precisely quantify the TNFα promoter sequence in the ChIP DNA as well as the TNFα mRNA expression. For ChIP DNA analysis, the same primers described above were used with an internal fluorogenic probe that was labeled with the fluorescent dyes carboxyfluorescein (FAM) as a reporter dye and N,N,N,′N′-tetramethyle-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA) as a quencher dye (5′-FAM-CTTGGTGGAGAAACC-TAMRA-3′) (Applied Biosystems). The PCR (25 μl) contained 5 μl of ChIP DNA, 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal Master Mix containing DNA polymerase and dNTPs, a 300 nm concentration of each primer, and 100 nm internal probe. The PCR conditions were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C (combined annealing and extension) using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). An isotype-matched IgG-immunoprecipitated DNA sample was also amplified as a negative control (data not shown). Sample data were normalized to the input DNA and are presented as -fold change relative to DNA from untreated cells (0 h). For TNFα mRNA analysis, total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX)). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse transcribed to cDNA in a 25-μl volume containing 0.2 μm dNTPs, 2.5 μm oligo(dT), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 units/μl murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR was performed using 5 μl of cDNA and TNFα and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pre-designed TaqMan primer/probe kits (Applied Biosystems) under the conditions described above. Sample data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and are presented as -fold change relative to mRNA from untreated cells. RNA Interference—Control and RelB-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transfected by electroporation with 5 μl (0.5 μm) of siRNA in 100 μl of transfection medium (Nucleofector; Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Immediately after transfection, cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS to induce tolerance. After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed with minimal medium, and stimulated for 3 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. Cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated and used to determine the TNFα mRNA expression levels. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and are presented as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between groups. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. TNFα Protein and mRNA Expression Are Silenced in LPS-tolerant THP-1 Cells—The experimental model used in this study mimics the LPS-tolerant phenotype that occurs in blood leukocytes during the course of severe systemic inflammation in animals and sepsis in humans (35Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. Fitting C. Adrie C. Payen D. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Mathison J.C. Virca G.D. Wolfson E. Tobias P.S. Glaser K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) where cytokine expression, including that of TNFα, is silenced after the initial induction phase following LPS exposure (4West M.A. Heagy W. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S64-S73Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 6Munoz C. Misset B. Fitting C. Bleriot J.P. Carlet J. Cavaillon J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Arnalich F. Garcia-Palomero E. Lopez J. Jimenez M. Madero R. Renart J. Vazquez J.J. Montiel C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We first measured the TNFα protein and mRNA levels in LPS-responsive and LPS-tolerant cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the total TNFα protein level was significantly increased by 3 h poststimulation and remained elevated at 8 h. With the longer incubation times (data not shown), we observed a gradual decline in the protein levels starting at 10 h. In contrast, LPS-tolerant cells produced TNFα protein at a background level throughout the course of stimulation. We also determined TNFα mRNA expression levels by real time PCR as shown in Fig. 1. TNFα mRNA was rapidly and significantly induced in responsive cells after 0.5 h of stimulation with LPS. The mRNA levels were dramatically decreased at 3 h. Consistent with the low protein levels, we detected very low TNFα mRNA levels in LPS-tolerant cells. Together these data demonstrate that TNFα protein and mRNA are induced by LPS in responsive THP-1 cells but are silenced in LPS-tolerant THP-1 cells. Histone H3 Phosphorylation on Ser10 and Demethylation on Lys9 at the TNFα Promoter Are Induced by LPS in Responsive but Not LPS-tolerant Cells—To investigate whether histone modifications contributes to TNFα silencing during LPS tolerance, we examined histone H3(Ser10) phosphorylation and H3(Lys9) dimethylation levels at the TNFα promoter using ChIP DNA from responsive and tolerant THP-1 cells. We found that in untreated LPS-responsive cells, histone H3 was phosphorylated on Ser10 at low levels. Ser10 phosphorylation was significantly increased at 1 and 4 h after LPS stimulation and returned to a near basal level by 4 h (Fig. 2, A and B). In LPS-tolerant cells, histone H3(Ser10) phosphorylation was only slightly increased at 1 h. We also found that histone H3 dimethylation on Lys9 was significantly decreased in LPS-responsive cells by 0.5 h after LPS stimulation and gradually returned to its basal state at 4 h (Fig. 2, A and B). In LPS-tolerant cells, histone H3(Lys9) was constitutively dimethylated and remained almost unchanged following LPS stimulation (Fig. 2, A and C). These data show a phosphorylation/methylation binary switch activity in responsive THP-1 cells that is impaired in silenced, LPS-tolerant THP-1 cells. HP1α Dissociates from the TNFα Promoter in LPS-responsive but Not LPS-tolerant Cells—The data presented above demonstrated that H3(Lys9) was persistently methylated in tolerant cells and that this histone modification correlated with TNFα silencing. Proteins that specifically interact with post-translational modifications of histone play a crucial role in mediating the functional role of histone marks (38Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 39Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Methylation of the Lys9 of histone H3 is an epigenetic mark for formation of heterochromatin and associated gene silencing (19Dormann H.L. Tseng B.S. Allis C.D. Funabiki H. Fischle W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This phenotype is often associated with binding of repressor HP1α or -β wherein the chromodomain binds to methylated H3(Lys9) and participates in gene silencing by establishing heterochromatin (19Dormann H.L. Tseng B.S. Allis C.D. Funabiki H. Fischle W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). We investigated whether HP1α is recruited to TNFα promoter during endotoxin silencing. Standard and real time PCR analysis of ChIP DNA using HP1α antibody showed that HP1α bound at the basal level in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3). The amount of HP1α bound to the promoter was significantly decreased in responsive cells after 0.5 h of LPS stimulation before it returned to a near basal level by 4 h. In contrast, HP1α remained bound in tolerant cells consistent with a role in repression of TNFα and contributing to the silenced phenotype of LPS tolerance. LPS-induced NF-κB p65 Binding to the TNFα Promoter Is Inhibited in LPS-tolerant Cells—Human TNFα promoter has three NF-κB binding sites, κB1, κB2, and κB3, known to be involved in its transcription regulation (34Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 41Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwiatkowski D. Rice N.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21178-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Promoter proximal transcription binding sites are usually functionally associated with chromatin-based gene silencing. We examined the kinetics of NF-κB protein binding to the NF-κB binding site κB3 in the TNFα promoter. We focused our investigation on the κB3 site because of its close proximity to the transcription initiation site and the assembly of basal transcription machinery. Also this site binds NF-κB proteins and contributes to the induction of TNFα in THP-1 cells (30Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 43Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar). Standard PCR and quantitative real time PCR analysis of ChIP DNA revealed a basal level binding by p65 in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4). Upon LPS stimulation, we detected a significant increase (∼11-fold) in p65 binding at 0.5 and 1 h following LPS stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B) that returned to near basal levels by 4 h. In LPS-tolerant cells, however, p65 binding occurred at the basal level and was not notably induced by LPS (Fig. 4, A and B). The low level binding of p65 at the TNFα promoter in tolerant cells occurs despite normal expression, nuclear translocation, and increased levels of p65 in LPS-tolerant THP-1 cells (44Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We detected low levels of p50 binding to the TNFα promoter in both responsive and tolerant cells that were not significantly changed in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 4, A and C). RelB Binds to the TNFα Promoter in LPS-tolerant Cells, and RelB Knockdown Reverses Tolerance and Restores TNFα mRNA Induction by LPS—We previously reported that RelB, which is not expressed in the basal state in THP-1 cells, is induced following LPS stimulation and subsequently acts as a transcription repressor (44Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A similar paradigm may occur in human blood leukocytes during severe systemic inflammation (44Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To examine whether RelB, another NF-κB family member, participates in silencing of TNFα in LPS-tolerant cells, we first analyzed its in vivo binding to the TNFα promoter. We found that RelB binds to TNFα promoter in responsive cells. Such binding slightly increased by 4 h of LPS stimulation (Fig. 4, A and D). In contrast, a significant increase in RelB binding occurred in LPS-tolerant cells and further increased by 4 h of LPS stimulation (Fig. 4, A and D). Using RelB-specific siRNA, we further tested whether decreasing RelB could restore TNFα expression in tolerant cells. As shown in Fig. 5, transfection of RelB siRNA reversed LPS tolerance and restored the LPS-induced TNFα mRNA expression to a level close to that seen in LPS-responsive cells (compare responsive + LPS with tolerant + LPS). In summary, we found that TNFα gene expression induced by LPS is associated with the activation of the phosphorylation/methylation binary switch wherein histone H3 becomes phosphorylated on Ser10 and demethylated on the adjacent Lys9. In contrast, a cell model of severe systemic inflammation and phenotypic acute proinflammatory gene silencing is associated with a deficiency in the binary switch and a persistent methylation in the TNFα promoter. This epigenetic silencing is characteristic of the formation of heterochromatin and included persistently bound HP1α. Changes in NF-κB binding to chromatin associated with silenced TNFα promoter were also observed, specifically decreased binding of NF-κB p65 and increased binding of the NF-κB repressor RelB. Chromatin configuration imposes profound and lasting effects on transcription (8Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2083019766,"Cysteine proteases play an important part in human pathobiology1. This report shows the participation of cathepsin L (CatL) in adipogenesis and glucose intolerance. In vitro studies demonstrate the role of CatL in the degradation of the matrix protein fibronectin, insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), essential molecules for adipogenesis and glucose metabolism2,3,4,5. CatL inhibition leads to the reduction of human and murine pre-adipocyte adipogenesis or lipid accumulation, protection of fibronectin from degradation, accumulation of IR and IGF-1R β-subunits, and an increase in glucose uptake. CatL-deficient mice are lean and have reduced levels of serum glucose and insulin but increased levels of muscle IR β-subunits, fibronectin and glucose transporter (Glut)-4, although food/water intake and energy expenditure of these mice are no less than their wild-type littermates. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of CatL also demonstrates reduced body weight gain and serum insulin levels, and increased glucose tolerance, probably due to increased levels of muscle IR β-subunits, fibronectin and Glut-4 in both diet-induced obese mice and ob/ob mice. Increased levels of CatL in obese and diabetic patients suggest that this protease is a novel target for these metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2138392373,"Growth factors have been widely used in strategies to regenerate and repair diseased tissues, but current therapies that go directly from bench to bedside have had limited clinical success. We hypothesize that engineering successful therapies with recombinant proteins will often require specific quantitative information of the spatiotemporal role of the factors and the development of sophisticated delivery approaches that provide appropriate tissue exposures. This hypothesis was tested in the context of therapeutic angiogenesis. An in vitro model of angiogenesis was adapted to quantify the role of the concentration/gradient of vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF(165)] on microvascular endothelial cells, and a delivery system was then designed, based on a mathematical model, to provide the desired profile in ischemic mice hindlimbs. This system significantly enhanced blood vessel formation, and perfusion and recovery from severe ischemia. This general approach may be broadly applicable to growth factor therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2063119446,"The β-lactam antibiotics mimic the d-alanyl4-d-alanine5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors and act as “suicide” substrates of the dd-transpeptidases that catalyze the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis. We have previously shown that bypass of the dd-transpeptidases by the ld-transpeptidase of Enterococcus faecium (Ldtfm) leads to high level resistance to ampicillin. Ldtfm is specific for the l-lysyl3-d-alanine4 bond of peptidoglycan precursors containing a tetrapeptide stem lacking d-alanine5. This specificity was proposed to account for resistance, because the substrate of Ldtfm does not mimic β-lactams in contrast to the d-alanyl4-d-alanine5 extremity of pentapeptide stems used by the dd-transpeptidases. Here, we unexpectedly show that imipenem, a β-lactam of the carbapenem class, totally inhibited Ldtfm at a low drug concentration that was sufficient to inhibit growth of the bacteria. Peptidoglycan cross-linking was also inhibited, indicating that Ldtfm is the in vivo target of imipenem. Stoichiometric and covalent modification of Ldtfm by imipenem was detected by mass spectrometry. The modification was mapped into the trypsin fragment of Ldtfm containing the catalytic Cys residue, and the Cys to Ala substitution prevented imipenem binding. The mass increment matched the mass of imipenem, indicating that inactivation of Ldtfm is likely to involve rupture of the β-lactam ring and acylation of the catalytic Cys residue. Thus, the spectrum of activity of β-lactams is not restricted to transpeptidases of the dd-specificity, as previously thought. Combination therapy with imipenem and ampicillin could therefore be active against E. faecium strains having the dual capacity to manufacture peptidoglycan with transpeptidases of the ld- and dd-specificities.

The peptidoglycan of Enterococcus faecium is generated by polymerization of a disaccharide-peptide subunit composed of β1–4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid, a linear stem pentapeptide (l-Ala1-d-iGln2-l-Lys3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5) linked to the lactoyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid by an amide bond, and a side-chain d-isoasparagynyl or d-isoaspartyl (d-iAsx) 2The abbreviations used are: d-iAsx, d-isoasparagynyl or d-isoaspartyl; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; rp-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography; Ldtfm, ld-transpeptidase from E. faecium. residue linked to the ϵ amino group of l-Lys3 (1Billot-Klein D.

The final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis involve polymerization of the glycan strands by glycosyltransferases (3van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cross-linking of peptide stems by dd-transpeptidases (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide bond formed by the latter enzyme links the carbonyl of d-Ala4 to the amino group of d-iAsx. The two-step reaction for the formation of these d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links starts by the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl of d-Ala4 of the acyl donor substrate by the γ oxygen of the catalytic serine leading to the release of d-Ala5 and to the formation of a covalent adduct (acylenzyme) (5Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.-M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 6Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 702-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the second step, the carbonyl of d-Ala4 is attacked by the α amino group of d-iAsx of the acceptor substrate leading to formation of the d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-link and to the release of the dd-transpeptidase. The β-lactam antibiotics are structural analogues of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of the pentapeptide stem and act as “suicide” substrates of the dd-transpeptidases (see Fig. 1). Opening of the β-lactam ring, which mimics the rupture of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 peptide bond in the first step of the dd-transpeptidation reaction, leads to inactivation of the dd-transpeptidases. Because the acylenzymes typically have half-lives in the order of several hours, inactivation of the dd-transpeptidases by β-lactams is essentially irreversible in the scale of the generation time of bacteria. The dd-transpeptidases, which are highly redundant enzymes, are collectively the killing target of β-lactams, because peptidoglycan cross-linking is essential to the integrity of the cell wall. These enzymes belong to a large family of active-site serine acyl-transferases that bind penicillin covalently and are thus referred to as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-lactams are one of the oldest and still the most broadly used class of antibiotics for the treatment of severe infections despite the development of several resistance mechanisms, including the enzymatic detoxification of the drug by β-lactamases (7Jacoby G.A. Munoz-Price L.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), the modification of the transport of the antibiotic in Gram-negative bacteria (8Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), and modifications of the target, the dd-transpeptidases, that result in reduced acylation of these enzymes by β-lactams (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. faecium, intrinsic resistance to moderate levels of ampicillin involves the production of one such low affinity PBP, designated PBP5fm (9Fontana R. Cerini R. Longoni P. Grossato A. Canepari P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Williamson R. Le Bouguénec C. Gutmann L. Horaud T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1933-1940PubMed Google Scholar). Acquisition of higher levels of resistance to this drug in clinical isolates results from overproduction of PBP5fm and from amino acid substitutions in the dd-transpeptidase domain of the protein that further decrease the interaction of the protein with ampicillin (11Klare I.

Analysis of the peptidoglycan structure of the resulting mutant, E. faecium M512, indicated that ampicillin resistance was due to target substitution, because the d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by the dd-transpeptidases (PBPs) were replaced by l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by an ld-transpeptidase (13Mainardi J.L.

The “ld” designation refers to cleavage of a peptide bond between amino acids of the l and d configurations prior to peptide bond formation, as opposed to dd-transpeptidases (PBPs) that act on the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 bond of the donor (Fig. 1A). The dd- and ld-transpeptidases use the same amino group in the acyl acceptor for peptide bond formation, corresponding to the α-amino group of d-iAsx in E. faecium (15Magnet S. Arbeloa A.

Production of a dd-carboxypeptidase, which cleaves the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 peptide bond of peptidoglycan precursors, is critical to the activation of the alternate pathway of transpeptidation, because it provides the essential donor substrate of Ldtfm (14Mainardi J.L.

Full elimination of pentapeptide stems ending in d-Ala5 by this dd-carboxypeptidase leads to high level cross-resistance to a second family of antibiotics, the glycopeptides, that bind to the peptidyl-d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors (19Cremniter J.

The β-lactam antibiotics are thought to have a unique type of target consisting of members of the active-site serine acyltransferase family of proteins characterized by a common fold and the presence of conserved amino acid motifs, S*XXK, SXN (or analogue), and KTG (or analogue) (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ldtfm functions on a different peptide bond (l-Lys3-d-Ala4 instead of d-Ala4-d-Ala5) and is structurally unrelated to the PBPs (16Mainardi J.L. Fourgeaud M. Hugonnet J.E. Dubost L.

In this report, we have examined this notion in a critical manner and unexpectedly found that a specific class of β-lactams, the carbapenems (Fig. 1D), is highly active against the mutant M512. We show that Ldtfm is the target of the carbapenems in vivo and that these drugs inactivate the enzyme by acylation of the catalytic cysteine. These results extend the diversity of the targets of β-lactams to include active-site cysteine peptidase of the ld-specificity.

All cultures were performed at 37 °C in brain heart infusion broth or agar (Difco Laboratories). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disk-diffusion assay for representatives of the four main classes of β-lactams, including penams (penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanate, piperacillin, and oxacillin), cephems (cefamandole, cefepime, cefixime, cefoperazone, cefotiam, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime), monobactams (aztreonam), and carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method (13Mainardi J.L. Legrand R. Arthur M. Schoot B. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol.

The exchange reaction was started by adding 25 μl of a solution containing Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala and d-[14C]Ala in the same buffer (final concentrations 5 and 0.15 mm, respectively). Aliquots were taken at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min, boiled at 100 °C for 3 min to stop the reaction, and Ac2-l-Lys-d-[14C]Ala was determined by rp-HPLC as previously described (14Mainardi J.L. Morel V.

The EC50 was defined as the antibiotic concentration that inhibited formation of Ac2-l-Lys-d-[14C]Ala by 50%. The EC50 was defined as the β-lactam concentration that inhibited the reaction by 50% and was deduced from vi/vo = f[I] plots where vi and vo are the velocity in the presence and absence of β-lactam, respectively, and [I] is the final β-lactam concentration.

The reaction mixture was dialyzed against water for 30 min and conserved at –20 °C. Formation of adducts between Ldtfm and meropenem or ertapenem was tested in the same conditions. For electrospray mass spectrometry, 5 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed extemporaneously with 5 μl of acetonitrile and 1 μl of 1% formic acid. The mixture (11 μl) was directly injected into the mass spectrometer (Qstar Pulsar I, Applied Biosystems) using rp-HPLC pumps at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min (acetonitrile 50%, water 49.5%, formic acid 0.5%, per volume). The data were acquired in the positive mode with a capillary voltage of 5200 V and a declustering potential of 20 V. The mass scan range was from m/z 400–2500, and the scan cycle was 1 s. The average mass of proteins and protein-carbapenem adducts was deduced from a total of nine pairs of peaks obtained in three independent experiments, and results were expressed as means and standard deviations. Digestion with trypsin (Proteomics Grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed for 18 h at 37 °C at a trypsin to Ldtfm ratio of 0.05 per mass.

Unexpectedly, activation of ld-transpeptidation pathway in E. faecium M512 did not result in resistance to imipenem, and the other carbapenems (meropenem and ertapenem) retained substantial residual activity. The mutant M512 was resistant to all other β-lactams, although residual activity was observed for third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone (MIC 128 μg/ml). Finally, M512 remained resistant to the monobactam aztreonam, which has no anti-enterococcal activity (data not shown). In Vitro Inhibition of the ld-Transpeptidase Activity of Ldtfm by β-Lactams—The effective concentration of imipenem inhibiting Ldtfm by 50% (EC50) was 0.077 ± 0.003 μg/ml, and full inhibition was detected at 0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 2B). Thus, inhibition of Ldtfm by imipenem could account for the antimicrobial activity of this drug (MIC 0.5 μg/ml). The low antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone against M512 (MIC 128 μg/ml) also correlates with inhibition of Ldtfm, because the EC50 of ceftriaxone was 19 ± 7 μg/ml, and complete inhibition of the enzyme was obtained with 200 μg/ml. The EC50 of ampicillin was >3200 μg/ml in agreement with the lack of antibacterial activity of this antibiotic (MIC > 2000 μg/ml). Ldtfm Is the Target of Imipenem in Vivo—Inhibition of the formation of the l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links by Ldtfm could not be tested in E. faecium M512, because this mutant does not produce low affinity PBP5fm and cannot therefore be grown in the presence of imipenem. To circumvent this problem, we introduced in M512 plasmid pAA20, which encodes PBP5fm and allowed growth of the mutant in the presence of 8 μg/ml of imipenem. In the absence of β-lactam, peptidoglycan manufactured by the resulting strain, M512/pAA20(pbp5fm), contained both d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by dd-transpeptidation and l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by ld-transpeptidation (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). In the presence of ampicillin (128 μg/ml), all multimers contained l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by Ldtfm indicating that all PBPs, including PBP5fm, were inhibited by this high drug concentration (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). In the presence of imipenem (8 μg/ml), cross-links were exclusively generated by the dd-transpeptidase activity of PBP5fm (Table 1 and Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the susceptibility of M512 to imipenem is due to inhibition of the cross-linking activity of Ldtfm by this antibiotic.TABLE 1Composition of the peptidoglycan manufactured by E. faecium M512/pAA20(pbp5fm) in the presence or absence of β-lactamsPeakProposed structureMonoisotopic massAmountsAmpicillinImipenemNone%Monomers ITri417.27.01.410.1 IITetra488.30.52.21.2 IIITri(Asp)532.318.44.518.8 IVPenta559.31.32.8NDaND, not detected.

Open table in a new tab Synergy between Imipenem and Ampicillin—The MIC of ampicillin decreased from >2000 to 16 μg/ml upon addition of a low concentration of imipenem (2 μg/ml). This strong synergistic effect indicates that the dual capacity of E. faecium M512/pAA20(pbp5fm) to manufacture peptidoglycan containing l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 and d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links accounts for growth of the mutant in the presence of either ampicillin or imipenem, respectively, because PBP5fm and Ldtfm provide alternative modes of transpeptidation. However, the combination of ampicillin and imipenem inhibited growth of E. faecium M512/pAA20(pbp5fm), because neither transpeptidase was functional in the presence of both drugs. Mechanism of Inhibition of Ldtfm by Carbapenems—Binding of imipenem to Ldtfm was tested with a fixed concentration of enzyme (34 μm) and different drug concentrations by electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). Formation of an adduct was detected at the lowest concentration of imipenem that was tested (3.4 μm). The relative intensity of the peaks corresponding to the adduct and to the native enzyme matched the molar ratio of imipenem to Ldtfm very closely. Thus, the bulk of the added antibiotic was trapped into the adduct up to the saturation of the protein. To purify the adduct, Ldtfm was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of imipenem and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The adduct and the native protein eluted both as monomers. Electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that the major protein peak corresponded to the protein adduct with only minor amounts of native protein (relative intensity 7%). The latter peak was not increased upon further incubation of the purified protein adduct for 2, 7, 24, and 48 h. These results indicate that the link between imipenem and Ldtfm is stable in solution. The average mass of the Ldtfm-imipenem adduct matched the average mass of the protein incremented by the average mass of imipenem (Table 2). Adducts matching increments of the average mass of meropenem and ertapenem were also detected. For each of the three carbapenems, binding of a single molecule of drug to Ldtfm was observed up to a drug to protein ratio of 10 that corresponds to the highest ratio that was tested. The observed mass increments are compatible with non-covalent binding of the carbapenems to Ldtfm or with formation of a covalent bond involving opening of the β-lactam ring (Fig. 1E). To distinguish between these two possibilities, Ldtfm was incubated with carbapenems and digested with trypsin, and the fragments were analyzed by nano-spray mass spectrometry. Digestion of Ldtfm was expected to generate 14 fragments greater than three residues that were all detected in the trypsin digest of the native protein. Upon addition of imipenem and meropenem, the fragment containing the catalytic Cys residue of Ldtfm (GSHGCINTPPSVMK) was replaced by fragments incremented by the monoisotopic mass of the corresponding carbapenems (Table 3). These results establish that imipenem and meropenem bind covalently to the same fragment of Ldtfm. The fact that the observed mass increments are equal to the mass of the drugs indicates that formation of the covalent adduct involves opening of the β-lactam ring. Substitution of the catalytic Cys442 by Ala (16Mainardi J.L. Fourgeaud M. Hugonnet J.E. Dubost L. Brouard J.P. Ouazzani J. Rice L.B. Gutmann L. Arthur M. J. Biol.

Thus, inactivation of the ld-transpeptidase by carbapenems required a catalytically active protein and is likely to involve formation of a thioester with the catalytic Cys residue (Fig. 1E).TABLE 2Formation of adducts between Ldtfm and carbapenemsCarbapenem (average mass)Average massCalculatedObservedNone (NA)aNA, not applicable.29,009.1829,009.70 ± 0.52Imipenem (299.35)29,308.5329,308.61 ± 0.08Meropenem (383.47)29,392.6529,393.35 ± 0.69Ertapenem (475.52)29,484.7029,484.94 ± 0.41a NA, not applicable.

Activation of the ld-transpeptidation pathway was expected to confer broad spectrum resistance to all β-lactams, because Ldtfm functions with a donor substrate containing a tetrapeptide stem (16Mainardi J.L. Fourgeaud M. Hugonnet J.E. Dubost L. Brouard J.P. Ouazzani J. Rice L.B. Gutmann L. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38146-38152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in contrast to the pentapeptide substrate of the PBPs (6Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 702-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that mimics β-lactam (22Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, screening of a large panel of β-lactams revealed in this study that carbapenems remain active against M512, although this mutant has the capacity to manufacture peptidoglycan independently from the dd-transpeptidase activity of the PBPs. To explore this intriguing phenotype, we first showed that the ld-transpeptidase activity of Ldtfm is inhibited by low concentrations of imipenem (EC50 = 0.077 ± 0.003 μg/ml (Fig. 2)). Ldtfm was fully inhibited in vitro by imipenem at a concentration corresponding to the MIC of the drug (0.5 μg/ml) indicating that the ld-transpeptidase activity of Ldtfm could be the target of imipenem in vivo. To establish this point, it was necessary to show that imipenem fully inhibits the formation of the l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links in the peptidoglycan of E. faecium M512. Toward this aim, we have expressed in M512 the pbp5fm gene encoding low affinity PBP5fm responsible for intrinsic resistance to moderate levels of β-lactams in natural isolates of E. faecium. PBP5fm acted as a surrogate of Ldtfm in the resulting strain, M512/pAA20(pbp5fm), because the peptidoglycan manufactured in the presence of imipenem or ampicillin exclusively contained d-Ala4→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 or l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Thus, the dual capacity of M512/pAA20(pbp5fm) to synthesize peptidoglycan with either Ldtfm or PBP5fm as the lone functional transpeptidase allowed to establish that Ldtfm is the target of imipenem in vivo. Interestingly, Ldtfm and PBP5fm conferred resistance to imipenem and ampicillin if either drug was present in the culture medium although M512/pAA20(pbp5fm) remained susceptible to the combination of imipenem and ampicillin. Combination therapy could therefore be effective in the treatment of bacteria endowed with the alternate modes of transpeptidation. Investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of Ldtfm by imipenem showed that the enzyme bound a stoichiometric amount of the drug (Fig. 4). The Ldtfm-imipenem adduct was stable, because it was purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, bound imipenem could be recovered in a specific tryptic fragment of Ldtfm that contained the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme (Cys442). These results also show that imipenem is covalently bound to Ldtfm. To determine whether formation of the adduct is catalyzed by Ldtfm, imipenem was incubated with the same concentration of enzyme or of a synthetic peptide with the same sequence (338GSHGCINTPPSVMK351) as the tryptic fragment containing the catalytic Cys442 residue (underlined). Mass spectrometry analyses (data not shown) indicated that full modification of Ldtfm occurred in 30 min, whereas no modification of the synthetic peptide was observed in 60 min under the same conditions. Thus, formation of the covalent bond between Ldtfm and imipenem was catalyzed by the enzyme. The mass of the Ldtfm-imipenem adduct was equal to the mass of the free antibiotic plus the mass of the free enzyme (Tables 2 and 3). Opening of the β-lactam ring is therefore the most likely mechanism for formation of the covalent adduct (Fig. 1E), because formation of bonds involving amines, hydroxyls, or carboxyls would lead to the elimination of a water molecule. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the γ sulfur atom of the catalytic Cys442 residue as the nucleophile for attack of the carbonyl of the β-lactam ring, because the Cys442 → Ala substitution totally abolished formation of the adduct. Thus, Ldtfm commits suicide by forming a thioester between Cys442 and carbapenems in a reaction similar to the acylation of the active site serine of dd-transpeptidase by β-lactams (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.-M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Because the initial proposal of Tipper and Strominger (22Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), β-lactams are regarded as molecular mimics of the N-acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine extremity of peptidoglycan precursors, which accounts for the fact that they act as suicide substrates of the dd-transpeptidase module of high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins. However, this could not be confirmed by direct co-crystallization of the dd-transpeptidases with their natural substrates or with the β-lactams, because co-crystals contained the reaction products (23Macheboeuf P. Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Dideberg O. Dessen A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 673-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For this reason, the analogy is only supported by modeling of the conformation of the two types of substrates (6Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 702-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As discussed by Goffin and Ghuysen (6Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 702-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the structural analogy relies on the spatial disposition of the carbonyl and carboxylate groups, but the C–CON–C–COOH bonds are far from being isosteric in the β-lactams and in the terminal d-Ala4-d-Ala5 dipeptide. Considering the classic alignment of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 backbone with β-lactams (Fig. 1), the Cα of d-Ala5 at the C terminus of the natural substrate (Fig. 1A) has a d configuration as the analogous carbon atoms of penams (ampicillin, Fig. 1B). The corresponding carbon is not tetrahedral in cephems (ceftriaxone, Fig. 1C) and carbapenems (Fig. 1D). The carbon atoms mimicking the Cα of d-Ala4 have opposite configuration in carbapenems and in all other β-lactams. This chiral center can be superimposed to an amino acid of the l configuration in ampicillin and ceftriaxone but to an amino acid of the d configuration in carbapenems. Despite the configuration inversion in this carbon, the dd-transpeptidase activity of the PBPs is inhibited by all β-lactams, including carbapenems. Thus, for the PBPs, the structural analogy between the suicide substrates (the β-lactams) and the natural substrates (the peptidoglycan precursors ending d-Ala4-d-Ala5) does not depend upon the configuration of the carbon mimicking the α carbon of d-Ala4. For the ld-transpeptidase, the analogy should be analyzed by aligning the β-lactams with the l-Lys3-d-Ala4 backbone. Paradoxically, the Cα of l-Lys3 can be superimposed to an amino acid of the d configuration in carbapenems and of the l configuration in other β-lactams, despite the fact that only the former antibiotics inactivate Ldtfm. In conclusion, the reactivity of β-lactams for transpeptidases of the ld- and dd-specificities is not principally determined by the configuration of carbons in the antibiotics that mimic the Cα carbons in the l-Lys3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors. It is therefore not surprising that imipenem was reported not to inhibit the ld-carboxypeptidase of E. coli (24Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Höltje J.-V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2064095852,"Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family member that transports glucocorticoids in blood and regulates their access to target cells. The 1.9Å crystal structure of rat CBG shows that its steroid-binding site resembles the thyroxin-binding site in the related serpin, thyroxin-binding globulin, and mutagenesis studies have confirmed the contributions of key residues that constitute the steroid-binding pocket. Unlike thyroxin-bound thyroxin-binding globulin, the cortisol-bound CBG displays an ""active"" serpin conformation with the proteinase-sensitive, reactive center loop (RCL) fully expelled from the regulatory β-sheet A. Moreover, the CBG structure allows us to predict that complete insertion of the proteolytically cleaved RCL into the serpin fold occurs in concert with a displacement and unwinding of helix D that would disrupt the steroid-binding site. This allosteric coupling between RCL positioning and occupancy of the CBG steroid-binding site, which resembles the ligand (glycosamino-glycan)-dependent activation of the thrombin inhibitory serpins heparin cofactor II and anti-thrombin RCLs, ensures both optimal recognition of CBG by target proteinases and efficient release of steroid to sites of action."

Regrettably, the levels of FN present in the tissues of heterozygous null FN and in the pFN null mice have not been reported. We have previously shown that knock-in mice having constitutive inclusion of the EDA exon of the FN gene (EDA+/+ strain) had up to 70-80% reduction in the levels of plasma and tissue FN (17Muro A.F.

Taking advantage of the “floxed” EDA exon present in those mice, we generated liver-specific EDA-null mice (EDA+/+CRE) after crossing EDA+/+ animals with a transgenic strain expressing the CRE recombinase only in hepatocytes (18Kellendonk C. Opherk C. Anlag K. Schutz G. Tronche F. Genesis. 2000; 26: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consequently, hepatocytes of EDA+/+CRE mice, without the EDA exon, were able to produce and secrete pFN at normal levels. We show here that the levels of pFN were restored in those mice and also that the levels of tissue FN were similar to those observed in EDAWT/WT animals. These results showed a major flow of pFN into the extracellular matrix of tissues and suggest the importance of the pFN as an essential source of FN for the tissues. The presented results might have potential significance for understanding the contributions of pFN, and perhaps other plasma proteins, to cellular activities and in the formation of the extracellular matrix of tissues.

Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). EDA+/+ mice were mated with the transgenic strain Tg Alf pCRE mice, which have CRE recombinase under the control of the albumin promoter and enhancer (18Kellendonk C. Opherk C. Anlag K. Schutz G. Tronche F. Genesis. 2000; 26: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). EDA+/WT mice having the CRE recombinase were mated in order to obtain EDA+/+ mice with the CRE transgene (EDA+/+CRE). This strain expresses the CRE recombinase exclusively in hepatocytes (18Kellendonk C. Opherk C. Anlag K. Schutz G. Tronche F. Genesis. 2000; 26: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The genotype of mice was determined by PCR from tail biopsies. RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from freshly extracted tissues and cells as described (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The radioactive RT-PCR reactions were performed and quantified as previously described (20Chauhan A.K. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. Muro A.F. Gene. 2004; 324: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (300 μl/20 g mouse), and organs were perfused with 25 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline through the left ventricle of the heart. Organs were immediately dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Organs were homogenized, and protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Identical amounts of protein sample were run on a 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal rabbit anti-FN antibody (50 μg of protein extract, 1:1500; Sigma), anti-EDA 3E2 monoclonal antibody (100 μg of protein extract, 1:300; Sigma), or anti β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (20 μg of protein extract, E7, 1:3000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) as described (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Three animals per genotype were analyzed. To determine the efficiency of perfusion and elimination of plasma proteins in each of the organs analyzed, a Western blot analysis of 50 μg of protein extract was performed using an anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000; DAKO). Serial ECL expositions of the membranes were performed to determine the optimum linear range to quantify the signals. Films were scanned with the Versadoc (Bio-Rad) and quantified with the help of the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). Bile was collected by holding the gallbladder with forceps. Two μl of each sample were mixed with protein loading buffer (0.125 Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Bile FN was analyzed by Western blot as described above. In Vivo Labeling of Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were purified by the two-step collagenase perfusion method (21Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar), using Liver Digest Medium (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturers. Hepatocytes were plated in rat tail collagen for 1 h, washed, and then incubated for 24 h with Met-Cys-free medium supplemented with 300 μCi/ml of [35S]Met/Cys (ProMix; Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant was collected, and a fraction was affinity-purified with gelatin-Sepharose as described (22Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2825-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Ruoslahti E. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M. Engvall E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: Pt. A, 803-Pt. A, 831Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis of Tissues—DNA was extracted from tissues, and 15 μg were digested with HindIII. The DNA was then run in an agarose gel and blotted onto Z-Probe membrane. A probe corresponding to the exon downstream to the EDA exon was used as described (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of Tissue Sections—Organs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. 4-μm sections of each tissue were cut and incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-FN antibody (1:200; Sigma). Then sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml; VectaStain) followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase mix (ABC Reagent; Vector Laboratories), 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories), and Gill's hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories). An AS LMD Leica microscope was used to visualize and photograph the sections. Hepatocytes of EDA+/+ Mice Have Normal Levels of Extracellular Matrix-FN but Do Not Secrete pFN—We have previously observed that mice having constitutive inclusion of the EDA exon of the FN gene (Fig. 1A) had a significant decrease of FN in plasma and in most tissues (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 20Chauhan A.K. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. Muro A.F. Gene. 2004; 324: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further characterization of pFN levels (embryo, young, and adult mice) from EDA+/+ mice showed very low amounts compared with EDAWT/WT and EDA-/- mice (Fig. 1, B and C). Embryos had 60% of the pFN levels in the control sample, whereas young and adult EDA+/+ mice showed a higher decrease in pFN levels. The decrease in pFN was due neither to lower levels in mRNA in tissues of EDA+/+ mice (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) nor to a reduced FN production by EDA+/+ tissues, as FN secreted by EDA+/+ embryonic fibroblasts or adult heart fibroblasts was similar to that produced by the EDAWT/WT fibroblasts, excluding a general defect (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The specific degradation of FN in the EDA+/+ mice by proteases was ruled out by a series of experiments: 1) Metalloproteinase activity levels in plasma and tissues by gelatin zymography analysis were similar among EDAWT/WT, EDA+/+, and EDA-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B); 2) [35S]Metlabeled fragments of FN containing or not containing the EDA exon were not differentially degraded when incubated with EDAWT/WT or EDA+/+ tissue extracts or plasma in the absence of protease inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D); 3) no increase in FN degradation rate was observed after mixing protein extracts from EDA+/+ or EDAWT/WT liver with those originating from different organs or plasma from EDA+/+ mice in the absence of protease inhibitors (data not shown); 4) Western blot analysis of tissue extracts done with different sets of anti-FN polyclonal antibodies, run on 5-17% gradient gel, did not show any specific degradation products in EDA+/+ mice (data not shown). Because the hepatocytes are the source of pFN (5Owens M.R. Cimino C.D. Blood. 1982; 59: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tamkun J.W. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4641-4647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed metabolic labeling of hepatocyte primary cultures from EDAWT/WT, EDA+/+, and EDA-/- livers followed by FN affinity purification of the conditioned medium to analyze pFN production. We observed a decreased secretion of pFN by the EDA+/+ hepatocytes, suggesting that the reduced levels in pFN in the EDA+/+ mice were the consequence of a defect in hepatocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the FN amounts detected by Western blot in hepatocyte cell extracts were similar (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the decrease of pFN in EDA+/+ embryos (Fig. 1B) but not in embryonic tissues (17Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) confirmed that the deficiency in FN secretion was limited only to EDA+/+ hepatocytes. These results showed that EDA+/+ hepatocytes were unable to secrete pFN in normal amounts. We hypothesized that the reduced levels of tissue FN could be due to the decreased supply of FN from plasma to tissues. Generation of Liver-specific EDA Null Mice—To determine the extent of FN flow into tissues we restored the capacity of hepatocytes to produce pFN not containing the EDA exon by cross-breeding EDA+/+ mice with a transgenic strain expressing the CRE recombinase only in hepatocytes (18Kellendonk C. Opherk C. Anlag K. Schutz G. Tronche F. Genesis. 2000; 26: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The aim was to perform a tissue-specific deletion of the EDA exon without modifying the EDA+ allele in other cell types and tissues (Fig. 3, A and B). Southern blot analysis of different tissues from the EDA+/+ mice carrying the liver-specific CRE recombinase (EDA+/+CRE mice) showed CRE-mediated recombination only in the liver (Fig. 3C). The percentage of recombination in liver was ∼60-70%. Because hepatocytes constitute 60% of the total number of cells present in the liver (24Malarkey D.E. Johnson K. Ryan L. Boorman G. Maronpot R.R. Toxicol. Pathol. 2005; 33: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), one can consider that the percentage of recombination in hepatocytes was close to 100%. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of the EDA exon in the FN mRNA both in liver and purified hepatocytes from EDA+/+CRE mice (Fig. 3D). FN Levels Are Restored in EDA+/+CRE Mice—Tissues and plasma from EDA+/+ mice expressing the hepatocyte-specific CRE recombinase were analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal anti-FN and anti-EDA-specific antibodies. As expected, pFN levels were completely restored in the EDA+/+CRE mice (Fig. 4A). Tissue extracts prepared from EDA+/+CRE mice contained amounts of FN similar to that found in EDAWT/WT mice (Fig. 4A). The amount of FN present in the extra-cellular matrix of tissues from EDA+/+CRE mice that was derived from plasma was ∼60% in testis and ∼40% in other tissues such as brain, heart, and lung (Fig. 4B). These results clearly indicate that an important proportion of the FN present in the extracellular matrix of adult tissues derives from plasma. Consequently, the amount of FN that is synthesized and deposited locally in tissues is much lower than believed. We then used the monoclonal antibody 3E2 to specifically detect the EDA-containing FN isoform. As expected, no EDA+FN was present in the plasma of EDAWT/WT mice. Additionally, we did not detect EDA+FN in the plasma of EDA+/+CRE mice, indicating a high efficiency of CRE-mediated recombination in hepatocytes. The EDA+FN isoform in liver was clearly visible only in the EDA+/+ samples (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-9), confirming again the Southern blot and RT-PCR data (Fig. 3, C and D). The absence of EDA+FN in the plasma of EDA+/+CRE mice also suggests that the FN flow is mainly from plasma to tissues and not vice versa (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). No differences were observed in the levels of EDA+FN in testis (Fig. 5, B and C) and in other tissues (data not shown) between the EDAWT/WT and EDA+/+CRE samples, suggesting that the observed differences in tissue FN among the different genotypes corresponded to EDA-FN incorporated from plasma into the extracellular matrix of tissues. To ensure that the detected levels of FN in tissues were not due to non-complete perfusion of the organs, we performed Western blot analysis of the plasma globulins that remained in each tissue after perfusion and normalized the protein load with the β-tubulin signal. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows that the remaining globulin levels after tissue perfusion were ∼10% of the levels seen in the non-perfused organs. Because most plasma proteins were washed out from the perfused organs, the differences of FN levels among the different strains were not due to residual contamination of pFN. Immunostaining of Tissue Sections Confirmed the Decrease of FN Levels in EDA+/+ Tissues and the Recovery in Tissues of EDA+/+CRE Mice—The above results were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections. Similar levels of FN-specific signal were detected in the sinusoids of liver samples prepared from all three genotypes (Fig. 6, A-C, black arrows). In the brain sections of EDAWT/WT and EDA+/+CRE mice a stronger FN-specific signal, probably associated with the cell surface of glial cells (25Price J. Hynes R.O. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2205-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tom V.J. Doller C.M. Malouf A.T. Silver J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9282-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Yang Z. Suzuki R. Daniels S.B. Brunquell C.B. Sala C.J. Nishiyama A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3829-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), was observed when compared with the EDA+/+ mice (Fig. 6E, white arrows). Similarly, in testis tissue sections, a stronger FN-specific signal was observed in the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules and interstitial regions of EDAWT/WT and EDA+/+CRE mice compared with EDA+/+ samples (Fig. 6H, white arrows). However, we did not observe intracellular accumulation of FN in the tissue sections of EDA+/+ mice by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 6, B, E, and H) or in primary culture of hepatocytes either by FN immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. 3) or by metabolic labeling (Fig. 2D). Gross histology of tissue samples from all three genotypes was similar, suggesting that the FN synthesized locally is sufficient to maintain the normal tissue architecture. These results indicate that there was a flow of FN from plasma to the extracellular matrix of tissues and plasma is an important source of tissue FN. Our data demonstrate an important and novel role for plasma proteins, in particular that of fibronectin, in the formation of the extracellular matrix of tissues and, probably, in the modulation of cellular activities in tissues. The concept that there is FN flow from plasma into tissues or extracellular matrix of cells has been known for a long time. Addition or injection of soluble FN into the culture medium of cells or into the plasma of mice, respectively, resulted in the incorporation of FN into the extracellular matrix (10McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Oh E. Pierschbacher M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35749-35759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the magnitude of the contribution of pFN to the extracellular matrix was not possible to address with either model. In the present report we have shown that in some tissues up to 60% of the fibronectin present in the extracellular matrix could be plasma-derived. Sakai et al. (12Sakai T. Johnson K.J. Murozono M. Sakai K. Magnuson M.A. Wieloch T. Cronberg T. Isshiki A. Erickson H.P. Fassler R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) have recently shown that pFN supports neuronal survival and reduces brain injury following transient focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting the incorporation of pFN into the injured brain. Our results confirmed and extended their observations to non-injured tissues as we showed pFN incorporation into most normal organs, including brain. In fact, we are also demonstrating that this is a general mechanism that occurs in most normal tissues, and we suggest that other plasma proteins could also become incorporated into the extracellular matrix of tissues, modulating cellular activities. Because FN is found both in blood and bile fluids, secretion of FN by hepatocytes seems not to be polarized as proposed for endothelial cells (31Kowalczyk A.P. Tulloh R.H. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also observed a decrease in FN levels in the bile fluid of EDA+/+ mice (data not shown), suggesting the absence of an EDA-dependent polarization of FN secretion in hepatocytes, as postulated for airway epithelial cells (32Wang A. Cohen D.S. Palmer E. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15598-15601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low levels of soluble FN in the plasma of EDA+/+ mice and intermediate levels in EDA+/WT and EDA+/- mice (data not shown) point toward the existence of a mechanism, analogous to that observed for the secretion of the IIICS variants (33Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Wilson C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), that detects the EDA domain during the secretory pathway of pFN from hepatocytes and prevents the release of EDA+FN into the bloodstream. The “defective” EDA+/EDA+ pFN dimers might be formed but their transit through the pFN secretory pathway might be slower compared with EDA-/EDA- dimers. However, immunostaining of tissue sections, immunofluorescence of primary culture of hepatocytes, or metabolic labeling of hepatocytes did not reveal any intracellular accumulation of FN in the liver of EDA+/+ mice, suggesting that the putative “misfolded” dimers are quickly degraded. We observed that the amount of pFN supplied to the extracellular matrix of tissues varied among the different organs analyzed, suggesting that there might be equilibrium between the amount of FN locally produced by the tissues and the availability of cellular receptors to incorporate FN from the plasma pool. To conclude, the presented results might have potential significance for understanding the contributions of pFN, and perhaps other plasma proteins, to cellular activities and in the formation of the extracellular matrix of tissues, as we have shown that a major fraction of tissue FN is plasma-derived. Because plasma provides approximately an equal amount of FN as the tissue itself, we suggest that plasma should be considered an important source of FN for tissues. Furthermore, hepatocytes have normal levels of FN in the extracellular matrix but do not secrete soluble EDA+FN, suggesting the existence of separate secretory pathways for soluble and fibrillar FN.

As dopamine in insects has been strongly implicated in aversive learning, we examined QMP's impact on associative olfactory learning in bees. We found that QMP blocks aversive learning in young workers, but leaves appetitive learning intact. We postulate that QMP's effects on aversive learning enhance the likelihood that young workers remain in close contact with their queen by preventing them from forming an aversion to their mother's pheromone bouquet. The results provide an interesting twist to a story of success and survival."

To gain an insight into the route of MAC removal, human C9 was tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 and traced within live cells. Tagged C9-AF488 was active in lysis of erythrocytes and K562 cells. Upon treatment of K562 cells with antibody and human serum containing C9-AF488, C9-AF488 containing MAC bound to the cells. Within 5–10 min, the cells started shedding C5b-9-loaded vesicles (0.05–1 μm) by outward vesiculation. Concomitantly, C9-AF488 entered the cells and accumulated in a perinuclear, late recycling compartment, co-localized with endocytosed transferrin-Texas Red. Similar results were obtained with fixed cells in which the MAC was labeled with antibodies directed to a C5b-9 neoepitope. Inhibition of protein kinase C reduced endocytosis of C5b-9. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that peripheral, trypsin-sensitive C5b-9 was cleared from cells at a slower rate relative to fully inserted, trypsin-resistant C5b-9. MAC formation is controlled by CD59, a ubiquitously expressed membrane complement regulator. Analysis at a cell population level showed that the amount of C5b-9-AF488 bound to K562 cells after complement activation was highly heterogeneous and inversely correlated with the CD59 level of expression. Efficient C9-AF488 vesiculation was observed in cells expressing low CD59 levels, suggesting that the protective impact of MAC elimination by vesiculation increases as the level of expression of CD59 decreases.

The complement system is a major component of the innate immune system. It efficiently protects the host from pathogenic microorganisms, is involved in immune complex regulation, and serves an important link between innate and adaptive immune responses. Complement comprises a group of more than 30 proteins; most of them participate in the cascade-like activation process, whereas others serve as control proteins or act as cellular receptors (1Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar, 2Sim R.B. Tsiftsoglou S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Initiation of the complement activation cascade may occur through the classical, alternative, or lectin pathways. The three initiation pathways lead to activation of the terminal complement pathway and to assembly of the membrane attack complexes (MACs) 2The abbreviations used are: MAC, complement membrane attack complex; C5b-9, complement terminal complex composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9; C9-AF488, human complement C9 tagged with Alexa Fluor 488; C9D, C9-depleted; HI, heat-inactivated; MVB, multivesicular bodies; NHS, normal human serum; PKC, protein kinase C; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution. that are composed of the complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 (also known as the C5b-9 complexes). Upon formation of C5b-7, C5b-8, and finally C5b-9 complexes, they adhere and then insert into the target cell membrane (3Muller-Eberhard H.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 321-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The C5b-9 complexes may contain 1–18 C9 molecules attached to a C5b-8 complex. When the number of C9 molecules per C5b-8 exceeds 12, they self-polymerize and form a cylinder-shaped transmembrane structure (4Tschopp J. Engel A. Podack E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1922-1928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon its assembly, the MAC expresses neoantigens that can be detected by specific monoclonal antibodies (5Mollnes T.E. Lea T. Harboe M. Tschopp J. Scand. J. Immunol. 1985; 22: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although red blood cells require only one effective MAC to lyse, nucleated cells are killed by complement only after a combined action of several MACs (6Koski C.L. Ramm L.E. Hammer C.H. Mayer M.M. Shin M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3816-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although larger C5b-9 channels containing several C9 are cytolytically more potent than smaller C5b-9 channels, the channel size has only a small influence on the rate of cell death in nucleated cells (7Kim S.H. Carney D.F. Hammer C.H. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid accidental killing by complement, cells utilize several protective strategies, including expression of membrane complement regulatory proteins, such as CD46, CD55, and CD59 that block the activation cascades at specific stages (reviewed in Refs. 8Fishelson Z.

C5b-9 complexes deposited on glomerular epithelial cells in kidneys of rats with experimental membranous nephropathy were found in clathrin-coated pits and also in MVB (20Kerjaschki D. Schulze M. Binder S. Kain R. Ojha P.P. Susani M. Horvat R. Baker P.J. Couser W.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 546-552PubMed Google Scholar). The latter report suggested that C5b-9 complexes deposited in vivo on epithelial cells are endocytosed, packed into MVB, and then released as exocytotic vesicles into the urine. Elimination of the MAC by outward vesiculation or ectocytosis has been described in many cells (19Morgan B.P. Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kerjaschki D. Schulze M. Binder S. Kain R. Ojha P.P. Susani M. Horvat R. Baker P.J. Couser W.G. J.

Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting selective membrane protein and lipid sorting during ectocytosis (23Sims P.J. Wiedmer T.

Release of membrane vesicles from resting and activated cells is ubiquitous and has important biological implications (for a review, see Ref. 27Pilzer D. Fishelson Z. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Vesicles shed directly from the plasma membrane by a process of outward vesiculation were named ectosomes or microparticles. In contrast, vesicles shed by a process involving endocytosis and followed by exocytosis were named exosomes. Some insight into the mechanisms involved in exosome release is beginning to emerge (28Keller S. Sanderson M.P. Stoeck A. Altevogt P. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 107: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism behind direct outward plasma membrane vesiculation is still elusive. Recently, the involvement of the mitochondrial hsp70 (mtHsp70/mortalin/GRP75) in shedding of C5b-9-loaded ectosomes from complement-attacked K562 cells was proposed (27Pilzer D. Fishelson Z. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). That mtHsp70 can bind directly to C9 suggested that mtHsp70 acted as a sensor identifying insertion of C5b-9 complexes into the plasma membrane and facilitating their removal by outward vesiculation (27Pilzer D. Fishelson Z. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to design and utilize a new reagent for an in depth study of the process of outward and inward vesiculation of the C5b-9 complexes. To be able to trace C5b-9 within viable cells, purified human complement C9 was tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 and incorporated into C5b-9 complexes deposited on K562 cells. Data shown here demonstrate rapid shedding of C5b-9 complexes in small vesicles (ectosomes) directly from the cell surface. This is followed by removal of the C5b-9 via an endocytic pathway and its targeting to a late endosomal compartment, probably for degradation and/or exocytosis via MVB. Sera and Reagents—Normal human serum (NHS), used as a source for complement, was prepared from healthy individuals. Heat-inactivated (HI) NHS was prepared by heating NHS for 30 min at 56 °C. Purified human C9 protein was purchased from Complement Technology, Inc. (Tyler, TX). Polyclonal antisera directed to K562 cells were prepared in rabbits and mice, and anti-human C9 antibodies were prepared in goats. Mouse monoclonal antibody directed to a neoepitope in human C5b-9 (clone aE11) was purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antiserum (hemolysin) was purchased from Difco. Complement C9-depleted human serum (C9D-NHS), trypsin l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated from bovine pancreas, Hepes, saponin, and HBSS were purchased from Sigma. GF109203X and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. The activity of these two inhibitors was confirmed in independent, concomitant analyses of their effects on cell lysis and on complement-induced protection (12Kraus S. Seger R. Fishelson Z. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 123: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Kraus S. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (not shown). Transferrin Texas Red-conjugated and Alexa Fluor protein labeling kit were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Lysis and Sublysis—K562, a human erythroleukemic cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) HI fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm pyruvate, and antibiotics mixture (Bio-Lab, Jerusalem, Israel). K562 cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. Briefly, K562 cells were diluted in culture medium and plated at one cell per five wells of a 96-well round bottom plate (Costar, Corning, NY). Wells containing colonies were identified under an inverted microscope (Olympus, Japan). Two K562 clones were expanded (clones A and B). Cytotoxicity assays were performed as described before (29Reiter Y. Ciobotariu A. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with diluted anti-K562 antiserum (rabbit or mouse) for 30 min at 4 °C and then with complement (NHS, C9D-NHS, or HI sera; final concentration 50%) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cell lysis was determined by measuring uptake of trypan blue. In the cell imaging experiments, the cells were first treated with a sublytic dose (yielding 10–20% trypan blue positive cells) of antibody and NHS (or C9D-NHS supplemented with C9 or C9-AF488), washed, and then further incubated at 37 °C for different times. Analysis of Secreted C9—Cells were treated with antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C and then with NHS or HI NHS (50%) for 10 min at 37 °C. Then they were extensively washed with HBSS, resuspended in HBSS, and incubated at 37 °C. At different times, the cells were removed by centrifugation at 250 × g, and the supernatant was further subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein (20 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (50 mm dithiothreitol) on a 10% acrylamide gel and was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk (Tnuva, Rehovot, Israel) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then treated with goat anti-human C9 antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG. Bands were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposed to a SuperRX film (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Tagging C9 with Alexa Fluor 488—C9 was tagged with a fluorescein analogue dye, Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Purified human C9 (5 μg) was treated with the dye reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reagent mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 min, and the unbound dye was removed by using a spin column. The level of fluorescence of tagged C9-AF488 was analyzed in a microplate reader (Spectrafluor plus, Tecan, Austria). Concentration of C9-AF488, relative to serially diluted C9 stock, was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel and densitometric analysis of stained protein bands ( supplemental Fig. S1). Concentration of C9-AF488 was determined to be 21.7 μg/ml. The molar ratio of AF488 to C9 in C9-AF488 was calculated after measuring the fluorescence units of samples of C9-AF488 and of serially diluted AF488 reagent of known concentrations in a microplate reader ( supplemental Table 1 and Fig. S2). Tagged C9-AF488 contained 1.67 mol of fluorophore/mol of C9. Hemolytic Activity of C9-AF488—Antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes were prepared with rabbit hemolysin (Difco) as described before (30Deng J. Gold D. LoVerde P.T. Fishelson Z. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6402-6410Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (1.5 × 107) in 0.1 ml of gelatin/veronal-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (GVB) were incubated with C9-depleted human serum (diluted 1:2,000) and increasing amounts of C9 or C9-AF488 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cold GVB (1 ml) was added to stop lysis, and the cells were removed by centrifugation. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated from the light absorption of the cell supernatants at 412 nm, relative to cells completely lysed by water. C9-AF488 was found to be hemolytically active (Fig. S3). Flow Cytometry Analysis of C5b-9 Deposition—K562 Cells were incubated with a sublytic dose of diluted anti-K562 antiserum for 30 min at 4 °C and then with complement (NHS or HI NHS, 50%) for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, the cells were washed into HBSS and incubated at 37 °C for different times and finally fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. For permeabilization, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml saponin and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml saponin, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% fetal calf serum for 20 min at 4 °C. Permeabilized cells (for measurement of total MAC) and nonpermeabilized cells (for measurement of surface MAC) were labeled with aE11 monoclonal antibody and a second FITC-labeled antibody and analyzed in a FACSort (BD Biosciences). The fluorescence data (7,000 cells) were analyzed by using WinMDI 2.8, and mean fluorescence intensity (G-mean) values were determined. Control cells were treated with second antibody alone. C5b-9 Imaging by Confocal Microscopy—Cells were incubated with sublytic antibody and NHS, HI-NHS, or C9-depleted serum supplemented with C9-AF488 for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, they were washed into HBSS and incubated at 37 °C for different times. In some experiments, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and either permeabilized with saponin or not. The cells were immunolabeled with aE11 or with anti-CD59 and a second FITC-labeled or Cy3-labeled antibody, respectively. Cells were analyzed under a Zeiss laser confocal microscope C-LSM 410 (Oberkochen, Germany). Images and merged images were obtained with the LSM software (Carl Zeiss, GmbH, Germany). For time lapse imaging of viable cells, the cells were treated with sublytic antibody and then with human C9-depleted serum supplemented with C9-Alexa 488 for 0 or 5 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were washed or not with HBSS and placed on a 22-mm coverslip (Assistant, Sondheim, Germany). Time lapse image capturing was started a few seconds after warming of the specimen to 37 °C, in intervals of 10 or 20 s over 10 or 20 min. Images were processed further for display by using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Minimal laser intensities were used for image collection in order to minimize risks of photobleaching and phototoxicity. Analysis of Transferrin Endocytosis—Cells were treated with antibody and complement, as described above. Then they were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) in binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C and further incubated at 37 °C for different times. After washing and fixation, the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy, as described above. Statistical Analysis—Student's two-sided paired t tests were used to determine the statistical significance of differences between various data sets. Results are expressed as arithmetic mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assumed when p < 0.05. Formation of Active C9-AF488—Human C9 protein was tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This C9-AF488 was shown to be hemolytically active when tested with antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (Fig. S3). To test the capacity of C9-AF488 to induce lysis of K562 cells, the cells were treated with anti-K562 antibodies, followed by C9D-NHS or HI-C9D-NHS supplemented with C9-AF488 (to physiological concentration of C9) for 60 min at 37 °C. Whereas C9D-NHS failed to lyse K562 cells (not shown), in the presence of C9-AF488, C9D-NHS induced K562 cell lysis (Fig. 1). The antibody titration curve observed was similar to that we routinely obtain with antibody and NHS. K562 cells were not lysed by HI-C9D-NHS supplemented with C9-AF488 (Fig. 1). Emission of C9-loaded Vesicles—Several cell types have been shown to eliminate the MAC by ectocytosis (outward vesiculation) (19Morgan B.P. Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morgan B.P. Imagawa D.K. Dankert J.R. Ramm L.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3402-3406PubMed Google Scholar, 24Scolding N.J. Morgan B.P. Houston W.A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18205-18212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, C9-AF488 was used to study the kinetics of formation and trafficking of C5b-9-bearing ectosomes. K562 cells were treated with anti-K562 antibodies and then with C9D-NHS supplemented with C9-AF488 for 10 min at 37 °C. As shown before, this treatment yields maximal deposition of C5b-9 on the cells (31Fishelson Z. Reiter Y. Monoclonal Antibody-C3b Conjugates: Killing of K562 Cells and Selection of a Stable Complement Resistant Variant. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, NY1989: 273-282Google Scholar). Next, the cells were incubated in HBSS at 37 °C and analyzed under a confocal microscope. Fluorescence and bright field images showed rapid formation of large vesicles (∼1 μm in diameter) labeled with C9-AF488, at the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Time lapse photography of viable C5b-C9-AF488-labeled cells clearly demonstrated rapid formation and emission of numerous C9-loaded vesicles. Fig. 2B shows formation and release of such an ectosome that lasts about 80 s from budding to pinching off (see also Movie S1). Few cells appeared also to release C9-AF488-loaded vesicles following accumulation of C9-AF488 below the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C; see also Movie S2). Since these cells still did not have clusters of C9-AF488-tagged C5b-9 in MVB (see below), this might represent a novel type of early endocytosis leading to direct vesicle release. Analysis of the sedimentation capacity of the C9 shed from the cells demonstrated that at least 51% of it could be spun down at 100,000 × g, probably attached to membrane vesicles, and became soluble after treatment with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2D). Endocytosis of the C5b-9 Complex—Inward vesiculation of the MAC was examined in viable K562 cells by using C9-AF488 and in fixed/permeabilized cells labeled with the aE11 antibody detecting a neo-C5b-9 antigenic epitope. C9-AF488 was seen inside the K562 cells as early as 5 min after maximal binding and cell washing (altogether 15 min at 37 °C) (Fig. 3). Time lapse photography demonstrated trafficking of C9-AF488-labeled intracellular vesicles from the cell periphery (early endosomal compartment) to a perinuclear compartment, probably the late endosomal region containing the MVB (Fig. 3; also see Movie S3). The MVB compartment reached its maximal size at 15–30 min after cell washing. Similar results were observed with cells treated with antibody and NHS, fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with aE11 that detects the native form of C5b-9 (not shown). This indicated that the rate and mode of clearance of C5b-9 complexes formed with C9-AF488 or native C9 were similar. Intracellular trafficking of C9-AF488 was compared with that of transferrin. C9-AF488 and transferrin-Texas Red entered K562 cells at about the same speed, and both reached the late recycling compartment after 30–40 min (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the fact that the transferrin and the C9 fluorescence merged at the perinuclear region (Fig. 4, B (C9-AF488) and C (aE11 mAb)) indicated that the cells transported the intracellular C5b-9 complexes to the late endosomal MVB-containing region. Even after 40 min, part of the C5b-9 complexes remained on or next to the cell surface (Fig. 4). This finding will be further addressed below. To confirm that cell entry of C9-AF488 required active C9 deposition and C5b-9 formation, we treated cells with heat-inactivated C9-depleted serum or C8-deficient human serum supplemented with C9-AF488 and found no intracellular C9-AF488 (data not shown).FIGURE 4Co-localization of C9-AF488 with transferrin. A, K562 cells treated with sublytic anti-K562 antibodies and then with C9D-NHS + C9-AF488 (10 min at 37 °C) were washed and incubated with transferrin-Texas Red (Tfr-TR) for 30 min on ice. Next, the cells were washed, incubated at 37 °C for 0 or 40 min, and analyzed under a confocal microscope. B, a larger view of a representative cell from A is shown. C, the location of C5b-9 in K562 cells treated with antibody and NHS (10 min), washed, incubated with Tfr-TR, as above, and further incubated at 37 °C for 40 min was determined in fixed/permeabilized cells by immunofluorescent labeling with aE11/FITC second antibody. C5b-9 and transferrin co-localized (Merge) in the perinuclear late recycling endosomal region. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics of Removal of Deposited C5b-9—Activation of the terminal pathway of complement leads to insertion of the C5b-9 complex into the plasma membrane. However, some of the complexes fail to penetrate the plasma membrane but remain attached to the cell surface. Unlike the inserted complexes, surface-attached complexes are sensitive to trypsin treatment (32Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Klump O. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2451-2457PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with sublytic antibody and complement, and the amount of surface-bound C5b-9 complexes was assessed by flow cytometry in viable cells labeled with the aE11 monoclonal antibody. To distinguish between transmembrane and surface-attached C5b-9, we treated C5b-9-bearing cells with trypsin before aE11 staining ( supplemental Fig. S4). At time 0, after 10-min complement treatment at 37 °C, ∼55% of the total deposited C5b-9 was found to be trypsin-sensitive (i.e. exogenously attached to the cell surface) (Fig. 5A). Similar analyses performed after 20, 40, and 60 min showed an increase in the relative amount of the externally attached C5b-9 to 60, 77, and >90%, respectively (Fig. 5A). The rates of elimination of transmembrane and externally attached C5b-9 were calculated based on the mean fluorescence intensities of the aE11/C5b-9 histograms. As shown in Fig. 5B, fully inserted, transmembrane C5b-9 (trypsin-resistant) was eliminated from the cell surface at a faster pace (t½ = 22 min) compared with externally bound (trypsin-sensitive) C5b-9 (t½ = 33 min between 0 and 20 min and 106 min between 20 and 60 min). Elimination half-time of total surface C5b-9 (sensitive and resistant to trypsin) was 38 min. Endocytosis of C5b-9 Is a PKC-dependent, ERK-independent Process—PKC and ERK are known to play a role in protection of K562 cells from complement-mediated damage (12Kraus S. Seger R. Fishelson Z. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 123: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Kraus S. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Carney D.F.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Possible involvement of PKC and/or ERK in endocytosis of C5b-9 was next examined. K562 cells were pretreated with 10 μm GF109203X (a specific PKC inhibitor) or PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor) or with Me2SO as control and were then treated with sublytic anti-K562 antibodies and with NHS. Next, the cells were labeled with aE11 monoclonal antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry as described. Total amount of C5b-9, inside the cells and on the cell surface, was determined by staining of fixed/permeabilized cells with aE11. The amount of surface-bound C5b-9 complexes was determined with viable cells labeled with the aE11 monoclonal antibody. The amount of intracellular C5b-9 was derived by subtraction of the mean fluorescence intensities of the surface bound aE11/C5b-9 from the total bound C5b-9. Preliminary analysis demonstrated that ove"
https://openalex.org/W2050933499,"We have investigated the assembly of FtsZ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbFtsZ). Electron microscopy confirmed the previous observation that MtbFtsZ assembled into long, two-stranded filaments at pH 6.5. However, we found that assembly at pH 7.2 or 7.7 produced predominantly short, one-stranded protofilaments, similar to those of Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). Near pH 7, which is close to the pH of M. tuberculosis cytoplasm, MtbFtsZ formed a mixture of single- and two-stranded filaments. We developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to measure the kinetics of initial assembly and the dynamic properties at steady state. Assembly of MtbFtsZ reached a plateau after 60–100 s, about 10 times slower than EcFtsZ. The initial assembly kinetics were similar at pH 6.5 and 7.7, despite the striking difference in the polymer structures. Both were fit with a cooperative assembly mechanism involving a weak dimer nucleus, similar to EcFtsZ but with slower kinetics. Subunit turnover and GTPase at steady state were also about 10 times slower for MtbFtsZ than for EcFtsZ. Specifically, the half-time for subunit turnover in vitro at pH 7.7 was 42 s for MtbFtsZ compared with 5.5 s for EcFtsZ. Photobleaching studies in vivo showed a range of turnover half-times with an average of 25 s for MtbFtsZ as compared with 9 s for EcFtsZ.

FtsZ, a bacterial homologue of tubulin, is the major cytoskeletal protein in bacterial cell division. FtsZ from most bacterial species assembles into single straight protofilaments in vitro, and these assemble further in vivo to form the cytokinetic Z-ring.

Recently we developed two assays to study the kinetics of E. coli FtsZ in vitro. One is based on the tryptophan mutant, FtsZ-L68W, which showed a 2.5-fold increase in fluorescence upon assembly (4Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The other is a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based assay (1Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both assays showed that assembly of EcFtsZ is a cooperative process with a weak dimer nucleus. Initial assembly was very fast and reached a plateau within 5 to 10 s. The FRET assay was used to monitor the rate of subunit exchange at steady state by mixing preassembled donor and acceptor EcFtsZ. The half-time for exchange was about 7 s, very close to the 8–9 s in vivo turnover measured by FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) (3Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus every protofilament in the Z ring, or in a steady state mixture in vitro, is disassembling and reassembling with a 7–9 s half-time. Tuberculosis is the single greatest cause of death in humans by a bacterium. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 3 million people each year die from tuberculosis. Several reports have already studied FtsZ as a promising target for new antibacterial drug discovery, some of them with a particular interest in the FtsZ of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbFtsZ) (5Margalit D.N.

MtbFtsZ has been studied previously and was reported to differ from EcFtsZ in several respects (8White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Leung A.K. Lucile White E. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. DeVito J.A. Borhani D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to the short, one-stranded protofilaments of EcFtsZ, MtbFtsZ assembled into long, two-stranded filaments. The kinetics of initial assembly, assayed by light scattering, were reported to be much slower than those of EcFtsZ. Dynamics at steady state were not examined. Because our FRET assay has several important advantages over light scattering, we used it to study the kinetics and assembly dynamics of MtbFtsZ. MtbFtsZ Purification-pSAR1 is a pET15 vector expressing a His-tagged MtbFtsZ (10Rajagopalan M. Atkinson M.A. Lofton H. Chauhan A. Madiraju M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We expressed the protein in BL21-pLysS and prepared a bacterial lysate as described previously (4Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The His-tagged MtbFtsZ protein in Talon buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.4) was passed over a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech Laboratories) and eluted with the same buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. After dialysis against the Talon buffer, 2 units/ml thrombin was added to remove the His tag. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The sample was mixed with Talon beads again to remove any remaining His-tagged MtbFtsZ. The sample was dialyzed into column buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) and further purified on a Source 15Q 10/10 column (GE Healthcare), eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm KCl in column buffer. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and stored at –80 °C. Protein Labeling-MtbFtsZ has a single cysteine, Cys-155, at the position of E. coli Val-157. This location is not near any known protofilament interface, and so we used this site to attach a fluorescent label. Donor FtsZ was prepared by reacting with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) and acceptor with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR; Molecular Probes). Reactions contained a 5-fold excess of probe and were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a pH 7.9 Tris buffer. Samples were dialyzed three times against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KAc, 2.5 mm MgAc, and 1 mm EGTA to remove free probe. A cycle of calcium assembly and disassembly was done to remove any inactive protein and remaining free probe, as described by Chen and Erickson (1Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein was resuspended in the desired buffer and stored at –80 °C. The labeling efficiency was 30–40% for each fluorophore. Most of the buffers used for assembly contained 100 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc, and 1 mm EGTA. The pH 6.5 and 6.7 buffers contained 50 mm MES; pH 6.9 and 7.2 buffers had 50 mm MOPS; and pH 7.4 and 7.7 buffers had 50 mm HEPES. Electron Microscopy-Negative stain electron microscopy was used to visualize MtbFtsZ filaments. About 10 μl of MtbFtsZ in the appropriate buffer was incubated with GTP for 5–10 min and applied to a carbon-coated copper grid. Grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and specimens were imaged with a Philips 301 electron microscope at ×50,000 magnification. GTPase Activity Measurement-GTPase activity was determined by an improved sensitivity malachite green assay (11Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) as described in detail by Redick et al. (12Redick S.D. Stricker J. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and Light-scattering Measurements-Kinetics data were measured using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer. For fluorescence measurements, the samples were excited at 450 nm and detected at 515 nm. For light scattering, the samples were both excited and measured at 350 nm. Because the assembly was slow we did not use a stopped flow device. For kinetic measurements assembly was initiated by adding GTP to 200 μm and pipetting to mix rapidly. The measurement started immediately after GTP was added. To assay for FtsZ filament exchange, donor- and acceptor-labeled FtsZ were assembled separately for 2 min in 0.5 mm GTP. Equal volumes of the two polymer samples were mixed, and measurement was begun. To measure GDP-induced disassembly, a mixture of acceptor and donor protein was first assembled in 0.1 mm GTP, and the fluorescence measurement was begun after adding 2 mm GDP. Kinetic Modeling-The MtbFtsZ assembly kinetics data were fit using the minimal kinetic model described previously for EcFtsZ (1Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This model has three steps: monomer activation, formation of a dimer nucleus, and elongation. The data were fit using the programs KINSIM40 and FITSIM40 (13Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 14Zimmerle C.T.

Growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis Cultures-Merodiploid M. smegmatis strain mC2-79 carries the plasmid pJFR79 (Pami:ftsZsmeg-GFP), which expresses MsmFtsZ-GFP (17Dziadek J. Rutherford S.A. Madiraju M.V. Atkinson M.A. Rajagopalan M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Strain mC2-11 carries plasmid pJFR11 (Pami:ftsZtb-GFP), which expresses MtbFtsZ-GFP (18Dziadek J. Madiraju M.V. Rutherford S.A. Atkinson M.A. Rajagopalan M. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Strains were maintained as freezer stocks at –80 °C and streaked onto plates of 7H10 Middlebrook agar supplemented with albumin-dextrose complex and 50 μg/ml kanamycin 4 days prior to use in a FRAP experiment. After 3 days, one colony of M. smegmatis cells was transferred into liquid medium (7H9 Middlebrook broth supplemented with albumin-dextrose complex and 0.05% Tween 80 plus 50 μg/ml kanamycin) and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The following day, cultures were diluted to OD ∼ 0.1 and grown for 4–6 h before undergoing FRAP microscopy. Microscopy and in Vivo FRAP Measurements-Culture samples of 4–5 μl were applied to the surface of 1% agarose pads and then covered with a coverslip, as in our most recent FRAP studies (3Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged, and FRAP experiments were performed on a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a laser source and driven by Metamorph software as described previously (2Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J.

All images and FRAP measurements were taken at room temperature. Exposures were typically 500 ms, and laser bleach pulses were 100 ms. Measurements of integrated fluorescence intensity in the bleached and other regions at each time point were made in Metamorph and exported to Microsoft Excel. For each measured region, background intensity was subtracted, and a correction factor was applied for overall photobleaching of the sample during observation (determined from intensity over time of a control cell in the same field). Recovery half-times were determined by performing a least-squares fit to a single-exponential equation as described previously (3Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). MtbFtsZ Assembles into Different Filamentous Structures Depending on pH-The previous study of MtbFtsZ reported assembly into long, two-stranded filaments (8White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), in contrast to the much shorter, one-stranded protofilaments of EcFtsZ (1Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The study of MtbFtsZ used an assembly buffer at pH 6.5. We confirmed that MtbFtsZ assembly gave a predominantly long, two-stranded filaments at pH 6.5 (Fig. 1a). Even in the early stages, the assembly consisted predominantly of short two-stranded filaments. Single protofilaments were also found, but they were rare. However, we found that at pH 7.7 MtbFtsZ assembled predominantly into short, one-stranded protofilaments, very similar to those of EcFtsZ (Fig. 1c). At intermediate pH, between 6.7 and 7.4, MtbFtsZ formed a mixture of two-stranded and one-stranded filaments (Fig. 1b). If we added 10 mm calcium to the pH 7.7 assembly buffer, we obtained long, two-stranded filaments or multistranded bundles. If we increased the KAc from 100 to 350 mm at pH 7.7, about half of the filaments were two-stranded (not shown). Kinetics of Initial Assembly of MtbFtsZ-We labeled MtbFtsZ with fluorescein as donor and with TMR as acceptor. We first tested whether the fluorophore labeling had any effect on assembly using the light-scattering assay at pH 6.5. Fig. 2 shows that there was only a small decrease in the assembly plateau measured by light scattering after labeling with fluorescein or TMR, and there was no significant change in kinetics. We then mixed equal parts donor and acceptor and assayed assembly by FRET using the decrease in donor fluorescence as the measure of FRET. Donor fluorescence showed a rapid 3–4% decrease after mixing and before adding GTP. This may reflect a weak dimer formation. This decrease occurred within 1 s (data not shown). Following the addition of GTP, donor fluorescence slowly dropped by 20%, which we attributed to the assembly of filaments (Fig. 2, curve e). The kinetics measured by FRET are very similar to those measured by light scattering. We also checked the labeled protein by electron microscopy and found similar structures assembled by labeled and unlabeled protein (data not shown). Fig. 3a shows the FRET assay of assembly kinetics of 7 μm total MtbFtsZ in three different pH buffers: pH 6.5, pH 6.9, and pH 7.7. The initial donor fluorescence before assembly was higher at pH 7.7 than at pH 6.5, consistent with the well established sensitivity of fluorescein emission to pH (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). We therefore normalized the fluorescence of each curve to the value before adding GTP. The kinetics of MtbFtsZ are slow at all three values of pH, requiring 60–100 s to reach a plateau. This is 10 times slower than assembly of EcFtsZ. The total change in donor fluorescence was significantly larger at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.7. This may be related to the structures of the polymers. In the two-stranded filaments assembled at pH 6.5, FRET can occur from one strand to the other, as well as along each strand. Because the excitation and emission spectra of fluorescein overlap, fluorescein-labeled MtbFtsZ in the absence of acceptor can produce a homo-FRET or quenching signal. This is shown in Fig. 3b. The homo-FRET signal is barely detectable at pH 7.7 but is substantial (9% decrease) at pH 6.5. The Förster distance is 4.0 nm for fluorescein homo-FRET versus 5.5 nm for fluorescein-rhodamine FRET. Because the subunit spacing is 4.3 nm along the filament, homo-FRET may be small for one-stranded filaments and stronger across the two-stranded filament. This signal would be especially strong if the labeled Cys-155 residues were facing each other across the center of the two-stranded filament. We concluded that some fraction of the total FRET signal in Fig. 3a was due to homo-FRET of the fluorescein donor, but this did not affect our interpretation. We used the drop in donor fluorescence as a measure of relative assembly, and it is not important whether the decrease was generated by hetero- or homo-FRET. Fig. 3c shows the total change in donor fluorescence from time zero to the plateau, measured at 120 s. (The curves in Fig. 3a show a continuous slow decrease after 120 s. This may be because of an enhanced FRET produced by bundling protofilaments or by bleaching. For the present purpose we have ignored this and defined 120 s as the end point of the primary assembly reaction.) The plots show the characteristic feature of a critical concentration, which is 2 μm at pH 6.5 and 3.2 μm at pH 7.7. The different slopes of the lines reflect the difference in absolute FRET signal due to pH noted above and cannot be interpreted quantitatively. Steady State GTPase Activity of MtbFtsZ-The GTPase activity of MtbFtsZ was much lower than that of EcFtsZ at all pH values. Because the GTPase is zero below the critical concentration, we calculated the hydrolysis rate (GDP FtsZ–1 min–1, Table 1) relative to the FtsZ concentration above the critical concentration (12Redick S.D. Stricker J. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Note that these rates were determined at room temperature. Because our previous GTPase assays were mostly at 37 °C, we compared the rates at the two temperatures for a single preparation of EcFtsZ. The GTPase of EcFtsZ was 2- or 3-fold lower at 22 °C than at 37 °C. This is similar to the previous results of de Boer et al. (21de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), who reported that the GTPase of EcFtsZ is 2-fold higher at 37 °C than at 30 °C.TABLE 1Summary of GDP-induced disassembly, subunit turnover, and GTPase at steady statepHGDP disassembly t½Turnover t½GTPase1/GTPasessGTP FtsZ-1 min-1sE. coli 6.5684 ± 215 7.745.57 ± 18.6M. tuberculosis 6.5131(163)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over.(0.08)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over. ± 0.02(750)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over. 6.951(80)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over.(0.26 ± 0.05)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over.(230)aTurnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over. 7.728420.8 ± 0.275a Turnover numbers for MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 6.9 are in parentheses because turnover was limited in extent; 1/GTPase numbers are exaggerated for these cases because they are based on total FtsZ, including the subunits that are not turning over. Open table in a new tab MtbFtsZ hydrolyzed 0.8 and 0.08 GTP/FtsZ/min at pH 7.7 and 6.5 (Fig. 3d, Table 1). In our previous study of EcFtsZ mutants we considered a value of 0.13 to be the noise from contaminating GTPases (12Redick S.D. Stricker J. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we believe the 0.08 value measured here is valid because the His tag provided an extra step of purification, eliminating most of the contaminating GTPases. Previous studies of MtbFtsZ at pH 6.5 have reported values of 0.04 ((8White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (a much lower value was quoted in the text, but we calculated this value from the 13 μm curve in their Fig. 8) and 0.13 (10Rajagopalan M. Atkinson M.A. Lofton H. Chauhan A. Madiraju M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), both in good agreement with our measurement. The data in Table 1 show that MtbFtsZ hydrolyzes GTP 50 and 9 times slower than does EcFtsZ at pH 6.5 and 7.7. Kinetics Analysis: MtbFtsZ Assembly Is Cooperative with a Weak Dimer Nucleus-We measured assembly kinetics over a range of protein concentration at both pH 6.5 and 7.7 (Fig. 4). Assembly at both pH 6.5 and 7.7 could be fit with the same kinetic model that fit EcFtsZ. This comprised three steps: monomer activation, formation of a weak dimer nucleus, and elongation (see Scheme 1 under “Experimental Procedures”). The model and fitting procedure are described in detail in our previous papers (1Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The main difference between EcFtsZ and MtbFtsZ (at pH 7.7) is that MtbFtsZ has a much slower rate constant for elongation. Table 2 lists the kinetic parameters derived from the fitting and compares them to the parameters determined previously for EcFtsZ.TABLE 2Comparison of the kinetic parameters, critical concentration (Cc), and GTPase activity of MtbFtsZ and EcFtsZParametersMtbFtsZEcFtsZ-F268CaData are taken from our previous study (1).MMK (pH 6.5)HMK (pH 7.7)HMK (pH 7.7)k1 (s-1)0.100.210.38k2 (μm-1 s-1)0.500.620.72k-2 (s-1)2347352.0199.6ke (μm-1 s-1)0.950.206.63k-e (s-1)1.17 (1.9)bCalculated from k-e = ke Cc.0.41 (1.3)bCalculated from k-e = ke Cc.4.0 (8.0)bCalculated from k-e = ke Cc.k-2/k2 (μm)4694567.7277.2k-e/ke (μm)1.222.050.60Cc (μm)2.03.21.2a Data are taken from our previous study (1Chen Y.

Open table in a new tab Protofilament Dynamics at Steady State-A particular advantage of the FRET assay is that it can measure assembly dynamics and subunit turnover at steady state. We did two experiments to measure the assembly dynamics of MtbFtsZ at steady state. First, we induced disassembly by adding a 20-fold excess of GDP, which blocks the reassembly reaction and lets one observe the rate of disassembly. During the depolymerization processes, FRET is lost and donor fluorescence increases. The depolymerization of MtbFtsZ fit a single exponential decay (Fig. 5a), F(t) = Feq +ΔF·e–t/τ (where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t, Feq is the final equilibrium fluorescence, ΔF is the change in fluorescence from time zero to equilibrium, and τ is the characteristic decay time; the half-time of the reaction is t½ = τ·ln2). The decay half-time was 28 s at pH 7.7 and increased to 131 s at pH 6.5 (Fig. 5a). In a similar experiment EcFtsZ showed a halftime of 4 s (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). The second experiment directly measured the subunit turnover at steady state by mixing separate pools of preassembled donor and acceptor protofilaments. Initially there was no FRET (except for some homo-FRET by fluorescein) because the donors and acceptors were on separate protofilaments. FRET developed as the protofilaments disassembled and reassembled into mixed polymers. Fig. 5b shows the change in the FRET signal over time in three different pH buffers: pH 6.5, 6.9, and 7.7. These curves were all fit well by single-exponentials. The half-time of MtbFtsZ turnover was about 42 s at pH 7.7 and 163 s at pH 6.5. The turnover of EcFtsZ was much faster with a half-time of 5 s at pH 7.7 (Fig. 5b, bottom panel). Also, we found that at pH 6.5 only about half of the MtbFtsZ subunits exchanged. Thus, in addition to the slow turnover, half of the subunits remained stably in their original two-stranded filaments and did not exchange. We repeated these experiments with different total concentrations of protein. We expected turnover to be independent of the total FtsZ concentration, because once the assembly has reached steady state all protofilaments will reassemble from the pool of subunits at the steady state concentration. We tested both the GDP-induced disassembly and the subunit turnover at 7, 10, and 15 μm MtbFtsZ. The rates were essentially identical at the three concentrations (at pH 7.7 and 7, 10, and 15 μm MtbFtsZ, the half-times for GDP-induced disassembly were 28, 28, and 25 s and turnover was 42, 42, and 41 s, respectively). In Vivo Dynamics of the Z-ring in M. smegmatis-We used FRAP to examine the dynamics of MtbFtsZ polymers in vivo. As we were not able to culture M. tuberculosis strains directly for this study, instead we performed FRAP on two strains of M. smegmatis. Both strains express M. smegmatis FtsZ (MsmFtsZ) from the genome. The first strain, mC2-79, also expresses MsmFtsZ fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) for detection purposes, and the second strain, mC2-11, expresses MtbFtsZ fused to GFP. When induced by acetamide, the FtsZ-GFP level was higher than that from genomic expression (17Dziadek J. Rutherford S.A. Madiraju M.V. Atkinson M.A. Rajagopalan M.

Cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1), a possible cytokine candidate with unknown function that was originally identified in bone marrow-derived CD34-positive cells, was selected for functional characterization. In view of the initial observation that Cytl1 is predominantly expressed in chondrocytes and cartilage, we investigated its possible role in chondrogenesis and hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Cytl1 expression was very low in mesenchymal cells, dramatically increased during chondrogenesis, and decreased during hypertrophic maturation, both in vivo and in vitro. The role of Cytl1 in chondrogenesis and hypertrophic maturation was examined by treating chondrifying mesenchymal cells with exogenous Cytl1 or ectopic expression of Cytl1. Notably, exogenous Cytl1 caused chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells during micromass culture. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Cytl1 additionally induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells. However, Cytl1 did not affect the hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Cytl1 exerted its chondrogenic effect via stimulation of Sox9 transcriptional activity. In addition, Cytl1 caused expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, which has a capacity to induce chondrogenesis. Thus, our results collectively suggest that chondrocyte-specific Cytl1 regulates chondrogenesis as a novel autocrine factor, but not hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes during cartilage development.

Notably, exogenous Cytl1 caused chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells during micromass culture. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Cytl1 additionally induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells. However, Cytl1 did not affect the hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Cytl1 exerted its chondrogenic effect via stimulation of Sox9 transcriptional activity. In addition, Cytl1 caused expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, which has a capacity to induce chondrogenesis. Thus, our results collectively suggest that chondrocyte-specific Cytl1 regulates chondrogenesis as a novel autocrine factor, but not hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes during cartilage development. Cartilage formation during embryonic development begins with the aggregation of mesenchymal cells, which ultimately differentiate into chondrocytes. Differentiated chondrocytes proliferate rapidly and secrete a cartilage-specific extracellular matrix such as type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycan to form cartilage. The cartilage serves as a template for endochondral ossification, which requires the maturation of hypertrophic chondrocytes (1Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J.

These sequential events during chondrogenesis and cartilage formation are precisely regulated by various growth factors released from cartilage elements and perichondrium.

Cytl1 is a functionally unknown cytokine candidate originally cloned from bone marrow and cord blood mononuclear cells that bear the CD34 surface marker (9Liu X. Rapp N. Deans R. Cheng L. Genomics. 2000; 65: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies report Cytl1 mRNA and protein expression in cartilaginous tissues, including mouse inner ear and human articular cartilage, respectively (10Ficker M. Powles N. Warr N. Pirvola U.

Alignment of the predicted primary amino acid sequences of Cytl1 proteins from multiple species (human, mouse, chicken, and puffer) reveals an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and four α-helices, a common characteristic of cytokines.

Our findings clearly indicate that Cytl1 regulates chondrogenesis, but not hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes during cartilage development. Tissue Preparation and Cell Culture—Mouse tissues and rib cartilage were obtained from 4-week-old male ICR mice and 3-day-old newborn mice, respectively. Mouse limb buds were prepared from forelimb buds of mouse embryos at the indicated embryonic day. Mouse rib chondrocytes were prepared from 3-day-old newborn ICR mice, as described previously (12Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsaranta M. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, cartilaginous rib cages were preincubated for 45 min in 0.2% type II collagenase (381 units/mg solid; Sigma) and rinsed with PBS. Tissues were further dissociated enzymatically for 4 h in 0.2% type II collagenase. Isolated chondrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Mesenchymal cells were isolated from the limb buds of 11.5 dpc ICR mouse embryos and maintained as micromass culture to induce chondrogenesis and hypertrophic maturation (13Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Ziran N. Goater J.J. Schwarz E.M. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Zuscik M. Drissi H. O'Keefe R.J. Bone (Elmsford). 2004; 34: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.0 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (2:3) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin were spotted as 15-μl drops on culture dishes to induce chondrogenesis for 6 days. The culture medium was altered to DMEM/F-12 (2:3) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, to induce hypertrophic maturation up to 15 days. Chondrogenesis was determined by examining the expression of collagen IIB and aggrecan by RT-PCR, as described below, or Alcian blue staining to detect accumulation of sulfated proteoglycans (15Oh C.D.

Hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes was determined by examining the expression of markers, such as collagen X and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or Alizarin Red staining to detect mineralization (13Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Ziran N. Goater J.J. Schwarz E.M. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Zuscik M. Drissi H. O'Keefe R.J. Bone (Elmsford). 2004; 34: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors and Reporter Gene Assay—Cytl1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number EF108311) was subjected to RT-PCR amplification from mouse rib chondrocytes using specific primers (Table 1) designed to introduce EcoRI and XhoI restriction sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The resulting cDNA was cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3.1(+) Myc/His vector (Invitrogen). A reporter gene containing the 48-bp Sox9-binding site in the first intron of human COL2A1 was constructed by inserting the chemically synthesized sequence in the pGL3-promoter luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI), as described previously (16Hwang S.G. Yu S.S. Poo H. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29780-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Sox9 reporter gene was transfected into a suspension of isolated mesenchymal cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection with pGL3-control or pGL3-Sox9 reporter gene for 2 h, mesenchymal cells were spotted and maintained as micromass culture in complete medium for 12 h, and treated with IGF-1 or Cytl1-conditioned medium in serum-free conditions, as described for each experiment. For the reporter gene assay, the Sox-9 reporter gene (1 μg) was co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector (0.3 μg) as an internal control to ensure transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity, as described previously (16Hwang S.G. Yu S.S. Poo H. Chun J.S. J. Biol.

One day after transfection, cells were subcultured and selected by adding 0.8 mg/ml G418. Cytl1 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Following growth to 90% confluency, control and Cytl1-expressing L929 cells were washed and maintained in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. Conditioned media were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, followed by filtration (0.2 μm pore size), and concentrated 30 times by ultrafiltration in Amicon stirred cells (Millipore) using a YM membrane with a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff. Construction and Infection of Lentivirus—Lentivirus bearing mouse Cytl1 was constructed by the Macrogen LentiVector Institute (Seoul, Korea). Briefly, the Cytl1 gene fragment was amplified from pcDNA3.1-Cytl1-myc/his vector by PCR. A Cytl1-specific primer set (Table 1) was designed to tag Myc sequences at the C terminus of the gene. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI-ClaI and inserted into a lentiviral vector (Lenti-mCMV-IRES-puro) containing the mouse cytomegalovirus promoter and a puromycin-resistant gene, using the internal ribosome entry site system. The constructed transfer vector, a vesicular stomatitis virus-G expression vector, and a gag-pol expression vector were co-transfected into 293T cells at a 1:1:1 molar ratio using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The culture supernatant containing viral particles was harvested at 48 h after transfection, clarified with a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Nalgene, New York, NY), and stored at -70 °C. The titer obtained (∼1-5 × 107 transduction units) was used without further concentration. Titers were determined using human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mesenchymal cells were maintained as micromass culture for 24 h and infected with mock lentivirus or Cytl1 lentivirus for 18 h. Infected cells were cultured for up to 5 days in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium. siRNA and shRNA—Five siRNA and two shRNA were used to knock down Cytl1 expression in chondrifying mesenchymal cells during micromass culture. Briefly, siRNAs were designed based on the coding sequence of mouse Cytl1 (supplemental Fig. 3), and siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Samchully Pharm (Daejeon, Korea) as follows: siRNA1, 5′-aua cca uca uga acu ccu utt-3′ (sense) and 5′-aag gag uuc aug aug gua utt-3′ (antisense); siRNA2, 5′-ggc uuu acc ugg aca ucc att-3′ (sense) and 5′-ugg aug ucc agg uaa agc ctt-3′ (antisense); siRNA3, 5′-uga cug cag ugc cuu aga att-3′ (sense) and 5′-uuc uaa ggc acu gca guc att-3′ (antisense); siRNA4, 5′-gga cuu ggu auu ccu cuc att-3′ (sense) and 5′-uga gag gaa uac caa guc ctt-3′ (antisense); and siRNA5, 5′-gcc gug aga uca ugg cag att-3′ (sense) and 5′-ucu gcc aug auc uca cgg ctt-3′ (antisense). After heating the siRNA oligonucleotides for 2 min at 90 °C to denature secondary structures within single strands, the sense and antisense strands were allowed to anneal at 30 °C for 1 h. Two shRNA constructs for Cytl1 were obtained from Openbiosystems Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The target sequences are 5′-gga agc tgt ata cca tca tg-3′ (shRNA1) and 5′-gct tta cct gga cat cca taa-3′ (shRNA2). Mesenchymal cells were maintained as micromass culture for 12 h and transfected for 6 h with siRNA or shRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Arrest-In™ transfection reagent (Openbiosystems), respectively. Transfected cells were cultured for up to 4 days in serum-free medium. Nonsilencing siRNA (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) and shRNA (Openbiosystems) were used as a negative control. In Situ Hybridization—Forelimb buds of 14.5 dpc mouse embryos and spots of micromass culture were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 18 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into 4-μm sections, as described previously (17Ryu J.H. Kim S.J. Kim S.H. Oh C.D. Hwang S.G. Chun C.H. Oh S.H. Seong J.K. Huh T.L. Chun J.S. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Ryu J.H. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For hybridization, dewaxed paraffin sections of prepared samples were pretreated with HCl and proteinase K, followed by acetylation. Sections were incubated with hybridization buffer containing denatured sense or antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. Next, sections were treated with RNase A and processed with an anti-digoxigenin detection assay kit (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridization signals were visualized with a solution of 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-iodolyl phosphate (Roche Diagnostics). Digoxigenin-conjugated riboprobes for collagen IIB, collagen X, and Cytl1 were synthesized using the digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, the cDNA fragments of mouse collagen IIB and collagen X were amplified by PCR using specific primers designed to introduce HindIII (sense) and EcoRI (antisense) restriction sequences at the 5′ end (Table 1). The cDNA fragments were digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The cDNA sequences of mouse Cytl1 inserted in the pcDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen) were digested with PstI and SacI. Digested collagen IIB and collagen X and Cytl1 cDNA sequences were cloned into the pSPT-18 vector (Roche Diagnostics), linearized with EcoRI or HindIII digestion, and transcribed with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase to generate sense and antisense probes, respectively. RT-PCR Analysis and Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Woodlands, TX) and reverse-transcribed with ImProm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega). The cDNA generated was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Primers and conditions for amplification are summarized in Table 1, and qRT-PCR was performed using a chromo 4 cycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara Bio). qRT-PCRs were performed in duplicate, and the amplification signal from the target gene was normalized against that of glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the same reaction. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated with a single-step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next, total RNA (3 μg) was fractionated on formaldehyde/agarose gels. The probe (417 bp) for Cytl1 transcripts was generated by RT-PCR using a sense primer corresponding to nucleotides +1 to +21 and an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotides +399 to +417 of Cytl1. For Western blotting, whole cell lysates prepared as described previously (16Hwang S.G. Yu S.S. Poo H. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29780-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Ryu J.H. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-type II collagen (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-1 (BD Biosciences), anti-Sox9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Myc-tagged (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) antibodies were employed to detect proteins. Micro Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Cytl1—Mouse rib chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM. After growth to 90% confluency, chondrocytes were washed and maintained in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. Supernatant fractions prepared from chondrocytes were precipitated using the trichloroacetic acid/acetone method. Proteins from the precipitated supernatant were reduced, alkylated, and trypsin-digested, as described previously (19Kim J.S. Park Z.Y. Yoo Y.J. Yu S.S. Chun J.S. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, digested proteins were loaded onto fused silica capillary columns, and placed in line with an Agilent HP1100 quaternary LC pump. Separated peptides were directly electrosprayed into an LCQ Deca XP Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA). A data-dependent scan consisting of one full MS scan and three data-dependent MS/MS scans was used to generate MS/MS spectra of eluted peptides. MS/MS spectra were searched against an in-house protein data base containing mouse Cytl1 sequences using TurboSequest. Search results were filtered with Bioworks version 3.1. Cytl1 Is Predominantly Expressed in Chondrocytes and Cartilage—To identify cartilage-specific regulatory genes, we analyzed the human normal cartilage library (Library 8940) deposited in the UniGene data base at the NCBI (www.wcbi.nlm.nih.gov). Briefly, functionally unknown and novel cartilage-specific genes in the library were classified on the basis of reference criteria (6Hong S. Choi I. Woo J.M. Oh J. Kim T. Choi E. Kim T.W. Jung Y.K. Kim D.H. Sun C.H. Yi G.S. Eddy E.M. Cho C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7685-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Oh J. Lee J. Woo J.M. Choi E. Park I. Han C. Baek N. Lee H. Kim D.H. Cho C. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 314Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A gene was categorized as “cartilage-specific” if the number of cartilage ESTs was significantly higher than that of non-cartilage ESTs analyzed using monochromatic serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)/cDNA virtual Northern (cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE). Among these, Cytl1 was selected for functional characterization during chondrogenesis and hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Alignment of Cytl1 amino acid sequences from multiple species (human, mouse, chicken, and puffer) revealed four α-helices and six conserved cysteine residues, which are common characteristics of cytokines and interleukins (supplemental Fig. 1). We initially examined the expression patterns of Cytl1 in various mouse tissues. RT-PCR, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses disclosed that Cytl1 is predominantly expressed in cartilage (Fig. 1, A and B). Among the cell types examined, Cytl1 was detected in primary culture chondrocytes but not HTB-94 chondrosarcoma or ATDC5 chondroprogenitor cells (Fig. 1C). Upon ectopic expression in chondrocytes, Cytl1 was detected as an ∼1.0-kb single transcript in primary culture mouse rib chondrocytes (Fig. 2A), and protein was identified in both cell lysates and culture supernatant (Fig. 2B). The secreted form of Cytl1 displayed increased molecular weight (approximately ∼6.4 kDa), indicative of post-translational modifications during secretion. Secretion of endogenous Cytl1 was further confirmed by micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the culture supernatant of chondrocytes. Specifically, trypsin-digested protein from the culture supernatant fractions was reduced, alkylated, and analyzed by micro liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2C, two peptides corresponding to mouse Cytl1 (77LRDFVASPQCWK88 and 89MAWVDTLKDR98) were detected, confirming its role as a secretory protein in chondrocytes.FIGURE 2Cytl1 is a secretory protein in chondrocytes. Cytl1 mRNA was detected as a single transcript in mouse rib chondrocytes (A). Rib chondrocytes were transfected with ectopic myc-tagged Cytl1. After 48 h incubation in serum-free medium, recombinant Cytl1 was detected with an anti-Myc antibody in both supernatant and cell lysates (B). Culture supernatant prepared from rib chondrocytes was digested with trypsin, and analyzed by micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Two detected peptides corresponding to the mouse Cytl1 sequence are specified in boldface (C). The data represent typical results from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of Cytl1 during Cartilage Development—To elucidate the in vivo expression pattern of Cytl1 during cartilage development, we performed RT-PCR analysis using mouse forelimb buds isolated from embryos at 11.5-15.5 dpc displaying limb development and cartilage formation (4Mariani F.V. Martin G.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Tickle C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 112: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Collagen IIB was detected at 14.5 and 15.5 dpc limb buds in which individual fingers are visible and longitudinal growth of cartilage occurs (Fig. 3A). Cytl1 expression occurs prior to collagen IIB expression with a peak level at 14.5 dpc limb buds (Fig. 3A). In situ hybridization in developing limb buds at 14.5 dpc led to the detection of significant Cytl1 transcript levels in the cartilage region, which was determined by collagen IIB expression and accumulation of sulfated proteoglycans (Fig. 3, B and C). In developing ulna, Cytl1 transcript was detected in the region where collagen IIB is expressed, but it was not detected in the region where collagen X is expressed (Fig. 3D), indicating that Cytl1 is expressed in differentiated and proliferating chondrocytes but not in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Next, we examined Cytl1 expression during in vitro chondrogenesis and hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes caused by micromass culture of mesenchymal cells isolated from 11.5 dpc mouse limb buds (13Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Ziran N. Goater J.J. Schwarz E.M. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Zuscik M. Drissi H. O'Keefe R.J. Bone (Elmsford). 2004; 34: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For this purpose, mesenchymal cells were maintained as micromass culture to induce chondrogenesis up to day 6, and hypertrophic maturation was induced by switching chondrogenic medium to hypertrophic medium up to day 15. As expected, the chondrocyte-specific markers collagen IIB and aggrecan (1Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 21Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were expressed at day 3, reached peak levels at day 6, and decreased during hypertrophic maturation (Fig. 4, A and B). Markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes, collagen X and MMP-13, were detected at day 9 (Fig. 4, A and B). Cytl1 expression was very low in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells (day 1), dramatically increased during chondrogenesis, and decreased during hypertrophic maturation (Fig. 4, A and B), similar to collagen IIB. Cells expressing Cytl1 and collagen IIB were identified from sections of day 6 micromass culture spots by in situ hybridization.

Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) harbor receptors that are not genuinely expressed by neutrophils. We tested whether or not functional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptors can be acquired by neutrophils via PMPs and whether these receptors participate in pro-inflammatory signaling. Surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. NF-κB activation was analyzed by Western blot experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and reverse transcription-PCR. Cell adhesion and spreading were estimated by myeloperoxidase assay and light microscopy. We found that PMPs transfer GPIIb/IIIa receptors to isolated and whole blood neutrophils via PMPs. We used specific antibodies in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-treated neutrophils and observed that acquired GPIIb/IIIa receptors co-localized with β2-integrins and cooperated in NF-κB activation. We show that Src and Syk non-receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as the actin cytoskeleton, control NF-κB activation. In contrast to NF-κB, acquisition of GPIIb/IIIa receptors was not necessary to induce adhesion to fibronectin or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling. When granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated neutrophils were incubated on fibronectin, strong NF-κB activation was observed, but only after loading with PMPs. Blocking either β2-integrins or GPIIb/IIIa receptors abrogated this effect. Therapeutic GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors were similarly effective. The compounds also inhibited NF-κB-dependent tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA up-regulation. The data implicate GPIIb/IIIa receptors as new therapeutic targets in neutrophil-induced inflammation.

Cells send and receive signals to communicate with their environment. In addition to soluble mediators such as cytokines and growth factors, cells may also generate membrane-derived microparticles. Conditions that lead to release of microparticles include cell activation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and shear stress (1Martinez M.C. Tesse A. Zobairi F. Andriantsitohaina R. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1004-H1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The composition of these microparticles varies from cell type to cell type. The microparticle cargo determines the biological consequences. For example, microparticles are able to transfer receptors to cells that do not normally express a particular receptor. The acquired receptors may be functional, as demonstrated for the CCR5 chemokine receptor released by lymphocytes. Acquisition of CCR5 receptors by endothelial cells rendered these cells susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus infection (2Mack M. Kleinschmidt A. Bruhl H. Klier C. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Plachy J. Stangassinger M. Erfle V. Schlondorff D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Another example for the generation of microparticles is inflammatory vascular injury, including acute coronary syndromes and acute vasculitis.

Neutrophils participate in non-infectious inflammatory processes including the acute coronary syndrome and systemic necrotizing vasculitis (6Buffon A. Biasucci L.M. Liuzzo G. D'Onofrio G. Crea F. Maseri A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is important for neutrophil survival and the generation of numerous inflammatory mediators (7Choi M. Rolle S. Wellner M. Cardoso M.C. Scheidereit C. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Blood. 2003; 102: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that GPIIb/IIIa receptors can be transferred to human neutrophils via PMPs and that these receptors participate in the NF-κB activation when neutrophils are challenged by cytokines. We found that acquired GPIIb/IIIa receptors cooperate with β2-integrins, allowing for NF-κB activation when GM-CSF-treated neutrophils interact with fibronectin, but not in suspension cells. The specific GPIIb/IIIa blockers abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban abrogated NF-κB activation. We suggest that GPIIb/IIIa receptors provide a new therapeutic target in neutrophil-induced inflammation. GM-CSF was obtained from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstedt, Germany). Ficoll-Hypaque and cytochalasin B were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Dextran was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Amsterdam, Netherlands); the α-actin antibody (C-2), the polyclonal rabbit antibodies against IκBα (C-21), and the monoclonal antibodies to CD41/61 (GPIIb/IIIa receptor) and to CD51/61 (vitronectin receptor) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from and Amersham Biosciences (Braunschweig, Germany), Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium (HBSS++), phosphate-buffered saline, and trypan blue were from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany).

The antibody to Akt and the phospho-specific antibodies to p38 and Akt were from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The FITC-labeled antibodies to CD18, the isotype control, and the blocking monoclonal antibodies to CD18 (7E4), CD41/61 (P2), and CD42b (SZ2) were purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The CD18-activating clone KIM 127 was described elsewhere (8Stephens P. Romer J.T. Spitali M. Shock A. Ortlepp S. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Cell Adhes Commun. 1995; 3: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Dr. Martyn Robinson (Celltech, Sough, UK). The monoclonal antibody LIBS-6 for activating β3-integrins was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Ginsberg (University of California, San Diego, CA) and was described previously (9Frelinger A.L. Du III, X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Abciximab (ReoPro®) was obtained from Centocor (Leiden, The Netherlands) and Lilly (Giessen, Germany), respectively (10Coller B.S.

Eptifibatide (Integrilin®) was from SP Europe (Brussels, Belgium) and Essex Pharma (Munich, Germany). Tirofiban hydrochloride (Aggrastat®) was obtained from MSD Sharp & Dohme (Haar, Germany). We used abciximab at final concentrations of 100 ng/ml, eptifibatide at 1500 ng/ml, and tirofiban at 40 ng/ml. These concentrations are at the lower range of the in vivo levels found with treatment (12Gilchrist I.C. O'Shea J.C. Kosoglou T. Jennings L.K. Lorenz T.J. Kitt M.M. Kleiman N.S. Talley D. Aguirre F.

Arnout J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 56: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In experiments where we saw no effect with these low concentrations, we used 1000 ng/ml abciximab, 2500 ng/ml eptifibatide, and 60 ng/ml tirofiban, respectively. These concentrations are at the upper limit of therapeutic concentrations used in vivo. Endotoxin-free reagents and plastic disposables were used in all experiments. Preparation and Culture of Human Neutrophils—Heparinized whole blood was drawn from healthy human donors after written approval (EA 3/011/06, Charité Berlin). Neutrophils were isolated using a double gradient method. The gradient was formed by layering an equal volume of Histopaque 1077 over Histopaque 1119. Whole blood was carefully layered onto the upper gradient and centrifuged for 30 min. Cells of the granulocytic series were found at the Histopaque 1077/1119 interphase, whereas lymphocytes, other mononuclear cells, and platelets were found at the plasma/Histopaque 1077 interphase. The granulocytic cells were carefully aspirated and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Remaining erythrocytes were lysed by incubation with hypotonic saline for 15 s. PMN were spun down (1050 rpm, 10 min) and reconstituted in HBSS with calcium and magnesium. The final cell concentration was 5 × 106 cells/ml. The cell viability was detected in every cell preparation by trypan blue exclusion and found to be >99%. With this method, we were able to isolate neutrophils with a very low amount of CD41/61-positive cells. Preparation of Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP), PMPs, and Platelet-free Plasma—PRP was obtained by centrifugation of heparinized whole blood at 200 × g for 10 min at room temperature. PMPs were generated using previously reported protocols with minor modifications (15Merten M. Pakala R. Thiagarajan P. Benedict C.R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2577-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Gemmell C.H. Sefton M.V. Yeo E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14586-14589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PRP was activated with 10 μm ADP for 20 min at 37 °C, and whole platelets were removed by centrifugation (twice at 4600 rpm, 13 min) and filtration through a 0.8-μm filter. To remove ADP, this solution was centrifuged for 60 min at 20,000 × g. The pellet containing PMPs was resuspended in HBSS++. As a negative control, we also prepared platelet-free plasma that was ADP-treated, filtered, and centrifuged in the same way as described above. Preparation of PMP-loaded Neutrophils in Vitro—PMP-loaded neutrophils were prepared by co-incubation of isolated human neutrophils with PMPs for 45 min at 37 °C. PMN were spun down (200 × g, 7 min) and resuspended in HBSS++ with a final cell concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Western Blot—Samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C in loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). 10–20 μg of protein was loaded per lane, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline with Tween, 5% skim milk for 1 h and incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies. Membranes were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The blot was developed by incubation in a chemiluminescence substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to an x-ray film. We confirmed equal loading of protein in parallel experiments using α-actin or total Akt antibodies. Flow Cytometry—CD41/61 receptor expression on freshly isolated neutrophils was determined by incubation with saturating concentration of the antibody (Clone A2A9/6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 25 min on ice. A mouse IgG2a antibody was used in the same concentration as a control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed and resuspended in HBSS++, and phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat-anti mouse IgG (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) were added in saturating concentration for a further 25 min. After washing, samples were assayed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). CD41/61 receptor expression on whole blood neutrophils was determined by stimulation of whole blood for 20 min with 10 μm ADP or phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, and further incubation with saturating concentration of the antibody for 20 min at room temperature. Erythrocytes were lysed by incubation with FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation and washing, samples were assayed using a FACScan. In experiments where CD61 receptor expression was determined on PMP-loaded neutrophils after incubation with the indicated inhibitory antibodies, we first incubated PMP-loaded neutrophils with 20 μg/ml of the antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with saturating concentration of a CD61-FITC antibody (Clone Y2/51, DAKO, Glastrup, Denmark) for a further 25 min on ice. After washing, samples were assayed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—After incubation with the respective antibody as described for flow cytometry, cells were spun down on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma; 0.25 μg/ml, 30 s) for nuclei counterstaining. Immunostained specimen were analyzed with a Leica DMRB light microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). Images were acquired using a digital camera (SPOT) and processed with MetaVue software. Confocal Analysis—For double-staining experiments, cells were immunolabeled with a monoclonal antibody against CD41/61, washed, and incubated with a Alexa Fluor® 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were washed again and incubated with a direct-conjugated CD18-FITC antibody (Clone 7e4, Immunotech, Marseille, France). After incubation and washing, cells were spun down on coverslips. Immunofluorescence images were scanned with a three-channel confocal laser scanning microscope with a ×40/1.25 NA oil immersion objective (Leica TCS SP-2, Leica Microsystems). All digitized images were analyzed using the Leica confocal software. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (7Choi M. Rolle S. Wellner M. Cardoso M.C. Scheidereit C. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Blood. 2003; 102: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with ice-cold HBSS++ supplemented with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2 mm final concentration). Cells were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended with the hypotonic buffer A (HEPES 10 mm, pH 7.5, KCl 10 mm, EGTA 0.1 mm, EDTA 0.1 mm, pH 8.0) containing an anti-protease mixture (2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were kept on ice for 10 min. Cells were vortexed briefly and centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet the nuclei and to remove intracellular granules that may cause nuclear degradation. The pellet was washed again with buffer A, and the hypertonic, high salt buffer C was added (HEPES 20 mm, pH 7.5, NaCl 0.4 m, EDTA 1 mm, EGTA 1 mm, glycerol 20%) together with the above mentioned protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was collected and referred to as the nuclear fraction. Protein measurements were done using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as described previously (7Choi M. Rolle S. Wellner M. Cardoso M.C. Scheidereit C. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Blood. 2003; 102: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (5 mg of protein) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled H2K probe. Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of poly(dI-dC) and 20 mm HEPES, containing 60 mm KCl, 4% Ficoll, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. Probes were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated according to a Qiagen protocol including DNase treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan technology (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Reverse transcription was carried out according to the SuperScript protocol (Invitrogen, De Schelp, NL). TaqMan RT-PCR was performed using the Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The quantification was checked for each sample using probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Primers and probes were designed using the primer express program (Applied Biosystems). The following oligonucleotides were used for IκBα: forward primer, 5′-CCCTGTAATGGCCGGACTG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-AGGAGTGACACCAGGTCAGGA-3′, and the probe Fam 5′-CCTTCACCTCGCAGTGGACCTGC-3′ Tamra. RT-PCR and quantification were performed using the TaqMan 5700 (Applied Biosystems). The following oligonucleotides were used for TNF-α: forward primer 5′-GGTGCTTGTTCCTCAGCCTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CAGGCAGAAGAGCGTGGTG-3′. For quantification of the amount of RNA present in the various samples, the fluorescence signal was measured at each PCR cycle, and the increase in the fluorescence normalized reporter signal (Rn) was documented in an amplification plot. Using non-template controls, the threshold was set in the log phase to subtract unspecific fluorescence signals. Cycle threshold (CT) values were determined for each sample. In short, the CT value difference (ΔCT) was used to calculate the factor of differential expression (2ΔCT). Results were imported in an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed according to the standard curve method. Spreading and Adhesion Assay—We used 96-well plates coated with fibronectin (10 μg/cm2) for the adhesion assay. 1 × 105 neutrophils in 100 ml of HBSS++ were either left untreated or were treated with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 60 min. Wells were flicked dry and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were estimated using the myeloperoxidase assay. Briefly, adherent cells were lysed in 100 μl of 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 10 min. 100 μl of substrate (2,2′-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, Sigma) was added, and OD was read after 10 min at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. Each experiment was done in triplicate. OD of the experimental sample was compared with a standard curve that showed an excellent correlation between OD and cell number. The standard curve was established over a range of 1 × 104–1 × 105 cells and showed an R2 value of 0.96. For estimation of cell spreading, neutrophils were cultured as described above. At the indicated time point, non-adherent cells were discarded, and the percentage of spread cells was assessed. At least 100 cells were counted using phase contrast microscopy, and those cells that were phase dark, enlarged, and irregular were considered as spread. Statistical Analysis—Results are given as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were done using paired t tests. Comparisons between multiple groups were done using one-way analysis of variance. Specific differences between multiple groups were then determined by use of a Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05 and are indicated by asterisks in the figure legends. Neutrophils Acquire GPIIb/IIIa Receptors via Transfer of PMPs—We first tested whether or not GPIIb/IIIa receptors can be acquired by the neutrophil via PMPs. We stimulated whole blood with ADP to activate platelets and to generate PMPs. By flow cytometry, we observed that whole-blood neutrophils displayed very low amounts of GPIIb/IIIa receptors on their membranes and that this amount was significantly up-regulated after ADP whole blood treatment (Fig. 1A). Using fluorescence microscopy in DAPI-treated cells, we could detect a high amount of neutrophils with very small CD41/61-positive particles on the cell surface in the ADP-treated sample (Fig. 1B). In addition, we observed whole platelets (see inserted box) and platelet-aggregates (not shown) that were larger and showed much higher fluorescence intensity when compared with PMPs. Epinephrine treatment gave similar results to those observed with ADP (data not shown). We next confirmed the whole blood data under defined in vitro conditions. We particularly wanted to exclude whole platelets and platelet aggregates, ensuring that platelet-derived microparticles caused the GPIIb/IIIa transfer to neutrophils. This setting would also allow us to study functional consequences of such a GPIIb/IIIa receptor transfer. Thus, we generated PMPs from PRP in vitro and transferred these particles to isolated neutrophils. Filtration through 0.8-μm filters assured complete removal of whole platelets. We observed that incubation of neutrophils with PMPs resulted in acquisition of GPIIb/IIIa receptor staining (Fig. 2). By flow cytometry, both the percentage of GPIIb/IIIa β3-integrin receptor-positive neutrophils, as well as the mean fluorescence intensity for GPIIb/IIIa staining, increased significantly (p < 0.05, Fig. 2A). We also observed significant transfer of GPIb (from 14.2 ± 4.1 to 39.1 ± 8.1% of the neutrophils; n = 5, p < 0.05 and from 14.3 ± 1.1 to 16.2 ± 2.8 for mean fluorescence intensity, respectively, not significant). However, the amount of receptor acquisition was lower when compared with GPIIb/IIIa receptors. In contrast, the other known β3-integrin receptor, vitronectin (αvβ3), was not detected on neutrophils, neither without nor with PMP loading (data not shown). Fluorescence microscopy clearly visualizes acquisition of GPIIb/IIIa receptors in isolated neutrophils after PMP incubation (Fig. 2B). Acquired GPIIb/IIIa Receptors Are Functional and Cooperate with β2-Integrins to Activate NF-κB after GM-CSF Stimulation—We next studied whether or not GPIIb/IIIa receptors acquired by the neutrophil were functional. We reported previously that β2-integrins provide co-stimulation, allowing cytokines such as GM-CSF and interleukin-8 to activate NF-κB signaling (17Kettritz R. Choi M. Rolle S. Wellner M. Luft F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2657-2665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in our earlier study, we had not investigated the contribution of PMPs to this process. Importantly, the isolation method used in these earlier experiments yielded neutrophils contaminated with variable amounts of PMPs (data not shown). We used specific antibodies to activate either the β2-integrin CD18 or the β3-integrin GPIIb/IIIa. We first studied NF-κB activation by Western blot experiments assaying the inhibitory IκBα-protein. Fig. 3A indicates that, in GM-CSF-treated suspension neutrophils that had not acquired GPIIb/IIIa receptors, neither an activating CD18 (KIM127) nor an activating GPIIb/IIIa antibody (LIBS-6) induced IκBα degradation. In contrast, GM-CSF-treated neutrophils that were loaded with PMPs showed NF-κB activation in response to an activating CD18 (KIM127) or an activating GPIIb/IIIa antibody (LIBS-6), respectively (Fig. 3B). NF-κB activation in PMP-loaded neutrophils was demonstrated by additional independent methods, namely a DNA binding assay (EMSA, Fig. 3C) and quantitative RT-PCR for NF-κB-dependent IκBα mRNA up-regulation (Fig. 3D). A blocking antibody to CD18 (7E4) prevented NF-κB activation by the activating GPIIb/IIIa and CD18 antibodies. Similarly, the blocking antibody to GPIIb/IIIa (P2) prevented NF-κB activation in response to the activating CD18 and GPIIb/IIIa antibodies (Fig. 3E). We observed similar findings when the assay was carried out on polyhemacrylate at a low cell density where we ensured by light microscopy that neutrophils had no contact to each other (data not shown). This culture condition was shown to securely exclude cell-plastic contact that may have provided a ligand for integrin receptors in the tube experiments and homotypic cell-cell contact (18Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). As an additional control experiment, we preincubated PMP-loaded neutrophils with a blocking antibody to another platelet receptor CD42b (glycoprotein Ibα). This blocking antibody did not prevent NF-κB activation in GM-CSF-treated cells in response to the activating CD18 antibody (Fig. 3F). Thus far, our data indicate that acquisition of GPIIb/IIIa receptors via PMPs was a prerequisite for NF-κB activation in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. We next tested whether or not PMP loading affected classical β2-integrin-mediated functions such as adherence to fibronectin or spreading or other signaling pathways. Our data indicate that GM-CSF induced neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin and that this response was similar in neutrophils without and with PMP loading (Fig. 4, A and B). The results also document that the blocking CD18 antibody (7E4) completely abrogated adhesion and spreading, whereas the blocking GPIIb/IIIa antibody (P2) showed no effect. Furthermore, neutrophil loading with PMPs or preincubation with blocking antibodies against β2-integrins and GPIIb/IIIa receptors, respectively, did not affect PI3K/Akt activation, another central signaling pathway for several inflammatory neutrophil functions (Fig. 4C). These data underscore the specific significance of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor acquisition for NF-κB activation in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. β2-Integrins and GPIIb/IIIa Receptors Cooperate in NF-κB Activation of GM-CSF-stimulated Neutrophils That Interact with Fibronectin—During migration, neutrophils interact with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (19Faull R.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Here, we fabricated a tetravalent IgG-like bispecific antibody with two kinds of single-chain Fv (scFv), i.e. humanized anti-EGFR scFv and anti-CD3 scFv, that contains the same four variable domains as hEx3, on the platform of human IgG1 (hEx3-scFv-Fc). hEx3-scFv-Fc prepared from mammalian cells showed specific binding to both EGFR and CD3 target antigens. At one-thousandth (0.1–100 fmol/ml) of the dose of normal hEx3, hEx3-scFv-Fc showed intense cytotoxicity to an EGFR-positive cell line in a growth-inhibition assay using lymphokine-activated killer cells with the T-cell phenotype (T-LAK cells). The enhanced antitumor effect was more clearly observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used as effector cells, indicating the utility of IgG-like fabrication. These results suggested that the intense antitumor activity is attributable to the multivalency and the presence of the fused human Fc, a hypothesis that was supported by the results of flow cytometry, PBMC proliferation assay, and protein kinase inhibition assay. Furthermore, the growth inhibition effects of hEx3-scFv-Fc were considerably superior to those of the approved therapeutic antibody, cetuximab, which recognizes the same EGFR antigen even when using PBMCs as effector cells. The high potency of hEx3-scFv-Fc may translate into improved antitumor therapy and lower costs of production because of the smaller doses needed.

Therapeutic antibodies have great potential in cancer immunotherapy. Approximately 20 therapeutic antibodies have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and there are more than 150 additional antibodies in clinical development (1Reichert J.M. Rosensweig C.J. Faden L.B. Dewitz M.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In attempts to accelerate the development of such drugs for use in cancer immunotherapy, problems with limited efficacy and high production costs have become so serious that attempts are now being made to construct highly effective and potent recombinant antibodies from human and/or humanized protein fragments (2Wu A.M. Senter P.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). These recombinant antibodies also may provide low production costs.

In particular, BsAbs can redirect cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which are the most potent killer cells in the immune system but cannot be engaged by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) because T-lymphocytes lack Fcγ receptors (3Kufer P.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in a wide range of human malignancies, and its expression level is correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with any of several cancers (5Fischer-Colbrie J. Witt A. Heinzl H. Speiser P. Czerwenka K. Sevelda P. Zeillinger R. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 613-619PubMed Google Scholar). BsAbs targeting CD3 and EGFR have been generated, and their efficacy in T-cell retargeting toward these antigens has been documented in several tumor models in vitro and in vivo (6Tosi E. Valota O.

Therapeutically potent BsAbs have been prepared by fusion of hybrid hybridoma and by chemical conjugation; however, such classical methods have led to the formation of several nonfunctional analogs (10Bohlen H. Manzke O. Patel B. Moldenhauer G. Dorken B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4310-4314PubMed Google Scholar). Advances in recombinant technology have made it feasible to generate smaller BsAbs, such as minibodies, tandem singlechain Fv (scFv), and diabodies, which generally consist of two VH and two VL domains from two different antibodies (3Kufer P. Lutterbuse R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 238-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Kontermann R.E. Acta Pharmacol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53907-53914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In comparison with classical BsAbs (e.g. in the F(ab′)2 form), small BsAbs are expected to have low immunogenicity, high tumor penetration ability, and high efficiency because of their physical proximity between lymphocytes and targeted tumor cells (13Wu A.M. Chen W. Raubitschek A. Williams L.E. Neumaier M. Fischer R. Hu S.Z. Odom-Maryon T. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Immunotechnology. 1996; 2: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In fact, we previously determined the effectiveness of the VH and VL domains from EGFR monoclonal antibody 528 in cancer immunotherapy, and we constructed a humanized functional bispecific diabody, hEx3, retargeting lymphokine-activated killer cells with the T-cell phenotype (T-LAK cells) against EGFR-positive cell lines (14Hayashi H. Asano R. Tsumoto K. Katayose Y. Suzuki M. Unno M. Kodama H. Takemura S. Yoshida H. Makabe K. Imai K. Matsuno S. Kumagai I. Kudo T. Cancer Immunol.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the small molecular form, the removal of the Fc region, and the monovalent binding to two different antigens result in rapid clearance from the circulation, a lack of induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and low affinity, respectively. The steady overcoming of these three problems is advancing the usefulness of BsAbs as clinical reagents. To date, several kinds of IgG-like BsAbs with the human Fc portion have been constructed. Evaluation of their functions has revealed that BsAbs with the Fc portion is an attractive molecule as a therapeutic reagent because it can overcome the above-mentioned problems of diabodies (16Carter P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 248: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Marvin J.S. Zhu Z. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2005; 26: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Atkins A. Brennan L. Balderes P. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 279: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of the most applicable molecules is the scFv-IgG form, in which two different scFv are fused at the N termini of the CL and the CH1 domains of an IgG, respectively: (scFvA)-CL and (scFvB)-CH1-CH2-CH3. Coexpression of the two polypeptide chains in a single host results in the formation of a tetravalent bispecific molecule, Bs(scFv)4-IgG. Only homogeneous BsAbs are generated as a result of the natural heterodimerization between the CL and the CH1 domains (17Marvin J.S. Zhu Z. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2005; 26: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Zuo Z. Jimenez X. Witte L. Zhu Z. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we selected the scFv-IgG form as an IgG-like bispecific antibody for efficient retargeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to malignant cells. Here, we describe the construction of a novel Bs(scFv)4-IgG molecule, designated hEx3-scFv-Fc, from humanized anti-EGFR and anti-CD3 scFv (Fig. 1A). hEx3-scFv-Fc prepared from the supernatant of stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells showed specific binding to both target cells and remarkably higher cytotoxicity to EGFR-positive cell lines than that of the diabody form of hEx3. This efficacy was well characterized by flow cytometry, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation assay, and protein kinase inhibition assay. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the construction and potency of a Bs(scFv)4-IgG molecule retargeted to surface antigens on T-lymphocytes and tumor cells; this molecule may prove to be a highly attractive recombinant therapeutic antibody with the possibility of low cost production. Construction of Expression Vector for hEx3-scFv-Fc-The gene encoding the humanized anti-human CD3 antibody OKT3 scFv with VH-VL orientation, referred to as hOHL, was amplified from bacterial expression vector by the first PCR (15Asano R. Sone Y. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Adair J.R. Athwal D.S. Bodmer M.W.

The leader peptide sequence for protein secretion in mammalian cells was then added to the 5′ end of the scFv-encoding sequence by the second PCR. Similarly, the gene encoding the humanized anti-human EGFR antibody 528 scFv with VH-VL orientation, referred to as h5HL, was amplified from bacterial expression vector by the first PCR followed by a second PCR to add the leader peptide sequence (15Asano R. Sone Y. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Separate expression vectors for the light and heavy chains of hEx3-scFv-Fc were constructed (Fig. 1B). The expression vector of hEx3-scFv-Fc heavy chain, pcDNA-hOHL-Fc, was constructed by replacing the VH gene of humanized OKT3 heavy chain expression vector based on pcDNA3.1/Neo(+) (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) with cloned hOHL by digestion with NheI and XhoI. Similarly, expression vector for the hEx3-scFv-Fc light chain, pcDNA-h5HL-CL, was constructed by replacing the VL gene of the humanized OKT3 light chain expression vector based on pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen) with the cloned h5HL by digestion with NheI and NarI. Preparation of hEx3 Diabody and hEx3-scFv-Fc Molecule- hEx3 diabody was prepared from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (14Hayashi H. Asano R. Tsumoto K.

For hEx3-scFv-Fc, CHO cells were cotransfected with equal amounts of DNA from vector pcDNA-hOHL-Fc and pcDNA-h5HL-CL. A CHO clone stably expressing hEx3-scFv-Fc was established after screening by selection medium containing antibiotic (500 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and 200 μg/ml hygromycin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA)). The cells were switched to serum-free medium 3 days after incubation at 37 °C in selection medium by roller-bottle culture. The supernatant was collected after 4 days, and hEx3-scFv-Fc was purified from the pooled supernatant by affinity chromatography in a protein A column, in accordance with the protocol described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). The antibody-containing fractions were pooled, buffer-exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and concentrated with Centriprep-10 concentrators (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The purity of the antibodies was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions. Finally, the concentrated sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) and stored in PBS at 4 °C. Preparation of PBMCs and T-LAK Cells-PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation of serum from a healthy volunteer. Then, for the induction of T-LAK cells, PBMCs were cultured for 48 h at a cell density of 1 × 106/ml in medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (kindly supplied by Shionogi Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan), in a culture flask (A/S Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) precoated with OKT3 mAb (10 μg/ml). The proliferated cells were then transferred to another flask and expanded for 2–3 weeks in culture medium containing 100 IU/ml interleukin-2, as reported previously (23Kodama H. Suzuki M. Katayose Y. Shinoda M. Sakurai N. Takemura S. Yoshida H. Saeki H. Asano R. Ichiyama M. Imai K. Hinoda Y. Matsuno S. Kudo T. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 81: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analyses-Test cells (1 × 106) were first incubated on ice with 200 pmol of hEx3 or 100 pmol of hEx3-scFv-Fc or 100 pmol parent IgGs for 30 min. After being washed with PBS plus 0.1% NaN3, they were exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated second antibody, namely anti-c-Myc for hEx3, anti-human Fc for hEx3-scFv-Fc, or anti-mouse Fc for parent IgGs, respectively, for 30 min on ice. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) (15Asano R. Sone Y. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Vitro Growth Inhibition Assay-In vitro growth inhibition of various cell lines was assayed with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay kit (CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay; Promega, Madison, WI). The target cells (5000 cells in 100 μl of culture medium) were plated on 96-well, half-area (A/2), flat-bottomed plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells were cultured overnight to allow well adhesion. After removal of the culture medium by aspiration, 100 μl of T-LAK cells (effector cells) plus various concentrations of recombinant antibodies were added to each well, giving a final effector-to-target cell (E:T) ratio of 5 or 10. After culture of the cells for 48 h at 37 °C, each well was washed with PBS three times to remove effector cells and dead target cells, and 95 μl of culture medium plus 5 μl of a fresh mixture of MTS/phenazine methosulfate solution (Promega) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°Cand then read on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 3550) at a wavelength of 490 nm. Growth inhibition of target cells was calculated as follows (24Asano R. Kudo T. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar): percentage growth inhibition of target cells = [1–(A490 of experiment–A490 of background)/(A490 of control–A490 of background)] × 100. A blocking test with parental mAb IgGs (528 or OKT3) or nonspecific IgGs (MUSE11; anti-MUC1 mAb or OKT8; anti-CD8 mAb) was also performed. After removal of the overnight culture medium used for the target cells, 100 μl of T-LAK cells plus 1.0 ng/ml hEx3-scFv-Fc and various concentrations of parental IgGs were added to each well. After culture for 48 h at 37 °C, detection with MTS solution was performed as above (14Hayashi H. Asano R. Tsumoto K. Katayose Y. Suzuki M. Unno M. Kodama H. Takemura S. Yoshida H. Makabe K. Imai K. Matsuno S. Kumagai I. Kudo T. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity of recombinant antibodies was also measured by using a standard 51Cr release assay. In brief, 10,000 51Cr-labeled target cells were added to U-shaped 96-well microtiter plates at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 10. Then, various dilutions of recombinant antibodies were added. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100-μl aliquots of supernatant were removed and evaluated for 51Cr release in a γ-counter (ARC2000, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The percentage cytotoxicity to cancer cells was calculated as follows (14Hayashi H. Asano R. Tsumoto K. Katayose Y. Suzuki M. Unno M. Kodama H. Takemura S. Yoshida H. Makabe K. Imai K. Matsuno S. Kumagai I. Kudo T. Cancer Immunol.

Proliferation Assay of PBMCs-Proliferation of PBMCs was assessed in a cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 1 × 105 freshly isolated PBMCs suspended in 0.2 ml of culture medium were distributed into each well of 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in the presence of various concentrations of recombinant antibodies. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, BrdUrd labeling reagent was added and the cells incubated for an additional 24 h. The detection procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's assay protocol for cells in suspension. Optical density was measured with a plate reader (Bio-Rad model 3550) at a wavelength of 450 nm (25Takemura S. Kudo T. Asano R. Suzuki M. Tsumoto K. Sakurai N. Katayose Y. Kodama H. Yoshida H. Ebara S. Saeki H. Imai K. Matsuno S. Kumagai I. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2002; 51: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis-Inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase was evaluated with a PathScan Multiplex Western mixture kit (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, TFK-1 was precultured with or without antibodies for 90 min and then stimulated with EGF at each concentration (final 0.1–10 μg/ml) for 7 min. Subsequently cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway was analyzed by using rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/Erk2). Specific binding was visualized by using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) (26Bremer E. Samplonius D.F. van Genne L.

Preparation of BsAbs from Growth Medium of CHO Cells- Two mammalian expression vectors, pcDNA-hOHL-Fc and pcDNA-h5HL-CL, were co-introduced into CHO cells. The resulting CHO transfectants expressed hOHL-Fc and h5HL-CL in growth medium, and these proteins were purified with high purity in stoichiometrically equal amounts by one-step protein A affinity chromatography under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 1). SDS-PAGE analysis in nonreducing conditions clearly demonstrated the assembly of hEx3-scFv-Fc in the CHO expression system (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The final yield of hEx3-scFv-Fc was a few milligrams per liter of serum-free medium. Binding Properties of BsAbs in Flow Cytometry-Binding of BsAbs to targeted antigens was confirmed by flow cytometry. The reactivity of hEx3-scFv-Fc for CD3-positive T-LAK and EGFR-positive TFK-1 (human bile duct carcinoma) was stronger than not only that of hEx3 but also those of the parental IgGs (528 or OKT3) (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, hEx3-scFv-Fc specifically bound to the CHO cells transfected with EGFR (EGFR/CHO) in the same manner but not to normal CHO (Fig. 2, C and D). Parental mAbs competitively inhibited the binding of hEx3-scFv-Fc to T-LAK and EGFR/CHO, implying that hEx3-scFv-Fc recognizes the same epitope as do the mAbs (data not shown). Growth Inhibition of Cancer Cells with T-LAK Cells and PBMC-To evaluate the availability of BsAbs with bivalency and the human Fc region, cancer growth inhibition was estimated by MTS assay. hEx3-scFv-Fc effectively inhibited growth of the TFK-1 cell line, even at a dose less than 1 fmol/ml (∼0.2 ng/ml). This concentration was more 100-fold lower than that by hEx3, indicating a marked improvement in cytotoxicity by bivalent binding compared with monovalency for each targeted antigen (Fig. 3A, i). When PBMCs were applied as effector cells, hEx3-scFv-Fc also inhibited cancer cell growth more effectively than hEx3. Although hEx3 was cytotoxic at high concentrations because of the presence of naturally occurring T-cells in PBMC, the cytotoxicity of hEx3-scFv-Fc indicates the activation of PBMC by the Fc region in hEx3-scFv-Fc and demonstrates the potential of hEx3-scFv-Fc monotherapy without supplemental molecules in adoptive immunotherapy (Fig. 3A, ii). Humanized OKT3 IgG and chimeric 528 IgG can induce ADCC via the Fc region derived from the same human IgG1 as hEx3-scFv-Fc. The growth inhibition ratio by these IgGs was saturated to about 30% at the low concentration of 80 fmol/ml; therefore, at 1 pmol/ml their cytotoxicities were weaker than that of hEx3, which had only monovalency bispecificity (Fig. 3A, ii and iii). In contrast, hEx3-scFv-Fc, with both bivalent bispecificity and the human Fc region, showed dramatic cytotoxicity, even at a concentration of 10 fmol/ml, because of the fusion of the two hEx3 molecules and the Fc region (Fig. 3A, ii). To confirm the importance of bispecificity in the cytotoxicity of hEx3-scFv-Fc, we assessed the inhibitory effects of parental IgGs, anti-CD3 (OKT3), and anti-EGFR (528) in the presence of hEx3-scFv-Fc (Fig. 3B). Unlike irrelevant IgGs (anti-CD8 and anti-MUC1), the addition of anti-CD3 (OKT3) or anti-EGFR (528) showed clear inhibition of antitumor effect. The antigen-specific cytotoxicity was also confirmed by 51Cr release assay of T-LAK cells with a low E:T ratio of 10 (Fig. 3C). hEx3-scFv-Fc at 1 fmol/ml showed cytotoxicity in an antigen-specific manner and the identical effect to a 500-fold higher concentration of hEx3, i.e. the diabody form. These results indicate that hEx3-scFv-Fc induces cytotoxicity in an EGFR-and CD3-specific manner and that the combination of Fc region and bispecificity is important for its strong cytotoxicity. Proliferation of PBMCs Stimulated by Various Recombinant Antibodies-An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to confirm the proliferation of PBMCs in response to recombinant antibodies (Fig. 4). hEx3 did not induce proliferation, even at a high concentration of 1 μg/ml because of its lack of the Fc region, whereas humanized OKT3 IgG and chimeric 528 IgG, with the Fc region, effectively caused proliferation of PBMCs at doses of 0.1–10 μg/ml. Proliferation in response to hOKT3 IgG was also observed at the low concentration of 0.1 fmol/ml, whereas at this concentration c528 IgG had no effect on the PBMCs because of anti-CD3 agonist activity. In the case of hEx3-scFv-Fc we observed effective stimulation of PBMCs that was not much less than the proliferation provoked by OKT3 IgG. These results indicate that the construction of hEx3-scFv-Fc led to little decline in proliferation and that the antibody provoked proliferation of PBMCs that was comparable with that caused by parent IgGs. Phosphorylation of Protein Kinase Inhibited by Bispecific IgG-like Antibody-Both p44 and p42 MAPKs (Erk1 and Erk2) play critical roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and MAPKs are activated by a wide variety of extracellular signals such as growth and neurotrophic factors, cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Here, the inhibition effect of hEx3-scFv-Fc on phosphorylation of protein kinase was detected by Western blotting with antiphospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Fig. 5). Although no distinguishable difference between hEx3, hEx3-scFv-Fc, and 528 IgG was observed at a high concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 μg/ml), at low EGF concentrations (0.1 and 1 μg/ml) parent 528 IgG showed inhibition of phosphorylation of Erk1/Erk2 comparable with those in previous reports (27Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A. Sato J.D. Masui H. McLeod C. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7755-7760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hEx3 did not inhibit phosphorylation at any concentration of EGF, whereas hEx3-scFv-Fc substantially inhibited phosphorylation at 0.1 and 1 μg/ml. These results suggested that the bivalency of hEx3-scFv-Fc was responsible for its inhibition of protein kinase. Comparison of hEx3-scFv-Fc with Approved Therapeutic Antibody-The growth inhibition effects of hEx3-scFv-Fc and the approved therapeutic antibody cetuximab were compared by MTS assay in two kinds of cancer cell lines by using T-LAK cells and PBMCs as effector cells. Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody with specificity for human EGFR as well as hEx3-scFv-Fc. It is in therapeutic use in the United States and is particularly effective in EGFR-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (28Levene A.P. Singh G. Palmieri C. J. R. Soc. Med. 2005; 98: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Porebska I. Harlozinska A. Bojarowski T. Tumour Biol. 2000; 21: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In TFK-1, and especially for SK-BR-3 (human breast cancer cells), cetuximab showed ADCC activity (Fig. 6) in the presence of PBMCs; however, it had no effect in the presence of T-LAK cells. This is because among T-LAK cells there are few with Fc receptor-positive phenotypes (e.g. NK cells), and Fc receptor-positive cells are needed to induce efficient ADCC activity. In contrast, hEx3-scFv-Fc was highly effective in each situation: that is, its cytotoxicity was almost independent of the kind of effector cell. This is because hEx3-scFv-Fc can link cancer cells and lymphocytes via its bispecificity and can also induce ADCC via its human Fc region. Thus, hEx3-scFv-Fc, with its bispecificity and ability to support secondary immune functions such as ADCC and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, is a prospective novel candidate as a reagent in far advanced and/or incurable cancer. Recombinant BsAbs containing a human Fc region, often described as “IgG-like BsAbs,” are realistic antibody forms with high therapeutic potency in recruiting cytotoxic T-cells against tumor cells and inducing ADCC activity. Furthermore, they can be easily purified by using protein A and have longer half-lives than small BsAbs such as diabodies; however, the classical preparation of IgG-like BsAbs by the fusion of two hybridomas or by in vitro chemical cross-linking from two IgG antibodies leads to heterogeneous production. The BsAbs that are formed can be purified, but purification is difficult because the products have analogous properties such as molecular weights (10Bohlen H. Manzke O. Patel B. Moldenhauer G. Dorken B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4310-4314PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, advanced DNA technologies have enabled the generation of attractive IgG-like BsAb molecules containing human Fc regions and with bivalency for each targeted antigen (17Marvin J.S.

The tetravalent BsAbs of the scFv-IgG form, selected here from among reported IgG-like BsAbs, was homogeneously generated by coexpression of the two polypeptide chains, i.e. (scFvA)-CL and (scFvB)-CH1-CH2-CH3, in a single host. The natural heterodimerization between the CL and CH1 domains in vivo can bypass the need for heterogeneous preparation of IgG-like BsAbs, which is a serious problem in classical methods (19Zuo Z. Jimenez X. Witte L. Zhu Z. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Lu D. Zhang H. Ludwig D. Persaud A. Jimenez X. Burtrum D. Balderes P. Liu M. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2856-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In some cases, construction of recombinant antibodies with IgG-like BsAb platforms can cause steric constraint by the linkage of scFv and the residual IgG Fc region; this structural change might decrease the affinity for each antigen and cause bispecific binding to become difficult (34Coloma M.J. Trinh K.R. Wims L.A. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with each parental IgG, the scFv-IgG constructed here from humanized anti-EGFR and anti-CD3 scFv, designated as hEx3-scFv-Fc, showed no decrease in affinity and specificity to either targeted antigen by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A and B). This implies that the constructed scFv-IgGs have no steric constraint that might cause a decrease in the activity of the binding function. Detailed structural and kinetic experiments by x-ray analysis and surface plasmon resonance methods are in progress. The more severe cytotoxicity of hEx3-scFv-Fc as compared with the hEx3 diabody at doses in the order of femtomol/ml is attributed to the combination of high affinity through bivalent bispecificity and ADCC activity through the presence of human Fc; this was supported by the results of PBMC proliferation assay and protein kinase inhibition assay. Although the existence of inactive protein in refolded hEx3 may influence its lower activity, we have confirmed that refolded hEx3 has identical function to that of soluble hEx3 prepared from mammalian expression system (data not shown). In comparison with humanized OKT3 IgG and chimeric 528 IgG, hEx3-scFv-Fc also had more severe cytotoxicity than the corresponding parent IgG molecules. These facts imply that the cross-linking of effector and target cells is more important than T-cell activation by the anti-CD3 agonist antibody and/or growth inhibition by the anti-EGFR antagonist antibody. hEx3-scFv-Fc induces cytotoxicity in an EGFR and CD3-specific manner, and the combination of Fc region and bivalent bispecificity is critical in endowing the molecule with strong cytotoxicity. These results are also supported by the comparison it its cytotoxicity with that of the approved therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab. We have reported the high antitumor activity of the Ex3 diabody and humanized forms in vivo (14Hayashi H. Asano R. Tsumoto K. Katayose Y. Suzuki M. Unno M. Kodama H. Takemura S. Yoshida H. Makabe K.

Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments of hEx3-scFv-Fc are now under way. Recently, there was a report of a phase I clinical trial of ertumaxomab, which is an intact BsAb that retargets HER2/neu and CD3 and has an Fc portion binding to activatory Fc receptors. This drug has been described as a trifunctional antibody. However there is concern about the development of human anti-mouse antibody and human anti-rat antibody responses, because ertumaxomab consists of rat IgG2b and mouse IgG2a produced by quadroma technology. Although currently we have no insights into the immunogenicity of artificial constructs and peptide linkers, hEx3-scFv-Fc with its fully human and humanized component can be expected to reduce the possibility of such responses to foreign proteins occurring. In conclusion, we constructed and characterized a tetravalent IgG-like bispecific antibody, designated as hEx3-scFv-Fc, that has bivalent bivalency for each targeted antigen and a human Fc region that enables the induction of ADCC activity. Addition of the Fc region also enables the purification of recombinant antibody by the use of a one-step protein A column and is expected to endow a longer half-life than that of the diabody. To our knowledge, this report is the first observation of the possibility of cancer immunotherapy by the use of a tetravalent scFv-Fc to recruit CD3-positive cells to cancer cells with high efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2027682791,"VP22 is a structural protein of the herpes simplex virus and has been reported to possess unusual trafficking properties. Here we examined the mechanism of cellular uptake of VP22 using a fusion protein between the C-terminal half of VP22 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Adsorption of VP22-GFP onto a cell surface required heparan sulfate proteoglycans and basic amino acids, in particular, Arg-164 of VP22. Inhibitor treatment, RNA interference, expression of dominant-negative mutant genes, and confocal microscopy all indicated that VP22-GFP enters cells through an endocytic pathway independent of clathrin and caveolae but dependent on dynamin and Arf6 activity. As with CD59 (a lipid raft marker), cell-surface VP22-GFP signals were resistant to Triton X-100 treatment but only partially overlapped cell-surface CD59 signals. Furthermore, unlike other lipid raft-mediated endocytic pathways, no Rho family GTPase was required for VP22-GFP internalization. Internalized VP22 initially entered early endosomes and then moved to lysosomes and possibly recycling endosomes.

Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of VP22, residues 159-301 (termed VP22.C1), is highly homologous in sequence to counterparts of other α-herpes virus VP22 proteins and is considered to be associated with intercellular trafficking ability (23Kueltzo L.A.

The uptake of VP22.C1-fused green fluorescent protein (GFP), hereafter referred to as VP22-GFP, into an entire tumor has been observed following peritumoral injection into human pancreatic tumors in SCID mice (28Boenicke L.

Thus, as with short peptide-type TAT-PTD, the 142-amino acid VP22.C1 protein may possibly serve as a vector for delivering cargo into cells. As in the case of TAT-PTD and its fusion proteins, VP22.C1 fusion proteins may also enter a cell via endocytosis because they exhibit cytoplasmic vesicular distribution (8Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To date, the cellular internalization mechanism of VP22 fusion proteins is but little understood.In this work, we studied the mechanism of cellular internalization of VP22 using VP22-GFP as a model system. VP22-GFP was internalized through interactions with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and subsequent lipid raft-mediated endocytosis independent of clathrin, caveolae, and Rho family GTPases but dependent on dynamin and Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6). Also, as with transferrin internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, nearly all internalized VP22-GFP signals were incorporated into the early endosomes and co-localized with transferrin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugs and Antibodies—Alexa Fluor 647-labeled transferrin, phalloidin-labeled rhodamine, and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes.

A 0.6-kb EcoRI/NotI fragment of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) was inserted into the EcoRI/NotI site of the pVP22/myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen). A fragment encoding the C-terminal half of VP22 (amino acids 159-301) and full-length enhanced GFP was amplified from the plasmid by PCR; digested with NheI and NotI; and inserted into the NheI/NotI site of pET28a (Novagen), which is capable of producing recombinant protein with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. The following primers were used: 5′-AAATTTGCTAGCACGGCGCCAACCCGATCCAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGTTAGATCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGAC-3′. PCR-based systematic mutagenesis was carried out, and a series of pVP22-GFP derivatives encoding mutants of VP22-GFP were generated. 5The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request. pGFP, a GFP expression plasmid, was constructed by inserting the 0.6-kb EcoRI/NotI fragment of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) into the EcoRI/NotI site of pET28a.The pcDNA3-HA-dynamin-2a-WT and pcDNA3-HA-dynamin-2a-K44A constructs (30Kasai K.

Donaldson (National Institutes of Health).Protein Purification—VP22-GFP and GFP were produced using E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) as host. Cells were first grown overnight in L-broth with kanamycin at 37 °C. The overnight culture was diluted 10 times with the same medium, and shaking was continued at room temperature. Iso-propyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm at A600 = 0.8-1.0. After an additional 12 h of shaking at room temperature, the cell cultures were cooled on ice, and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The pellets were frozen and stored at -20 °C until used. Cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl), and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buffer and then wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl) and finally eluted with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl). Purified protein was immediately used or frozen in 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C until used.Cell Culture and Transfection—Wild-type CHO-K1 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Glycosaminoglycan-deficient (pgsA-745) and heparan sulfate-deficient (pgsD-677) mutant CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Ham's F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, cells were analyzed within the period of 16-48 h following transfection.Visualization of Internalized Proteins by Confocal Microscopy—Cells were cultured in 12-well culture plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) on a glass coverslip. When cells were treated with drug or protein (VP22-GFP, GFP, or transferrin), the culture medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium at the protein and/or drug concentrations indicated. The cells were incubated for 1 h and then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After being fixed with 2-4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature unless indicated otherwise, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). This was followed by cell visualization with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscopy system. Successive 0.25-μm optical sections were taken using a ×60 objective lens. In some cases, after cells had been incubated on ice, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing protein(s) at the indicated concentrations. The cells were then placed on ice for 1 h, washed twice with serum-free medium, placed in prewarmed serum-free medium, incubated for a specified period of time, and then visualized as described above. Transferrin internalization was examined by exposing cells to culture medium containing 0.25 μm Alexa Fluor 647-labeled transferrin and observing stained cells under a confocal microscope.Quantification of Internalized VP22-GFP—Cells were seeded on each well of 12-well culture plates in culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Culturing was continued until pre-confluency at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing 1 μm VP22-GFP. Cells were incubated for the indicated times or for 1 h, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and trypsinized for 15 min at 37 °C to eliminate non-internalized cell-surface protein. This was followed by centrifugation in 1.5-ml tubes, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, lysed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged. The protein content of the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a Hitachi FL-2500 spectrofluorometer at a excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a emission wavelength of 511 nm. Replacement of 0.5% Triton X-100 with 0.1% SDS gave no appreciable difference in measurement, indicating that almost all internalized VP22-GFP is solubilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 treatment.Low Temperature Treatment and ATP Depletion—For low temperature treatment, after being incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, the cells were further incubated in the presence of VP22-GFP for 1 h at 4 °C and subjected to trypsin digestion or fixation. For removal of cellular ATP, the cells were incubated with ATP depletion medium (glucose-free DMEM with 10 mm sodium azide and 6 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1.5 h, followed by incubation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of VP22-GFP for 1 h in serum-free ATP depletion medium. Cellular protein uptake was visualized or measured as described above.Quantification of Cell-surface VP22-GFP and Anti-heparan Sulfate Antibody Binding Signals—Cells were cultured in 12-well culture plates on a glass coverslip. Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated on ice for 1 h. After addition of the indicated concentrations of VP22-GFP or 2 μg/ml anti-heparan sulfate antibody in serum-free DMEM, cells were further incubated on ice for 1 h, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and visualized by confocal microscopy. For anti-heparan sulfate antibody staining, the secondary antibody treatment was also carried out before paraformaldehyde fixation. A projection image was constructed using successive optical sections of 0.25 μm each. A region of interest was drawn around each cell, and the average intensity was calculated using the software that came with the confocal microscope.Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured in 12-well culture plates on a glass coverslip, incubated with protein at the specified concentrations in serum-free DMEM for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After being washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 5-10% goat whole serum (IBL Medical Products Co.) at room temperature for 30 min. Following incubation with the primary antibody (1:100-400 dilution) in PBS containing 1-5% goat whole serum for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with the secondary antibody (1:100-400 dilution) in PBS containing 1-5% goat whole serum for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by two washes with PBS and visualization by confocal microscopy as described above.RNA Interference (RNAi)—Two sets of human clathrin heavy chain small interfering RNA (siRNAs) were selected using siDirect (33Naito Y. Yamada T. Ui-Tei K. Morishita S. Saigo K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W124-W129Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar): CHC1 (clathrin heavy chain 1), GCUUCAGUACCCUGACUAUGG (passenger strand) and AUAGUCAGGGUACUGAAGCCA (guide strand); and CHC2, CCUGGUACGUCGAAAGGAUCC (passenger strand) and AUCCUUUCGACGUACCAGGUA (guide strand). Firefly luciferase siRNA was used as a control: CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAAA (passenger strand) and UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGUG (guide strand). RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo, and double-stranded siRNA was prepared as described previously (34Ui-Tei K. Zenno S. Miyata Y. Saigo K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HeLa cells in 12-well plates were transfected three times at 24-36-h intervals with 50 nm siRNA. Firefly luciferase siRNA-treated and CHC siRNA-treated cells were trypsinized, mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and seeded in 12-well plates 20 h prior to observation of the effects of clathrin heavy chain depletion in the same field. DNA transfection was conducted with a third siRNA transfection.DNA-mediated RNAi was also carried out to knock down the genes encoding RhoA, Cdc42, and Arf6. A firefly luciferase short hairpin RNA expression construct was used as a control. Details of vector construction will be described elsewhere. 6K. Ui-Tei, K. Nishi, and K. Saigo, unpublished data. HeLa cells in 12-well plates were transfected with a suitable construct, and transfectants were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) 24 h after transfection. Cells were analyzed 96 h after transfection.Drug Treatment—Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing a given drug at the indicated concentrations for 30 min except for C. difficile toxin B. Following protein addition to the medium, cells were incubated for 1 or 4 h. Protein uptake and cell-surface binding were visualized and measured as described above.Triton X-100 Treatment—After being put on ice with 0.25 μm VP22-GFP, 2 μg/ml anti-CD59 antibody, or 1 μg/ml anti-transferrin receptor antibody on ice for 1 h, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM, stained with the secondary antibody for 1 h in serum-free DMEM, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, treated with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 7 min, and washed twice again with ice-cold PBS on ice. They were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized.Cell Treatment with Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) Lyases—Enzymatic treatment with GAG lyases was carried out as reported previously (35Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, preconfluent cells were washed once with PBS, followed by incubation with GAG lyases in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% gelatin, and 0.1% glucose for 2 h at 37 °C. Four washings with PBS or serum-free DMEM were carried out. Following addition of the indicated concentrations of VP22-GFP to the medium, cells were incubated for 1 h. VP22-GFP uptake and binding were visualized and measured as described above.Real-time PCR—The total RNA from transfected cells was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). The RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega Corp.), purified using the RNeasy mini kit, and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Before the PCR, a mixture of the synthesized cDNA and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. PCR was then carried out at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. The levels of PCR products were monitored with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system and analyzed with ABI PRISM 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). For each sample, the amount of target mRNA was normalized using endogenous β-actin mRNA. The following primers were used: Arf6, 5′-ATCAATGACCGGGAGATGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGCTGCACATACCAGTTC-3′ (reverse); Cdc42, 5′-CGATGGTGCTGTTGGTAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTCTTGCCCTGCAGTATC-3′ (reverse); RhoA, 5′-CGGTCTGGTCTTCAGCTACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATCACCAACAATCACCAG-3′ reverse; and β-actin, 5′-CACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTC-3′ (reverse).RESULTSCellular Uptake of VP22-GFP Occurs through Endocytosis—To clarify the mechanism for the cellular uptake of VP22, VP22-GFP, a fusion protein between GFP and VP22.C1 (Fig. 1A), was prepared from E. coli cells and added to the culture medium with HeLa cells. GFP signal distribution was examined at 1 h of incubation at 37 °C using a confocal microscope (Fig. 1B). Significant VP22-GFP signals were observed not only on the surface of the cells (Fig. 1B, top section (t.s.)) but also inside (intermediate sections (i.s.)). Fifteen minutes of trypsin treatment at 37 °C eliminated almost completely the cell-surface signals without affecting intracellular signal intensity (Fig. 1B, compare middle and lower panels). Cellular VP22-GFP uptake appeared to depend on the VP22 moiety because no intracellular GFP signal was detected upon elimination of the entire VP22.C1 moiety from the fusion protein (data not shown). Change in intracellular GFP signal intensity was examined spectrofluoro-metrically using trypsin-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 1D). The intracellular VP22-GFP signal increased gradually for >6 h.Fig. 1B shows that the cytoplasmic distribution of VP22-GFP in HeLa cells is vesicular, supporting the notion that VP22-GFP is internalized through endocytosis (8Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Endocytosis-dependent cellular internalization would not occur either at 4 °C or in the absence of ATP (7Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vivès E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (C and E), no or hardly any intracellular accumulation of VP22-GFP could be detected in HeLa cells exposed to VP22-GFP at 4 °C. In contrast to cellular uptake, VP22-GFP adsorption onto the cell surface appeared to occur quite normally even at 4 °C. The cellular ATP pool becomes empty upon preincubation of cells with sodium azide and deoxyglucose (36Tang Y. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Only slight cellular uptake of VP22-GFP without significant reduction in surface signals was apparent in both ATP-depleted HeLa and CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1E). VP22-GFP may thus be concluded to be internalized through endocytosis in HeLa and CHO-K1 cells.Requirement of Heparan Sulfate for Cell-surface Binding and Cellular Uptake of VP22-GFP—Cellular internalization of TAT-PTD requires proteoglycans (11Tyagi M.

https://openalex.org/W2053945938,"Chemokine dimerization has been the subject of much interest in recent years as evidence has accumulated that different quaternary states of chemokines play different biological roles; the monomer is believed to be the receptor-binding unit, whereas the dimer has been implicated in binding cell surface glycosaminoglycans. However, although several studies have provided evidence for this paradigm by making monomeric chemokine variants or dimer-impaired chemokines, few have provided direct evidence of the receptor function of a chemokine dimer. We have produced a covalent dimer of the CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) by placing a disulfide bond at the center of its dimer interface through a single amino acid substitution (MIP-1β-A10C). This variant was shown to be a nondissociating dimer by SDS-PAGE and analytical ultracentrifugation. NMR reveals a structure largely the same as the wild type protein. In studies of glycosaminoglycan binding, MIP-1β-A10C binds to a heparin-Sepharose column as tightly as the wild type protein and more tightly than monomeric variants. However, MIP-1β-A10C neither binds nor activates the MIP-1β receptor CCR5. It was found that the ability to activate CCR5 was recovered upon reduction of the intermolecular disulfide cross-link by incubation with 1 mm dithiothreitol.

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a group of small (7–14 kDa) structurally related proteins that regulate cell trafficking of various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors and cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 2The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanBMEβ-mercaptoethanolDTTdithiothreitolCCR5CC chemokine receptor-5MIP-1βmacrophage inflammatory protein-1β; also called CCL4NOEnuclear Overhauser effectDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumWTwild typeCHOChinese hamster ovaryNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyILinterleukin. There are two major chemokine subfamilies, CC and CXC, named for the placement of conserved Cys residues near the N terminus. The critical role played by chemokines in recruiting leukocytes and inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus entry has led to a great deal of interest in their structural biology. Many chemokine structures have been solved, both by NMR and x-ray crystallography (1Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

These structures reveal that all chemokines share a common fold, composed of three β-strands in a Greek key arrangement, followed by a C-terminal α-helix. Many chemokines form dimers with affinities generally in the high nanomolar or low micromolar range, leading several groups to study the biological role of the chemokine quaternary state. An early study in this area showed that the obligate monomer of the CXC chemokine IL-8 did retain activity on neutrophils in vitro (10Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and later work by our group and others showed that monomeric variants of the CC chemokines MIP-1β and MCP-1 were also able to bind and activate their respective receptors (11Laurence J.S.

More recently, it was shown that monomeric variants of some chemokines were unable to recruit leukocytes in vivo, despite having receptor activity in vitro (17Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Further indication of the role of the chemokine dimer includes studies in which GAGs have been shown to mediate chemokine oligomerization (12Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol.

LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10090-10101Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite the accumulation of data regarding the role of the quaternary state in chemokine function, and the clear evidence that at least some chemokine monomers are competent to activate cognate receptors in vitro, no direct evidence has yet been reported on whether a CC chemokine dimer can or cannot bind to its receptor. In particular, it has never been shown definitively if a chemokine dimer is able to bind the CCR5 receptor or if the dimer has some role in receptor function, in part because it is not possible to observe the quaternary state of a chemokine in standard receptor experiments. Chemokine receptors have been shown to dimerize (19Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Martin de Ana A. Albar J.P. Martinez-A C. Mellado M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), leading to the possibility that multimerization of chemokine ligand on the receptor could lead to multimerization of the receptor. This question is particularly intriguing because the two chemokine subfamilies have completely different dimer structures, leading to the possibility of different results for different subfamilies (21Jin H. Hayes G.L. Darbha N.S. Meyer E. Liwang P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, a covalent dimer of the CC chemokine MIP-1β was produced by a single amino acid substitution (MIP-1β-A10C). This variant was shown to be a nondissociating dimer that forms a disulfide bond at the center of the dimer interface, and its structure is largely the same as the wild type protein. It has been determined that MIP-1β-A10C neither binds nor activates the MIP-1β receptor CCR5. However, the receptor activity was recovered upon reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bond. To the best of our knowledge, results reported here represent the first direct evidence that the CC chemokine dimer does not bind to its receptor and thus offers new implications for chemokine-related drug development. Production and Purification of MIP-1β Variants—The genes for MIP-1β-A10C and A10S were produced using the QuikChange™ procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a variant of pET32-Xa/LIC (Novagen, Madison, WI). Mutations were confirmed through DNA sequencing. These MIP-1β variants protein were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL321(DE3) and purified as follows. The cells were grown in 1 liter of minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source (when preparing protein for NMR assignment experiments, [13C6]glucose was the sole carbon source). Protein production was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm in 37 °C culture for 7 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g in an F10S-6X500y rotor (Piramoon Technologies Inc.) for 30 min. The cells were resuspended in 30 ml of 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), and 10 mm benzamidine and French pressed twice at 16,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 30 min at 17,000 × g in an SS34 rotor (Sorvall Instruments), the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 5 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The solution was stirred overnight and then centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 × g to remove remaining insoluble pellet. To refold the uncut protein, the solution was dropped slowly into 100 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The diluted protein solution was allowed to remain at room temperature for 2 h and then was dialyzed at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8) to remove guanidine chloride and BME. After dialysis, precipitated matter was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g in an F14S-6X250y rotor (Piramoon Technologies Inc.), and the protein was purified on a C4 reversed phase chromatography column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and lyophilized by the Labconco freeze-dry system (Labconco Corp.). The C4 column was found to effectively separate protein with correctly formed disulfide bonds from protein that was observed to be unfolded, presumably because of incorrect disulfide bond formation. To remove the fusion tag, the protein powder was solubilized into ∼1 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 2.5), and the volume was increased to ∼40 ml in 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. Factor Xa (Novagen) was used for the proteolytic cleavage, which typically took 2 weeks at room temperature. SDS-PAGE was used to monitor the cutting reaction. Finally, the cut MIP-1β variants were purified over a C4 reversed phase chromatography column and lyophilized. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE—Equal amounts of MIP-1β variant samples (∼10 μg) were resuspended in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and mixed with 10 μl of 2× loading sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) with or without 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (reducing agent), boiled, and electrophoresed on a 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using rotor An-60 Ti at 25 °C. For MIP-1β-A10C under nonreducing conditions, the speeds used were 25,000, 38,000, and 45,000 rpm. Samples were composed of 10 μm protein in 20 mm (pH 2.5) sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. For MIP-1β-A10C under reducing conditions, the protein was dissolved into 200 μl of 20 mm (pH 2.5) sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl to a concentration of 10 μm. The pH was raised to 7.4 by addition of 2 μl of 1 m NaOH; the solution was made to 1 mm DTT and incubated overnight. Then 2 μl of 50% phosphoric acid was added to lower the pH to 2.5 for analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. The rotor speeds for this reduced sample were 25,000, 35,000 and 45,000 rpm. During each experiment, samples were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The solvent density (ρ) and partial specific volume of the protein (ν¯) were calculated from the amino acid compositions using the program Sednterp (obtained from the Boston Biomedical Research Institute RASMB web site). The data were processed using the program Origin (Beckman) for detecting multiple equilibria and estimating the value of the equilibrium constants from the absorbance data (11Laurence J.S.

Each set of experimental data was fit to an ideal model or monomer-dimer equilibrium model using a nonlinear least squares fit. Selective Reduction of MIP-1β-A10C—To reduce the intermolecular disulfide bond formed by the substitution of Cys for Ala in MIP-1β, the purified MIP-1β-A10C powder was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT (Sigma) was added, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 16 h and then quenched by adding 1 m phosphoric acid to lower the pH to 2.5. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to 0.1%; acetonitrile was added to 10%, and the reduced protein was purified on a C4 column and lyophilized into dried powder. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer using protein samples at ∼1 mm concentration in 20 mm phosphate, 10 mm NaCl buffer (pH 2.5). Chemical shifts were referenced to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate by the method of Wishart et al. (23Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L.

CCR5-expressing Cell Lines—A CHO-K1 cell line coexpressing CCR5, Gα16, and apo-aequorin was a kind gift from Dr. Marc Parmentier from the Institute of Interdisciplinary Research of the Free University of Brussels (ULB) Medical School, Brussels, Belgium. This cell line was described previously (33Blanpain C. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Migeotte I. Sharron M. Dupriez V. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Following selection with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 14 days, the population of mixed cell clones was used in binding and functional studies. A TZM-bl HeLa cell line stably expressing a large amount of human CCR5 was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health; TZM-bl was from Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyuan Wu, and Tranzyme Inc. The details of this cell line were described previously (34Derdeyn C.A. Decker J.M. Sfakianos J.N. Wu X. O'Brien W.A. Ratner L. Kappes J.C. Shaw G.M.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type CCR5 were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc), using 0.08 nm radiolabeled 125I-MIP-1β (2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) as a tracer, variable concentrations of MIP-1β or its mutants, and 40,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The level of total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and the level of nonspecific binding was measured with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C, and then the bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneamine. Filters were counted for 1 min in the Beckman Coulter Gamma LS 5000TA counter. Binding assays utilizing HeLa cells were carried out in the TZM-bl cell line by fixing the cells onto the 24-well culture plate following the protocol mentioned previously (36Chackerian B. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, TZM-bl cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flask in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 units of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin until 30% confluency. Then the cells were detached and seeded onto 24-well culture plate overnight at 105 cells per well. The next day, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then were overlaid with 150 μl of the cold binding buffer. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.05 nm 125I-labeled human MIP-1β (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of various concentrations of chemokine mutants. The reactions were stopped by washing wells four times with the cold binding buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl. Cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1% SDS. Lysates were transferred to a counting vial, and bound radioactivity was counted for 1 min in the Beckman Coulter Gamma LS 5000TA counter. All determinations were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Binding parameters (IC50) were determined with KaleidaGraph version 3.6 (Synergy Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model. Representative data are shown in Fig. 4, B and C. The results are reported as fitted IC50 mean value ± S.D. nm). Functional Assays—The functional response of CCR5-expressing cells to chemokines was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described previously (37Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Rucker J. Govaerts C. Baik S.S. W. Lorthioir O. Migeotte I. Libert F. Baleux F. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

CHO-K1 cells (described above) were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, resuspended in DMEM at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine H (Promega). Cells were diluted 5-fold before being used. Agonists in 50 μl of DMEM were added to 50 μl of a cell suspension (50,000 cells), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in an Orion II microplate luminometer (Berthold Techniques, Germany). Determinations were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The receptor activation EC50 values were determined with KaleidaGraph using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site ligand binding model. Representative data is shown in Fig. 4A. The results are reported as fitted EC50 mean value ± S.D. nm. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography of GAG Binding Studies—GAG binding capacity of chemokine mutants was studied by using the heparin-Sepharose chromatography as mentioned in previous publications (38Koopmann W. Ediriwickrema C. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2120-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of MIP-1β-A10C, MIP (9Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), MIP-1β-F13L, and MIP-1β-L34W (∼10 μg of lyophilized protein) were taken up in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and injected onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap heparin column (GE Healthcare) using the AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 5 ml of the same buffer followed by a gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) at a rate of 0.5 ml/min for 60 min. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The salt concentration corresponding to the center of each eluted peak is a relative determinant of the GAG binding ability of that mutant. MIP-1β-A10C Is a Covalent Nondissociating Dimer—To obtain an obligate MIP-1β dimer, a single substitution from Ala to Cys at the 10th position, which is in the center of dimer interface, was made (Fig. 1A). To determine the oligomerization state of MIP-1β-A10C, SDS-PAGE experiments were carried out. In the presence of reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, MIP-1β-A10C migrates nearly identically to wild type MIP-1β on the gel. In the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, MIP-1β-A10C migrates more slowly than the wild type MIP-1β (Fig. 1B) at a position indicative of a covalent dimer. To further confirm this, we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation equilibrium experiments on the purified protein. The ultracentrifugation data did not fit to either a dissociating dimer model or to a monomer model, but rather the best fit of the data was to a single species of 15.5 kDa (twice the size of the calculated the monomer molecular weight), indicating MIP-1β-A10C is indeed a non-dissociating covalent dimer (Fig. 1C). MIP-1β-A10C Is Similar in Structure to the Wild Type MIP-1β Dimer—The A10C mutation results in three contiguous cysteines (Cys10, Cys11, and Cys12), each of which must form a correct disulfide bond to result in correctly folded protein. Although Cys10 is involved in an intermolecular cross-link, Cys11 and Cys12 form internal disulfide links (to Cys35 and Cys51, respectively) as a critical component of the wild type tertiary structure. A detailed NMR investigation was carried out to determine whether the structure of the covalent dimer MIP-1β-A10C was identical to that of the wild type MIP-1β dimer. Complete backbone (15N, 1HN, 13Cα, and 13Cβ) chemical shifts were determined for MIP-1β-A10C and compared with the wild type values. 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts are sensitive to secondary structure and overall fold of the protein, and Fig. 2 shows that these values are essentially identical between the two proteins except at the site of mutation. This indicates that the A10C variant has a typical chemokine fold that is likely very similar to wild type MIP-1β. Furthermore, these data in addition to intramolecular NOE distance contacts (data not shown) indicate that the native disulfide bonds (Cys11–Cys35 and Cys12–Cys51) have not been perturbed. To determine whether the interaction of the two monomeric subunits in MIP-1β-A10C is the same as in the wild type dimer, we carried out three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY and four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited NOESY experiments on MIP-1β-A10C. These data show that the MIP-1β-A10C dimer makes almost all of the same inter-subunit contacts as the wild type dimer, including contacts between Gly4, Ser5, Asp6, and Pro7 to Val50′; Asp6 to Cys51′; Pro8, Thr9 to Cys12′; Pro8 to Val41′; and numerous contacts between Phe13 and Thr9′, and Leu34′, which can only be made across the dimer and not intramolecularly (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. 2, and supplemental Table 1). Not every contact reported for the wild type dimer was able to be distinguished for MIP-1β-A10C, although in many cases NOE peaks may be present but were too overlapped or of low intensity to be assigned unambiguously. For example, the description of the wild type MIP-1β dimer mentions contact between Ser47′ and both Gly4 and Ser5 (1Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but because of extensive overlap we could not unambiguously assign an NOE peak for these contacts. In addition, a few contacts are present in MIP-1β-A10C that indicate closer intersubunit contacts for certain atoms than were seen in the wild type dimer structure, including NOE contact between Ser5 and Thr16′(Hγ), and between Phe13(Hα) (as opposed to the side chain) and Leu34′. This could indicate an altered structure compared with the wild type protein or could be explained by spin diffusion during the NMR experiment. However, overall the structural results suggest that MIP-1β-A10C is nearly identical in structure to the wild type dimer, and so our functional results do indeed reflect the function of the chemokine dimer and are not an artifact of altered conformation. The MIP-1β-A10C Dimer Is Not Active on the Receptor CCR5—Two measures of chemokine receptor function are typically carried out, activity assays and binding assays. The activity assays generally measure the release of intracellular calcium stores after productive engagement of the chemokine receptor by its ligand. Binding assays measure the level of chemokine binding to the receptor, regardless of whether an intracellular signal is able to be transmitted. To measure the ability of MIP-1β-A10C to activate the CCR5 receptor, activity assays were carried out on CHO-K1 cells bearing human CCR5. As shown in Fig. 4A, MIP-1β-A10C is unable to elicit a response even at micromolar concentrations. Similarly, binding assays reveal that MIP-1β-A10C is unable to bind CCR5 (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate that mutation to the 10th position is"
https://openalex.org/W2119265100,"Release of charged neurotransmitter molecules through a narrow fusion pore requires charge compensation by other ions. It has been proposed that this may occur by ion flow from the cytosol through channels in the vesicle membrane, which would generate a net outward current. This hypothesis was tested in chromaffin cells using cell-attached patch amperometry that simultaneously measured catecholamine release from single vesicles and ionic current across the patch membrane. No detectable current was associated with catecholamine release indicating that <2% of cations, if any, enter the vesicle through its membrane. Instead, we show that flux of catecholamines through the fusion pore, measured as an amperometric foot signal, decreases when the extracellular cation concentration is reduced. The results reveal that the rate of transmitter release through the fusion pore is coupled to net Na+ influx through the fusion pore, as predicted by electrodiffusion theory applied to fusion-pore permeation, and suggest a prefusion rather than postfusion role for vesicular cation channels."

A subset of pathogenic bacteria also express terminal Neu5Ac residues, using a biosynthetic pathway evolutionarily related to that of the vertebrate host. Sia biosynthesis in bacteria appears ancient (1Angata T. Varki A. Chem.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and has become increasingly associated with invasive infections in elderly and immunocompromised individuals (10Edwards M.S. Nizet V. Baker C.J. Remington J. Klein J. Baker C.J. Wilson C.B. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. 2006: 404-464Google Scholar). The most extensively studied and widely appreciated virulence factor of GBS is its Sia-capped capsular polysaccharide (CPS). To date, the structures of nine antigenically distinct GBS CPS serotypes have been described, all of which express terminal α2–3-linked Neu5Ac (11Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Animal models of infection confirm that GBS mutants in the Sia biosynthetic pathway are severely attenuated for virulence (12Wessels M.R. Rubens C.E. Benedí V Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8983-8987Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to being a virulence determinant, the CPS is also an important target of both innate (lectin-mediated complement) and adaptive (IgG) host immune responses against the pathogen (13Aoyagi Y. Adderson E.E. Min J.G. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Takahashi S. Okuwaki Y. Bohnsack J.F. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Baker C.J. Kasper D.L. N. Engl. J.

Recently, it was shown that bacterial Sias can facilitate interactions with certain host Sia-binding proteins called Siglecs (15Jones C. Virji M. Crocker P.R. Mol.

In short, the sialylated CPS of GBS represents both an important host-pathogen interface and a relevant model for studying Siadependent bacterial interactions with the immune system. Recently, we described the biochemical and genetic basis of capsular Sia O-acetylation in GBS (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sia O-acetylation influences several Sia-dependent functions of vertebrate cells, including apoptotic regulation (33Malisan F. Franchi L. Tomassini B. Ventura N. Condo I. Rippo M.R. Rufini A.

Med. 2002; 196: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), susceptibility to the alternative pathway of complement, and binding to leukocyte-expressed Sia-binding proteins (34Shi W.X.

Given the effects of this modification on vertebrate cell-cell interactions, we hypothesize that Sia O-acetylation on the bacterial surface is also likely to modulate interactions between GBS and host. A combined biochemical and genetic approach for manipulating Sia-O-acetyl regulation in GBS is necessary to address these and other pertinent questions about Sia-dependent virulence at the host pathogen interface. Biosynthesis of sialylated structures requires activation of the Sia monomer by transfer of the α-phosphate of CTP to the anomeric oxygen of Neu5Ac (35Ambrose M.G. Freese S.J. Reinhold M.S. Warner T.G. Vann W.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac is catalyzed by a cytidyltransferase (CMP-Sia synthetase). Some bacterial CMP-Sia synthetases have an additional C-terminal domain related to the GSDL family of hydrolases. In GBS and Escherichia coli K1, these two-domain CMP-Sia synthetases are encoded by the neuA gene and were recently shown to possess esterase functionality in vitro (36Liu G. Jin C. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17738-17749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Yu H. Ryan W. Yu H. Chen X. Biotechnol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Initial experiments on the bifunctional enzymes employed 4-nitrophenyl-acetate and (acetylated) platelet-activating factor as substrates of the esterase reaction (36Liu G. Jin C. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17738-17749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Yu H. Ryan W. Yu H. Chen X. Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recently, work by Vimr and coworkers (38Steenbergen S.M. Lee Y.C. Vann W.F. Vionnet J. Wright L.F. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest that in E. coli, the native substrate of the NeuA esterase domain is O-acetylated Sia. Based on these studies and our earlier observations, we hypothesized that GBS NeuA acts natively as a Sia-O-acetylesterase, an intracellular process that could mitigate overall O-acetylation of the sialylated capsule in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used a defined in vitro system to explore mechanistic aspects of Sia-O-acetyl removal, coupled with live bacterial models to study the biochemical phenotypes resulting from genetic deletion, overexpression, and site-directed enzymatic inactivation of the NeuA esterase in GBS. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the bifunctional GBS NeuA can act through two different enzymatic pathways and show for the first time that O-acetyl removal prior to capsular assembly is an important regulatory mechanism controlling the extent of capsular O-acetylation in intact bacteria. Purification of Recombinant NeuA Enzymes-Full-length neuA homologs were cloned into pET15b or pET22b(+) vectors from GBS serotype V strain 2603V/R, Neisseria meningitidis group B strain MC58, and E. coli K1 strain ATCC13027 as previously described. C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins were expressed in isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (39Yu H. Yu H. Karpel R. Chen X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Enzymes were stored at 4 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol. We observed some variability in overall GBS enzyme activity between enzyme batches over time. Findings were confirmed using at least two different batches of GBS enzyme. Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Neu5,9Ac2 and CMP-Neu5, 9Ac2-6-O-Acetyl ManNAc was prepared as previously described (40Yu H. Huang S. Chokhawala H. Sun M. Zheng H. Chen X. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2006; 45: 3938-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 mg of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) was dissolved in a mixture of CH3CN and Me2SO (3:1, v/v, 6 ml). Trifluoroethyl acetate (1 ml) and Protease N (100 mg; Amano Enzyme Inc.) were added, and the suspension was stirred vigorously at 45 °C for 2 days. Protein was then removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (EtOAc/MeOH, 5:1 v/v) using Silica Gel 60 (40–63 μm; Sorbent Technologies) to yield 6-O-acetyl ManNAc (121 mg, 51% yield). 9-O-Acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) was subsequently prepared in a Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.5) buffer containing MgCl2 (20 mm), 6-O-acetyl ManNAc (10 mm), sodium pyruvate (50 mm), and the recombinant Sia aldolase from E. coli K12 ATCC47076 (0.2 mg/ml) (39Yu H. Yu H. Karpel R. Chen X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated in an isotherm incubator at 37 °C with 140 rpm agitation for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding EtOH when TLC (EtOAc/MeOH/H2O/HOAc = 4:2:2:0.2, v/v/v/v) analysis indicated the completion of the reaction. The precipitates in the reaction mixture were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated and purified by BioGel P-2 gel filtration chromatography to yield Neu5,9Ac2 (60%) as a white solid after lyophilization. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O) δ 4.31 (dd, 1 H, J = 3.0, 12.0 Hz), 4.14 (dd, 1 H, J = 5.7. 11.4 Hz), 3.86–4.01 (m, 2 H), 3.67–3.70 (m, 1 H), 3.57 (d, 1 H, J = 6.6 Hz), 2.20 (dd, 1 H, J = 4.5, 12.9 Hz), 2.08 (s, 3 H), 2.02 (s, 3 H), 1.79 (t, 1 H, J = 12.9 Hz); 13C NMR (75 MHz, D2O) δ 176.62, 174.83, 174.53, 96.60, 70.21, 68.27, 67.91, 67.26, 66.34, 52.26, 39.40, 22.19, 20.35. N-Acetylmannosamine, EtOAc, and trifluoroethyl acetate were purchased form Sigma. CH3CN, Me2SO, MeOH, HOAc, Tris, and MgCl2 were from Fisher. The presence of small quantities of Neu5,7Ac2 and Neu5,8Ac2 seen by HPLC (Fig. 1A) and probably by NMR (see left shoulder of the 9-OAc peak in Fig. 3A) probably reflect an equilibrium of O-acetyl migration along the exocyclic 3-carbon side chain of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (41Kamerling J.P. Schauer R. Shukla A.K. Stoll S. van H.H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 is a direct substrate of the NeuA esterase and is de-O-acetylated more rapidly than free Neu5,9Ac2. NeuA reactions were monitored by 600 MHz 1H NMR. Experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 0.7 ml. Assays included 2.5 μm GBS NeuA with 2.5 mm substrate, CTP, and MgCl2 in 20 mm deuterated phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. About 5 min elapsed between the addition of the enzyme and the acquisition of the first time point (defined as t = 0 min). NMR spectra were acquired every 2 min. Data shown are representative of the trends observed throughout the reaction. A, Neu5,9Ac2 alone was used as substrate. B, enzymatically synthesized CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 was used as substrate but contained a significant amount of free Neu5,9Ac2, allowing internal comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 was synthesized from 6-O-acetyl ManNAc using the Sia aldolase and NeuA of N. meningitidis (the latter does not possess a C-terminal esterase domain) as reported (39Yu H. Yu H. Karpel R. Chen X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), except that a Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.5 was used instead of pH 8.5. The product CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 was stored as a lyophilized powder at –80 °C. This species was not completely stable and was broken down spontaneously during the lyophilization and storage to form some CMP and Neu5,9Ac2 (42Higa H.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8838-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1,2-Diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene (DMB) derivatization with or without NaBH4 treatment (as described below) showed that the CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 used in our assays contained ∼50% Neu5,9Ac2. Preparation of [9-O-acetyl-3H]Neu5,9Ac2-Radioactive substrate for NeuA esterase assays was prepared as previously described (43Varki A. Diaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6600-6608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat liver Golgi vesicles were prepared by the method of Leelevathi (44Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and subsequently labeled with [acetyl-3H]acetyl-coenzyme A, of which 75–85% was incorporated into O-acetylated Neu5Ac (45Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Sias were released by treatment with Arthrobacter urafaciens sialidase and further purified using Dowex-1 and Dowex 3×4A ion exchange resins as previously described. Finally, any O-acetylation existing at the 7-carbon position of Sia was induced to migrate to the 9-carbon position by incubation of the purified Sia pool in 20 mm ammonium hydroxide at 37 °C for 30 min followed by rapid evaporation. DMB Derivatization and HPLC Analysis of Sias-Sias were derivatized in 7 mm DMB, 18 mm sodium hydrosulfite, 1.4 m acetic acid, and 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 hat 50°Cinthe dark. Typically, fresh 2 × DMB reagent was added to an equal volume of released Sias or reaction mixture. Derivatized Sias were resolved on a reverse phase C18 Microsorb-MV column (Varian; 4.6-mm internal diameter, 25 cm, 5 μm) using a Rainin Dynamax SD-200 high pressure liquid chromatograph and a 50-min isocratic elution in 8% acetonitrile and 7% methanol in water at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min (45Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). C18 separation of Sias was followed by fluorescence detection using a Jasco FP-2020 Plus intelligent fluorescence detector. Standard Sias prepared from bovine submaxillary mucin as previously described (46Manzi A.E. Diaz S. Varki A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 20-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were derivatized in parallel for peak assignment. Integration of HPLC peaks was performed using Rainin R software, allowing calculation of O-acetylation as a percentage of total Sias. NeuA Esterase Assays-Purified NeuA enzyme was incubated at a concentration of 1–4 μm with Neu5,9Ac2 or [9-O-acetyl-3H]Neu5,9Ac2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of 5 mm CTP and 20 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. Control reactions in the absence of enzyme or in the presence of an equimolar concentration of bovine serum albumin showed little background hydrolysis. When (nonradioactive) Neu5,9Ac2 was used, reactions were quenched at the designated time interval by the addition of 2 × DMB derivatization reagent (see below), followed by incubation at 50 °C for 2 h and then HPLC separation and quantitation of starting material (Neu5,9Ac2) and reaction product (Neu5Ac). When [9-O-acetyl-3H]Neu5,9Ac2 was used, reactions were performed with 7,000–12,000 cpm of substrate (3–4 μm final concentration) and were quenched with an equal volume of 125 mm chloroacetic acid dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 1 m NaOH and 4 m NaCl. Reactions to assess linearity of hydrolysis with varying enzyme concentration were performed in separate tubes; however, a single large reaction was set up to measure hydrolysis over time, with removal of reaction aliquots at various time intervals. Quenched reactions were allowed to sit on ice for 15 min, followed by a 5-min high speed centrifugation step to remove any precipitated protein. Typically, 80 μl of quenched reaction were added to 10 ml of scintillation mixture consisting of 0.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.03% 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-1)benzene (both from U. S. Biochemical Corp.) dissolved in toluene with the subsequent addition of 20% isoamyl alcohol. Released (protonated) free acetate is taken into the organic phase scintillation mixture, whereas the nonhydrolyzed starting material remains in the aqueous phase of the reaction mixture and is not counted. This is based on an assay originally reported for analysis of acetylcholinesterase activity (47Johnson C.D. Russell R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Reduction of Free Sias in Reaction Products with Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4)-CMP-Sias are cleaved under the acidic conditions of DMB derivatization. For this reason, the DMB-HPLC method alone cannot distinguish between free and CMP-activated Sias produced during the NeuA reaction. We modified a previously described method (48Kean E.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5643-5650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect CMP-activated Sias. Products of the NeuA reaction (∼400 pmol) were treated with 80 mm sodium borohydride at room temperature for 20 min and then quenched with the addition of 5 m acetic acid (1:7 by volume). The DMB reagent was added directly to NaBH4-treated or untreated samples. Parallel controls included commercially produced Neu5Ac (Pfanstiehl Laboratories, Waukegan, IL) and CMP-Neu5Ac (Sigma). In control reactions, Neu5Ac was destroyed by NaBH4, and CMP-Neu5Ac remained >90% intact. Untreated Neu5Ac was used as a standard for quantitation of CMP activation and de-O-acetylation reactions. 1H NMR Assays-Experiments were carried out in a total volume of 0.7 ml using 2.5 μm GBS NeuA and 2.5 mm substrate in the presence of cofactors (5 mm CTP, 20 mm MgCl2) in 20 mm deuterated phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Spectra were acquired every 2 min using 600 MHz 1H NMR. Peak assignments were made by comparison with the 1H NMR spectra of standards. Strains and Culture Conditions-All GBS strains are isolates from human neonates with invasive infection. GBS were propagated on Todd-Hewitt agar plates or liquid broth at 37 °C without shaking, with 5–10 μg/ml erythromycin (Erm) or 2 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm) selection when indicated. Allelic exchange mutagenesis of neuA was performed in WT serotype III strains COH1 and D136 and serotype Ia strain A909. In addition, NeuA overexpression was performed in serotype Ib (H36B), V (NCTC), and Ia (KL90) strains. Release of GBS Sias-Total bacterial Sias were released using 2 m acetic acid for 3 h at 80°C (45Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Alternatively, surface Sias were released using A. urafaciens sialidase (EY Laboratories) in 50 mm sodium acetate for 3 h at 37°C. Deletion, Complementation, and Overexpression of NeuA in GBS-The GBS neuA knock-out vector (pNeuA-KO) was constructed as described previously (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and used for precise, in frame replacement of GBS neuA for a Cm acetyltransferase gene (cat), which confers resistance to Cm. Briefly, WT GBS strains were transformed by electroporation with pNeuA-KO with selection on Erm at 30 °C. Chromosomal integration events were identified by a shift to the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) under Erm selection, followed by relaxation in the absence of antibiotics to identify double cross-over mutants with Cm resistance but Erm sensitivity. Precise in-frame allelic replacement of neuA by cat in the GBS chromosome was confirmed by PCR. A plasmid bearing GBS NeuA under a constitutive promoter (pGBS-NeuA) was generated as described previously (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and introduced by electroporation to transform WT or NeuA mutant strains. Site-directed Mutagenesis of neuA-Site-directed mutagenesis of NeuA asparagine 301 to alanine in pGBS-NeuA was accomplished with PAGE-purified primer 5′-ctataggggtagctgatctcattacagg-3′ and its reverse complement in the QuikChange reaction (Stratagene) followed by DpnI digestion to remove residual template. DNA isolated by ethanol precipitation was used to transform electrocompetent E. coli MC1061, and plasmid pGBS-NeuA-N301A was confirmed by sequencing to harbor only the single residue change in the neuA coding region. GBS NeuA De-O-acetylates Free Neu5,9Ac2 under Conditions That Maintain the NeuA CMP-Sia Synthetase Activity-The GBS O-acetyltransferase, NeuD, acts at the level of free intracellular Sia (17Lewis A.L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11186-11192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the NeuA C-terminal esterase domain could act on free intracellular O-acetylated Sias to regulate capsular O-acetylation on the bacterial surface. Assays were designed to test this hypothesis in vitro, using purified recombinant GBS NeuA and synthetic Neu5,9Ac2. Reaction products were monitored by reverse phase HPLC after fluorescent derivatization of Sias using DMB. Initial experiments used reaction conditions identical to those previously published for the (presumably nonnative) substrates 4-nitrophenyl-acetate and platelet-activating factor (40Yu H. Huang S. Chokhawala H. Sun M. Zheng H. Chen X. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2006; 45: 3938-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, little difference was observed between HPLC profiles of the Neu5,9Ac2 substrate in the presence or absence of purified NeuA enzyme (Fig. 1A). Given the putative bifunctional nature of this enzyme, co-factors of the CMP-Sia synthetase domain (CTP and Mg2+) were added in an attempt to boost the proposed secondary activity. The new conditions did, in fact, stimulate de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac2 as evidenced by a NeuA-dependent increase in the Neu5Ac reaction product by DMB-HPLC (Fig. 1A). Upon removal of either CTP or MgCl2 from the reaction, esterase activity returned to near base line levels (Fig. 1B). Spontaneous migration and hydrolysis of Sia-O-acetyl esters has been reported in several contexts, particularl"
https://openalex.org/W2094004006,"Ataxin-1 is a neurodegenerative disorder protein whose mutant form causes spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1). Evidence suggests that ataxin-1 may function as a transcription repressor. However, neither the importance of this putative transcriptional repression activity in neural cytotoxicity nor the transcriptional targets of ataxin-1 are known. Here we identify the MEF2-HDAC4 transcriptional complex involved in neuron survival as a target of ataxin-1. We show that ataxin-1 binds specifically to histone deacetylase-4 (HDAC4) and MEF2 and colocalizes with them in nuclear inclusion bodies. Significantly, these interactions are greatly reduced by the S776A mutation, which largely abrogates the cytotoxicity of ataxin-1. Supporting the importance of these interactions, we show that wild type ataxin-1 represses MEF2-dependent transcription, whereas the S776A mutant is less potent. Furthermore, overexpression of MEF2 can partially reverse cytotoxicity caused by ataxin-1. Our results identify the MEF2-HDAC4 complex as a target for ataxin-1 transcriptional repression activity and suggest a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby ataxin-1 sequesters and inhibits the neuronal survival factor MEF2.

Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SCA1 is one of at least nine polyglutamine diseases caused by mutant proteins with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract (2Michalik A. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R173-R186Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins are prone to the formation of toxic aggregates that are likely to be a major cause of neuronal cell death (reviewed in Ref. 3Lansbury P.T. Lashuel H.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In SCA1, ataxin-1 has been identified as the polyglutamine disease protein (4Banfi S. Servadio A. Chung M.Y. Kwiatkowski T.J.

Although its physiological function is not known with certainty, ataxin-1 interacts with the transcription corepressor silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and histone deacetylase HDAC3, and it can repress transcription when tethered to DNA (5Tsai C.C.

Interestingly, these interactions are mediated by a conserved domain termed the AXH, which has also been reported to contribute to aggregation of ataxin-1 (6Mizutani A. Wang L. Rajan H. Vig P.J.

These findings, as well as a recent report of ataxin-1 in complexes with the repressor Capicua (CIC), indicate an activity of ataxin-1 in transcriptional repression (8Lam Y.C. Bowman A.B. Jafar-Nejad P. Lim J. Richman R. Fryer J.D. Hyun E.D. Duvick L.A. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2006; 127: 1335-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, to what degree this transcriptional repression activity is important for ataxin-1-dependent pathogenesis and what specific transcriptional pathways are targeted by ataxin-1 remain unknown. Answers to these questions may add to our understanding of how ataxin-1 induces neuron death and reveal targets that might be critical for SCA1 pathogenesis.Disease-associated ataxin-1 variants have an expansion of the polyglutamine tract, and they form nuclear inclusion bodies in cultured cells and in neurons from affected patients and transgenic mice (1Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, other characteristics besides the length of the polyglutamine tract strongly affect disease development. Overexpression of a short polyQ form of ataxin-1 in fly and mouse models also leads to the formation of nuclear inclusions and a neurodegenerative phenotype, albeit a milder one (1Orr H.T.

Furthermore, elegant studies have revealed that phosphorylation at serine 776 is a critical modulator for ataxin-1 toxicity (10Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y.

The phosphorylation of serine 776 was shown to recruit the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3, resulting in increased ataxin-1 stabilization, aggregation, and toxicity (11Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Remarkably, mutation of this serine to alanine (S776A) severely impairs the ability of ataxin-1 to elicit a prominent neurodegeneration phenotype (10Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T.

Although the serine 776 phosphorylation status robustly affects the potency of ataxin-1 to induce cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration, the mechanism by which this phosphorylation affects pathogenesis is not well understood.Histone deacetylase-4 (HDAC4), a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases, has previously been identified as a regulator of neuronal cell death (12Bolger T.A. Yao T.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9544-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). HDAC4 actively shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to specific signaling events (13Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under conditions of activity-dependent neuron death, HDAC4 translocates to the nucleus, and there it promotes cell death through its transcription repression activity (12Bolger T.A. Yao T.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9544-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This is accomplished at least in part by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor MEF2. MEF2 acts as a neuronal survival factor, and its inhibition has been linked to several different kinds of neuron death (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Okamoto S. Li Z. Ju C. Scholzke M.N. Mathews E. Cui J. Salvesen G.S. Bossy-Wetzel E. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although these studies indicate that HDAC4 and MEF2 are regulators of activity-dependent cell death, whether this transcriptional complex is involved in other types of neuron death, such as those associated with neurodegeneration, is not known.In this study, we describe a functional interaction between ataxin-1, HDAC4, and MEF2. We show that ataxin-1 binds HDAC4 and MEF2, and they colocalize to ataxin-1-induced nuclear inclusion bodies. Functionally, we present data that ataxin-1 acts as a repressor of MEF2-dependent transcription. Importantly, the less toxic ataxin-1 S776A mutant shows a markedly reduced interaction with HDAC4 and MEF2 and compromised transcriptional repressive activity. Lastly, we show that overexpression of MEF2 is able to partially rescue cellular toxicity caused by ataxin-1. Our study identifies the MEF2-HDAC4 transcriptional complex as a target of ataxin-1, and we suggest that repression of MEF2 activity may contribute to ataxin-1-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The HDAC4 polyclonal antibody, ab186, was described previously (13Zhao X.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9544-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) medium consisted of Neurobasal with 5% fetal bovine serum, B27 supplement, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 0.6 mg/ml glucose, and 25 mm KCl. After 1 day in culture, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to cells to inhibit non-neuronal cells. CGNs were transfected immediately following isolation using the mouse neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa), and cells were then cultured for 2 days before harvesting. CAD cells, a variant of Cath.a cells, were cultured in 8% fetal bovine serum in DMEM-F12. Differentiation medium consisted of DMEM-F12 without serum. Cos-7 and 293T cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. C2C12 cells were cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's instructions.Immunofluorescent Staining—Samples were stained for immunofluorescence essentially as described (13Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When samples were harvested, coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. They were washed and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed, incubated with secondary antibody, washed again, stained with Hoechst dye, and mounted with Fluoromount-G. CGN images in Fig. 1A were captured with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope with ×63 objective lens. All other images were taken with a Zeiss Axioimager microscope with ×63 objective.Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in either modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) for HDAC4 immunoprecipitations or NETN (170 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for MEF2 immunoprecipitations. 0.8–1.2 mg of total protein were rocked 5 h to overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, rabbit α-mouse IgG, and protein A-conjugated beads. Beads were spun down and then washed three times with lysis buffer, and then 2× sample buffer was added. Samples were then boiled for 10 min, and beads were removed by centrifuging. Samples were then run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted. For band intensity quantitation, NIH ImageJ software was used to analyze the bands. The values for the coimmunoprecipitated ataxin-1 were normalized to the ataxin-1 protein levels in the respective whole cell lysates. The values for ataxin1-82Q alone (see Fig. 2B) and for ataxin1-2Q (see Fig. 3D) were set to 100.FIGURE 2HDAC4 association with the ataxin-1-S776A mutant is reduced.

After 24 h, the cells were placed in differentiation medium for an additional 24 h. Then the samples were subjected to the Cytotox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega), which compares lactate dehydrogenase levels in the medium from ruptured, dying cells with the levels in lysates from the remaining healthy cells. The medium from each sample was removed, centrifuged briefly, and then diluted 1:3 for the assay. Cells remaining on the plates were lysed in buffer containing 0.9% Triton for 45 min at 37 °C. Lysates were transferred to tubes, centrifuged briefly, and diluted 1:10 for the assay. 50 μlof diluted medium or lysate was mixed in a 96-well plate with an equal amount of substrate mix and incubated for 20–30 min until color change was evident. Absorbance was then read at 490 nm on a plate reader. Relative values were determined by subtracting background and multiplying by the dilution factor, and the percentage of cell death was determined by dividing the value derived from the medium by the lysate value for each sample. Samples were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and data were collected from four independent experiments. The mean for each is shown, and in Fig. 4, error bars represent standard error of the mean.RESULTSAs we have shown previously, HDAC4 translocates to the nucleus under conditions of neuron death (12Bolger T.A. Yao T.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9544-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We wished to examine whether this translocation also occurred in pathological conditions of neuronal cell death, such as death caused by expanded polyglutamine-tract proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. To this end, we transfected CGNs with a disease-associated form of ataxin-1 that contains a glutamine tract of 82 residues (ataxin-1-82Q) and examined the localization of HDAC4 with a specific antibody (13Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, in a control GFP transfection, HDAC4 was primarily localized to the cytoplasm. In contrast, transfected ataxin-1-82Q caused HDAC4 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, in those cells, a portion of the nuclear HDAC4 was also concentrated to ataxin-1 inclusion bodies (see inset).To confirm the recruitment of HDAC4 to nuclear inclusion bodies, we transfected CAD cells, a catecholaminergic cell line derived from mouse neuroblastoma, with GFP-ataxin-1-82Q and stained them with HDAC4 and GFP antibodies (18Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in CGNs, endogenous HDAC4 staining in these cells also colocalized with ataxin-1-82Q inclusions (Fig. 1B). HDAC4 can also be found at nuclear inclusion bodies formed by a 2Q form of ataxin-1, indicating that the recruitment of HDAC4 is not strictly dependent on polyglutamine length (data not shown). Similar colocalization can be observed with ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged HDAC4 and GFP-ataxin-1, as well as FLAG-ataxin-1-82Q and endogenous HDAC4 (supplemental Fig. 1). Importantly, related family members HDAC1 and HDAC10 were not concentrated to the ataxin-1 inclusion bodies (Fig. 1C and data not shown). These observations show that HDAC4 colocalizes with ataxin-1 inclusion bodies, indicating a specific association of HDAC4 and ataxin-1.Inclusion body formation and the neural toxicity of ataxin-1 have been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation of serine 776 (10Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Neuron. 2003; 38: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site to alanine (S776A) results in an ataxin-1 that forms fewer inclusions and has severely reduced neurodegeneration when compared with non-mutated forms. If HDAC4 association with ataxin-1 is related to the disease process, we reasoned that its interaction might be dependent on Ser-776 phosphorylation. To address this possibility, we transfected GFP-ataxin-1-82Q and the 82Q-S776A mutant into CAD cells and stained the cells for GFP and HDAC4 (Fig. 2A). As reported previously, the ataxin-1-S776A mutant can still occasionally form inclusion bodies (11Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, HDAC4 is absent from most of these S776A-ataxin-1 inclusion bodies (Fig. 2A, bottom panels), indicating that the association of HDAC4 and ataxin-1 is negatively affected by the S776A mutation. Consistent with the immunolocalization study, a coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that both ataxin1-2Q and 82Q-ataxin-1 interact with HDAC4 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the ataxin-1-S776A mutant associated with HDAC4 weakly and below background level. Taken together, these data argue strongly that HDAC4 associates with ataxin-1 and that this binding is modulated by serine 776 of ataxin-1.To begin to elucidate the functional significance of the association of HDAC4 and ataxin-1, we investigated the potential involvement of MEF2 for two reasons. First, HDAC4 binds MEF2 with high affinity and represses its transcriptional activity (19Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Second, MEF2 is well established as a pro-survival factor in neurons (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous MEF2 was prominently present at ataxin-1 inclusion bodies in CAD cells. This colocalization is specific, as neither estrogen receptor-α nor SP-1 was found in the inclusion bodies (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Importantly, like HDAC4, MEF2 is not recruited to inclusion bodies induced by the ataxin-1-S776A mutant (Fig. 3C). Further validating the interaction of ataxin-1 and MEF2, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that MEF2 associates with both the 2Q and the 82Q forms of ataxin-1 but much less efficiently (<30%) with the ataxin-1-S776A mutant (Fig. 3D). Thus this data demonstrate that MEF2 also associates with ataxin-1 and that ataxin-1-S776A, a mutation associated with less toxicity, has reduced association with both HDAC4 and MEF2.Because ataxin-1 has the ability to act as a transcriptional repressor, we hypothesized that ataxin-1 may interact with HDAC4 and MEF2 and repress MEF2-dependent transcription. To address this hypothesis, we transfected Cos-7 cells with a luciferase reporter containing three tandem repeats of MEF2 binding sites and performed luciferase assays. Cotransfection of MEF2 resulted in substantial activation of the reporter (Fig. 4A). The addition of either ataxin-1-2Q or ataxin-1-82Q repressed MEF2-dependent reporter activity, indicating that ataxin-1 can indeed inhibit MEF2. Importantly, the S776A mutant of ataxin-1 was significantly impaired in its ability to repress MEF2 transcription activity. These data indicate that ataxin-1 can act as a transcriptional corepressor of MEF2. Further, the difference in activity between ataxin-1-82Q and the S776A mutant suggests a correlation between the abilities of ataxin-1 to induce cellular toxicity and repress MEF2 activity.MEF2 is known to be an important factor in neuronal survival (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of MEF2 by ataxin-1 through its transcription repression activity and its sequestration of MEF2 to inclusions may be important for ataxin-1-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether overexpression of MEF2 can alleviate ataxin-1-induced cell death. To that end, we cotransfected CAD cells with MEF2 and GFP, ataxin-1-82Q, or ataxin-1-82Q-S776A and then differentiated the cells by serum starvation for 24 h. We then performed a colorimetric cytotoxicity assay that measures lactate dehydrogenase activity to determine the percentage of cell death. As shown in Fig. 4B, ataxin-1-82Q (21%) induced about a 3-fold increase in the amount of cell death over GFP controls (<8%), whereas the toxicity of the S776A mutant was considerably lower (11%). Importantly, although cotransfection of MEF2 had little effect on cell death in GFP and S776A mutant samples, it significantly reduced the toxicity of the ataxin-1-82Q by about one-third (15%), indicating that MEF2 overexpression can partially rescue cell death caused by ataxin-1. Transfection of ataxin-1-2Q also induced cell death, although less than the 82Q form, and was largely rescued by MEF2 overexpression (supplemental Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of MEF2 contributes to ataxin-1 mediated toxicity.DISCUSSIONAtaxin-1 has previously been shown to bind HDAC3 and the corepressor silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor, and this finding led to the proposal that ataxin-1 might normally function as a transcriptional corepressor (5Tsai C.C. Kao H.Y. Mitzutani A. Banayo E. Rajan H. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4047-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is also supported by a recent report that ataxin-1 associates with another corepressor, Capicua or CIC (8Lam Y.C. Bowman A.B. Jafar-Nejad P. Lim J. Richman R. Fryer J.D. Hyun E.D. Duvick L.A. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2006; 127: 1335-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our finding that ataxin-1 interacts with HDAC4 further strengthens this proposition. Importantly, our study identifies the neuronal survival factor MEF2 as the first potential transcriptional target for ataxin-1. This finding provides direct evidence that ataxin-1 indeed has the capacity to inhibit gene expression associated with neuronal survival. It also offers an alternative mechanism by which mutant ataxin-1 can cause cell death through repression of the pro-survival activity of MEF2. Supporting this idea, we show that overexpression of MEF2 can alleviate the cytotoxicity induced by mutant ataxin-1. Together with the known functions of the MEF2/HDAC4 transcriptional complex in neuronal cell death, our study suggests that MEF2 inhibition by ataxin-1 might be important for the pathogenesis of SCA1.We report that HDAC4 and MEF2 associate with both long and short forms of ataxin-1, indicating that their association is not strictly dependent on polyQ length. Although an expanded polyQ tract is the hallmark of polyglutamine diseases and no doubt important, it has become increasingly clear that the pathogenesis of these diseases involves more than just the expansion of the polyglutamine tract itself (20Paulson H. Nat. Med. 2003;"
https://openalex.org/W2050616445,"Eucrites are a group of meteorites that represent the first planetary igneous activity following metal-silicate differentiation on an early planetesimal, similar to Asteroid 4 Vesta, and, thus, help date geophysical processes occurring on such bodies in the early solar system. Using the short-lived radionuclide 182 Hf as a relative chronometer, we demonstrate that eucrite zircon crystallized quickly within 6.8 million years of metal-silicate differentiation. This implies that mantle differentiation on the eucrite parent body occurred during a period when internal heat from the decay of 26 Al and 60 Fe was still available. Later metamorphism of eucrites took place at least 8.9 million years after the zircons crystallized and was likely caused by heating from impacts, or by burial under hot material excavated by impacts, rather than from lava flows. Thus, the timing of eucrite formation and of mantle differentiation is constrained."

Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that nCL-2 exists in both monomeric and homo-oligomeric forms, but not as a heterodimer with 30K or 30K-2, and that the oligomerization occurs through domains other than the 5EF-hand domain IV, most probably through domain III, suggesting a novel regulatory system for nCL-2. Calpain (Clan CA-C2, EC 3.4.22.17) is an intracellular Ca2+-regulated cysteine protease, comprising a superfamily with members in almost all eukaryotes and some bacteria (1Suzuki K. Hata S.

These observations clearly indicate calpain is indispensable physiologically; however, the specific physiological functions of calpains and the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions remain unclear. The mammalian calpain family comprises products from 14 independent genes, and can be classified into typical and atypical members according to their domain structures (2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 3Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous μ- and m-calpains, well characterized typical calpains in mammals, are heterodimers composed of a distinct 80-kDa large catalytic subunit (abbreviated here to μCL and mCL, respectively; also known as calpain 1 and 2) and a common 30-kDa small regulatory subunit (30K). 2The abbreviations used are: 30K30-kDa small regulatory subunitnCL-2novel calpain large subunit-2nCL-4novel calpain large subunit-4WTwild typeCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: 30K30-kDa small regulatory subunitnCL-2novel calpain large subunit-2nCL-4novel calpain large subunit-4WTwild typeCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutinin. The large and small subunits contain four (I–IV) and two (V and VI) domains, respectively: the regulatory N-terminal domain (I), the protease domain (II), the C2-domain-like Ca2+/phospholipid-binding domain (III), the penta-EF-hand domains (IV and VI), which are missing in atypical calpains, and the Gly-clustering hydrophobic domain (V). The C-terminal fifth EF-hand motifs in domains IV and VI cannot bind Ca2+, and interact with each other to form the heterodimer. Domain IV is also reported to function in the recognition of substrates and regulatory molecules (16Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Tomita T. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Int. J. Mol.

In the absence of Ca2+, the protease domain (II) is separated into two subdomains, IIa and IIb, and residues in the catalytic triad are prevented from assuming the correct positions for hydrolysis. The binding of Ca2+ to domains IIa, IIb, III, IV, and VI induces conformational changes that allow domain II to form a single active domain (19Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z.

Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and cells from 30K gene-deficient mice, which die at E10.5–11.5, show neither detectable μ- or m-calpain activity nor detectable μCL or mCL protein, even though their mRNAs are expressed normally (7Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Zimmerman U.J. Boring L. Pak J.H. Mukerjee N. Wang K.K. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results indicated that 30K functions as a molecular chaperon in vivo, at least for μCL and mCL. nCL-2/calpain 8, identified as a stomach-specific calpain, is a typical calpain with four domains (25Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19476-19482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3B). nCL-2 is most similar to mCL (amino acid identities in the full-length protein and in domains II and IV are 61.5, 73.4, and 51.8%, respectively). Possible functions for nCL-2 in the pituitary gland and in the embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis have been reported (26Duan W.R. Ito M. Lee E.J. Chien P.Y. Jameson J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Cao Y. Zhao H. Grunz H. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We recently showed that, in the stomach, nCL-2 as well as nCL-4/calpain 9, a digestive tract-specific calpain, are expressed specifically in the gastric mucus cells (pit cells), quite unlike the μ- and m-calpains, which are expressed diffusely in all cells, and that nCL-2 may be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking in the pit cells (28Hata S. Koyama S. Kawahara H. Doi N. Maeda T. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11214-11224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These reports highlight potentially important nCL-2 functions that cannot be compensated for by μ- and m-calpains, not only in the stomach but also in other tissues. However, the enzymatic properties of nCL-2, including its regulatory mechanisms, have not been reported, except for one yeast two-hybrid analysis suggesting that nCL-2 does not interact with 30K despite the high similarity between nCL-2 and mCL (29Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, using Escherichia coli-expressed and purified nCL-2, the detailed biochemical properties of this enzyme were examined, and several unique characteristics were revealed. Unexpectedly, nCL-2 was found to exist as both a monomer and as homo-oligomers, and the domain responsible for oligomerization was, unlike in the μ- and m-calpains, the C2-like domain (III), not the penta-EF-hand domain (IV), suggesting that nCL-2 has a novel regulatory mechanism. Materials-Recombinant human μ- and m-calpains, anti-nCL2 polyclonal antibody (previously called anti-nCL2/2′), and mouse gastric mucosal protein were prepared as described previously (28Hata S. Koyama S. Kawahara H. Doi N. Maeda T. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol.

RP2-calpain 8 polyclonal antibody, anti-FLAG (clone M2), anti-hemagglutinin (HA)2 (clone 6E2), anti-MYC, and anti-His monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Triple Point Biologics Inc. (OR), Sigma, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (IA), and Novagen Inc., respectively. Protease inhibitors (calpeptin, calpain inhibitor I, calpastatin domain I, E64c, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and pepstatin A) were purchased from Sigma, TaKaRa (Kyoto, Japan), and Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). CSTN pep42 (NH2-EVSDPMSSTYIEELGKREVTIPPKYRELLAKPIGPDDAIDAL-COOH), corresponding to one of reactive sites of human calpastatin, was synthesized by Research Genetics. Cloning and Construction of Expression Plasmids-cDNAs encoding full-length mouse nCL-2, human and mouse 30K, and human and mouse 30K-2/CAPNS2 were amplified by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene Inc.), and the sequences were verified after being subcloned into appropriate vectors. For bacterial expression, the amplified mouse nCL-2 cDNA was ligated into the pCold I vector (TaKaRa) to produce proteins fused with an NH2-terminal His tag. For COS7 cell expression, the amplified cDNAs were ligated into a modified pSRD vector (31Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce proteins fused with an NH2-terminal FLAG, HA, or MYC tag. The nCL-2 deletion mutants were constructed by introducing termination codons at the appropriate positions using a PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method as previously described (10Ono Y.

Protein Expression in Bacterial Cells and Purification-The constructed pCold I expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21/pG-Tf2 (TaKaRa), and the transformants were cultured at 37 °C in 3 liters of LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until A600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside and 5 ng/ml tetracycline (tet) for 24 h at 15 °C. Harvested cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and lysed with a French Press (American Instruments Inc.). The cell lysate was spun at 55,000 × g for 20 min, and the recovered supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter (Millipore). The supernatant was then applied by gravity to a 2-ml Ni2+-chelating agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, and then six column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein was then eluted with 8 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was immediately dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was further purified by a Mono Q HR10/10 anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. For gel filtration, the sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/10 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the protein was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The peak fraction was stored at 4 °C until use. Proteolysis Assay-Proteolytic activity was measured using a fluorogenic substrate, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc-LLVY-MCA) (Peptide Institute Inc.). Recombinant nCL-2 (2 μg), μ-calpain (0.1 μg), or m-calpain (0.4 μg) was incubated with 0.1 mm Suc-LLVY-MCA in reaction buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.2% CHAPS), with varying Ca2+ concentrations, temperatures, or pH. For pH values other than 7.5, Tris acetate (pH 5.5, 6.0, or 6.8) or Tris-Cl (pH 7.0, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, or 9.5) buffer was used instead of Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer. Reactions in 40 μl were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 10% SDS and 1.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 9.0). MCA release by proteolysis was monitored by a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-1500, Shimadzu, Osaka, Japan), with excitation and emission wavelengths at 380 and 460 nm, respectively. For the autolysis assay, 1 μg of recombinant nCL-2 was incubated in 10 μl of the reaction buffer with or without 10 mm CaCl2 at 25 or 37 °C for the times indicated. Protein Expression in Culture Cells and Immunoprecipitation-COS7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of the expression plasmids by electroporation, as previously described (31Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the COS7 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm pepstatin A). The lysed cells were spun at 100,000 × g for 20 min and incubated with a 50% slurry of FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h, then the protein-bound agarose was washed five times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) and mixed with SDS sample buffer. For the in vitro proteolysis assay, 10 μl of the eluted immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with 2 μl of 6× Ca buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm CaCl2, and 6 mm dithiothreitol) or 2 μl of 6× EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm EDTA, and 6 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer. Protein Sequencing-After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were blotted onto a Pro-Blot membrane (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Target protein bands on the membrane were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining, excised, and washed three times with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) methanol and then with absolute methanol. Sequencing was performed using the ABI 491cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Recombinant Mouse nCL-2 Using an E. coli Expression System-To investigate the solubility and expression efficiency of nCL-2, full-length mouse nCL-2 was expressed with or without 30K in E. coli BL21(DE3). nCL-2 was abundantly expressed in both cases, and no significant difference was observed in its amount or solubility (data not shown). Therefore, nCL-2 was expressed without 30K for the purpose of purification. To improve the solubility of the nCL-2 in E. coli, a tet-on chaperon-inducible BL21/pG-Tf2 strain was used, and active nCL-2 was successfully recovered in a soluble fraction that represented one-third to one-half of the total nCL-2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Purification of Recombinant nCL-2-As described under “Experimental Procedures,” NH2 terminally His-tagged recombinant nCL-2 was expressed and purified to homogeneity by Ni2+-chelating agarose and Mono Q anion-exchange column chromatographies in succession (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). The peak elution of nCL-2 from the Mono Q column was around 0.2 m NaCl. Approximately 1 mg of recombinant nCL-2 was purified from 3 liters of E. coli culture, and subjected to further analyses. Enzymatic Properties of Recombinant nCL-2-Using the nCL-2 prepared above, the enzymatic characterization of recombinant nCL-2 was performed, in comparison with recombinant human μ- and m-calpains. A fluorogenic substrate, Suc-LLVY-MCA, was used to detect the proteolytic activities. The activity of nCL-2 was Ca2+ dependent, and was blocked by known inhibitors of μ- and m-calpains but not by other inhibitors (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that nCL-2 possesses characteristics typical of conventional calpains. The concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal activity was about 0.3 mm, almost identical to that of m-calpain (Fig. 2A). The calculated specific activity was a 40th and a 25th of that of μ- and m-calpain, respectively. The specific activity of the case-inolysis of nCL-2 was also lower than those of μ- and m-calpain (data not shown).FIGURE 2Characterization of nCL-2.

As a result, the mock- and nCL-2:C105S-transformed cell lysates showed virtually no activity (0.25 ± 0.01 and 1.97 ± 0.02 fluorescence units, respectively) in the presence of Ca2+, whereas WT nCL-2-transformed cell lysate showed >200 times their activities (403.07 ± 0.81 fluorescence units) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, “mock purification” was also performed using the mock-transformed cell lysate (Fig. 1C, S2) in the same manner as that for WT nCL-2 (Fig. 1C, S1). As a result, the final Mono Q fractions (Fig. 1C, lanes E1–E3) around 0.2 m NaCl, where WT nCL-2 was mainly eluted, showed no activity. Thus, the possibility of host protease activities was excluded. The optimal temperature for nCL-2 activity was 20 °C (Fig. 2C), which was similar to that for μ- and m-calpain under our assay conditions, and to that reported previously for nCL-4 (32Lee H.J. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Lee H.J. Tomioka S. Kinbara K. Masumoto H. Jeong S.Y. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The time courses of nCL-2 activity at various temperatures showed that the initial rates were maximal at 30 to 37 °C, whereas maximal activity was achieved at 15 °C (Fig. 2D). The low optimal temperature for nCL-2 indicates that it is unstable at higher temperatures in the presence of Ca2+. The optimal pH for nCL-2 activity was 6.0, which is lower than the optimal pH values for conventional calpains (Fig. 2E). Autolytic Properties of nCL-2-The autolysis of nCL-2 was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis, as shown in Fig. 3A. Various breakdown products appeared in a time-dependent manner, and were confirmed to be autolytic fragments of nCL-2 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). By NH2-terminal sequencing of a 43-kDa fragment (Fig. 3A, arrowhead e), one of the autolysis sites was determined to be between Ala-5 and Ala-6. Given its molecular weight, the COOH terminus of this fragment was in or near the acidic loop in domain III (Fig. 3C, e). The autolytic fragment just below the 81-kDa full-length band (Fig. 3, A and B, arrowhead a) reacted with the anti-nCL2 but not the anti-His antibody. Based on this and its molecular mass (about 79 kDa), this autolytic fragment probably spanned from Ala-6 to the COOH terminus (Fig. 3C, arrowhead a). Autolytic fragments of 63 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B, arrowhead b) and 41 kDa (arrowhead f) reacted with the anti-nCL2 and RP2-calpain 8 (anti-domain III) antibodies, and with only the anti-nCL2 antibody, respectively. This indicates that the 63- and 41-kDa fragments extend from Ala-6 to the second EF-hand motif (EF-2) in domain IV and to the beginning of domain III, respectively (Fig. 3C, arrowheads b and f). Autolytic fragments of 45 and 44 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B, arrowheads c and d) reacted with the anti-nCL2 and anti-His, but not the RP-calpain 8 antibodies, indicating that these fragments extend from the NH2 terminus to the acidic loop in domain III and to the beginning of domain III, respectively (Fig. 3C, arrowheads c and d). In summary, the autolytic sites of nCL-2 include the NH2 terminus, the NH2-terminal parts of domain III, and EF-2 in domain IV. nCL-2 Exists as a Monomer and Homo-oligomer-The finding that 30K was not required for nCL-2 activity prompted us to investigate the tertiary structure of nCL-2. To examine whether nCL-2 exists as a monomer or homo-oligomer, the purified nCL-2 was subjected to gel filtration column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4A, nCL-2 was eluted with peaks at positions corresponding to about 80 and 160 kDa. This result indicates that nCL-2 is present as both a monomer and homo-oligomers, and that the monomer and homodimer forms predominate. Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activities of both fractions were measured, and the calculated specific activity of the peak fraction at about 160 kDa was about 1/15 of that at about 80 kDa. To confirm the homo-oligomerization of nCL-2, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed. Full-length mouse nCL-2 fused with an NH2-terminal FLAG, HA, or MYC tag were co-expressed in COS7 cells; the cell lysate was spun in an ultracentrifuge and then immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies. The m-calpain subunits, FLAG-30K and HA-mCL, were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 4C, HA-mCL was co-precipitated with FLAG-30K (lane 2), whereas HA-nCL-2 was not (lane 5), consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results described above. These results indicated that this method was applicable for detecting the protein interactions of interest. When FLAG-nCL-2 and HA-nCL-2 were co-expressed in COS7 cells, HA-nCL-2 was co-precipitated with FLAG-nCL-2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–3). To confirm this interaction, the combination of FLAG-nCL-2 and MYC-nCL-2 was also tested, and yielded consistent results (Fig. 4D, lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, to exclude a possibility that observed co-precipitation is an artifact due to overexpression, FLAG-nCL-2 and HA-nCL-2 were co-expressed in COS7 cells at very low levels, even lower than the physiological levels (Fig. 4E, anti-nCL2, lanes 1 versus 2 and 3). Even under this condition, co-precipitation was observed (Fig. 4E, IP:FLAG, anti-HA, lane 3). nCL-2 Oligomerization Is Not through Domain IV but through Domain III-To investigate which domain is required for the homo-oligomer formation of nCL-2, several truncation mutants of nCL-2 (Fig. 4B) were used in the immunoprecipitation experiment. Because the COOH-terminal fifth EF-hand motif (EF-5) in domains IV and VI is critical for the heterodimer formation of μ- and m-calpains, we first tested whether the EF-5 of nCL-2 was necessary for oligomerization. When a tagged EF-5 deletion mutant (Fig. 4B, FLAG- or HA-ΔEF5) was co-expressed with full-length nCL-2 or its ΔEF5 mutant, the ΔEF5 mutant was co-precipitated with the ΔEF5 mutant as well as with full-length nCL-2 (Fig. 4F, lanes 6–8; Table 1), indicating that EF-5 is not required for the homo-oligomerization of nCL-2.TABLE 1Summary of interactions between nCL-2 and its m"

Here we used atomic force microscopy to visualize the initial interaction of transposase protein with P element DNA. The transposase first binds to one of the two P element ends, in the presence or absence of GTP, prior to synapsis. In the absence of GTP, these complexes remain stable but do not proceed to synapsis. In the presence of GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, synapsis happens rapidly, whereas DNA cleavage is slow. Both atomic force microscopy and standard biochemical methods have been used to show that the P element transposase exists as a pre-formed tetramer that initially binds to either one of the two P element ends in the absence of GTP prior to synapsis. This initial single end binding may explain some of the aberrant P element-induced rearrangements observed in vivo, such as hybrid end insertion. The allosteric effect of GTP in promoting synapsis by P element transposase may be to orient a second site-specific DNA binding domain in the tetramer allowing recognition of a second high affinity transposase-binding site at the other transposon end.

Furthermore, GTP does not effect the binding of P element transposase to the high affinity sites near the transposon termini, as assayed by DNase I footprinting (9Kaufman P.D. Rio D.C.

Whereas some transposon systems have been studied with respect to the assembly state of their transposase, the oligomeric state of the active P element transposase protein and how it initially interacts with P element DNA are unknown. In cases where it has been studied, other transposases are able to function as dimers, tetramers, or hexamers to carry out the catalytic steps of transposition (1Craig N.L. Cragie R. Gellert M.

Biochemical methods show that P element transposase exists as a tetramer in solution, in the absence of DNA. We have also used AFM to determine the volume of the transposase protein, in the absence and presence of DNA, and we used this information to determine the native molecular weight of the protein by comparison with the relative volumes of a set of standard proteins; these measurements also indicate that the P element transposase exists as a tetramer in both conditions. This method of AFM protein volume determination has been used previously to analyze the size of protein-DNA complexes involved in transcription and DNA repair (31Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Mol.

Our AFM data indicate that a pre-formed transposase tetramer initially interacts with either P element terminus, in the absence of GTP, prior to GTP-dependent synaptic complex formation. These studies also show that synapsis is rapid with GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs but that donor DNA cleavage occurs more slowly. These studies show initial binding of a pre-formed tetramer of P element transposase to one P element end and suggest that the GTP cofactor somehow orients a second DNA binding domain in the oligomer to interact with the high affinity transposase-binding site near the other P element end leading to synaptic complex formation. This two-stage binding/synapsis might explain how inappropriate pairing in vivo of two P element ends from different P elements might give rise to ectopic chromosomal rearrangements sometimes observed, such as hybrid ends insertions and deletions (33Gray Y.H.

P element donor cleavage reactions were carried out by mixing 1 μl of purified 3′ polyoma epitope-tagged transposase (∼50 μg/ml) in HGKED buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 m KCl) with 1 ml of 50 nm P element donor DNA and 4 ml of HGED buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the mixture was added to 14 μl of 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 in HGED buffer, with or without 2 mm GTP, and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The final protein concentration of protein and DNA in the 20-μl assay was 28.5 and 2.5 nm respectively. These reaction conditions are similar to those used previously for donor cleavage and strand transfer in bulk solution reactions (11Beall E.L. Rio D.C.

Thus, in the DNA binding reaction the DNA concentration was 2.5 nm, and the protein concentration (as a monomer) was typically ∼28.5 nm giving a ratio of 11 monomeric proteins per DNA molecule. In the GTP analog experiments, GTPγS, GMP-PCP, and GMP-PNP were used at a final concentration of 2 mm. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Approximately 3.5 μg of immunoaffinity-purified transposase protein was resolved on a Superdex 200 PC3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare) on a SMART system at 4 °C in HGKED buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. 40-μl fractions were collected and assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (10Mul Y.M. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Beall E.L. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2122-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Standard proteins used to calibrate the column were bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and were run in the same buffer as transposase. Glycerol Gradient Velocity Sedimentation—Glycerol gradient centrifugation (38Gossen M. Pak D.T. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was carried out in a 4-ml gradient with an SW60 rotor at 42,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C, in an L90M ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Approximately 3 μg of transposase was layered on top of a freshly poured gradient in HGEKD buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and various % glycerol as indicated in Fig. 3, B and C). 150-μl fractions were collected from the top and assayed for transposase by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (10Mul Y.M. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Beall E.L. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2122-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Standard proteins used to calibrate the column were bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and were run in a parallel gradient in the same buffer as transposase. For the experiment with GTP or GTP and strand transfer oligonucleotide (P1/P2-17; 37), 0.5 mm GTP and 1 mm Mg(OAc)2 were preincubated with ∼3 μg of transposase at room temperature for 15 min in gradient buffer or 0.5 mm GTP and 1 mm Mg(OAc)2 along with a 10-fold molar excess of P element 3′ end strand transfer oligo. Following the preincubation, the samples were loaded on top of 4-ml glycerol gradients and centrifuged as above. Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging—The samples were imaged in air with a NanoScope III (Digital Instruments) atomic force microscope, operating in tapping mode, using tips from nanosensors (point probes, type NCH-50). The protein was equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.04 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT and then deposited onto freshly cleaved mica for 1 min. The samples were then washed with water for 15 s and then dried with a gentle stream of nitrogen. All images were collected at scan rates between 1.54 and 3.05 Hz with scan sizes of 1-3 μm. To investigate the effect of the water washing on the apparent transposase volume, thus on its oligomeric state, we tried two different types of water: (i) Milli-Q water (Millipore) with a pH of 4.5, and (ii) NanoPure water (Barnstead) with a pH of 6.2. In more recent experiments, once we realized the wash water pH was a problem, we used commercial water from Mallinkrodt, at pH 6.8-7.2. We also tried two different washing times as follows: 10 s (which we refer to as “quick wash”) and 2 min (which we refer to as “soak wash”). For protein volume comparison experiments, such as those described in Fig. 4, extra care was taken to avoid imaging differences because of different AFM tips or microscope settings. To compare the apparent sizes of transposase oligomers between gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation fractions, we used the protein peak fractions from both methods and carried out a single end binding experiment where the protein was incubated with DNA substrate DNA in the absence of GTP for 30 min, and the reaction mixture then was deposited on mica, processed, and imaged as indicated above and in Ref. 14Tang M. Cecconi C. Kim H. Bustamante C. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Volume Measurements—Protein volumes were calculated by treating apparent proteins as solids with elliptical footprints with major and minor axes equal to protein length and protein width. The vertical cross-sections for both axes were approximated as parabolas with maximum of protein height at the center of each axis. Integration of the area of the ellipse along the height axis gave a volume equal to p/6 × (length × width × height). Initial P Element Transposase-DNA Complexes Form at One Transposon End Prior to Synapsis—The P element transposition reaction occurs in stages, with initial transposase binding, synapsis, nonconcerted DNA cleavage, and the target capture and integration (Fig. 1A). Our previous studies have shown that P element transposase binding to its internal site-specific recognition sites on P element DNA is not affected by the presence or absence of GTP, but GTP can promote synapsis of P element ends (14Tang M. Cecconi C. Kim H. Bustamante C. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining how the P element transposase interacted with the P element termini prior to synaptic complex formation. To investigate the early protein-DNA complexes that formed from 1 to 30 min, transposase protein was incubated with a linear DNA carrying a 0.6-kb P element flanked by flanking sequences of 300 bp at the 5′ end and 600 bp at the 3′ end (Fig. 1B, top). Upon brief incubation of the protein and DNA (1-30 min) at a molar ratio of ∼11 transposase monomers to each P element DNA, the linear DNA was bound by transposase at either one end or the other (Fig. 1B) as evidenced by a protein-DNA complex formed with either a short (0.3 kb) or long (0.6 kb) tail. There appeared to be equal numbers of transposase bound to either the 5′ or 3′ transposon end, suggesting that the two ends have similar affinities for the protein, as had been suggested by earlier DNase I footprinting assays (15Kaufman P.D. Doll R.F. Rio D.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 359-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, and those published previously (14Tang M. Cecconi C. Kim H. Bustamante C. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), nonspecific DNA binding is seen to vary from experiment to experiment. However, in some cases transposase molecules were observed to be bound to DNA ends or at random to incorrect sites on the P element-containing DNA fragment (data not shown and see Ref. 14Tang M. Cecconi C. Kim H. Bustamante C. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These nonspecific binding events were ∼10-100-fold less abundant than site-specific DNA binding and this number is consistent with previous measurements of site-specific versus nonspecific DNA binding by the P element transposase made by DNase I footprinting (15Kaufman P.D. Doll R.F. Rio D.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 359-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More importantly, even though the ratio of transposase monomers to P element DNA is ∼11:1, we did not observe two transposase complexes bound at the two transposon ends on the same DNA molecule, in over 100,000 DNA molecules examined that had transposase bound. Even when the transposase concentration was raised another 10-fold, no increase in either nonspecific binding or two transposase complexes on a single P element were observed (data not shown). Given the low occurrence of two ends being bound, it seems reasonable to propose that it is the single end-bound transposase complexes that proceed to synapsis. However, it may be the case that these stable one-end-bound complexes are stable, but more loosely bound protein-DNA complexes are lost during the sample preparation for AFM. It seems to be the case that once a single end of the transposon is bound by transposase, the second end cannot be stably bound by a second transposase complex. It may simply involve differential stability of protein-DNA interactions, since footprinting studies showed that the protein has high nonspecific DNA (15Kaufman P.D. Doll R.F. Rio D.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 359-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), yet nonspecific DNA binding is not frequently observed in the AFM assays (see Ref. 14Tang M. Cecconi C. Kim H."
https://openalex.org/W2005579255,"Two peroxiredoxins, classified as Type II and PrxQ, were characterized in the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Both recombinant proteins showed remarkable thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity with broad substrate specificity in vitro. Nevertheless, PrxQ of R. sphaeroides, unlike typical PrxQs studied to date, does not contain one of the two conserved catalytic Cys residues. We found that R. sphaeroides PrxQ and other PrxQ-like proteins from several organisms conserve a different second Cys residue, indicating that these proteins should be categorized into a novel PrxQ subfamily. Disruption of either the Type II or PrxQ gene in R. sphaeroides had a dramatic effect on cell viability when the cells were grown under aerobic light or oxidative stress conditions created by exogenous addition of reactive oxygen species to the medium. Growth rates of the mutants were significantly decreased compared with that of wild type under aerobic but not anaerobic conditions. These results indicate that the peroxiredoxins are crucial for antioxidative stress response in this bacterium. The gene disruptants also demonstrated reduced levels of photopigment synthesis, suggesting that the peroxiredoxins are directly or indirectly involved in regulated synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus.

All organisms exposed to a variety of environments must acquire adaptation systems to sustain homeostasis. Under aerobic conditions, an organism's metabolism unavoidably produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), 3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesCCPcytochrome c peroxidaseCDNB1-chloro-2′, 4-dinitrobenzeneCHPcumene hydroperoxideGSHglutathioneNTRNADPH-Trx reductasePrxperoxiredoxinRNSreactive nitrogen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseSNPsodium nitroprussidet-BHPt-butyl hydroperoxideTrxthioredoxinDTTdithiothreitol. such as the superoxide radical (O2⋅¯), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) (1Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7996) Google Scholar, 2Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 395-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). O2⋅¯is the first product in ROS metabolism and is generated by the incomplete reduction of oxygen to water during respiration. Although O2⋅¯ has low reactivity for lipid oxidation and cannot permeate the cytoplasmic membrane, it causes iron reduction (from Fe3+ to Fe2+) as well as the H2O2-prompted Fenton reaction that results in production of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH–). H2O2, which is enzymatically produced from O2⋅¯, is stable and can pass through the cytoplasmic membrane. The molecular properties of NO are similar to those of H2O2, but it is highly reactive and can cause oxidative damage. Furthermore, NO reacts with O2⋅¯ to generate peroxynitrite (OONO–). It has been shown that these ROS and RNS cause lipid peroxidation and inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as inactivation of enzymes through oxidation of heme, Fe2+, and/or sulfhydryls (1Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7996) Google Scholar, 2Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev.

To avoid such oxidative damage, all aerobic organisms have antioxidant systems that include catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and various peroxidases (1Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7996) Google Scholar, 2Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev.

ROS and RNS at low levels also function as intracellular messengers in response to various stresses, and the antioxidant systems play a role in sustaining the proper ROS and RNS levels for the signaling cascade (5Rhee S.G. Science. 2006; 312: 1882-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 6Biswas S. Chida A.S. Rahman I. Biochem.

Recently, peroxiredoxin (Prx) has been extensively studied as a core member of the antioxidant system conserved in many organisms (7Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar, 8Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 9Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Prx was initially discovered as a 25-kDa enzyme in yeast and protects cellular components against oxidative damage (10Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later studies established that Prxs are a family of thiol-specific peroxidases and peroxynitrite reductases that can reduce various peroxides, such as H2O2, alkyl hydrogen peroxides, and peroxynitrite, with broad substrate specificity. Based on primary structure, Prxs are classified into four groups (1-Cys, 2-Cys, Type II, and PrxQ) (9Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). All types of Prxs contain a conserved N-terminal peroxidatic Cys residue that acts as the primary catalytic center. The peroxide substrate interacts with the peroxidatic sulfhydryl group of the catalytic center to oxidize it to sulfenic acid (SOH). This sulfenic acid returns to a sulfhydryl group in a manner dependent on the Prx class. In the case of 2-Cys Prxs, a second catalytic cysteinyl group, a so-called resolving thiol, is located in the C terminus and forms an intermolecular disulfide bond within the Prx homodimer. In contrast, PrxQ and Type II Prxs function as monomeric proteins and form an intramolecular disulfide bridge between the peroxidatic Cys and the resolving thiol. The disulfide bond formed in the Prx molecules is reduced by various electron donors, such as thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione (GSH), and cyclophilins. 1-Cys Prx does not have the resolving thiol, and the sulfenic acid derivative of the peroxidatic Cys residue is re-reduced by an unknown interacting partner before the next catalytic cycle (7Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). These Prxs are conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and function not only as antioxidants but also as modulators of oxidative signaling pathways and as a redox sensor (7Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar, 8Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol.

In eukaryotic organisms, many Prxs are localized in plastid and/or mitochondria, suggesting that they were introduced into host cells during symbiosis of photosynthetic and/or aerobic bacteria. The prokaryotic Prxs have been characterized in only a limited number of bacterial species, and the physiological significance of these proteins is not fully elucidated. In light of the evolutionary considerations mentioned above, we studied the Prx proteins in the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides because this bacterium exhibits remarkably versatile bioenergetics such that it can grow by photosynthesis as well as by aerobic and anaerobic respiration under various environmental conditions (11McEwan A.G. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Genetic manipulations for this organism are also well established (12Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Under high oxygen conditions, the bacterium achieves aerobic respiration with a respiratory chain that is similar to that of mitochondria, whereas under low oxygen conditions it produces photosynthetic complexes to grow by photosynthesis (11McEwan A.G. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Matsuura K. J. Plant Res. 1994; 107: 191-200Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Zeilstra-Ryalls J.H. Kaplan S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 417-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The synthesized photosynthetic apparatus can produce another ROS, singlet oxygen (1O2) in the presence of both oxygen and light (15Borland C.F. Cogdell R.J. Land E.J. Truscott T.G. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1989; 3: 227-245Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, the bacterium is exposed to various ROS produced by both respiratory and photosynthetic metabolism. These properties suggest that the bacterium has acquired more sophisticated antioxidant systems than those of other bacteria studied to date. So far, several factors within the antioxidant systems of this bacterium had been analyzed (16Pasternak C. Assemat K. Clement-Metral J.D. Klug G. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Zeller T. Moskvin O.V. Li K. Klug G. Gomelsky M. J.

We now report that R. sphaeroides has two Prxs that can be classified into Type II and PrxQ Prxs and that are critical for growth under aerobic conditions. The PrxQ family protein was further categorized into a subfamily we defined based on the position of a critical cysteine. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-R. sphaeroides strain 2.4.1 was used as a wild-type strain. The wild-type and Prx mutant strains were grown at 30 °C in PYS medium (21Nagashima K.V. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For anaerobic conditions, cells were grown in completely filled vessels. Illumination was provided by 100-watt tungsten lamps. For semiaerobic conditions cells were grown in 100-ml medium in 150-ml conical flasks by rotational incubation. For aerobic conditions, cells were grown by vigorous shaking in L-shaped test tubes. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance of cultures at 660 nm with a Shimadzu UV 1600 spectrophotometer. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium. When appropriate, kanamycin and streptomycin were used at 25 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides. Kanamycin was used at 50 mg/liter, and ampicillin was used at 100 mg/liter for E. coli. Expression and Purification of Type II and PrxQ Prxs and Thioredoxin A (TrxA) of R. sphaeroides-The coding regions for genes encoding RsPrxT, RsPrxQ, and TrxA (accession numbers YP_353982, ABA79134, and YP_351571, respectively) were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of R. sphaeroides as a template with the following combination of primers: for RsPrxT, 5′-GGGGGGGCATATGGTGATTTCGGTAGGCGA-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-GGGGGGTCGACTCAGATCGCGGCCAGCAG-3′ (SalI); for RsPrxQ, 5′-GGGGGGGCATATGACCGATGCCGGACAGA-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-GGGGGTCGACTCAGAGCGAGCGGGCCG-3′ (SalI); for TrxA, 5′-GGCATATGTCCACCGTTCCCGTGA-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-GGGAATTCTCAGAGCGCCGAGGCGAT-3′ (EcoRI). The restriction sites shown in parentheses are underlined in the sequences. Each amplified DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and SalI (or EcoRI) and cloned into NdeI-SalI- (or EcoRI)-digested pTYB12 vector (New England Biolabs). Sequences of the insert DNA were confirmed by sequencing, and the obtained plasmids were named pTYTypeII, pTYPrxQ, and pTYTrx for RsPrxT, RsPrxQ, and TrxA expression plasmids, respectively. Expression plasmids for two mutant RsPrxQs, C44S and C80S, in which Cys-44 and Cys-80 were replaced individually by Ser, were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with use of pTYPrxQ as template DNA and complementary primers containing a 1-bp mismatch that converts the codon for Cys to one for Ser. The plasmids were transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3), and each chitin-tagged protein was overexpressed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified with chitin beads (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were dialyzed in storage buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). Protein was quantified using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Peroxidase Activity Assay-Trx-dependent peroxidase activity was measured by the coupled oxidation of NADPH using NADPH-Trx-reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtNTR) and R. sphaeroides TrxA at 25 °C. For measurement of the activity of Prxs, a reaction containing 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.3, 20 μm TrxA, 5 μm AtNTR (recombinant protein expressed in E. coli) (22Hosoya-Matsuda N. Motohashi K. Yoshimura H. Nozaki A. Inoue K. Ohmori M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 840-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and 0.2 mm NADPH was used. To measure GSH-dependent peroxidase activity, a reaction containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.23 units/ml NADPH-glutathione reductase from E. coli. (Sigma), 1 mm NADPH, and 70 μm GSH (Sigma) was used. After the addition of various concentrations of Prx, the reaction was initiated by addition of various concentrations of H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), and the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm of the reaction was monitored. In Vitro Reduction of Prx Proteins-Oxidation of Prxs was induced by incubation with 50 μm CuCl2. The oxidized Prxs were incubated with a combination of DTT and TrxA as indicated in Fig. 3 (top of each photograph). The redox states of Prx proteins were determined as follows. Briefly, the protein was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and collected by centrifugation. The obtained protein precipitates were then washed with acetone, and the proteins were dissolved in freshly prepared solution containing 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstibene-2′, 2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes). Proteins were then separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Construction of R. sphaeroides Prx-disrupted Strains-The R. sphaeroides RsPrxT-disrupted strain, TYPEII, was constructed as follows. The DNA fragment that includes the RsPrxT coding region and the 500-bp up- and downstream regions was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as a template. The primers used were 5′-GGTCTAGATGGAGCAACTCCTACGGAA-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGTCGACGGACAGGGGCGGACGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and SalI and then cloned into pUC118 vector (TAKARA), and the plasmid was named pUCTypeII. The plasmid pUCTypeII was digested with HincII, and a 1.5-kilobase StuI-digested kanamycin-resistant cassette derived from plasmid pBSL86 (23Alexeyev M.F. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 52-56PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the HincII site. The resulting plasmid was named pUCKmTypeII. Then the insert DNA of plasmid pUCKmTypeII was removed by digestion with XbaI and SalI and introduced into XbaI-SalI-digested-pZJD29A (24Masuda S. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a gentamicin-resistant suicide vector. The obtained plasmid was transferred into R. sphaeroides cells by conjugation with the mobilizing strain S17-1 lysogenized with λpir (25Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 37-45Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar, 26Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant cells on plates containing 5% sucrose were selected as double-crossover candidates, and the chromosomal insertion was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The R. sphaeroides RsPrxQ-disrupted strain, PRXQ, was constructed as follows. The DNA fragment including the RsPrxQ coding region and the 500-bp up- and downstream regions was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as a template. The primers used were 5′-GGGGGTCTAGACCGCCCCGTGAAGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAGCTCTTGCCCGAATGGGCGAAAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and SacI and then cloned into pZERO vector (Invitrogen), and the plasmid was named pZEPrxQ. The plasmid pZEPrxQ has a unique EcoRI site within the RsPrxQ coding region. A 1.5-kilobase EcoRI-digested streptomycin/spectinomycin-resistant cassette (27Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI site of pZEPrxQ to obtain the plasmid named pZESmpPrxQ. Then the insert DNA of pZESmpPrxQ was removed by digestion with XbaI and SacI and introduced into XbaI-SacI-cut-pZJD29A (24Masuda S. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasmid was named pZJDSmpPrxQ. The plasmid pZJDSmpPrxQ was transferred into R. sphaeroides cells by conjugation with the mobilizing strain S17-1 lysogenized with λpir (25Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 37-45Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar, 26Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Streptomycin-resistant cells were selected as double-crossover candidates, and the chromosomal insertion was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The R. sphaeroides RsPrxT/RsPrxQ double-disrupted strain, PRXQII, was constructed as follows. The plasmid pZJDSmp-PrxQ was transferred into the TYPEII cells by conjugation with the mobilizing strain S17-1 lysogenized with λpir (25Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A.

Streptomycin/kanamycin-resistant cells were selected as double-crossover candidates, and the chromosomal insertion was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Determination of Survival Rates-Cell densities of cultures grown under semiaerobic conditions until mid-logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to A660 of 0.50. A dilution series was made, and then cell suspension was spotted onto PYS plates containing varying concentrations of H2O2, t-BHP, CHP, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), paraquat, rose bengal, or sodium nitroprusside (SNP), as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The spots were allowed to dry, and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days (for Fig. 4, A and C) or 7 days (for Fig. 4B). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNA was isolated from cells grown until mid-logarithmic phase (A660 of 0.5–0.6) using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern hybridization was performed essentially as described (28Shimada H. Iba K. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 471-475Google Scholar). Probe DNA fragments were generated by PCR with the following primers: CCP (RSP2395), 5′-ATGCGCCTGACCCTCACC-3′ and 5′-TCACTCGACCCGGATCTC-3′; FeSOD (RSP2693), 5′-ATGGCCTTCACCCTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGGCGCGAGGCCA-3′. Signals were measured and quantified using ImageQuant (Version 5.1, GE Healthcare). Measurement of Levels of Light-harvesting Complexes-The harvested cells grown to A660 0.5 ∼ 0.7 were suspended in ICM buffer (10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication. The disrupted cultures were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Absorption spectra of the cell-free extracts were measured with a Hitachi U-0080D spectrophotometer. Levels of light-harvesting complexes after spectroscopic analysis of the samples were determined as described (29Meinhardt S.W. Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Crofts A.R. Harayama S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Identification of Genes Encoding Prx-like Proteins from the Genomic Sequence of R. sphaeroides-Genes encoding Prx-like proteins in the R. sphaeroides genome were found by a computer-aided similarity search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). There were two candidate open reading frames with accession numbers YP_353982 (RSP0899) and ABA79134 (RSP2973), annotated as an AhpC/TSA family protein gene and a peroxiredoxin gene, respectively. From phylogenetic tree analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the two proteins with those of other Prx proteins, the gene products of YP_353982 and ABA79134 were categorized as Type II and PrxQ Prxs, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore we designated them as RsPrxT and RsPrxQ. RsPrxT conserves the two catalytic Cys residues including peroxidatic Cys and resolving Cys residues at the position of 49 and 74, respectively (Fig. 1A). In contrast, RsPrxQ conserves only the peroxidatic Cys residue at position 44 (Fig. 1B). Although catalytic Cys residues of typical PrxQ identified so far are spaced by four amino acids (30Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Gualberto J.M. Jordy M.N. De Fay E. Hirasawa M. Duplessis S. Lemaire S.D. Frey P. Martin F. Manieri W. Knaff D.B. Jacquot J.P.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), RsPrxQ lacks the latter resolving Cys residue at that position (Fig. 1B). In addition, when the amino acid sequences of various PrxQ were aligned, the position of another Cys residues was found at various positions or not found on the sequences. Within them, Cys-80 of RsPrxQ is well conserved in PrxQ proteins from some prokaryotes (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Anabaena variabilis ATCC29413, and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1). Therefore, we designated a subgroup of PrxQs that have two conserved Cys residues with four-residue spacing as PrxQα and a subgroup of PrxQs with two conserved Cys residues with a 35-residue gap as PrxQβ. To date, nothing is known of the biochemical properties of PrxQβs. Given that PrxQα family proteins form a catalytic site by forming an intramolecular disulfide bridge (30Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Gualberto J.M. Jordy M.N. De Fay E. Hirasawa M. Duplessis S. Lemaire S.D. Frey P. Martin F. Manieri W. Knaff D.B. Jacquot J.P.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that RsPrxQ has only two Cys residues (peroxidatic Cys-44 and Cys-80), Cys-80 may function as a resolving Cys residue. To investigate whether the Cys-80 could be a resolving Cys, we attempted to estimate the position of the Cys from the crystal structure of a 2-Cys Prx of Crithidia fasciculate, which has the highest similarity based on predicted secondary structure with that of RsPrxQ as determined by Genomes TO Protein structures and functions from the Laboratory for Gene-Product Informatics at the National Institute of Genetics, Japan (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, Ile-53 (corresponding to the resolving Cys of PrxQα) in C. fasciculate 2-Cys Prx is vicinal to the peroxidatic Cys-48 with an intervening distance of ∼8 Å within a same helix. In contrast, Thr-84 (corresponding to Cys-80 of RsPrxQ) in C. fasciculate 2-Cys Prx locates in a different helix, although it is still vicinal to the peroxidatic Cys-48 (Fig. 1C). Thus, Cys-44 and Cys-80 of RsPrxQ could, potentially, create an active site by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. To test this hypothesis we tested the in vitro redox properties of RsPrxQ wild-type and mutant proteins that contain Cys-44 changed to Ser (C44S) or Cys-80 changed to Ser (C80S) point mutations. The recombinant RsPrxQ wild-type, C44S, and C80S proteins were purified to homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2A, the oxidized form of purified wild-type RsPrxQ contains an intramolecular disulfide bond as judged by its behavior in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The two monocysteinic mutants ran in the same position regardless of the electrophoretic conditions, indicating an inability to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, but these mutant proteins did form measurable amounts of homodimer via an intermolecular disulfide bond involving the remaining Cys residue. These results clearly indicated that wild-type RsPrxQ makes an active site by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-44 and Cys-80. Biochemical Characterization of RsPrxT and RsPrxQ-Using purified recombinant proteins, we investigated the biochemical properties of RsPrxT and RsPrxQ. Prx proteins have been reported to have broad substrate-specific peroxidase activity using Trx or GSH as an electron donor (7Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar, 8Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 9Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In this measurement, we examined the two different pathways for electron donation to Prxs. One is provided by the combination of NADPH, Trx from R. sphaeroides (TrxA), and Trx reductase from A. thaliana (AtNTR). The second is provided by the combination of NADPH, GSH, and glutathione reductase from E. coli. The reaction was initiated by adding substrates such as H2O2 or CHP. In the Trx-dependent peroxidase activity assay, NADPH oxidation was not induced without the addition of RsPrxT or RsPrxQ. The addition of RsPrxT or RsPrxQ resulted in significant oxidation of NADPH with decomposition of oxidant (Table 1). The kcat values for the reduction of H2O2 and CHP by RsPrxT were very similar to those observed for RsPrxQ. However, the two peroxides showed an approximate 2-fold higher affinity for RsPrxT than for RsPrxQ. Thus, the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of RsPrxT toward H2O2 and CHP were ∼2- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than those of RsPrxQ (Table 1). We also measured the GSH-dependent peroxidase activity of RsPrxT and RsPrxQ; however, these were not detectable (Fig. 2B for RsPrxQ; data not shown for RsPrxT). Hence, both proteins exhibited peroxidase activities to decompose H2O2 and CHP with electrons donated from TrxA, although the activity of RsPrxT was slightly higher than that of RsPrxQ.TABLE 1Catalytic parameters of recombinant RsPrxT and RsPrxQSubstrateType of PrxKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin-1H2O2RsPrxT4.75 ± 1.8117.08 ± 0.863.59RsPrxQ8.56 ± 1.0617.07 ± 0.361.99CHPRsPrxT6.65 ± 0.7216.45 ± 0.342.47RsPrxQ8.48 ± 0.3116.85 ± 0.131.98 Open table in a new tab We next tested the peroxidase activity of the RsPrxQ C44S and C80S mutants. Site-specific mutation in the peroxidatic Cys residue (C44S) resulted in complete loss of peroxidase activity (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the mutant RsPrxQ containing a Ser at the resolving Cys position (C80S) still had significant peroxidase activity with electrons donated from TrxA (but not from GSH), although the activity was approximately half that of the wild-type protein. This indicates that the resolving Cys is not essential for the peroxidase activity in RsPrxQ. To directly confirm the reduction of RsPrxT and RsPrxQ by TrxA, we next studied the redox states of the thiol groups in the RsPrxT and RsPrxQ molecules in the presence or absence of TrxA.

The transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs) were a recently identified family of CREB co-activators that bind to CREB to enhance CRE-mediated transcription. TORC3, a TORC family protein, dramatically enhances Tax-mediated transcription from the LTR. In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal region of TORC3 as bait and identified B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia protein 3 (BCL3) as a protein interacting with TORC3. This interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with detection by Western blotting. The ankyrin repeat domain of BCL3 interacted with TORC3. By using a luciferase assay, we determined that BCL3 inhibited transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR in a manner dependent on TORC3. Knockdown of endogenous BCL3 using RNA interference enhanced transcriptional activation of CRE. Treatment with trichostatin A, a potent inhibitor of the transcriptional co-repressor HDAC, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of BCL3. These results suggest that BCL3 functions as a repressor of HTLV-1 LTR-mediated transcription through interactions with TORC3. In addition to stimulating transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR, Tax also enhances BCL3 expression; thus, transcription from the LTR is regulated by both positive and negative feedback mechanisms.

Tax is a pleiotropic factor that interacts with multiple cellular proteins to regulate gene expression (8Maruyama M. Shibuya H. Harada H. Hatakeyama M. Seiki M. Fujita T. Inoue J. Yoshida M.

Tax also modulates its own transcription by interacting directly with cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a cellular transcription factor that activates the LTR (13Giebler H.A.

The Tax-CREB complex binds to the Tax-responsive element (TxRE) within the HTLV-1 LTR. This binding promotes viral transcription through the recruitment of co-activators, such as CBP/p300 and associated factors, in a process that does not require CREB phosphorylation (14Kwok R.P.

Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The HTLV-1 LTR contains three tandem repeats of TxRE, each of which consists of a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) flanked by GC-rich sequences (17Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Huang M.S.

Recently, a family of CREB co-activators, the transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs), was discovered to bind CREB in a phosphorylation-independent manner and enhance CRE-mediated transcription (18Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

This transcriptional activation is facilitated by recruitment of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 130 (TAF130), a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, to the CREB-containing complex. TORC1, TORC2, and TORC3 dramatically enhance Tax-mediated transcription from the LTR (20Koga H. Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol.

Virol. 2006; 80: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This enhancement appears to require the formation of a ternary complex composed of Tax, CREB, and TORCs. To clarify the mechanism by which transcription from the LTR is regulated, we searched for a cellular factor(s) that interacted with TORC3 using a yeast two-hybrid screening system with the N terminus of TORC3 as bait. This approach identified B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia protein 3 (BCL3) as a protein interacting with TORC3. BCL3 was originally identified through molecular cloning of the chromosomal breakpoint in a subset of human B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia containing the t(14;19) chromosome translocation (22McKeithan T.W. Rowley J.D. Shows T.B. Diaz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9257-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). BCL3 is unique among the members of the ankyrin repeat-containing IκB family of NF-κB inhibitors for its ability to regulate gene expression in multiple ways (23Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). In addition to binding NF-κB p50 and p52 homodimers, BCL3 also interacts with co-activators, such as CBP/p300, SRC-1, and Tip60, and co-repressors, such as HDAC1 (24Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V.

During our investigation of the role of BCL3 in the regulation of transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR, we discovered that BCL3 suppressed transcription from its promoter through interaction with TORC3. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Assay—The DNA fragment encodes amino acids 1–298 of TORC3 into the pGBT9 vector (Clontech). This plasmid was used as the bait to screen a human spleen cDNA library (Clontech) that had been cloned into the yeast cell line Y190 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Transformants were selected in medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine containing 50 mm 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole. After incubation for 7 days at 30 °C, we screened a total of 2.0 × 106 transformants by β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid Construction—cDNA encoding human BCL3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005178) by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from Raji cells used the following primers: 5′-aaagaattcATGGACGAGGGGCCCGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCAGCTGCCTCCTGGAGCTGG-3′. We constructed an expression plasmid by inserting the full-length cDNA sequence encoding BCL3 into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the epitope-tagged pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). To construct plasmids expressing two deletion mutants of BCL3, BCL3ΔNC (125–359 amino acids) and BCL3ΔANK (lacking ankyrin repeats), the corresponding DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using their respective primers. The fragments were then subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the epitope-tagged pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers used are as follows: for BCL3ΔNC, 5′-aaagaattcGCCATGGCCACCCGTGCAGATGAG-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagAGGGGAGGGGTCTGGCTGGGAGGT-3′; for BCL3ΔANK, 5′-aaagaattcATGGACGAGGGGCCCGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGGTCTGGCTGGGAGGTCTCATCTGCACGGGTGGCCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGCCACCCGTGCAGATGAGACCTCCCAGCCAGACCCCTCC-3′ and aaactcgagTCAGCTGCCTCCTGGAGCTGG-3′. Lowercase letters indicate a linker sequence containing EcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively. pGAL4-TORC3 was generated by inserting the full TORC3 coding region, the EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pcDNA3-FLAG-TORC3, by inserting into EcoRI and SalI sites of the pM vector (Clontech). pLEC1 was generated by inserting the HTLV-1 LTR into AseI and NheI sites of the GFP-tagged form of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). HTLV-1 LTR was obtained by RT-PCR from ATL43Tb(-) cells using the following primers: 5′-attaatTGACAATGACCATGAGCCC-3′ and 5′-gctagcTGTGTACTAAATTTCTCTCC-3′.

Cell Culture and Treatment—HEK-293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Jurkat, JPX-9, MT2, C91-PL, SLB1, and Raji cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber. Raji cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 100 nm. JPX-9 is a Jurkat cell derivative with inducible expression of Tax cDNA under the control of the metallothionein promoter. In this cell, Tax expression is induced by the presence of cadmium (20 μm CdCl2) (30Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Nagata K. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1589-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HeLa-LEC1 cells were transfected with pLEC1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions into HeLa cells. Selection of cells was performed in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), resulting in isolation of the stable transformant, HeLa-LEC1, carrying a gene consisting of HTLV-1 LTR followed by the coding region of GFP. Plasmid Transfection—HEK-293T cells were grown to 50% confluence in 6-cm dishes or 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with expression vectors or the corresponding empty vector constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—Rat anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), mouse anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-CREB (48H2; Cell Signaling), mouse anti-HDAC1 (2E10; Upstate), and rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Upstate) antibodies were commercially obtained. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rat IgG, sheep anti-mouse IgG, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. GST Pulldown Assay—GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Resin-bound GST fusion proteins were then incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled BCL3, which had been synthesized by in vitro translation using a TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Binding reactions were performed in 600 μl of GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in 1 ml of GST binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were visualized by autoradiography using a BAS-5000 image analyzer (Fujix). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation assays utilized HEK-293T cells. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min. Lysates were first cleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min and then incubated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Antibody-protein mixtures were then incubated for another 30 min with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer; immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DNAP)—HEK-293T cells were lysed with DNAP binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min. Lysates were first incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min to eliminate nonspecific binding and then incubated with 15 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 2 μg of biotinylated DNA probe for 1 h at 4 °C. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads were then incubated with these mixtures for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times in DNAP binding buffer, precipitated proteins were eluted in loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The biotin-labeled DNA probes were annealed to complementary oligonucleotides. We used DNA probe sequences representative of CRE, 5′-biotin-(AGCCTGACGTCAGAGA)x3-3′, and TxRE, 5′-biotin-(GAAGGCTCTGACGTCTCCCCCA)x3-3′. Luciferase Reporter Assay—After seeding onto 24-well plates for 24 h, HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids using FuGENE 6. After an additional 24-h incubation, we performed luciferase assays using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) on a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. We normalized luciferase activities in cell lysates to the measured Renilla luciferase activity derived from co-transfected pRL-RSV-luc. All reporter assays were performed in triplicate. Standard errors are denoted by the bars in the figures. RNA Interference—A 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex specific for BCL3 was purchased from Ambion (predesigned siRNA). A control nucleotide, si-control, was purchased from Dharmacon (nonspecific control duplex IX). HeLa cells were transfected with 25 μl of 20 μm duplex RNA per 6-cm dish using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 4 h after transfection, medium was replaced with normal culture medium. Total RNA isolated from cells 48 h after siRNA transfection was used as a template for RT-PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTCATCCACGCCGTGGAAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGCTGCCTCCTGGAGCTGG-3′ (reverse). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—We isolated total RNA from cultured cells using Sepasol RNA I super reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We evaluated the relative expression of each mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR using a One-step RNA PCR kit (Takara) or a SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with the ABI 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA served as an internal control. The following primers were used: BCL3, 5′-CTCATCCACGCCGTGGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCAGCTGCCTCCTGGAGCTGG-3′; Tax, 5′-AAGGCGACTGGTGCCCCATCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTAGAGGTACATGCAGA-3′; GFP, 5′-GTCGAGCTGGACGGCGACGT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGTCTTGTAGTTGCCGTC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGG-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—This assay was performed essentially as described (protocol from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from 1 × 106 cells for each reaction with the antibody was used for analyzing histone modifications or association with transcriptional regulators. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with 125 mm glycine; cell were lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average 500 bp. Following centrifugation, the chromatin was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer, and precleared with protein A-agarose beads containing salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of the precleared chromatin fraction were incubated with different antibodies. After overnight rotation at 4 °C, the immune complexes were collected by addition of protein A-agarose beads. DNA was purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and followed by ethanol precipitation. The recovered DNA was amplified by PCR using primers specific for HTLV-1 LTR 5′-TTCCGAGAAACAGAAGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTGTTAGTTTATTGAGC-3′. The PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Identification of BCL3 as a Factor Interacting with TORC3—TORC3, a TORC family protein, dramatically enhances Tax-mediated transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR (20Koga H. Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52978-52983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This activation requires the formation of a ternary complex containing Tax, CREB, and TORC3. To clarify the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of transcription from the LTR by these proteins, we searched for a cellular factor(s) that interacts with TORC3 using a yeast two-hybrid screening system with the TORC3 N terminus as bait. The N-terminal 298 amino acids of TORC3 were subcloned into pGBT9 (GAL4 system; Clontech); this plasmid was co-transformed with human spleen cDNA library (Clontech) into yeast Y190 cells. We obtained 29 clones from 2.0 × 106 yeast transformants that exhibited a positive phenotype. One of these clones encoded a portion of BCL3. To confirm the interaction of BCL3 with TORC3, we performed a GST pulldown assay using bacterially expressed GST-TORC3 (1–298 amino acids). Under conditions in which in vitro translated BCL3 did not bind GST-bound Sepharose beads alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 5 and 8), it could be detected in the fraction bound to Sepharose beads conjugated to recombinant GST-TORC3 (1–298 amino acids) (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This result suggests that BCL3 interacts specifically with TORC3. To identify the region of BCL3 responsible for interacting with TORC3, we repeated this GST pulldown assay using several BCL3 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). The in vitro synthesized BCL3ΔNC fragment (125–359 amino acids), but not ΔANK (which lacks the ankyrin repeats), co-precipitated with GST-TORC3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 9). To analyze the in vivo interaction of BCL3 with TORC3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged TORC3 and HA-tagged BCL3. Immunocomplexes precipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody identified a band corresponding to the expected size of BCL3 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). To define the domains within BCL3 and TORC3 responsible for the interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using the BCL3 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). HA-tagged BCL3ΔNC (Fig. 1C, lane 4), but not HA-tagged BCL3ΔANK (Fig. 1C, lane 6), could be detected in the immunocomplexes isolated from cell lysates with an anti-FLAG antibody. Taken together, these results suggested that TORC3 interacts with the ankyrin repeats of BCL3. BCL3, TORC3, and CREB Form the Ternary Complex on CRE and TxRE—As TORCs are involved in CREB complex (18Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol.

A. 2003; 100: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we used an in vitro DNA affinity precipitation assay to determine whether BCL3 is also recruited to CRE and TxRE. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector, HA-tagged BCL3, or FLAG-tagged TORC3 expression plasmids. Cell lysates were incubated with a 5′-biotin-labeled DNA probe consisting of three repeats of either CRE or TxRE. Probe DNA was recovered with streptavidin-coated beads; probe-bound proteins were eluted in SDS loading buffer and detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-CREB antibodies. The amount of BCL3 bound to either CRE or TxRE increased in the presence of TORC3 (Fig. 2, A, lane 4 and B, lane 4); the presence or absence of BCL3 did not change the amounts of TORC3 and CREB (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that BCL3 is recruited to CRE and TxRE in a TORC3-dependent manner. BCL3 Inhibits Transcription from the LTR, TxRE, and CRE by Tax and/or TORC3—As TORC3 is a co-activator of the transcription factor CREB, which itself enhances CRE-mediated target gene transcription (18Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

A luciferase assay using the pLTR-luc reporter plasmid revealed that luciferase activity was enhanced by ectopic expression of either Tax or TORC3. BCL3 expression, however, suppressed this activation of transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR (Fig. 3A). Association of Tax as well as TORC3 with CREB on the TxRE within the HTLV-1 5′-LTR activates viral gene expression. To determine the effect of these proteins on viral gene transcription, we performed a reporter assay using pTxRE-luc, a reporter plasmid with five copies of the Tax-responsive element in its promoter region. Luciferase activity was enhanced by the expression of either Tax or TORC3. BCL3, however, decreased activation 3-fold from the TxRE by Tax or TORC3 (Fig. 3B). Next, we explored the effect of BCL3 on TORC3-dependent transcription from the CRE. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding TORC3 and BCL3 together with the luciferase reporter plasmid, pCRE-luc, which contains four repeats of the CRE consensus sequence. TORC3-activated pCRE-luc expression, generating luciferase levels ∼80-fold greater than untransfected control cells. BCL3, however, decreased TORC3-dependent activation of luciferase expression from pCRE-luc in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Tax was unable to activate transcription from CRE (Fig. 3C). To examine the function of BCL3 under physiological conditions, we employed siRNA technology to suppress endogenous BCL3. Treatment with BCL3 siRNA efficiently reduced the levels of BCL3 mRNA in HeLa cells, whereas GAPDH mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3D). Knockdown of endogenous BCL3 by RNA interference enhanced the transcription activation of CRE by TORC3 (Fig. 3E). Next, to examine the effect of BCL3 under physiological condition, we used stable transformant of HeLa cell clone, HeLa-LEC, transduced with pLEC1. These cells are appropriated to assess the physiological relevance of the HTLV-1 LTR and superior to HTLV-1-infected lymphoid cell lines because of higher efficiency of transfection. A semiquantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that GFP mRNA was enhanced by ectopic expression of TORC3. BCL3 expression, however, suppressed this activation of transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR (Fig. 3F). Moreover, we observed that knockdown of endogenous BCL3 by RNA interference enhanced the transcription activation of GFP mRNA by TORC3 (Fig. 3G). These results suggest that BCL3 represses transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR.

Lipid A and core oligosaccharides (OS) are synthesized and assembled at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and then translocated to the periplasmic side of the membrane where lipid A-core becomes the acceptor of the O antigens.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). This macromolecule plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the outer membrane (2Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of lipid A and core oligosaccharide of Escherichia coli have been reviewed by Raetz and Whitfield (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Homologues of these enzymes are also found in P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria. Biosynthesis of lipid A-core begins at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane, and all of the enzymes involved are either localized in the cytoplasm or associated with the membrane. In E. coli, the minimal LPS structure required for growth has been known to be two 2-keto 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid residue of the inner core attached to lipid A (Kdo2-lipid A or Re LPS) (4Wang X. Karbarz M.J. McGrath S.C. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49470-49478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The requisite LPS structure has been redefined by Meredith et al. (5Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) who had shown in their recent study that an E. coli mutant producing only the lipid A precursor known as lipid IVA in the outer membrane was viable. In contrast, P. aeruginosa requires sugars of the full inner core and at least part of the outer core in addition to lipid A to be viable (3Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Rahim R. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2803-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The lipid A-core moiety must be flipped to the periplasmic side of the inner membrane where it is either directly transported to the outer membrane or serves as acceptor of the O antigens. Earlier work on E. coli showed that the transport of this molecule is ATP-dependent and is most likely carried out by an ATP binding cassette transporter, named MsbA (7Hanrahan J.W. Mathews C.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Grzelczak Z. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Exp. Zool. 1996; 275: 283-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein exhibited structural similarities to mammalian multidrug-resistant ABC transporters as well as several bacterial exporters (8Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MsbA was therefore classified as a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. Polissi and Georgopoulos (9Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed that msbAEc is an essential gene and the only essential bacterial ABC transporter known in E. coli. The MsbA protein was localized to the inner membrane and shown to possess ATP binding and hydrolysis properties. Studies by Zhou et al. (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and Doerrler and Raetz (11Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) showed that MsbA can transport fully acylated lipid A. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of MsbA can be stimulated by lipid A, suggesting that this protein could be involved in transport of lipid A across the inner membrane. Homologues of MsbA have been identified in almost all Gram-negative bacteria as well as in some Gram-positive bacteria. Because Gram-positive bacteria do not produce LPS, the function of the MsbA homologues in these bacteria has been implicated in multidrug resistance (12Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13van Veen H.W. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, information on the biochemical characteristics of MsbA proteins is limited and MsbAEc is the only one that has been characterized biochemically. Moreover, the sequence conservation within the membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) of MsbA proteins is low (supplemental Fig. S1), likely caused by differences in their substrate recognition and the kinetics of ATPase activity. lipopolysaccharide isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside octylglucoside lauryldimethylamineoxide dodecyl β-d-maltoside membrane-spanning domains nucleotide-binding domains digoxigenin Open reading frame pa4997 from the annotated Pseudomonas PAO1 genome encodes a protein that shares 40% sequence identity with E. coli MsbA. MsbA protein (msbA/MsbA are used from here onward to designate the gene and its product in P. aeruginosa, homologues in other organisms will be designated with a suffix in subscript font) possesses conserved ABC transporter protein motifs (supplemental Fig. S1) and as such is classified as a member of this family. In this study, we describe the characterization of the putative MsbA of P. aeruginosa, and test the hypothesis that this protein is involved in the transport of lipid A-core, and not just lipid A, from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to the periplasmic side. We observed that msbA is an essential gene and msbAEc cannot be used to cross-complement an msbA mutation in P. aeruginosa. The differences between these two genes and their products are substantiated by the observation that the kinetic parameters of purified and reconstituted MsbA are considerably different than that of MsbAEc. Finally, this is the first report to show that the phosphate substituents in the lipid A-core play a role in the transport of this molecule across the membrane in model bilayers (liposomes). Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in the supplemental Table S1 (50Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar). Bacterial strains were routinely propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, ON) at 37 °C. Pseudomonas Isolation Agar (PIA; DIFCO Becton Dickson, Sparks, MD) was used for the bacterial mating experiments. DNA Procedures—All restriction enzymes were used according to the suppliers' specifications. Small-scale plasmid DNA preparations were carried out using a plasmid Mini-Prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich Canada). Plasmid DNA was electroporated into P. aeruginosa with a Gene Pulser instrument (Bio-Rad). Genomic DNA was isolated from P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and E. coli K12 (W3110) by the method described by Ausubel et al. (14Ausubel F. Brent S. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Struhl K. Short Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Early attempts to amplify pa4997 of strain PAO1 using a standard PCR procedure with primers designed to sequences flanking the 5′- and 3′-end of the open reading frame were unsuccessful. Subsequently, we amplified two segments of the gene and ligated them to produce an intact gene. The intact gene product was cloned into pEX18Ap and pQE80 for protein expression experiments. Southern blot analysis was performed using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter kit following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). To generate a knock-out mutation in msbA, the method described by Hoang et al. (18Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar) was followed. To construct a chimera of msbA, the membrane-spanning domain (MSD) of MsbA was fused to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of MsbAEc by using the Splice Overlap Extension (SOE) method as described previously (15Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The length of each of the two domains was determined by the Simple Molecular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) domain prediction program (16Letunic I. Copley R.R. Pils B. Pinkert S. Schultz J. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D257-D260Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 17Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Chimeric-MsbA (Chi-MsbA) was overexpressed as an N terminus histidine-tagged fusion protein using pQE80 and purified as described below for MsbA. Overexpression of MsbA—N-terminal histidine-tagged MsbA was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Several expression conditions were tested including those reported for BmrA (12Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and MsbAEc (11Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.6. The bacterial cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the cell pellet was washed with ice-cold 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7 and resuspended in 40 ml of the suspension buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2). Cell breakage was achieved by 3 passages through a French Press cell at 20,000 psi. Unbroken cells and cellular debris were then removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Inside-out membrane vesicles were sedimented by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min. Membrane vesicles were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol at protein concentration of 10–30 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. Solubilization and Purification of His6-MsbA from Membrane Vesicles—Several detergents including N-laurylsarcosine (Sarcosyl), octylglucoside (OG), lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), and dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) were tested for their ability to solubilize functionally active MsbA. The following procedure was used to reproducibly produce relatively large quantities of MsbA (5 mg per 500 ml of culture) that exhibited very high level of ATPase activity. Briefly, frozen membrane vesicles were quickly thawed at 37 °C and diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml with the solubilization buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, and 1% (w/v) DDM), and the sample was stirred for 1 h at 4°C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the solubilized membranes were adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mm imidazole. Prior to purification, detergent-solubilized protein was gently stirred for 1 h at 4°C in 1 ml of TALON resin (ClonTech). After that MsbA was eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed from the purified protein using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare BioSciences Inc., Baie d'Urfé, QC), and the buffer was exchanged to protein storage buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and 0.05% DDM) and stored at –80 °C. Reconstitution of Purified MsbA—Commercially available E. coli polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc, Alabaster, AL) were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:4, v/v) and dried under nitrogen gas and vacuum for 30 min. The resulting lipid film was resuspended in a HEPES buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5 containing 20 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 (HEPES buffer) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The lipid suspension was then passed through a 100-nm filter several times using an extruder device (Avestin, Ottawa, ON) to produce unilamellar liposomes. The liposomes were then diluted to 4 mg/ml and saturated with DDM to a final concentration of 2 mm. At this concentration of detergent, there was no noticeable change in the OD540 of the sample, indicating the saturation point has been reached before onset of solubilization (19Lambert O. Levy D. Ranck J.L. Leblanc G. Rigaud J.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Purified MsbA was then added to a lipid to protein ratio of 50:1 (w/w) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle stirring. BioBeads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were then added to the sample at 100 mg/ml followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The above step was repeated once more followed by a third addition of BioBeads and the incubation period was continued for 16 h at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were harvested by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 m m 2-mercaptoethanol (HEPES-ME buffer) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Proteoliposomes were frozen at –80 °C and stored in small aliquots until use. Purified and reconstituted protein samples were quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Colorimetric ATPase Assay—The method of Chifflet et al. (20Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) was employed for the ATPase assay. To determine the activity of the detergent-solubilized MsbA, 2 μg of the protein was added to a 100-μl reaction mixture in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% DDM. For assays with the liposome-reconstituted protein, the above buffer was replaced with one without the 0.05% DDM. The amounts of ATP used in the entire experiments are as follows: 0–20 mm for establishing standards curves, 0.2–6 mm for assaying intrinsic ATPase activity of detergent-solubilized and liposome-reconstituted MsbA, and 4 mm for assessing the stimulatory effect of different forms of lipid A-core and for evaluating the effect of MsbA on antibiotic susceptibility. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 100 μlof 12% (w/v) SDS, 3% (w/v) ascorbic acid and 1% (w/v) ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of a solution containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid, 2% (w/v) sodium arsenite, and 2% sodium citrate was added to stop the reaction. Reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min and measured for absorbance at OD750. Preparation of LPS—The standard hot aqueous-phenol method of Westphal and Jann (21Westphal O. Jann K. Himmelspach K. Prog. Allergy. 1983; 33: 9-39PubMed Google Scholar) was used to prepare LPS from two well-defined LPS-mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1, namely, a rmlC mutant which produces LPS that is truncated in the core region, designated as RT-LPS; and a wapR mutant that produces rough LPS with a complete core-oligosaccharide (R-LPS) (22Poon K.K.H. Mead K. Lam J.L. The 103rd General Conference of the American Society for Microbiology. 2003; (May 18–22, Washington, D. C., Abst. No. D-242)Google Scholar). Both forms of LPS are devoid of O antigens. Dephosphorylation of the R-LPS was prepared by treating 100 mg of lyophilized LPS sample with concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF, 48%) at 4 °C for 48 h. HF was then removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen until the sample was dried (about 20 h). Lyophilized LPS was then resuspended in water and dialyzed against 16 liters of deionized water for at least 48 h. Finally, the sample was lyophilized to recover the LPS and it was resuspended in 50% dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO). LPS prepared in this manner was stored at 4 °C until use. LPS was quantified by 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) assay as described previously (19Lambert O. Levy D. Ranck J.L. Leblanc G. Rigaud J.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Droge W. Lehmann V. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Skoza L. Mohos S. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mole-to-mass ratio of LPS was estimated based on the stoichiometry of two Kdo residues per LPS molecule of P. aeruginosa. Mild acid treatment of LPS would release a free Kdo from the inner core oligosaccharide (19Lambert O. Levy D. Ranck J.L. Leblanc G. Rigaud J.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Droge W. Lehmann V. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Skoza L. Mohos S. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The free Kdo would then react with thiobarbituric acid to give rise to the chromophore that facilitated spectrophotometric detection based on an optimum extinction coefficient at wavelength 552 nm. The Kdo that is glycosidically linked to heptose remained intact and would not react with the thiobarbituric acid. Therefore, the molar ratio of Kdo to LPS molecule was calculated as 1:1. Antibiotic Susceptibility Test—Agar disk-diffusion method was used as described previously (25Bauer A.W. Perry D.M. Kirby W.M. AMA Arch. Intern. Med. 1959; 104: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, P. aeruginosa harboring msbA or msbAEc were grown overnight. Cell cultures were diluted to OD600 of about 1.0. 10 μl of each cell culture was plated on LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotics. After an initial 30 min incubation of the plates at 37 °C, the sterile disks were placed on the center of the plates and 10 μlof each antibiotic solution was added to the disk. The plates were then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and the zone of clearance was then measured. All experiments were performed blinded with respect to the bacterial samples being examined for antibiotic susceptibility to avoid bias and repeated at three different times. msbA Is Essential to the Viability of P. aeruginosa—To determine the functional role of pa4997, constructions of a knockout mutant of msbA was attempted using insertional mutation and allelic replacement as described previously by Hoang et al. (18Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). A large number of gentamicin-resistant colonies were obtained indicating that the GmR insertion was effective. However, upon streaking the gentamicin-resistance colonies on PIA containing 5% sucrose as counter selection, none of the colonies tested were able to grow on the specific medium, suggesting the presence of sacB from the gene-replacement vector and that the loss of functional msbA would result in a lethal phenotype. The genotype of these colonies was determined by colony PCR. As expected, the PCR results showed that the colonies were merodiploids containing a wild-type copy of msbA as well as a disrupted copy of this gene in their chromosome (data not shown). These merodiploid colonies were also resistant to carbenicillin, further indicating the incorporation of the entire vector (pEX18Ap) into the chromosome. The inability of these colonies to grow on sucrose even after extensive passages was the first evidence to suggest that msbA is an essential gene in P. aeruginosa. msbA was cloned into a low-copy-number plasmid pRK404 (26Scott H.N. Laible P.D. Hanson D.K. Plasmid. 2003; 50: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the resulting construct was transformed into a sucrose-sensitive merodiploid. Transformants were then subjected to growth in PIA containing sucrose and gentamycin to select for excision of the plasmid carrying sacB and the wildtype copy of msbA, leaving the mutated copy on the chromosome. Southern hybridization analysis showed that the sucrose-resistant colonies have lost the functional chromosomal copy of msbA and retained the disrupted copy (Fig. 1). However, the loss of the wild-type msbA could only occur when another functional copy is present in trans suggesting that msbA is an essential gene. Thus, in P. aeruginosa true mutants are not viable. Complementation of merodiploid isolates followed by Southern blot further confirmed the essential nature of msbA in this organism. In Trans Supplementation of the Merodiploid Colonies with msbAEc—To test whether msbA from E. coli K12 (W3110) could substitute for msbA, msbAEc was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pRK404. This construct was then transformed into P. aeruginosa msbA merodiploid cells. Most of the transformants were not able to grow on medium containing 5% sucrose. A few colonies that grew were streaked on LB agar supplemented with carbenicillin and LB agar supplemented with gentamicin. All the colonies tested were resistant to both carbenicillin and gentamicin. Upon repeating the experiment the colonies were still resistant to carbenicillin. This suggested that the presence of msbAEc in trans was unable to substitute for msbA and a functional copy of msbA is still required for viability. These results indicated that there are sufficient differences between msbA in these two bacterial species. To ensure that MsbAEc is active in P. aeruginosa, ATPase activity of MsbAEc-enriched membrane vesicles was measured, and the activity was observed to compare closely with those of MsbA-enriched membrane vesicles (supplemental Fig. S2). Optimization of Overexpression, Solubilization, and Purification of MsbA—MsbA was overexpressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag. Doerrler and Raetz (11Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression of MsbAEc was accomplished by inducing the expression strain of bacteria with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 30 °C, whereas Steinfels et al. (12Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was able to overexpress BmrA, a homologue in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, using a condition of 0.4 mm IPTG at 25 °C for 4 h. Expression of MsbA could be detected using either of these published conditions, but the protein exhibited very low enzymatic activity (data not shown). Alternatively, overexpression of MsbA was achieved by inducing the cultures with 1 mm IPTG for 16 h at 15 °C. The yield of MsbA in the membranes prepared from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells expressing the protein appeared to be lower as compared with the yield when the other two induction protocols were used. However, MsbA purified from cells after 15 °C induction showed ATPase activity/mg protein to be about 10-fold higher than when the protein was induced using the conditions reported for MsbAEc and BmrA, respectively (11Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles prepared this way were frozen at –80 °C in small aliquots. The ATPase activity of MsbA was stable upon storage under these conditions for up to three months (data not shown). To select a suitable detergent for solubilization of MsbA, a number of detergents were examined including OG at 2% (w/v), LDAO at 2% (w/v), DDM at 1% (w/v) and Sarcosyl at 1% (w/v). Samples were then incubated with gentle stirring for 1 h. No difference in the amount of solubilized proteins was observed when the membranes were incubated with detergents for longer than 1 h. Sarcosyl was most effective for solubilizing MsbA from the membranes resulting in the highest yield of solubilized protein compared with the other three detergents (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The extent in which MsbA could be solubilized by the remaining three detergents appeared to be similar (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, and 4). Although Sarcosyl was highly effective for solubilizing MsbA from the membrane preparations, it produced a rather low yield of purified protein. In contrast, significantly higher amounts of purified proteins, i.e. ∼3 mg of purified MsbA from 500 ml of culture, were obtained when DDM or OG were used as detergents (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4). Interestingly, the yield of purified MsbAwas the lowest, at approximately five times less when LDAO was used to solubilize the membranes (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When different preparations of purified MsbA were assayed for intrinsic ATPase activity, LDAO-solubilized MsbA showed the lowest activity (3.51 nmol/mg/min), followed by Sarcosyl (10.31 nmol/mg/min), and OG-solubilized protein (25.73 nmol/mg/min) in ascending order. DDM-solubilized MsbA exhibited the highest ATPase activity (46.37 nmol/mg/min) (Fig. 2C). It is worth noting that during the purification step for all the detergent-solubilized membranes, DDM was used at 0.1% (w/v) final concentration, which was further reduced to 0.05% (w/v) during the buffer exchange. According to our observations, overexpression of MsbA at 15 °C with 1 mm IPTG for 16 h and solubilization of the resulting membrane vesicles with 1% (w/v) DDM resulted in the highest amount of functionally active protein. This condition was used for all subsequent analyses of this protein. Intrinsic ATPase Activity of Purified MsbA—Using ATP concentrations up to about 5 mm, the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis activity of detergent-solubilized MsbA follows the Michaelis-Menten equation, and Vmax of 61.4 nmol/mg/min and Km of 573 μm were observed (Fig. 3A). These parameters are consistent with those reported for MsbAEc in the reconstituted system and in the presence of lipid A (11Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Intrinsic ATPase Activity of Reconstituted MsbA—Reconstituted MsbA showed an increase in activity that correlated with increasing ATP concentrations (Fig. 3B). At 8 mm ATP, the Vmax of MsbA was recorded at 144.5 nmol/mg/min, and Km was at 4500 μm. Interestingly, the high ATP concentration of 8 mm had no inhibitory effect on ATPase activity of"
https://openalex.org/W1976821591,"The par2 locus of Escherichia coli plasmid pB171 encodes two trans-acting proteins, ParA and ParB, and two cis-acting sites, parC1 and parC2, to which ParB binds cooperatively. ParA is related to MinD and oscillates in helical structures and thereby positions ParB/parC-carrying plasmids regularly over the nucleoid. ParB ribbon-helix-helix dimers bind cooperatively to direct repeats in parC1 and parC2. Using four different assays we obtain solid evidence that ParB can pair parC1- and parC2-encoding DNA fragments in vitro. Convincingly, electron microscopy revealed that ParB mediates binary pairing of parC fragments. In addition to binary complexes, ParB mediated the formation of higher order complexes consisting of several DNA fragments joined by ParB at centromere site parC. N-terminal truncated versions of ParB still possessing specific DNA binding activity were incompetent in pairing, hence identifying the N terminus of ParB as a requirement for ParB-mediated centromere pairing. These observations suggest that centromere pairing is an important intermediate step in plasmid partitioning mediated by the common type I loci."

Although the activity of GCMa can be post-translationally regulated by protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, it is unknown whether GCMa activity can be regulated by sumoylation. In this report, we investigated the role of sumoylation in the regulation of GCMa activity. We demonstrated that Ubc9, the E2 component of the sumoylation machinery, specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of GCMa and promotes GCMa sumoylation on lysine 156. Moreover, GCMa-mediated transcriptional activation was repressed by sumoylation but was enhanced in the presence of the SUMO-specific protease, SENP1. The repressive effect of sumoylation on GCMa transcriptional activity was attributed to decreased DNA binding activity of GCMa. Furthermore, structural analysis revealed a steric clash between the SUMO1 moiety of sumoylated GCMa and the DNA-binding surfaces of GCMa, which may destabilize the interaction between GCMa and its cognate DNA sequence. Our study demonstrates that GCMa is a new sumoylation substrate and its activity is down-regulated by sumoylation.

Because syncytiotrophoblasts undergo apoptosis, to maintain the structural and functional integrity of placental villi, GCMa very likely plays a pivotal role in regulation of syncytiotrophoblast formation. Indeed, GCMa activity is regulated by post-translation modifications, which may in turn fine tune the differentiation of syncytiotrophoblast. Recently, we have demonstrated that CREB-binding protein directly interacts with and acetylates GCMa in the activated cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway (2Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Acetylation of GCMa prolongs its protein stability with a concomitant increase in transcriptional activity, which may provide an explanation of why the cAMP stimulant, forskolin, enhances placental cell fusion. Because acetylation is a reversible modification, several histone deacetylases (HDAC1, -3, -4, and -5) have been identified to mediate deacetylation of GCMa (3Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vitro labeling experiments have also revealed that GCMa is a phosphoprotein. Being phosphorylated, GCMa can be targeted by the F-box protein, FBW2, and subjected to protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system (4Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10083-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of GCMa activity is achieved at multiple levels by phosphorylation, acetylation, deacetylation, and ubiquitination.Sumoylation is a protein modification involving a covalent conjugation of a polypeptide termed the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to lysine residues of target proteins (5Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 6Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). SUMO proteins are structurally related to ubiquitin and are expressed as precursors that undergo proteolytic cleavage to make the C-terminal glycine-glycine motif available for conjugation. At least three mammalian SUMO proteins, SUMO1, -2, and -3 have been identified. SUMO2 and -3 share greater than 90% identity in amino acid sequence, whereas both are about 50% identical to SUMO1. Similar to ubiquitination, sumoylation is catalyzed by a set of enzymes, including E1-activating enzyme (Aos1/Uba2 or SAE1/SAE2), E2-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9), and E3 ligases. However, unlike ubiquitination, a consensus sequence for SUMO modification has been identified as ΨKXE, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid and K is the site of SUMO conjugation (5Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 6Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Moreover, recombinant E1, Ubc9, and SUMO are sufficient for ATP-dependent SUMO modification of substrates in vitro. Consistent with this observation, structural studies have shown direct recognition of the SUMO consensus motif by the Ubc9 active site (7Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Three types of SUMO E3 ligases have been identified, including RanBP2, the PIAS proteins, and Pc2. They exhibit different subcellular localization patterns and may be important in regulating substrate recognition and enhancing sumoylation of substrates in vivo. Interestingly, PIAS proteins can also function as transcriptional coregulators. With no sumoylation involved, PIAS1 has recently been shown to interact with and localize the Msx1 homeoprotein to the nuclear periphery, where Msx1 can engage with and repress the expression of its target genes (8Lee H. Quinn J.C. Prasanth K.V. Swiss V.A. Economides K.D. Camacho M.M. Spector D.L. Abate-Shen C. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).A wide spectrum of functional consequences of SUMO modification of protein has been reported, including modulation of transcriptional activity, mediation of nuclear import, recruitment of transcriptional regulators in nuclear domains, protection from ubiquitination, and regulation of mitosis (6Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In addition, conjugation of SUMO can provide new interaction surfaces to protein and facilitate proteolytic processing, respectively. For instance, sumoylation of p300 and Elk1 facilitates the recruitment of HDAC6 and HDAC2, respectively (9Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 10Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Sumoylation in the N-terminal inhibitory domain of Sp1 prevents proteolytic cleavage of this domain and hence represses Sp1 transcriptional activity (11Spengler M.L. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5567-5574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation may regulate the sumoylation of a substrate. A phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif of ΨKXEXXSP, composed of a SUMO consensus site and an adjacent proline-directed phosphorylation site, has been identified in several transcription factors, including GATA-1 and MEF2 (12Hietakangas V. Anckar J. Blomster H.A. Fujimoto M. Palvimo J.J. Nakai A. Sistonen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It is foreseeable that new SUMO substrates will be identified based on the phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif.Although protein phosphorylation, acetylation, deacetylation, and ubiquitination regulate GCMa activity, it remains unknown whether GCMa activity can be regulated by sumoylation. In this study, we investigated the role of sumoylation in the regulation of GCMa activity. We demonstrated that the Ubc9 protein specifically interacts with GCMa and promotes GCMa sumoylation. Furthermore, the primary SUMO acceptor site was identified as lysine 156 in the N-terminal domain of GCMa, which is also the interaction domain for Ubc9. Sumoylation of GCMa repressed the transcriptional activity of GCMa. This is most likely due to a decrease in the DNA binding activity of GCMa, since protein modeling indicated that the SUMO1 domain can impose steric hindrance on the DNA-binding surfaces of GCMa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The expression plasmids pHA-GCMa, pGCMa-FLAG, pGal4-FLAG, and pGal4-GCMa-FLAG and its deletion mutants have been described previously (2Chang C.W.

The K149R, K156R, K160R, and E158A mutants of pGal4-GCMa-FLAG-(1–300) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis at lysine 149, lysine 156, lysine 160, and glutamic acid 158, respectively. The K3R mutant harbors a combined mutation at lysine 149, lysine 156, and lysine 160. pHA-GCMa-SUMO1 and pSUMO1-GCMa-FLAG were constructed by inserting a SUMO1 cDNA fragment in frame to the 3′-end of the HA-GCMa and to the 5′-end of the GCMa-FLAG cDNA fragment, respectively. To prevent desuomylation of the chimeric SUMO1-GCMa-FLAG protein, the codons for the last two glycine residues in the SUMO1 cDNA were changed to encode two alanine residues. pUbc9-FLAG and -Myc, pPIAS2β-Myc, and pSENP1-FLAG were constructed by placing the respective open reading frame cDNA tagged at the C-terminal with three copies of FLAG or four copies of Myc under the control of cytomegalovirus early promoter/enhancer. pUbc9-FLAG-dn encodes a dominant-negative Ubc9 harboring a Cys93 → Ser mutation in its active site. pPIAS2β-Myc-C/S encodes a null mutant PIAS2β harboring a Cys362 → Ser mutation. pEGFP-SUMO1 was constructed by cloning the wild type SUMO1 cDNA fragment (amino acids 1–97) into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). pEGFP-SUMO1-AA is similar to pEGFP-SUMO1 except that the last two glycine residues were changed into two alanine residues. A syncytin promoter fragment derived from the 083M05 BAC clone was inserted into pE1bLUC to generate p(27950/28314)LUC. The proximal GCMa-binding site (pGBS, 28026–28033) in p(27950/28314)LUC was deleted to generate p(27950/28314)LUC-ΔGBS. The reporter construct, p(pGBS)4E1bLUC, has been described previously (2Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—293T and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). JAR cells and the BeWo-derived stable line expressing HA-GCMa were maintained at 37 °C in F-12K medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). For transient expression experiments, cells were transfected with the amounts of plasmids described in the figure legends using calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation, the TransIT LT1 reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI), or the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). In addition, adjusted amounts of the empty expression vector were added to maintain a constant amount of total DNA in each transfection assay. For luciferase reporter assays, cells were harvested in the reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 48 h post-transfection and analyzed as previously described (2Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Co-Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down Assay, and Interaction Domain Mapping—To study the interaction between GCMa, Ubc9, and PIAS, 293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated amount of pHA-GCMa, pUbc9-FLAG, and pPIAS2β-Myc as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as previously described (2Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression vector pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for preparation of the GST-Ubc9 fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Recombinant GCMa-FLAG protein was prepared by the baculovirus-insect cell expression system as previously described (1Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To study the physical interaction between GCMa and Ubc9, 0.2 μg of GCMa-FLAG and 2.5 μg of GST or GST-Ubc9 were used for GST pull-down experiments as previously described (3Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To map the interaction domain of GCMa for Ubc9, 293T cells were transfected with pUbc9-Myc and pGal4-GCMa-FLAG or its deletion mutants, followed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis.In Vivo and In Vitro Sumoylation Assays—To study GCMa sumoylation in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with different combinations of pHA-GCMa, pEGFP-SUMO1, pEGFP-SUMO1-AA, pUbc9-FLAG, pUbc9-FLAG-dn, pPIAS2β-Myc, and pPIAS2β-Myc-C/S as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. Detection of sumoylated GCMa was performed by immunoprecipitation with HA mAb and then immunoblotting with HA or EGFP mAb. Sumoylation of GCMa in placental cells was studied by transfecting HA-GCMa-expressing BeWo cells with pEGFP-SUMO1 or pEGFP-SUMO1-AA, followed by the above mentioned detection assay. In separate experiments, HA-GCMa proteins in HA-GCMa-expressing BeWo cells were immunoprecipitated by HA mAb, or the endogenous GCMa proteins in JAR cells were immunoprecipitated by a GCMa antibody (1Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblotting with a SUMO1 antibody (Invitrogen). For the in vitro sumoylation assay of GCMa, cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells were prepared according to Kroll et al. (13Kroll M. Conconi M. Desterro M.J. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and incubated with different combinations of recombinant GCMa-FLAG, Ubc9, GST-SUMO1, and GST-SUMO1-AA at 30 °C for 2.5 h, followed by immunoblotting with FLAG mAb. In a separate experiment, recombinant SUMO E1, SAE1/SAE2 (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA), and His-SUMO1 (Boston Biochem) proteins were incubated with GCMa-FLAG and Ubc9 for in vitro sumoylation assay of GCMa.FIGURE 2In vivo and in vitro sumoylation of GCMa. A and B, sumoylation of GCMa in nonplacental and placental cells.

The arrow indicates sumoylated HA-GCMa. C, HA-GCMa-expressing BeWo cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with normal mouse IgG (mIgG) and HA mAb, respectively. In a separate experiment, JAR and 293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with GCMa antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblotting (IB) using HA mAb, SUMO1, or GCMa antibody. The arrows indicate SUMO1-conjugated HA-GCMa and endogenous GCMa. Note that the endogenous free form GCMa in JAR cells is masked by the heavy chain (HC) of IgG. D, sumoylation of GCMa in vitro. 100 ng of GCMa-FLAG was incubated with 250 ng of Ubc9 and 400 ng of GST-SUMO1 or GST-SUMO1-AA in the presence of 6 μg of HeLa extracts at 30 °C for 2.5 h (left). In a separate experiment, 200 ng of GCMa-FLAG was incubated with 0.5 μg of SAE1/SAE2, 1 μg of Ubc9, and 5 μg of His-SUMO1 at 37 °C for 3 h (right). The reaction mixture was then subjected to immunoblotting using FLAG mAb. The arrow indicates sumoylated GCMa-FLAG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mapping of the sumoylation acceptor site in GCMa was first conducted by identification of its minimal domain susceptible to sumoylation. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of pGal4-FLAG; pGal4-GCMa-FLAG-(1–436), -(1–220), -(1–300), and -(300–436); pEGFP-SUMO1; and pEGFP-SUMO1-AA as described in the legend to Fig. 3A. The sumoylated domain was detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with FLAG mAb. The sumoylation acceptor site was further identified in HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP-SUMO1 and wild type pGal4-GCMa-FLAG-(1–300) or its site-specific lysine or glutamic acid mutants, including K149R, K156R, K160R, K3R, and E158A.FIGURE 3Characterization of GCMa sumoylation site. A, identification of the GCMa minimal domain susceptible to sumoylation. 293T cells were transfected with 4 μg of pGal4-FLAG or pGal4-GCMa-FLAG or its deletion mutant plus 2 μg of pEGFP-SUMO1 or pEGFP-SUMO1-AA. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for sumoylation analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The asterisks indicate sumoylated wild type or mutant Gal4-GCMa-FLAG. B, identification of the sumoylation acceptor site in GCMa. The lysine residues of three potential sumoylation motifs in GCMa-(1–300) are highlighted, and the signature glutamic acid residue in each motif is underlined. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP-SUMO1 and 4 μg of wild type (WT) pGal4-GCMa-FLAG-(1–300) or its site-specific lysine-to-arginine or glutamic acid-to-alanine mutant. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for sumoylation analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrow indicates sumoylated wild type or mutant Gal4-GCMa-FLAG-(1–300).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Stability, EMSA, and DNA Pull-down Assay—Protein stabilities of HA-GCMa, HA-GCMa-SUMO1, GCMa-FLAG, and SUMO1-GCMa-FLAG were studied by transfecting HeLa cells with pHA-GCMa, pHA-GCMa-SUMO1, pGCMa-FLAG, and pSUMO1-GCMa-FLAG, respectively. 30 h post-transfection, cells were pretreated with 75 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 h and were harvested immediately or after a continuous treatment of cycloheximide for an additional 1, 2, or 4 h for immunoblotting with HA or FLAG mAb. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis using an Eastman Kodak Co. DC290 zoom digital camera and Kodak 1D image analysis software.Preparation of recombinant MBP fusion proteins has been described previously (2Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MBP-GCMa-(1–167) fusion protein contains the minimal domain of GCMa essential for DNA binding. MBP-GCMa-(1–167)-SUMO1 fusion protein is a different version of MBP-GCMa-(1–167) with an additional SUMO1 domain at its C terminus. EMSA experiments using the pGBS oligonucleotide and the prepared MBP fusion proteins were conducted as described previously (1Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For the DNA pull-down assay, a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing three copies of the pGBS sense strand sequence was annealed with a complementary oligonucleotide. The annealed oligonucleotide, Biotin-(pGBS)3, was attached to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). The beads were then incubated with an in vitro sumoylation reaction mixture containing nonsumoylated GCMa-FLAG and His-SUMO1-conjugated GCMa-FLAG in binding conditions similar to EMSA. After extensive washing, the reactions were analyzed by immunoblotting with FLAG mAb. Band intensities were quantified with the Kodak EDAS290 system described above. A previously described wild type pGBS oligonucleotide and its mutant, Mut, were used as competitors in the pull-down assay (1Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Approximately 3 × 106 HeLa cells were mock-transfected or transfected with different combinations of pLUC(27950/28314), pLUC(27950/28314)-ΔGBS, pHA-GCMa, pHA-GCMaK156R, pEGFP-SUMO1, and pEGFP-SUMO1-AA. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for ChIP assays to study the effect of sumoylation on in vivo association between GCMa and pGBS in the syncytin promoter as previously described (1Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In brief, the associated HA-GCMa-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated by HA mAb-conjugated agarose beads and PCR-amplified for a specific region containing the pGBS sequence in the syncytin promoter construct. Sequences of primers used for PCR were 5′-CAGTGAACATAGACAGAAGTC-3′ and 5′-TAGAATGGCGCCGGGCCTTTC-3′. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels.Protein Modeling—The model for the GCM motif (residues 14–167) of human GCMa protein was constructed by a homology-based modeling method using MODELER version 8.2 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) based on the 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the GCM motif of murine GCMa bound to its octameric DNA target (Protein Data Bank code 1ODH) (15Cohen S.X. Moulin M. Hashemolhosseini S. Kilian K. Wegner M. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The GCM motifs of human and murine GCMa proteins share 93.5% amino acid sequence identity, and there are no gaps in the sequence alignment. The coordinates of the SUMO1 molecule were obtained from the 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure of human SUMO1 (residues 19–97) conjugated with thymine DNA glycosylase (Protein Data Bank code 1WYW) (16Baba D. Maita N. Jee J.G. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Nature. 2005; 435: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Before performing the docking modeling, the structures of the GCM motif and SUMO1 were optimized by energy minimization using CHARMm (Accelrys). The potential energy during minimization was calculated using CHARMM22 force field parameters in a vacuum, and the solvent effect was estimated implicitly using the generalized Born model with smooth switching function for the molecular surface. After 1000 minimization steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1000 steps with adopted basis Newton-Raphson algorithm, the quality of the structures was evaluated by PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The docking of SUMO1 to GCM motif was conducted by using ZDOCK (18Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. Proteins. 2003; 52: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). ZDOCK searched 2000 possible binding modes in the translational and rotational space between the GCM motif and SUMO1 and evaluated each mode by shape complementarity, desolvation free energy, and electrostatics energy. The complex predicted as most probable was chosen as the template structure for making the model of GCM-SUMO1 chimeric protein by energy minimization and the homology-modeling program MODELER. MODELER assigned the coordinates of GCM and SUMO domains in the chimeric protein from the GCM-SUMO1 complex structure and built the loop structure between the two domains, which originates from the linker sequence (serine-arginine) in the expression plasmid and from the highly disordered N terminus (residues 1–18) of SUMO1. The conformation of the SUMO1 C terminus was altered by XtalView (19McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) in order to represent the possible SUMO1 conjugation state (i.e. conjugation of glycine 97 of SUMO1 with lysine 156 of the GCM motif). The resulting model structure was further energy-minimized and evaluated by PROCHECK. Molecular visualization was prepared by PyMOL (available on the World Wide Web).RESULTSAssociation of GCMa with Ubc9—To investigate the possibility of GCMa being a substrate for sumoylation machinery, we first examined whether GCMa interacts with Ubc9 and PIAS proteins, two key components for substrate recognition in the sumoylation machinery. 293T cells were transfected with different combinations of pHA-GCMa, pUbc9-FLAG, and pPIAS2β-Myc for co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, a specific interaction between GCMa and Ubc9 was observed, whereas no interaction between GCMa and PIAS2β was observed. We also examined the interaction between GCMa and other PIAS proteins: PIAS1, -3, -2α, and -y. However, these PIASs did not interact with GCMa either (data not shown). To characterize the interaction between GCMa and Ubc9 in vitro, we performed GST pull-down experiments by incubating recombinant GCMa-FLAG protein with recombinant GST or GST-Ubc9 protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, a direct and specific interaction between GCMa and Ubc9 was observed. We further mapped the interaction domains of GCMa for Ubc9 by cotransfecting 293T cells with pUbc9-Myc and a series of pGal4-GCMa-FLAG plasmids encoding different proteins with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused with full-length or different regions of the GCMa polypeptide. As shown in Fig. 1C, specific interactions were only detected between Ubc9 and the regions of amino acids 1–436 (full length), 1–220, and 1–300 in GCMa, suggesting that Ubc9 interacts with the N-terminal domain of GCMa. Similar mapping results were also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that GCMa can be recognized by the sumoylation machinery via its Ubc9 component and is therefore highly likely to be a sumoylation substrate.In Vitro and in Vivo Sumoylation of GCMa—We next investigated whether GCMa can be sumoylated in vivo and in vitro. We performed in vivo sumoylation assays by transfecting 293T cells with different combinations of pHA-GCMa, pEGFP-SUMO1, pEGFP-SUMO1-AA, pUbc9-FLAG, pPIAS2β-Myc, and pPIAS2β-Myc-C/S, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with HA mAb. As shown in Fig. 2A, a band corresponding to higher molecular mass GCMa protein was detected when GCMa was coexpressed with EGFP-SUMO1 but not with EGFP-SUMO1-AA, which lacks the terminal Gly-G"

Factor Xa (fXa) protects fVa from inactivation by APC. To test the hypothesis that fXa and APC share overlapping fVa binding sites, 15 amino acid-overlapping peptides representing the heavy chain (residues 1–709) of fVa were screened for inhibition of fVa inactivation by APC. As reported, VP311–325, a peptide comprising residues 311–325 in fVa, dose-dependently and potently inhibited fVa-dependent prothrombin activation by fXa in the absence of APC. This peptide also inhibited the inactivation of fVa by APC, suggesting that this region of fVa interacts with APC. The peptide inhibited the APC-dependent cleavage of both Arg<sup>506</sup> and Arg<sup>306</sup> because inhibition was observed with plasma-derived fVa and recombinant R506Q and RR306/679QQ fVa. VP311–325 altered the fluorescence emission of dansyl-active site-labeled APC<sub>i</sub> but not a dansyl-active site-labeled thrombin control, showing that the peptide binds to APC<sub>i</sub>. This peptide also inhibited the resonance energy transfer between membrane-bound fluorescein-labeled fVa (donor) and rhodamine-active site-labeled S360C-APC (acceptor). These data suggest that peptide VP311–325 represents both an APC and fXa binding region in fVa."
