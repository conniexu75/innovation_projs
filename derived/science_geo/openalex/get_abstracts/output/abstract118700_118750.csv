https://openalex.org/W2008302913,"Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200degreesC. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into ""ropes,"" which consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms. The x-ray form factor is consistent with that of uniformly charged cylinders 13.8 +/- 0.2 angstroms in diameter. The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of <10(-4) ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge, where growth occurs. These factors strongly favor the metallic (10,10) tube with C5v symmetry and an open edge stabilized by triple bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1995499476,"Proper regulation of chondrocyte differentiation is necessary for the morphogenesis of skeletal elements, yet little is known about the molecular regulation of this process. A chicken homolog of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the conserved Hedgehog family of secreted proteins that is expressed during bone formation, has now been isolated. Ihh has biological properties similar to those of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), including the ability to regulate the conserved targets Patched (Ptc) and Gli. Ihh is expressed in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes of cartilage elements, where it regulates the rate of hypertrophic differentiation. Misexpression of Ihh prevents proliferating chondrocytes from initiating the hypertrophic differentiation process. The direct target of Ihh signaling is the perichondrium, where Gli and Ptc flank the expression domain of Ihh. Ihh induces the expression of a second signal, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), in the periarticular perichondrium. Analysis of PTHrP (-/-) mutant mice indicated that the PTHrP protein signals to its receptor in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes, thereby blocking hypertrophic differentiation. In vitro application of Hedgehog or PTHrP protein to normal or PTHrP (-/-) limb explants demonstrated that PTHrP mediates the effects of Ihh through the formation of a negative feedback loop that modulates the rate of chondrocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2037479635,"The simultaneous and unequivocal discernment of all human chromosomes in different colors would be of significant clinical and biologic importance. Whole-genome scanning by spectral karyotyping allowed instantaneous visualization of defined emission spectra for each human chromosome after fluorescence in situ hybridization. By means of computer separation (classification) of spectra, spectrally overlapping chromosome-specific DNA probes could be resolved, and all human chromosomes were simultaneously identified."
https://openalex.org/W2046471185,"Photoinduced magnetization was observed in a Prussian blue analog, K0.2Co1.4- [Fe(CN)6]&middot;6.9H2O. An increase in the critical temperature from 16 to 19 kelvin was observed as a result of red light illumination. Moreover, the magnetization in the ferrimagnetic region below 16 kelvin was substantially increased after illumination and could be restored almost to its original level by thermal treatment. These effects are thought to be caused by an internal photochemical redox reaction. Furthermore, blue light illumination could be used to partly remove the enhancement of the magnetization. Such control over magnetic properties by optical stimuli may have application in magneto-optical devices."
https://openalex.org/W2085530184,"The PTH/PTHrP receptor binds to two ligands with distinct functions: the calcium-regulating hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the paracrine factor, PTH-related protein (PTHrP). Each ligand, in turn, is likely to activate more than one receptor. The functions of the PTH/PTHrP receptor were investigated by deletion of the murine gene by homologous recombination. Most PTH/PTHrP receptor (-/-) mutant mice died in mid-gestation, a phenotype not observed in PTHrP (-/-) mice, perhaps because of the effects of maternal PTHrP. Mice that survived exhibited accelerated differentiation of chondrocytes in bone, and their bones, grown in explant culture, were resistant to the effects of PTHrP and Sonic hedgehog. These results suggest that the PTH/PTHrP receptor mediates the effects of Indian Hedgehog and PTHrP on chondrocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2066833587,"Vaccination with naked DNA elicits cellular and humoral immune responses that have a T helper cell type 1 bias. However, plasmid vectors expressing large amounts of gene product do not necessarily induce immune responses to the encoded antigens. Instead, the immunogenicity of plasmid DNA (pDNA) requires short immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) that contain a CpG dinucleotide in a particular base context. Human monocytes transfected with pDNA or double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ISS, but not those transfected with ISS-deficient pDNA or oligonucleotides, transcribed large amounts of interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interleukin-12. Although ISS are necessary for gene vaccination, they down-regulate gene expression and thus may interfere with gene replacement therapy by inducing proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2059581111,"Angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal evidence of an energy gap in the normal state excitation spectrum of the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. This gap exists only in underdoped samples and closes around the doping level at which the superconducting transition temperature Tc is a maximum. The momentum dependence and magnitude of the gap closely resemble those of the dx2-y2 gap observed in the superconducting state. This observation is consistent with results from several other experimental techniques, which also indicate the presence of a gap in the normal state. Some possible theoretical explanations for this effect are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W1968322176,"Multiple pathways of protein degradation operate within cells. A selective protein import pathway exists for the uptake and degradation of particular cytosolic proteins by lysosomes. Here, the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein LGP96 was identified as a receptor for the selective import and degradation of proteins within lysosomes. Specific substrates of this proteolytic pathway bound to the cytosolic tail of a 96-kilodalton lysosomal membrane protein in two different binding assays. Overexpression of human LGP96 in Chinese hamster ovary cells increased the activity of the selective lysosomal proteolytic pathway in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1980713523,"Complete spinal cord gaps in adult rats were bridged with multiple intercostal nerve grafts that redirected specific pathways from white to gray matter. The grafted area was stabilized with fibrin glue containing acidic fibroblast growth factor and by compressive wiring of posterior spinal processes. Hind limb function improved progressively during the first 6 months, as assessed by two scoring systems. The corticospinal tract regenerated through the grafted area to the lumbar enlargement, as did several bulbospinal pathways. These data suggest a possible repair strategy for spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2028841335,"Protein structures in nature often exhibit a high degree of regularity (for example, secondary structure and tertiary symmetries) that is absent from random compact conformations. With the use of a simple lattice model of protein folding, it was demonstrated that structural regularities are related to high ""designability"" and evolutionary stability. The designability of each compact structure is measured by the number of sequences that can design the structure-that is, sequences that possess the structure as their nondegenerate ground state. Compact structures differ markedly in terms of their designability; highly designable structures emerge with a number of associated sequences much larger than the average. These highly designable structures possess ""proteinlike"" secondary structure and even tertiary symmetries. In addition, they are thermodynamically more stable than other structures. These results suggest that protein structures are selected in nature because they are readily designed and stable against mutations, and that such a selection simultaneously leads to thermodynamic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1989172027,"A cytoplasmically inherited genetic element in yeast, [PSI+], was confirmed to be a prionlike aggregate of the cellular protein Sup35 by differential centrifugation analysis and microscopic localization of a Sup35-green fluorescent protein fusion. Aggregation depended on the intracellular concentration and functional state of the chaperone protein Hsp104 in the same manner as did [PSI+] inheritance. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of Sup35 contributed to the unusual behavior of [PSI+]. [PSI+] altered the conformational state of newly synthesized prion proteins, inducing them to aggregate as well, thus fulfilling a major tenet of the prion hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964442935,"Complex, optically functional surfaces in organic polymers can be fabricated by replicating relief structures present on the surface of an elastomeric master with an ultraviolet or thermally curable organic polymer, while the master is deformed by compression, bending, or stretching. The versatility of this procedure for fabricating surfaces with complex, micrometer- and submicrometer-scale patterns was demonstrated by the production of (i) diffraction gratings with periods smaller than the original grating; (ii) chirped, blazed diffraction gratings (where the period of a chirped grating changes continuously with position) on planar and curved surfaces; (iii) patterned microfeatures on the surfaces of approximately hemispherical objects (for example, an optical surface similar to a fly's eye); and (iv) arrays of rhombic microlenses. These topologically complex, micropatterned surfaces are difficult to fabricate with other techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2042526900,"The repeated association during the late Neoproterozoic Era of large carbon-isotopic excursions, continental glaciation, and stratigraphically anomalous carbonate precipitation provides a framework for interpreting the reprise of these conditions on the Late Permian Earth. A paleoceanographic model that was developed to explain these stratigraphically linked phenomena suggests that the overturn of anoxic deep oceans during the Late Permian introduced high concentrations of carbon dioxide into surficial environments. The predicted physiological and climatic consequences for marine and terrestrial organisms are in good accord with the observed timing and selectivity of Late Permian mass extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2025091441,"The functional mimicry of a protein by an unrelated small molecule has been a formidable challenge. Now, however, the biological activity of a 166-residue hematopoietic growth hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), with its class 1 cytokine receptor has been mimicked by a 20-residue cyclic peptide unrelated in sequence to the natural ligand. The crystal structure at 2.8 A resolution of a complex of this agonist peptide with the extracellular domain of EPO receptor reveals that a peptide dimer induces an almost perfect twofold dimerization of the receptor. The dimer assembly differs from that of the human growth hormone (hGH) receptor complex and suggests that more than one mode of dimerization may be able to induce signal transduction and cell proliferation. The EPO receptor binding site, defined by peptide interaction, corresponds to the smaller functional epitope identified for hGH receptor. Similarly, the EPO mimetic peptide ligand can be considered as a minimal hormone, and suggests the design of nonpeptidic small molecule mimetics for EPO and other cytokines may indeed be achievable."
https://openalex.org/W2053648381,"Proliferating murine C2C12 myoblasts can undergo either terminal differentiation or programmed cell death under conditions of mitogen deprivation. Unlike myoblasts, differentiated myotubes were resistant to apoptosis. During myogenesis the appearance of the apoptosis-resistant phenotype was correlated with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21(CIP1) but not with the appearance of myogenin, a marker expressed earlier in differentiation. Forced expression of the Cdk inhibitors p21(CIP1) or p16(INK4A) blocked apoptosis during myocyte differentiation. These data indicate that induction of Cdk inhibitors may serve to protect differentiating myocytes from programmed cell death as well as play a role in establishing the postmitotic state."
https://openalex.org/W2046584121,"The function of DNA methylation in higher plants was investigated by expression of a complementary DNA encoding a cytosine methyltransferase (MET1) from Arabidopsis thaliana as an antisense RNA in transgenic plants. This expression resulted in a 34 to 71 percent reduction in total genomic cytosine methylation. Loss of methylation was observed in both repetitive DNA and single-copy gene sequences. Developmental effects included altered heterochrony, changes in meristem identity and organ number, and female sterility. Cytosine demethylation prolonged both vegetative and reproductive phases of development. These findings implicate DNA methylation in establishing or maintaining epigenetic developmental states in the meristem."
https://openalex.org/W2001287959,"Ultrafast emission and absorption spectroscopies were used to measure the kinetics of DNA-mediated electron transfer reactions between metal complexes intercalated into DNA. In the presence of rhodium(III) acceptor, a substantial fraction of photoexcited donor exhibits fast oxidative quenching (>3 x 10(10) per second). Transient-absorption experiments indicate that, for a series of donors, the majority of back electron transfer is also very fast (approximately 10(10) per second). This rate is independent of the loading of acceptors on the helix, but is sensitive to sequence and pi stacking. The cooperative binding of donor and acceptor is considered unlikely on the basis of structural models and DNA photocleavage studies of binding. These data show that the DNA double helix differs significantly from proteins as a bridge for electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2054387131,"Rod-coil block copolymers are self-assembling polymers that combine the physics of orientational ordering of rodlike polymers and the microphase separation of coil-coil block copolymers. Several new solid-state morphologies were observed in a series of anionically synthesized model poly(hexyl isocyanate-b-styrene) rod-coil diblock copolymers examined by transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction. The rod-coils formed smectic C-like and O-like morphologies with domain sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to almost 1 micrometer. Both structural and orientational changes were found for increasing rod volume fractions. In addition, some morphologies exhibited spontaneous long-range orientational order over many tens of micrometers."
https://openalex.org/W2002009593,"When a terawatt-peak-power laser beam is focused into a gas jet, an electron plasma wave, driven by forward Raman scattering, is observed to accelerate a naturally collimated beam of electrons to relativistic energies (up to 10(9) total electrons, with an energy distribution maximizing at 2 megaelectron volts, a transverse emittance as low as 1 millimeter-milliradian, and a field gradient of up to 2 gigaelectron volts per centimeter). Electron acceleration and the appearance of high-frequency modulations in the transmitted light spectrum were both found to have sharp thresholds in laser power and plasma density. A hole in the center of the electron beam may indicate that plasma electrons were expelled radially."
https://openalex.org/W2050868215,"Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, is transmitted by the bites of infected fleas. Biological transmission of plague depends on blockage of the foregut of the flea by a mass of plague bacilli. Blockage was found to be dependent on the hemin storage (hms) locus. Yersinia pestis hms mutants established long-term infection of the flea's midgut but failed to colonize the proventriculus, the site in the foregut where blockage normally develops. Thus, the hms locus markedly alters the course of Y. pestis infection in its insect vector, leading to a change in blood-feeding behavior and to efficient transmission of plague."
https://openalex.org/W2146112646,"Subtype 2 of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) is expressed in the presynaptic elements of hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Knockout mice deficient in mGluR2 showed no histological changes and no alterations in basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, or tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Long-term depression (LTD) induced by low-frequency stimulation, however, was almost fully abolished. The mutant mice performed normally in water maze learning tasks. Thus, the presynaptic mGluR2 is essential for inducing LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, but this hippocampal LTD does not seem to be required for spatial learning."
https://openalex.org/W2067900965,"Tuberculosis, although preventable and curable, causes more adult deaths than any other infectious disease. A theoretical framework for designing effective control strategies is developed and used to determine treatment levels for eradication, to assess the effects of noneradicating control, and to examine the global goals of the World Health Organization. The theory is extended to assess how suboptimal control programs contribute to the evolution of drug resistance. A new evaluation criterion is defined and used to suggest how control strategies can be improved. In order to control tuberculosis, treatment failure rates must be lower in developing countries than in developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W2078125149,"Single-file diffusion is the restricted propagation of particles that cannot pass each other. The occurrence of this phenomenon should be reflected by a change in the time dependence of the mean particle displacement in comparison with ordinary diffusion. Although this process is considered to be the rate-controlling mechanism in a large variety of processes, so far no direct evidence of this phenomenon has been provided. Diffusion measurements made with pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in unidimensional pore systems (zeolites AlPO4-5 and Theta-1) reflect the expected time dependence of single-file diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2032425419,"Chronic morphine administration induces an up-regulation of several components of the cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction cascade. The behavioral and biochemical consequences of opiate withdrawal were investigated in mice with a genetic disruption of the alpha and Delta isoforms of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). In CREBalphadelta mutant mice the main symptoms of morphine withdrawal were strongly attenuated. No change in opioid binding sites or in morphine-induced analgesia was observed in these mutant mice, and the increase of adenylyl cyclase activity and immediate early gene expression after morphine withdrawal was normal. Thus, CREB-dependent gene transcription is a factor in the onset of behavioral manifestations of opiate dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2060960668,"The POU transcription factor Oct-6, also known as SCIP or Tst-1, has been implicated as a major transcriptional regulator in Schwann cell differentiation. Microscopic and immunochemical analysis of sciatic nerves of Oct-6(-/-) mice at different stages of postnatal development reveals a delay in Schwann cell differentiation, with a transient arrest at the promyelination stage. Thus, Oct-6 appears to be required for the transition of promyelin cells to myelinating cells. Once these cells progress past this point, Oct-6 is no longer required, and myelination occurs normally."
https://openalex.org/W1987276980,"B and T lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis in response to anti-immunoglobulin M antibodies and dexamethasone, respectively, were found to have increased amounts of messenger RNA for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and increased amounts of IP3R protein. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the augmented receptor population was localized to the plasma membrane. Type 3 IP3R (IP3R3) was selectively increased during apoptosis, with no enhancement of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1). Expression of IP3R3 antisense constructs in S49 T cells blocked dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, whereas IP3R3 sense, IP3R1 sense, or IP3R1 antisense control constructs did not block cell death. Thus, the increases in IP3R3 may be causally related to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052178043,"CD1 proteins have been implicated as antigen-presenting molecules for T cell-mediated immune responses, but their intracellular localization and trafficking remain uncharacterized. CD1b, a member of this family that presents microbial lipid antigens of exogenous origin, was found to localize to endocytic compartments that included the same specialized subset of endosomes in which major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are proposed to bind endocytosed antigens. Unlike MHC class II molecules, which traffic to antigen-loading endosomal compartments [MHC class II compartments (MIICs)] primarily as a consequence of their association with the invariant chain, localization of CD1b to these compartments was dependent on a tyrosine-based motif in its own cytoplasmic tail."
https://openalex.org/W2064205106,"The SWI/SNF complex participates in the restructuring of chromatin for transcription. The function of the yeast SWI/SNF complex in the remodeling of a nucleosome array has now been analyzed in vitro. Binding of the purified SWI/SNF complex to a nucleosome array disrupted multiple nucleosomes in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent reaction. However, removal of SWI/SNF left a deoxyribonuclease I-hypersensitive site specifically at a nucleosome that was bound by derivatives of the transcription factor Gal4p. Analysis of individual nucleosomes revealed that the SWI/SNF complex catalyzed eviction of histones from the Gal4-bound nucleosomes. Thus, the transient action of the SWI/SNF complex facilitated irreversible disruption of transcription factor-bound nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2072982648,"The molecular mechanisms underlying directed motility of growth cones have not been determined. The role of myosin-V, an unconventional myosin, in growth cone dynamics was examined by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI). CALI of purified chick brain myosin-V absorbed onto nitrocellulose-coated cover slips inhibited the ability of myosin-V to translocate actin filaments. CALI of myosin-V in growth cones of chick dorsal root ganglion neurons resulted in rapid filopodial retraction. The rate of filopodial extension was significantly decreased, whereas the rate of filopodial retraction was not affected, which suggests a specific role for myosin-V in filopodial extension."
https://openalex.org/W2032286197,"An absorption band at 260 nanometers on the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede, identified as the Hartley band of Ozone (O3), was measured with the Hubble Space Telescope. The column abundance of ozone, 4.5 x 10(16) per square centimeter, can be produced by ion impacts or by photochemical equilibrium with previously detected molecular oxygen (O2). An estimated number density ratio of [O3]/[O2] = 10(-4) to 10(-3) requires an atmospheric density orders of magnitude higher than upper limits from spacecraft occultation experiments. Apparently, this O2-O3 ""atmosphere"" is trapped in Ganymede's surface ice, an inference consistent with the shift and broadening of the band compared with the gas-phase O3 band."
https://openalex.org/W1983864122,"Nanometer-sized helium droplets, each containing about 10(4) helium atoms, were used as an inert substrate on which to form previously unobserved, spin-3/2 (quartet state) alkali trimers. Dispersed fluorescence measurements reveal that, upon electronic excitation, the quartet trimers undergo intersystem crossing to the doublet manifold, followed by dissociation of the doublet trimer into an atom and a covalently bound singlet dimer. As shown by this work, aggregates of spin-polarized alkali metals represent ideal species for the optical study of fundamental chemical dynamics processes including nonadiabatic spin conversion, change of bonding nature, and unimolecular dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1972057413,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength may underlie learning and memory in the brain. The induction of LTP occurs in postsynaptic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region but is presynaptic in CA3. LTD is also well characterized in CA1 but not in CA3. Low-frequency stimulation of mouse hippocampal slices caused homosynaptic LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse, which may be induced presynaptically by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Thus, the efficacy of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses can be regulated bidirectionally, which may contribute to neuronal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2022080502,"Phylogenetic analysis with x-ray computed tomography of fossilized and recent crania implicates differential growth of the neocortex in the evolution and development of the mammalian middle ear. In premammalian tetrapods, the middle ear evolved as a chain of bones attached to the mandible and cranium, but in adult mammals the chain is detached from the mandible and lies behind it. The neocortex evolved concurrently with detachment of the chain. In mammalian development the auditory chain arises connected to the mandible but later detaches, recapitulating the phylogenetic transformation. In modern didelphid development, the auditory chain reaches mature size by the third week after birth and is then separated from the jaw and displaced caudally as the neocortex grows for another 9 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2029305793,"The degenerin family of proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans is homologous to subunits of the mammalian amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels. Mutations in nematode degenerins cause cell death, probably because of defects in channel function. Genetic evidence was obtained that the unc-105 gene product represents a degenerin homolog affecting C. elegans muscles and that this putative channel interacts with type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix underlying the muscle cell. This interaction may serve as a mechanism of stretch-activated muscle contraction, and this system could provide a molecular model for the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2143465401,"Ancient Egyptian methods of baking and brewing are investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopy of desiccated bread loaves and beer remains. The results suggest that current conceptions about ancient Egyptian bread and beer making should be modified. Bread was made not only with flour from raw grain, but sometimes also with malt and with yeast. Brewing blended cooked and uncooked malt with water; the mixture was strained free of husk before inoculation with yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2064339093,"The study of many biological processes requires the analysis of three-dimensional (3D) structures that change over time. Optical sectioning techniques can provide 3D data from living specimens; however, when 3D data are collected over a period of time, the quantity of image information produced leads to difficulties in interpretation. A computer-based system is described that permits the analysis and archiving of 3D image data taken over time. The system allows a user to roam through the full range of time points and focal planes in the data set. The user can animate images as an aid to visualization and can append multicolored labels and text notes to identified structures during data analysis. The system provides a valuable tool for the study of embryogenesis and cytoplasmic movements within cells and has considerable potential as an educational tool."
https://openalex.org/W2014901376,"The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were modeled as shallow layers of turbulent fluid overlying a smooth, spherical interior. With only the observed values of radius, rotation rate, average wind velocity, and mean layer thickness as model parameters, bands and jets spontaneously emerged from random initial conditions. The number, width, and amplitude of the jets, as well as the dominance of anticyclonic vortices, are in good agreement with observations for all four planets."
https://openalex.org/W2049671024,"During the inbound pass of the Galileo spacecraft, the magnetometer acquired 1 minute averaged measurements of the magnetic field along the trajectory as the spacecraft flew by Io. A field decrease, of nearly 40 percent of the background jovian field at closest approach to Io, was recorded. Plasma sources alone appear incapable of generating perturbations as large as those observed and an induced source for the observed moment implies an amount of free iron in the mantle much greater than expected. On the other hand, an intrinsic magnetic field of amplitude consistent with dynamo action at Io would explain the observations. It seems plausible that Io, like Earth and Mercury, is a magnetized solid planet."
https://openalex.org/W1965356399,"Theoretical modeling of the dynamics of complexation and decomplexation of guest molecules by container molecules reveals that gating has a critical influence on the ease of formation and stability of host-guest complexes. Hosts equipped with gates can form very stable complexes with a variety of guests under readily achievable conditions. Gating involves conformational processes of the host molecule that alter the size of the portals through which guest molecules pass. ""French door"" and ""sliding door"" mechanisms of gate opening are identified."
https://openalex.org/W1982329355,"Broadband seismometers deployed at Aso volcano in Japan have detected a hydrothermal reservoir 1 to 1.5 kilometers beneath the crater that is continually resonating with periods as long as 15 seconds. When phreatic eruptions are observed, broadband seismograms elucidate a dynamic interplay between the reservoir and discharging flow along the conduit: gradual pressurization and long-period (approximately20 seconds) pulsations of the reservoir during the 100 to 200 seconds before the initiation of the discharge, followed by gradual deflation of the reservoir concurrent with the discharging flow. The hydrothermal reservoir, where water and heat from the deeper magma chamber probably interact, appears to help control the surface activity at Aso volcano."
https://openalex.org/W2040519423,"The successful development of digital radiography depends, to a large extent, on the availability of suitable x-ray photoconductors. The x-ray photoconductive nanocomposites reported here combine the advantages of both inorganic and organic compounds. An inorganic compound was finely dispersed in an organic polymer. The inorganic compound, with its large x-ray absorption efficiency, functioned as the x-ray absorber, and the polymer provided good dielectric properties and ease of thin-film preparation. The preparation procedures and the x-ray photoconductive properties of a specific example, a 50 percent by weight nanocomposite of bismuth triiodide and nylon-11, are discussed in detail."
https://openalex.org/W2044755062,"The development of artificial surfactants for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requires lipid systems that can spread rapidly from solution to the air-water interface. Because hydration-repulsion forces stabilize liposomal bilayers and oppose spreading, liposome systems that undergo geometric rearrangement from the bilayer (lamellar) phase to the hexagonal II (HII) phase could hasten lipid transfer to the air-water interface through unstable transition intermediates. A liposome system containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was designed; the system is stable at 23 degrees C but undergoes transformation to the HII phase as the temperature increases to 37 degrees C. The spreading of lipid from this system to the air-water interface was rapid at 37 degrees C but slow at 23 degrees C. When tested in vivo in a neonatal rabbit model, such systems elicited an onset of action equal to that of native human surfactant. These findings suggest that lipid polymorphic phase behavior may have a crucial role in the effective functioning of pulmonary surfactant."
https://openalex.org/W2052998128,"Crustal temperatures within collisional orogens are anomalously high compared with temperatures at comparable depths in stable continents, which is evidence of thermal processes that are fundamental to orogenesis. These temperatures can be explained by the redistribution of crust enriched in heat-producing elements through the accretion of crust from the down-going plate to the upper plate and surface erosion. With the use of geologically reasonable rates, the model results predict high temperatures (over 600°C) and inverted upper-plate geotherms (about 100°C over 20 kilometers) at shallow depths (20 to 40 kilometers) by 25 to 35 million years after collision. This study emphasizes the interdependence of deformational, surficial, and thermal processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073877300,"Signaling molecules are essential for vertebrate embryonic development. Here, two Xenopus homologs of the Drosophila gene fringe, lunatic Fringe (lFng) and radical Fringe (rFng), were identified and the protein product of lFng further characterized. The messenger RNA of lFng is supplied as a maternal message. Its product is a precursor protein consisting of pre-, pro-, and mature regions. The mature lunatic Fringe protein is secreted extracellularly, and it induced mesodermal tissue formation in animal cap assays. These results indicate that secreted lunatic Fringe can induce mesoderm and reveal that the Fringe proteins are a family of vertebrate signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2055393835,"The 1994 eruption of Rabaul, in Papua New Guinea, involved a small plinian eruption at Vulcan and a vulcanian eruption on the opposite side of the caldera at Tavurvur. Vulcan's ash leachates indicate seawater interaction that is consistent with earlier observations of low sulfur dioxide emissions and the presence of ice crystals in the initial plinian eruption cloud. In contrast, Tavurvur ash leachates indicate no seawater interaction, and later sulfur dioxide emissions remained high despite low-level eruptive activity. Silicic melt inclusions indicate that the andesitic melt contained about 2 weight percent water and negligible carbon dioxide. Mafic melt inclusions in Tavurvur ash have water and carbon dioxide contents that vary systematically over the course of the eruption. The mafic melt inclusions suggest that a mafic dike intruded from below the silicic chamber and provide further evidence that mafic intrusions drive caldera unrest."

Thus, the technology associated with the well-known Paleoindian tradition was not confined to the Americas. The Uptar collection does not compare readily with other Beringian complexes and demonstrates that there is greater diversity in the archaeological record of northeastern Siberia than traditional colonization models imply."

The predominant minerals in the schists become plastic at lower temperatures, and thus at shallower depths, than the minerals in the other basement rocks. The lateral variations in lithology will control the depth extent (and thus the magnitudes) of potential future earthquakes; these depths can be determined from the depth of the current background seismicity."
https://openalex.org/W1999264620,"Ab initio molecular orbital calculations were used to determine the structure and vibrational frequencies of the cyclic glycerol trimer, which represents the region of medium-range ordering in liquid and supercooled glycerol. The calculations reproduced the experimentally observed low-frequency Raman scattering peak (or the ""boson peak"") at approximately50 per centimeter, which suggests that the peak results from the localized collective motions of the cooperatively hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups. The calculations also suggest that the fast relaxation process may result from the translational motion of each glycerol molecule in the cyclic structure. On the basis of these results, a model of the glass transition was developed."
https://openalex.org/W2049307727,"Contrary to the prediction of the Z-scheme model of photosynthesis, experiments demonstrated that mutants of Chlamydomonas containing photosystem II (PSII) but lacking photosystem I (PSI) can grow photoautotrophically with O2 evolution, using atmospheric CO2 as the sole carbon source. Autotrophic photosynthesis by PSI-deficient mutants was stable both under anaerobic conditions and in air (21 percent O2) at an actinic intensity of 200 microeinsteins per square meter per second. This PSII photosynthesis, which was sufficient to support cell development and mobility, may also occur in wild-type green algae and higher plants. The mutants can survive under 2000 microeinsteins per square meter per second with air, although they have less resistance to photoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2036825626,"Gas-liquid scattering experiments provide direct observations of the fate of hydrogen-bonding molecules striking the surfaces of acidic liquids. Collisions of gaseous formic acid with concentrated sulfuric acid show that impinging monomers (HCOOH and DCOOD) scatter inelastically from the interface or become trapped by surface H2SO4. Most trapped DCOOD molecules undergo proton exchange before desorbing from the acid, indicating that gas-surface accommodation almost always leads to reaction with H2SO4 molecules. This proton transfer is not inhibited by dimerization of the formic acid: The dimers readily undergo intramolecular hydrogen bond cleavage and D-H exchange before desorbing from the acid."
