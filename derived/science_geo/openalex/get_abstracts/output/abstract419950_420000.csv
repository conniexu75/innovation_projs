https://openalex.org/W2156339883,"The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide and threatens to shorten lifespan. Impaired insulin action in peripheral tissues is a major pathogenic factor. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue through the GLUT4 (also known as SLC2A4) glucose transporter, and alterations in adipose tissue GLUT4 expression or function regulate systemic insulin sensitivity. Downregulation of human and mouse adipose tissue GLUT4 occurs early in diabetes development. Here we report that adipose tissue GLUT4 regulates the expression of carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP; also known as MLXIPL), a transcriptional regulator of lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose ChREBP is a major determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin sensitivity. We find a new mechanism for glucose regulation of ChREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical ChREBP isoform (ChREBP-α) induces expression of a novel, potent isoform (ChREBP-β) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter. ChREBP-β expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin sensitivity, indicating that it may be an effective target for treating diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2067478074,"The plant hormone auxin regulates virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Auxin acts by binding the F-box protein transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and promotes the degradation of the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) transcriptional repressors. Here we show that efficient auxin binding requires assembly of an auxin co-receptor complex consisting of TIR1 and an Aux/IAA protein. Heterologous experiments in yeast and quantitative IAA binding assays using purified proteins showed that different combinations of TIR1 and Aux/IAA proteins form co-receptor complexes with a wide range of auxin-binding affinities. Auxin affinity seems to be largely determined by the Aux/IAA. As there are 6 TIR1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX proteins (AFBs) and 29 Aux/IAA proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, combinatorial interactions may result in many co-receptors with distinct auxin-sensing properties. We also demonstrate that the AFB5-Aux/IAA co-receptor selectively binds the auxinic herbicide picloram. This co-receptor system broadens the effective concentration range of the hormone and may contribute to the complexity of auxin response."

By positional cloning using a previously characterized rat strain with altered titin mRNA splicing, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding RNA binding motif protein 20 (Rbm20) as the underlying cause of pathological titin isoform expression. The phenotype of Rbm20-deficient rats resembled the pathology seen in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by RBM20 mutations. Deep sequencing of the human and rat cardiac transcriptome revealed an RBM20-dependent regulation of alternative splicing. In addition to titin (TTN), we identified a set of 30 genes with conserved splicing regulation between humans and rats. This network is enriched for genes that have previously been linked to cardiomyopathy, ion homeostasis and sarcomere biology. Our studies emphasize the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in cardiac function and provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of human heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2121950548,"Engineered T cells expressing a tumor antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) have shown promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, the introduced TCR chains can pair with the endogenous TCR chains in T cells, and in mice, these mismatched TCRs can cause a lethal autoimmune reaction. Provasi et al. now show that they can eliminate expression of the endogenous TCR chains using zinc finger nucleases and express only the desired exogenous TCR by lentiviral transduction. The resultant TCR-edited lymphocytes showed tumor specificity without the risk of off-target toxicity. The transfer of high-avidity T cell receptor (TCR) genes isolated from rare tumor-specific lymphocytes into polyclonal T cells is an attractive cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, TCR gene transfer results in competition for surface expression and inappropriate pairing between the exogenous and endogenous TCR chains, resulting in suboptimal activity and potentially harmful unpredicted antigen specificities of the resultant TCRs. We designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that promoted the disruption of endogenous TCR β- and α-chain genes. Lymphocytes treated with ZFNs lacked surface expression of CD3-TCR and expanded with the addition of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. After lentiviral transfer of a TCR specific for the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, these TCR-edited cells expressed the new TCR at high levels, were easily expanded to near purity and were superior at specific antigen recognition compared to donor-matched, unedited TCR-transferred cells. In contrast to unedited TCR-transferred cells, the TCR-edited lymphocytes did not mediate off-target reactivity while maintaining their anti-tumor activity in vivo, thus showing that complete editing of T cell specificity generates tumor-specific lymphocytes with improved biosafety profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2153977062,"Targeting noncatalytic cysteine residues with irreversible acrylamide-based inhibitors is a powerful approach for enhancing pharmacological potency and selectivity. Nevertheless, concerns about off-target modification motivate the development of reversible cysteine-targeting strategies. Here we show that electron-deficient olefins, including acrylamides, can be tuned to react with cysteine thiols in a rapidly reversible manner. Installation of a nitrile group increased the olefins' intrinsic reactivity, but, paradoxically, eliminated the formation of irreversible adducts. Incorporation of these electrophiles into a noncovalent kinase-recognition scaffold produced slowly dissociating, covalent inhibitors of the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase RSK2. A cocrystal structure revealed specific noncovalent interactions that stabilize the complex by positioning the electrophilic carbon near the targeted cysteine. Disruption of these interactions by protein unfolding or proteolysis promoted instantaneous cleavage of the covalent bond. Our results establish a chemistry-based framework for engineering sustained covalent inhibition without accumulating permanently modified proteins and peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2032012444,"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the unique capability of aggressive tumor cells to mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenic networks. In the study we demonstrated that CD133 expression was the highest in triple-negative (TN) breast cancer specimens. Importantly, VM showed statistical correlation with CD133+ expression. The presence of the close relationship between VM and CD133+ expression might be central for TN tumor relapse and progression. The TN breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 cells developed a range of colony morphologies paralleling the holoclone, meroclone and paraclone morphologies produced by normal keratinocytes and other epithelial cancer cell lines when plated at clonal densities. Holoclone cells were capable of forming more colonies on soft agar than meroclone cells and paraclone cells, suggesting that holoclone cells had higher self-renew potential and might harbors cancer stem cells (CSCs) subpopulation. Strikingly, it was holoclone that displayed CD133+ phenotype and formed VM. In addition, holoclone acquired endothelial cell marker vascular endothelial-cadherin expression and upregulated VM mediators matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression. The subpopulation with holoclone morphology, CD133+ phenotype and CSCs characteristics might have the capacity of transdifferentiation and contributed to VM in TN breast cancer. The related molecular pathways may be used as novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis in TN breast carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2036275580,"Lisa Strug and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for meconium ileus in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Conventional genome-wide approaches identified variants in SLC26A9 and SLC6A14 associated with meconium ileus. The authors also performed a hypothesis-driven genome-wide association study (HD-GWAS) that upweighted 3,814 SNPs within 10 kb of 155 genes expressed in the apical plasma membrane. The HD-GWAS identified variants near SLC9A3 associated with meconium ileus. Variants associated with meconium ileus in cystic fibrosis were identified in 3,763 affected individuals by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Five SNPs at two loci near SLC6A14 at Xq23-24 (minimum P = 1.28 × 10−12 at rs3788766) and SLC26A9 at 1q32.1 (minimum P = 9.88 × 10−9 at rs4077468) accounted for ∼5% of phenotypic variability and were replicated in an independent sample of affected individuals (n = 2,372; P = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively). By incorporating the knowledge that disease-causing mutations in CFTR alter electrolyte and fluid flux across surface epithelium into a hypothesis-driven GWAS (GWAS-HD), we identified associations with the same SNPs in SLC6A14 and SLC26A9 and established evidence for the involvement of SNPs in a third solute carrier gene, SLC9A3. In addition, GWAS-HD provided evidence of association between meconium ileus and multiple genes encoding constituents of the apical plasma membrane where CFTR resides (P = 0.0002; testing of 155 apical membrane genes jointly and in replication, P = 0.022). These findings suggest that modulating activities of apical membrane constituents could complement current therapeutic paradigms for cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2158225056,"Ataxia telangiectasia is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutation of the Atm gene. Here we report that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency causes nuclear accumulation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in neurons and promotes neurodegeneration. Nuclear HDAC4 binds to chromatin, as well as to myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), leading to histone deacetylation and altered neuronal gene expression. Blocking either HDAC4 activity or its nuclear accumulation blunts these neurodegenerative changes and rescues several behavioral abnormalities of ATM-deficient mice. Full rescue of the neurodegeneration, however, also requires the presence of HDAC4 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the ataxia telangiectasia phenotype results both from a loss of cytoplasmic HDAC4 as well as its nuclear accumulation. To remain cytoplasmic, HDAC4 must be phosphorylated. The activity of the HDAC4 phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is downregulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation. In ATM deficiency, enhanced PP2A activity leads to HDAC4 dephosphorylation and the nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. Our results define a crucial role of the cellular localization of HDAC4 in the events leading to ataxia telangiectasia neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2087753439,"Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were used to test the hypothesis that stomach content analysis has systematically overlooked the consumption of gelatinous zooplankton by pelagic mesopredators and apex predators. The results strongly supported a major role of gelatinous plankton in the diet of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), leerfish (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), blue butterfish (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely. In conclusion, the jellyvorous guild in the Mediterranean integrates two specialists (ocean sunfish and loggerhead sea turtles in the oceanic stage) and several opportunists (bluefin tuna, little tunny, spearfish, swordfish and, perhaps, blue butterfish), most of them with shrinking populations due to overfishing."
https://openalex.org/W2074536099,"UV-sensitive syndrome (UV(S)S) is a genodermatosis characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity without skin carcinoma. Despite mild clinical features, cells from individuals with UV(S)S, like Cockayne syndrome cells, are very UV sensitive and are deficient in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair (TC-NER), which removes DNA damage in actively transcribed genes. Three of the seven known UV(S)S cases carry mutations in the Cockayne syndrome genes ERCC8 or ERCC6 (also known as CSA and CSB, respectively). The remaining four individuals with UVSS , one of whom is described for the first time here, formed a separate UV(S)S-A complementation group; however, the responsible gene was unknown. Using exome sequencing, we determine that mutations in the UVSSA gene (formerly known as KIAA1530) cause UV(S)S-A. The UVSSA protein interacts with TC-NER machinery and stabilizes the ERCC6 complex; it also facilitates ubiquitination of RNA polymerase IIo stalled at DNA damage sites. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the processing of stalled RNA polymerase and explain the different clinical features across these TC-NER–deficient disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1982833706,"Dyslipidemia has been associated with an increased risk for developing cancer. However, the implicated mechanisms are largely unknown. To explore the role of dyslipidemia in breast cancer growth and metastasis, we used the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice (ApoE(-/-)), which exhibit marked dyslipidemia, with elevated circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the setting of normal glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Non-metastatic Met-1 and metastatic Mvt-1 mammary cancer cells derived from MMTV-PyVmT/FVB-N transgenic mice and c-Myc/vegf tumor explants respectively, were injected into the mammary fat pad of ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (WT) females consuming a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet and tumor growth was evaluated. ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited increased tumor growth and displayed a greater number of spontaneous metastases to the lungs. Furthermore, intravenous injection of Mvt-1 cells resulted in a greater number of pulmonary metastases in the lungs of ApoE(-/-) mice compared with WT controls. To unravel the molecular mechanism involved in enhanced tumor growth in ApoE(-/-) mice, we studied the response of Mvt-1 cells to cholesterol in vitro. We found that cholesterol increased Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Mvt-1 cells as well as cellular proliferation, whereas cholesterol depletion in the cell membrane abrogated Akt(S473) phosphorylation induced by exogenously added cholesterol. Furthermore, in vivo administration of BKM120, a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), alleviated dyslipidemia-induced tumor growth and metastasis in Mvt-1 model with a concomitant decrease in PI3K/Akt signaling. Collectively, we suggest that the hypercholesterolemic milieu in the ApoE(-/-) mice is a favorable setting for mammary tumor growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2118325816,"The Trithorax and Polycomb groups of chromatin regulators are critical for cell-lineage specification during normal development; functions that often become deregulated during tumorigenesis. As an example, oncogenic fusions of the Trithorax-related protein mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) can initiate aggressive leukemias by altering the transcriptional circuitry governing hematopoietic cell differentiation, a process that requires multiple epigenetic pathways to implement. Here we used shRNA screening to identify chromatin regulators uniquely required in a mouse model of MLL-fusion acute myeloid leukemia, which revealed a role for the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in maintenance of this disease. shRNA-mediated suppression of PRC2 subunits Eed, Suz12 or Ezh1/Ezh2 led to proliferation arrest and differentiation of leukemia cells, with a minimal impact on growth of several non-transformed hematopoietic cell lines. The requirement for PRC2 in leukemia is partly because of its role in direct transcriptional repression of genes that limit the self-renewal potential of hematopoietic cells, including Cdkn2a. In addition to implicating a role for PRC2 in the pathogenesis of MLL-fusion leukemia, our results suggest, more generally, that Trithorax and Polycomb group proteins can cooperate with one another to maintain aberrant lineage programs in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2015467014,"Gamma oscillations in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA3 show variable coherence in vivo, but the mechanisms and relevance for information flow are unknown. We found that carbachol-induced oscillations in rat CA3 have biphasic phase-response curves, consistent with the ability to couple with oscillations in afferent projections. Differences in response to stimulation of either the intrinsic feedback circuit or the dentate gyrus were well described by varying an impulse vector in a two-dimensional dynamical system, representing the relative input to excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Responses to sinusoidally modulated optogenetic stimulation confirmed that the CA3 network oscillation can entrain to periodic inputs, with a steep dependence of entrainment phase on input frequency. CA3 oscillations are therefore suited to coupling with oscillations in the dentate gyrus over a broad range of frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2078046017,"Multiple serine proteases exert proinflammatory actions by signaling through protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) on the cell surface. Although inhibitors of individual proteases are anti-inflammatory, we sought to discover whether the first potent antagonist of their common target PAR2 might be beneficial in treating chronic arthritis-like inflammatory disease. Using a fluorescence assay, a novel compound, GB88, was shown to antagonize PAR2-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release in human monocyte-derived macrophages, being 1000 times more potent than a control compound, ENMD-1068 (IC(50) 1.6 ± 0.5 μM vs. 1.2 ± 0.4 mM, respectively). In Wistar rats, GB88 was orally bioavailable (F=55%, T(max) 4 h, C(max) 1.7 μM, 10 mg/kg). GB88 inhibited the acute paw edema induced in Wistar rats by intraplantar λ-carrageenan or PAR2 agonists 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2) or mast cell β-tryptase, without inhibiting proteolytic activity of tryptase in vitro. In the chronic collagen-induced model of arthritis in rats, GB88 (10 mg/kg) was disease modifying and ameliorated pathological and histopathological changes (edema, pannus formation, synovial hyperplasia, collagen degradation, macrophage invasion, mast cell degranulation) compared to untreated arthritic controls. The results suggest that an orally active PAR2 antagonist is effective in treating chronic arthritis in rats through inhibiting macrophage infiltration, mast cell degranulation, and β-tryptase-PAR2 signaling in joint inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2037838998,"Switchgrass has increasingly been recognized as a dedicated biofuel crop for its broad adaptation to marginal lands and high biomass. However, little is known about the basic biology and the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in switchgrass, particularly under stress conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of salt and drought stress on switchgrass germination, growth and the expression of small regulatory RNAs. The results indicate that salt stress had a gradual but significant negative effect on switchgrass growth and development. The germination rate was significantly decreased from 82% for control to 36% under 1% NaCl treatment. However, drought stress had little effect on the germination rate but had a significant effect on the growth of switchgrass under the severest salinity stress. Both salt and drought stresses altered the expression pattern of miRNAs in a dose-dependent manner. However, each miRNA responded to drought stress in a different pattern. Salt and drought stress changed the expression level of miRNAs mainly from 0.9-fold up-regulation to 0.7-fold down-regulation. miRNAs were less sensitive to drought treatment than salinity treatment, as evidenced by the narrow fold change in expression levels. Although the range of change in expression level of miRNAs was similar under salt and drought stress, no miRNAs displayed significant change in expression level under all tested salt conditions. Two miRNAs, miR156 and miR162, showed significantly change in expression level under high drought stress. This suggests that miR156 and miR162 may attribute to the adaption of switchgrass to drought stress and are good candidates for improving switchgrass as a biofuel crop by transgenic technology."
https://openalex.org/W2049212551,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are expressed at high levels in many cancers and therefore represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we report for the first time that the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) mimetic BV6 sensitizes glioblastoma cells toward Temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of glioblastoma. BV6 and TMZ synergistically reduce cell viability and trigger apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (combination index <0.4-0.8), which is accompanied by increased loss of mitochondrial-membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms reveals that BV6 causes rapid degradation of cIAP1, leading to stabilization of NF-κB-inducing kinase and NF-κB activation. BV6-stimulated NF-κB activation is critically required for sensitization toward TMZ, as inhibition of NF-κB by overexpression of the mutant IκBα super-repressor profoundly reduces loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activation and apoptosis. Of note, BV6-mediated sensitization to TMZ is not associated with increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production. Also, TNFα, CD95 or TRAIL-blocking antibodies or knockdown of TNFR1 have no or little effect on combination treatment-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, BV6 and TMZ cooperate to trigger the formation of a RIP1 (receptor activating protein 1)/caspase-8/FADD complex. Knockdown of RIP1 by small interfering RNA significantly reduces BV6- and TMZ-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis, showing that RIP1 is necessary for apoptosis induction. By demonstrating that BV6 primes glioblastoma cells for TMZ in a NF-κB- and RIP1-dependent manner, these findings build the rationale for further (pre)clinical development of Smac mimetics in combination with TMZ."
https://openalex.org/W1974384503,"Cyclotides are a new class of plant biologics that display a diverse range of bioactivities with therapeutic potentials. They possess an unusual end-to-end cyclic backbone combined with a cystine knot arrangement, making them exceptionally stable to heat, chemical and enzymatic degradation. Currently, >200 cyclotides have been discovered but only three naturally occurring linear variants (also known as uncyclotides) have been isolated. In this study, we report the discovery of 18 novel peptides, chassatides C1 to C18, composed of 14 new cyclotides and four uncyclotides from Chassalia chartacea (Rubiaceae family). Thus far, this is the largest number of uncyclotides being reported in a single species. Activity testing showed that the uncyclotides not only retain the effectiveness but also are the most potent chassatides in the assays for antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and hemolytic activities. Genetic characterization of novel chassatides revealed that they have the shortest precursors of all known cyclotides hitherto isolated, which represents a new class of cyclotide precursors. This is the first report of cyclotide genes in a second genus, the Chassalia, other than the Hedyotis (Oldenlandia) of the Rubiaceae family. In addition, we also report the characterization of two Met-oxidized derivatives of chassatides C2 and C11. The oxidation of Met residue causes loss of bioactivities, strengthening the importance of the hydrophobic patch for membrane interaction."

Although it is unclear in most cases whether +TIP phosphorylation regulates microtubule plus-end-tracking in cells, we recently demonstrated that multisite phosphorylation of the EB1 binding region of CLASP2 by GSK3 inhibits EB1 and microtubule binding (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3β phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An intriguingly similar regulation of microtubule binding by GSK3 was later described for the spectraplakin ACF7 (12.Wu X. Shen Q.T. Oristian D.S. Lu C.P. Zheng Q. Wang H.W. Fuchs E. Skin stem cells orchestrate directional migration by regulating microtubule-ACF7 connections through GSK3β.Cell. 2011; 144: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both CLASP2 and ACF7 are involved in pathways stabilizing microtubules at the leading edge of migrating cells. GSK3α and -β play essential roles in intracellular signaling, neuronal development, regulation of cell migration, cell division, and protein degradation pathways and are responsible for multisite phosphorylation of a large number of proteins (15.Hur E.M. Zhou F.Q. GSK3 signaling in neural development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16.Jope R.S. Yuskaitis C.J. Beurel E. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Inflammation, diseases, and therapeutics.Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 577-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Despite this central importance of GSK3 and its involvement in numerous disease processes, the molecular mechanisms by which multisite phosphorylation regulates protein functions are not well understood. Highly dynamic electrostatic interactions between disordered protein regions are likely central to many intracellular processes (17.Uversky V.N.

Recognit. 2010; 23: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar), and here we use CLASP2 and EB1 as a model system to investigate how intrinsically disordered proteins can be regulated by multisite phosphorylation. pEGFP-CLASP2-(497–794) was made by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment between EcoRI and SalI restriction sites in pEGFP-C3. Point mutations to inactivate SXIP motifs and phosphorylation sites were generated by QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). SXIP mutations in non-phosphorylatable CLASP2 constructs were first generated in published pEGFP-CLASP2-(497–1238) constructs (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3β phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pEGFP-C3 using ScaI and SalI restriction sites. All CLASP2 residue numbering is based on NCBI reference sequence NP_055912.2. For bacterial expression, His6-CLASP2-(497–794) was subcloned into pHAT2 between EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. pHAT2-EB1 was constructed by amplifying the EB1 open reading frame from pEGFP-EB1 and cloned in pHAT2 between NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using standard protocols. Briefly, after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, proteins were expressed for 4–6 h, cell lysates were prepared using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics), and proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on TALON resin (Clontech) in 25 mm HEPES, 400 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin), and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For the in vitro microtubule plus-end-tracking assay, double-sided tape flow chambers using poly-l-lysine-PEG-passivated slides and biotin-PEG-functionalized coverslips were prepared exactly as described (19.Bieling P. Telley I.A. Hentrich C. Piehler J. Surrey T.

Brightly Alexa-568-labeled, biotinylated guanylyl-(α,β)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP)-stabilized microtubule seeds prepared as described (20.Telley I.A. Bieling P. Surrey T.

The chambers were sealed with VaLaP (1:1:1, vaseline:lanoline:paraffin) and imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy at 37 °C. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For imaging, HeLa cells were grown on 35-mm, #1.5 thickness glass-bottom dishes (Mattek), and EGFP-CLASP2 constructs were introduced by transfection with FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were arrested in metaphase either with 5 μm S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC) (Tocris Bioscience) or 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem). The CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (EMD Biosciences) was added at 9 μm. For biochemistry, STLC-arrested cells were harvested by mitotic shake-off, and metabolic labeling was performed as described (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3β phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Live cell spinning disk confocal microscopy was performed as described (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3β phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of EGFP-CLASP2-(497–794) constructs along microtubule plus ends was measured using the “Intensity Profile” function in NIS Elements (Nikon) for three microtubules per cell keeping illumination, exposure, and measurement tool settings constant. Intensity profiles were corrected for local background by subtracting an intensity profile adjacent to the measured microtubule end and normalized for expression level by dividing the background-corrected profile by the average of the background intensity profile minus camera offset. These normalized profiles were fitted with an exponentially modified Gaussian function (22.Di Marco V.B. Bombi G.G. Mathematical functions for the representation of chromatographic peaks.J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 931: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), y(x)=a2τexp(σ22τ2−x−x0τ){1−erf[12(στ−x−x0σ)]}(Eq. 1) Profiles from 10 cells were aligned to the maximum of the fit and averaged. Least square curve-fitting was done using the Solver function in Microsoft Excel. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of human EB1 bound to microtubule actin crosslinking factor (MACF) peptides (PBD ID 3gjo) was used as the template to build the homology model of EB1-bound CLASP2 peptides with in-house software (Protein Localization Optimization Program PLOP; distributed as Prime by Schrodinger, LLC) (23.Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. A hierarchical approach to all-atom protein loop prediction.Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) by aligning SXIP motifs in CLASP2 and MACF. The N and C termini of the CLASP2 peptides were capped to neutralize charges. The final model was energy-minimized by a Truncated Newton method (24.Zhu K. Shirts M.R. Friesner R.A. Jacobson M.P. Multiscale optimization of a truncated Newton minimization algorithm and application to proteins and protein-ligand complexes.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2007; 3: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ionizable groups were assumed to have model compound-like pKa values. Each model was placed in an orthorhombic water box with a minimum of 10 Å from any protein heavy atom to the edge of the box. Counterions were added to make the system electrically neutral, and NaCl concentration was set to 0.1 m. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the Desmond simulation package (D.E. Shaw Research) (25.Shivakumar D. Williams J. Wu Y.J. Damm W. Shelley J. Sherman W. Prediction of absolute solvation free energies using molecular dynamics free energy perturbation and the OPLS force field.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010; 6: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The OPLS_2005 forcefield (26.Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. Development and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field on conformational energetics and properties of organic liquids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10687) Google Scholar) was used for protein, and the TIP3P model was used for waters (27.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926Crossref Scopus (30049) Google Scholar). Partial charges on the phosphate groups were as follows: +1.91 (phosphorus), −0.76 (ester oxygen), and −1.11 (acidic oxygens). A two-stage approach was used to energy-minimize the simulation systems, with a steepest-descent algorithm followed by a conjugate gradient method with the solute restrained. In the first stage, the protein complex was fixed, and only the water and ions were energy-minimized. In the second stage, the entire system was energy-minimized. The minimization was then repeated without restraints on the solute. Long-range electrostatic forces were treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald method (28.Darden T.A. York D.M. Pedersen L.G. Particle mesh Ewald: An log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089Crossref Scopus (20950) Google Scholar), subject to a 9 Å cutoff. For all simulations, the SHAKE algorithm (29.Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints. Molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1976; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16972) Google Scholar) was used to constrain hydrogen-heavy atom bonds. Equilibration was accomplished in four stages. First, the system was simulated in the canonical (NVT) ensemble for 12 ps at a temperature of 10 K with a fast temperature relaxation constant and non-hydrogen solute atoms restrained. Second, the system was simulated in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble for 12 ps at 10 K and 1 atm with a fast temperature relaxation constant, a slow pressure relaxation constant, and non-hydrogen atoms restrained. Next, the temperature was increased to 300 K, and the system was simulated for 24 ps. Finally, the system was simulated for 24 ps at 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm with a fast temperature relaxation constant and a normal pressure relaxation constant. For production molecular dynamics, the system was simulated for 20 ns with a 2-fs time step. Independent simulations (at 300 K and 1 atm) were performed with different initial velocities for each system. DELPHI, which solves the Poission-Boltzmann equation by finite difference methods (30.Nicholls A. Honig B. A rapid finite difference algorithm, utilizing successive over-relaxation to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), was employed to calculate the electrostatic potential of the system at different points in the trajectories of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated states. Interior dielectric was set at 4, and exterior dielectric was set at 80.0. A box size of 300 Å was chosen in which the molecule occupied 50% of the box volume. Boundary conditions were set to “coulombic,” wherein the boundary is approximated by the sum of Debye-Huckel potentials of all the charges. Scaling was set to 2 grids/Å. EB1 binding of N-terminally fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled CLASP2 peptides (Biomatik) was monitored by the increase in fluorescence polarization upon titration of concentrated EB1 protein. The assay was performed in 384-well plates containing 10 nm concentrations of labeled peptide in each well in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm (or 250 mm) NaCl, and 2 mm DTT at room temperature. 0.01 mg/ml BSA was added to minimize nonspecific binding. Fluorescence polarization was measured using an Analyst HT Fluorometer (Molecular Devices) with 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission, and data were fit to the binding equation, y(x)=b0+(bmax−b0)xKd1+xKd(Eq. 2) Peptides were dissolved to a final concentration of 600 μm in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% D2O. 500 μl were placed in Wilmad 535 round-bottom tubes (Wilmad). One-dimensional spectra were acquired at 25 °C with between 500 and 1000 transients on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer with broadband cryoprobe located in the UCSF NMR facility at Mission Bay. pH was adjusted with 1 n HCl, and NaOH added in 1-μl aliquots at room temperature and measured using a custom NMR glass combination electrode (Mettler Toledo). 31P spectra were referenced indirectly to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (31.Maurer T. Kalbitzer H.R. Indirect Referencing of 31P and 19F NMR Spectra.J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 113: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant human cycB/CDK1 (PV3292), cycA/CDK2 (PV3267), and p25/CDK5 (PV4676) with specific activities of 1.4, 1.8, and 8.4 μmol/min/mg were from Invitrogen. cycD1/CDK4 (7530) with a specific activity 0.154 μmol/min/mg was obtained from Cell Signaling. In vitro kinase reactions were performed with 5 μg of CLASP2-(497–794), 50 ng of CDKs, 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEG502A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35 at 30 °C. For autoradiography, 20-μl aliquots were removed after 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (161-0737, Bio-Rad). Autoradiographs were quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). For progress curve analysis, 10 μl of the kinase reaction were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose squares (20-134, Millipore), and samples were washed and quantified in a scintillation counter as described (32.Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H.J. Cohen P. Assay of protein kinases using radiolabeled ATP. A protocol.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For analysis of priming-dependent GSK3β phosphorylation, 100 μm CLASP2 peptides were phosphorylated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithioerythritol, 4 mm ATP, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) with a 1:1000 molar ratio of GSK3β (New England Biolabs). The reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 50% methanol, subsequently diluted 1:10 with 50% methanol and 1% formic acid, and applied to an LCQ advantage electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectra were analyzed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and charge states were deconvolved using MagTran software (33.Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. A universal algorithm for fast and automated charge state deconvolution of electrospray mass-to-charge ratio spectra.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The central, disordered region of vertebrate CLASP proteins contains two partially conserved SXIP sequence motifs that are required to bind to EB1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Although it has been shown that SXIP motifs in other +TIPs are sufficient to mediate plus-end-tracking in the presence of EB1 (7.Honnappa S. Gouveia S.M. Weisbrich A. Damberger F.F. Bhavesh N.S. Jawhari H. Grigoriev I. van Rijssel F.J. Buey R.M. Lawera A. Jelesarov I. Winkler F.K. Wüthrich K. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. An EB1 binding motif acts as a microtubule tip localization signal.Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), this has not been directly demonstrated for CLASPs. We, therefore, reconstituted plus-end-tracking of the central CLASP2 domain using an in vitro assay in which dynamic microtubules are polymerized from biotinylated GMPCPP microtubule seeds (19.Bieling P. Telley I.A. Hentrich C. Piehler J. Surrey T. Fluorescence microscopy assays on chemically functionalized surfaces for quantitative imaging of microtubule, motor, and +TIP dynamics.Methods Cell Biol. 2010; 95: 555-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with published in vitro microtubule binding data of the central CLASP2 domain (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), purified, recombinant EGFP-tagged CLASP2-(497–794) bound weakly along microtubules in this assay. In the presence of EB1 protein, EGFP-CLASP2-(497–794) accumulated at growing microtubule plus ends and rapidly dissociated from microtubule ends when microtubules paused or transitioned to shortening (Fig. 1, C and D; supplemental Video 1). In contrast, we observed no accumulation at growing microtubule ends without EB1 or with EGFP-CLASP2-(497–794) protein in which both SXIP motifs were mutated to SXNN (data not shown). Thus, EB1 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate CLASP2 plus-end-tracking. In addition to the SXIP motif, less well characterized electrostatic interactions of +TIPs with EB1 contribute to EB1 binding and EB1-mediated plus-end-tracking (7.Honnappa S. Gouveia S.M. Weisbrich A. Damberger F.F. Bhavesh N.S. Jawhari H. Grigoriev I. van Rijssel F.J. Buey R.M. Lawera A. Jelesarov I. Winkler F.K. Wüthrich K. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. An EB1 binding motif acts as a microtubule tip localization signal.Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). CLASP SXIP motifs are embedded in an intrinsically disordered, highly positively charged, serine- and arginine-rich region that is highly conserved across species (Fig. 1, A and B). Each SXIP motif is C-terminally flanked by conserved GSK3 phosphorylation sites that negatively regulate microtubule binding (9.Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3β phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation may also directly modulate the interaction with EB1. To determine the relative contribution of phosphorylation of these two EB1 binding modules to the regulation of CLASP2 plus-end-tracking in cells, we quantitatively analyzed the intracellular localization of t"
https://openalex.org/W2067945376,"Although people are generally interested in how the brain functions, neuroscience education for the public is hampered by a lack of low cost and engaging teaching materials. To address this, we developed an open-source tool, the SpikerBox, which is appropriate for use in middle/high school educational programs and by amateurs. This device can be used in easy experiments in which students insert sewing pins into the leg of a cockroach, or other invertebrate, to amplify and listen to the electrical activity of neurons. With the cockroach leg preparation, students can hear and see (using a smartphone oscilloscope app we have developed) the dramatic changes in activity caused by touching the mechanosensitive barbs. Students can also experiment with other manipulations such as temperature, drugs, and microstimulation that affect the neural activity. We include teaching guides and other resources in the supplemental materials. These hands-on lessons with the SpikerBox have proven to be effective in teaching basic neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2116509746,"The infiltration of glioma cells into adjacent tissue is one of the major obstacles in the therapeutic management of malignant brain tumours, in most cases precluding complete surgical resection. Consequently, malignant glioma patients almost invariably experience tumour recurrences. Within the brain, glioma cells migrate rapidly either amoeboidly or mesenchymally to invade surrounding structures, in dependence on the extracellular environment. In addition, radiotherapy, frequently applied as adjuvant therapeutic modality, may enhance tumour cell mobility. Here, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Mer (MerTK) is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that this is accompanied with increased invasive potential. MerTK expression is maintained in primary GBM-derived tumour spheres under stem cell culture conditions but diminishes significantly in serum-containing cultures with concomitant downregulation of Nestin and Sox2. Depletion of MerTK disrupts the rounded morphology of glioma cells and decreases their invasive capacity. Furthermore, the expression and phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 are strongly associated with MerTK activity, indicating that the effect of MerTK on glioma cell invasion is mediated by actomyosin contractility. Finally, DNA damage robustly triggers the upregulation and phosphorylation of MerTK, which protects cells from apoptosis. This effect is strongly impaired upon MerTK depletion or overexpression of an inactive MerTK mutant. Collectively, our data suggests that MerTK is a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of the malignant gliomas."

Increasing evidence indicates that LIN28A functions as an oncogene promoting cancer cell growth. However, little is known about its molecular mechanism of cell cycle regulation in cancer. Using tissue microarrays, we found that strong LIN28A expression was reactivated in about 10% (7.1–17.1%) of epithelial tumors (six tumor types, n = 369). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that LIN28A promotes cell cycle progression in cancer cells.

Furthermore, the ability of LIN28A to stimulate translation of LIN28A-binding mRNAs, such as CDK2, was validated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, using a combined gene expression microarray and bioinformatics approach, we found that LIN28A also regulates CCND1 and CDC25A expression and that this is mediated by inhibiting the biogenesis of let-7 miRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2023874666,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) produces high quantities of subviral surface antigen particles (HBsAg) which circulate in the blood outnumbering virions of about 1\103–6 times. In individuals coinfected with the defective hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) the small HDV-RNA-genome and Delta antigen circulate as ribonucleoprotein complexes within HBsAg subviral particles. We addressed the question whether subviral HBsAg particles may carry in the same way cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) which are released into the bloodstream within different subcellular forms such as exosomes and microvescicles. Circulating HBsAg particles were isolated from sera of 11 HBsAg carriers by selective immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-HBs-IgG, total RNA was extracted and human miRNAs were screened by TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR Arrays. Thirty-nine human miRNAs were found to be significantly associated with the immunoprecipitated HBsAg, as determined by both comparative DDCT analysis and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, p<0.05) with respect to controls. Moreover immunoprecipitated HBsAg particles contained Ago2 protein that could be revealed in ELISA only after 0.5% NP40. HBsAg associated miRNAs were liver-specific (most frequent = miR-27a, miR-30b, miR-122, miR-126 and miR-145) as well as immune regulatory (most frequent = miR-106b and miR-223). Computationally predicted target genes of HBsAg-associated miRNAs highlighted molecular pathways dealing with host-pathogen The finding that HBsAg particles carry selective pools of hepatocellular miRNAs opens new avenues of research to disentangle the complex interactions between host and HBV and provides a non invasive tool to study the physiopathology of liver epigenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2027917427,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, the 43 S ribosomal pre-initiation complex is recruited to the 5′-end of an mRNA through its interaction with the 7-methylguanosine cap, and it subsequently scans along the mRNA to locate the start codon. Both mRNA recruitment and scanning require the removal of secondary structure within the mRNA. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A is an essential component of the translational machinery thought to participate in the clearing of secondary structural elements in the 5′-untranslated regions of mRNAs. eIF4A is part of the 5′-7-methylguanosine cap-binding complex, eIF4F, along with eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, and the scaffolding protein eIF4G. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4F has a strong preference for unwinding an RNA duplex with a single-stranded 5′-overhang versus the same duplex with a 3′-overhang or without an overhang. In contrast, eIF4A on its own has little RNA substrate specificity. Using a series of deletion constructs of eIF4G, we demonstrate that its three previously elucidated RNA binding domains work together to provide eIF4F with its 5′-end specificity, both by promoting unwinding of substrates with 5′-overhangs and inhibiting unwinding of substrates with 3′-overhangs. Our data suggest that the RNA binding domains of eIF4G provide the S. cerevisiae eIF4F complex with a second mechanism, in addition to the eIF4E-cap interaction, for directing the binding of pre-initiation complexes to the 5′-ends of mRNAs and for biasing scanning in the 5′ to 3′ direction.

Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a complex process involving more than a dozen initiation factors. It begins with the binding of a ternary complex composed of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi), and GTP to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 43 S pre-initiation complex (PIC). 2The abbreviations used are: PICpre-initiation complexntnucleotidePABPpoly(A)-binding proteinsssingle-strandedTAMRA5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. This process is promoted by eIF1, -1A, and -3. The 43 S PIC is then thought to be recruited to the 5′-end of the mRNA with the help of eIF3, -4F, and -4B and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and to then move along the mRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction to locate the start codon (1Lorsch J.R.

The mammalian protein exists in three isoforms: eIF4AI, eIF4AII, and eIF4AIII (9Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H.

The crystal structure of yeast eIF4A revealed that the protein is dumbbell shaped, with N- and C-terminal domains connected by a flexible 11-residue linker (11Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B.

These studies revealed that eIF4G contacts both the N- and C-terminal RecA domains of eIF4A, fixing them in space such that the residues from each domain involved in ATP binding/hydrolysis and RNA binding now face each other, poised for catalysis (12Oberer M.

Simultaneous binding of eIF4E to the mRNA cap and eIF4G is thought to direct the 43 S complex to the 5′-end of the mRNA via interactions between eIF4G and components in the PIC. However, the mechanisms through which eIF4F facilitates binding of the PIC to the 5′-end of the mRNA remain obscure. In this study, we have biochemically characterized yeast eIF4A and the eIF4F complex. Our results show that, unlike its human ortholog, yeast eIF4F has a distinct preference for unwinding RNA duplexes with 5′-overhangs. The RNA-binding sites of eIF4G confer this specificity for duplexes with 5′-overhangs both by enhancing their unwinding and by suppressing the unwinding of duplexes with 3′-overhangs. Our data indicate that this intrinsic bias toward interacting with the 5′-end of mRNA substrates is independent of the presence of the 5′-cap and may serve as an additional mechanism to ensure that 43 S PIC loading takes place at the 5′-end of mRNAs. In addition, this intrinsic directionality of unwinding by the eIF4F complex could play a role in ribosomal scanning and location of the initiation codon. eIF4A, eIF4A-Rh (eIF4A labeled with TAMRA), eIF4E·eIF4G, and deletion mutants of eIF4G were purified as described previously (19Acker M.G.

DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (Coralville, IA) and purified by PAGE in 8 m urea. The RNA oligonucleotides were either ordered from Thermo (formerly Dharmacon; Table 1) or transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (19Acker M.G. Kolitz S.E. Mitchell S.F. Nanda J.S. Lorsch J.R. Reconstitution of yeast translation initiation.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 430: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The purity of the RNA was checked by end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the enzyme T4-polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and running on a 20% polyacrylamide (19:1) 8 m urea gel. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined from absorbance at 260 nm using their calculated extinction coefficients.TABLE 1RNA substratesSequenceName5′-GGCUGUAACU-3′ds103′-N6CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GGCUGUAACUAAAUGAGAGCCAAGUGGAGAAAGAAGAGAA-3′3′-30-nt-ds103′-N6CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GGAGACCACAUCGAUUCAAUCUUCCGAAAUCGGCUGUAACU-3′5′-30-nt-ds103′-N6CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GGCUGUAACUAAACUAGACGAAAGU-3′3′-15-nt-ds103′-CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GAACUAGACGAAAGUGGCUGUAACU-3′5′-15-nt-ds103′-CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GGCUGUAACUCUAAAGCCUUCUAACUUAGCUACACCAGAGG-3′3′-5 seq-30-nt-ds103′-N6CCGACAUUGA-5′5′-GGCUGUAACUUUCAAUCGAAAUGAGAGCCAAGUGGAGAAAGAAGAGAA-3′3′-30-nt-ss10–105′-AGTTACAGCCCN6–3′ss10 DNA5′-GGAAUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUAUGCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUC-Fl-3′75.1-Fl mRNA5′-GUUGCGAUUGAAUCN6–3′ss14-C6-NH2 RNA Open table in a new tab Three different unwinding substrates were used in this study (Table 1). The sequence of the 10-bp duplex region was designed to possess a GC content of ∼50% (Tm = 48 °C under the reaction conditions) to ensure stable base-pairing between the two strands. The sequence of the 3′- and the 5′-overhangs were derived from a naturally occurring mRNA for the ribosomal protein L41A (RPL41A). The duplexes were generated by heating the two strands to 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 4 °C. The extent of base-pairing was checked by 5′-end-labeling one of the strands with [γ-32P]phosphate, annealing the two strands, and analyzing by native 22% (19:1) TBE-PAGE. All experiments discussed in this study were carried out in “Recon Buffer” containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 3 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), and 100 mm KOAc, pH 7.4, at 26 °C unless specified otherwise. In all assays requiring ATP (or its analogs), it was added with a stoichiometric amount of MgCl2 (i.e. as ATP·Mg2+). The 14-mer RNA (or the 10-mer DNA) oligonucleotide containing a C6-NH2 at the 3′-end (Table 1) was mixed with TAMRA-SE (Invitrogen) in the ratio of 1:10 in 0.1 m sodium tetraborate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was carried out at room temperature overnight. The free dye was separated from the labeled oligonucleotide using Bio-Gel-P6 (Bio-Rad) spin columns. The efficiency of labeling and the concentration of the labeled oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients of the oligonucleotides and free dye. Two different fluorescence-based techniques were used to measure the equilibrium binding constant (Kd) for RNA, depending on the protein in question. The Kd value for eIF4E·eIF4G binding to single-stranded (ss) RNA was measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled ssRNA upon protein binding. The Kd value for eIF4A binding to single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA was measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity upon protein binding. In these experiments, 30 nm 75.1-Fl (Table 1) mRNA was titrated against increasing concentration of eIF4A or eIF4E·eIF4G. The fluorophore was excited at 490 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 515 nm. Protein binding to ssRNA resulted in an increase in fluorescence anisotropy, with little or no change in fluorescence intensity. The ratio of the change in anisotropy (r − r0) to the maximal change (rmax) (fraction bound) was plotted against the protein concentration to obtain the RNA binding curves for each protein. The data were then fit to a quadratic function given by Equation 1, y=(Kd+Et+Lt)−(Kd+Et+Lt)2−4(Et⋅Lt)2(Eq. 1) where Kd is the equilibrium binding constant; Et is the total protein (eIF4A) concentration, and Lt is the total ligand (RNA) concentration. Binding of eIF4A and eIF4E·eIF4G to the 75.1-Fl ssRNA was shown to have 1:1 stoichiometry (see below). In the experiment measuring the stoichiometry of eIF4A binding to ssRNA, 5 μm 75.1-Fl (Table 1) mRNA was titrated against increasing concentration of eIF4A. Protein binding to ssRNA was monitored using fluorescence anisotropy, as described above. The fraction of ssRNA bound was plotted as a function of protein concentration, and the data were fit to Equation 1. The point of inflection of the binding curve indicates the stoichiometry of binding. In these experiments, 5 nm ss14-C6-NH2 RNA or ds10 RNA labeled with 5-TAMRA (Table 1) was titrated against increasing concentrations of eIF4A. The fluorophore was excited at 550 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 580 nm. Protein binding to ssRNA resulted in an increase in fluorescence anisotropy, accompanied by a large change in fluorescence intensity. This change in fluorescence intensity (with unpolarized light) was used to monitor protein binding to RNA. The ratio of the change in intensity (F − F0) to the maximal change (Fmax) (fraction bound) was plotted against the protein concentration to obtain the RNA binding curves for each RNA substrate. The data were then fit with a hyperbola given by Equation 2, y=A⋅[E](Kd+[E])(Eq. 2) where A is the amplitude; E is the enzyme concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant for the protein-RNA interaction. In these experiments, 30 nm eIF4A-Rh was titrated against increasing concentrations of eIF4E·eIF4G WT or ΔRNA mutant proteins. The Kd value of eIF4E binding to eIF4G (< 15 nm) is such that this complex is stable at all concentrations used in the titration. The fluorophore was excited at 550 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 580 nm. eIF4E·eIF4G binding to eIF4A resulted in an increase in fluorescence anisotropy, with little or no change in fluorescence intensity. The fraction bound was plotted against the protein concentration to obtain the eIF4A binding curves for each protein. The data were then fit to Equation 1. In these experiments, 100 nm eIF4A (with or without 300 nm eIF4E·eIF4G) was mixed with 10 nm dsRNA substrate (Table 1) and 3.0 μm ssDNA trap (Table 1). The reaction was initiated by mixing in 3 mm ATP. A reaction mix containing all components except ATP was considered t = 0. Aliquots were removed at various times (1–120 min) and mixed with native gel loading dye, containing 0.002% bromphenol blue and 40% sucrose. The time points were quenched by loading onto a running 16 or 22% (19:1) native polyacrylamide TBE gel. The resolved dsRNA and ssRNA were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The fraction of unwound substrate was calculated and corrected for the presence of ssRNA at time 0 using Equation 3, F=((SS×DS0)−(DS×SS0))(DS0×(SS+DS))(Eq. 3) where F is the fraction of unwound substrate; DS and SS are radioactivities of duplex and unwound substrate bands at a given time, respectively; and DS0 and SS0 are the radioactivities of duplex and unwound substrates at time 0, respectively (22Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. The functional interaction of the hepatitis C virus helicase molecules is responsible for unwinding processivity.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Under our reaction conditions, <5% of the RNA was in the ssRNA form at the beginning of the reaction (t = 0). In these experiments, 200 nm eIF4A was mixed with 200 nm eIF4E·eIF4G to form the eIF4F complex. This enzyme complex was then pre-incubated with 5 μm ssRNA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP containing trace [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at 26 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at various times (15–180 min), and formic acid added to 1 n to stop the reaction. 0.5 μl of each time point was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate. Pi was separated from ATP using 0.4 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.4, as the chromatographic solvent and quantified using a PhosphorImager. In the experiments measuring the Km value for ATP, the RNA concentration was kept at saturating levels at 5 μm, and the concentration of ATP was varied from 20 μm to 5 mm. In these experiments, 200 nm eIF4F complex was used at low ATP concentrations (20 μm to 0.5 mm), and 500 nm eIF4F complex was used at higher ATP concentrations (1–5 mm ATP) to achieve an optimal signal to noise ratio. In the experiments measuring the Km value for RNA, the ATP concentration was kept at 5 mm (or 10 mm when measuring dsRNA-stimulated ATPase activity of eIF4F ΔRNA mutants), and the concentration of RNA was varied from 20 nm to 10 μm. The concentration of the eIF4F complex was kept at 500 nm. The active enzyme fraction was assumed to be 100%. Note that in the latter experiments, the measured Km values are not true Km values because [E] > Km. Thus, these values are reported as upper limits (Table 2).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for RNA stimulated ATPase activity of eIF4A and eIF4Fkcatkmmin−1μmssRNA stimulated, increasing ATP concentrationWT eIF4FaMeasured with capped RNA.1.0 ± 0.775 ± 50WT eIF4F3.1 ± 1.3160 ± 40eIF4F ΔRNA14.5 ± 1.2620 ± 120eIF4F ΔRNA25.4 ± 0.51400 ± 390eIF4F ΔRNA34.6 ± 1.1380 ± 45ssRNA-stimulated, increasing RNA concentrationWT eIF4FaMeasured with capped RNA.0.92 ± 0.5<0.065WT eIF4F3.1 ± 0.8<0.15eIF4F ΔRNA14.1 ± 0.5<0.15eIF4F ΔRNA24.3 ± 0.3<0.15eIF4F ΔRNA34.5 ± 0.5<0.15dsRNA-stimulated, increasing ATP concentrationeIF4A0.2 ± 0.05225 ± 50WT eIF4FNDbND means not determined because of low signal to noise with the slow rates observed.NDeIF4F ΔRNA15.9 ± 2.0cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.3270 ± 680cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.eIF4F ΔRNA23.2 ± 0.4cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.2100 ± 150cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.eIF4F ΔRNA34.4 ± 1.1cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.4100 ± 900cValues were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2.a Measured with capped RNA.b ND means not determined because of low signal to noise with the slow rates observed.c Values were projected from fits; all errors shown are mean deviations; n ≥ 2. Open table in a new tab The molar ATP hydrolyzed per molar enzyme was plotted against time, and the slopes of the linear regions provided the initial velocities. These initial velocities were subtracted for any background ATPase observed in the absence of any nucleic acid. eIF4A showed negligible levels of background ATPase, whereas the background ATPase rate of eIF4F ranged between 0.05 and 0.075 min−1. Plots of the corrected initial velocities versus substrate concentration (with saturating concentration of the second substrate) were then fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain kcat and Km values. RNA was capped using the vaccinia virus capping enzyme (purified as described in Ref. 20Mitchell S.F. Walker S.E. Algire M.A. Park E.H. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R.

Additional enzyme was added to the reaction after 30 min for a final concentration of 250 nm capping enzyme. The reactions were quenched with EDTA, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and spin column-purified using Bio-Gel P6 columns (Bio-Rad). The capping efficiency was determined by adding trace [γ-32P]GTP to a small aliquot of the cold capping reaction, followed by analysis of the percentage incorporation of [γ-32P]GTP by electrophoresis. The capping efficiency ranged between 70 and 75%. RNA helicases are typically characterized by their ability to bind RNA and couple this RNA binding activity to nucleotide hydrolysis. Thus, as a first step toward a thorough characterization of S. cerevisiae eIF4A, we examined the ability of the enzyme to bind RNA. We developed a fluorescence-based equilibrium binding assay for this activity. eIF4A binding to 3′-TAMRA-labeled ssRNA (ss14; Table 1) in the presence of ATP (or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ADP·[AlF4]−) results in an enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the labeled RNA (Fig. 1, A and B). We used this as the signal to monitor the binding of eIF4A to ss- and dsRNA substrates. As was observed for mammalian eIF4A (23Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), binding of yeast eIF4A to ssRNA is strongly coupled to ATP binding; we could only detect binding to ssRNA in the presence of ATP (or ADP·[AlF4]−, data not shown). In the presence of saturating ATP, yeast eIF4A bound ssRNA with a Kd of ∼1.5 μm (Fig. 1C) similar to the affinity observed with the human factor (23Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Monitoring binding of a different, pyrimidine-rich ssRNA labeled on its 3′-end with fluorescein (75.1-Fl; Table 1) using fluorescence anisotropy yielded a Kd of ∼1.9 μm (data not shown), indicating that the fluorescence enhancement assay is an accurate readout of the eIF4A-ssRNA interaction and suggesting ssRNA binding is not sequence-specific. Unlike the mammalian protein, which has no appreciable dsRNA binding capability, yeast eIF4A bound dsRNA more tightly than it bound ssRNA, with a Kd of ∼20 nm (Fig. 1D). Unlike ssRNA binding, eIF4A binding to dsRNA was only moderately influenced by ATP binding (Kd for eIF4A·dsRNA in the absence of ATP ∼70 nm, data not shown). Similar experiments could not be carried out for the eIF4F complex due to the affinity of the interaction between yeast eIF4A and eIF4E·eIF4G (Kd ∼30 nm) (20Mitchell S.F. Walker S.E.

We next explored the abilities of S. cerevisiae eIF4A and eIF4F to hydrolyze ATP when stimulated by RNA substrates. In these assays, eIF4A or eIF4F (generated by adding saturating, equimolar concentrations of eIF4A to eIF4E·eIF4G) was incubated with saturating concentrations of RNA substrates (5 μm ssRNA or dsRNA, Table 1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP containing trace [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 0–180 min at 26 °C, quenched at different times with formic acid, and analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography. Our experiments showed that the ATPase activities of eIF4A and eIF4F are stimulated by both ssRNA and dsRNA, albeit to different extents. eIF4A exhibits no detectable ATP hydrolysis activity in the absence of RNA and has a 30-fold higher rate of ATP hydrolysis when stimulated by dsRNA than by ssRNA (Fig. 2). eIF4F, however, has robust ATPase activity when stimulated by ssRNA but 2 orders of magnitude lower activity with dsRNA (Fig. 2). Thus, the ATPase of yeast eIF4A on its own is activated better by dsRNA than by ssRNA, consistent with its ability to bind dsRNA more tightly than ssRNA, whereas eIF4A as part of the eIF4F complex has a strong preference for ssRNA. We next examined the RNA unwinding activity of yeast eIF4A and the eIF4F complex. Briefly, 100 nm eIF4A (with 300 nm eIF4E·eIF4G, when working with eIF4F) was incubated with 10 nm dsRNA (Table 1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and a DNA trap oligonucleotide to a final concentration of 3 mm and 3 μm, respectively. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 0–120 min and quenched by loading on a running 16% (19:1) native PAGE TBE gel (Fig. 3). The DNA trap used in the experiment had the same sequence as the radiolabeled strand of the duplex substrate. The trap served to base pair with the unlabeled ssRNA generated during the unwinding reaction, thereby preventing re-annealing of the labeled RNA strand and making its dissociation irreversible. Experiments performed with varying ratios of eIF4A to eIF4E·eIF4G showed that the 3-fold excess of eIF4E·eIF4G did not affect the rate of ATPase or RNA unwinding of the eIF4F complex (data not shown). In addition, control experiments with the trap DNA oligonucleotide showed that it did not bind to eIF4A (Fig. 1C) or eIF4E·eIF4G (Fig. 6B) at the concentrations used in the experiments. Moreover, ssDNA did not stimulate the ATPase activity of the eIF4F complex (data not shown). The trap by itself did not displace the RNA strand from th"

Extrinsic factors include molecular patterns that are derived from either pathogens (PAMPs) or cellular damage (DAMPs). These molecules can promote tumourigenesis by activation of the innate immune system, but the individual contribution of ligands and their receptors remains elusive. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (Rage) is a pattern recognition receptor that binds multiple ligands derived from a damaged cell environment such as Hmgb1 and S100 protein.

Recently, we observed in the gill of killifish, an environmental model organism, that arsenic exposure induced the ubiquitinylation and degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel that is essential for the mucociliary clearance of respiratory pathogens in humans. Accordingly, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that low dose arsenic exposure reduces the abundance and function of CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Arsenic induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in multiubiquitinylated CFTR, which led to its lysosomal degradation, and a decrease in CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. Although arsenic had no effect on the abundance or activity of USP10, a deubiquitinylating enzyme, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, abolished the arsenic-stimulated degradation of CFTR. Arsenic enhanced the degradation of CFTR by increasing phosphorylated c-Cbl, which increased its interaction with CFTR, and subsequent ubiquitinylation of CFTR. Because epidemiological studies have shown that arsenic increases the incidence of respiratory infections, this study suggests that one potential mechanism of this effect involves arsenic-induced ubiquitinylation and degradation of CFTR, which decreases chloride secretion and airway surface liquid volume, effects that would be proposed to reduce mucociliary clearance of respiratory pathogens.

https://openalex.org/W2017096160,"Leukotoxin (LtxA) is a protein toxin that is secreted from the oral bacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. LtxA targets specifically the β(2) integrin, leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) on white blood cells (WBCs) and causes cell death. LtxA preferentially targets activated WBCs and is being developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of WBC diseases such as hematologic malignancies and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which interaction between LtxA and LFA-1 results in cell death is not well understood. Furthermore, how LtxA preferentially recognizes activated WBCs is not known. We show here that LtxA interacts specifically with LFA-1 in the active (exposed) conformation. In THP-1 monocytes, LtxA caused rapid activation of caspases, but LtxA could overcome the inhibition of caspases and still intoxicate. In contrast, inhibiting the vesicular trafficking pathway or cathepsin D release from the lysosome resulted in significant inhibition of LtxA-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating a more potent, lysosomal mediated cell death pathway. LtxA caused rapid disruption of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal contents into the cytosol. Binding of LtxA to LFA-1 resulted in the internalization of both LtxA and LFA-1, with LtxA localizing specifically to the lysosomal compartment. To our knowledge, LtxA represents the first bacterial toxin shown to localize to the lysosome where it induces rapid cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2005003282,"Liver metastasis is the predominant cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality in developed countries. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a cell adhesion molecule with reduced expression in early phases of CRC development and thus functions as a tumor growth inhibitor. However, CEACAM1 is upregulated in metastatic colon cancer, suggesting a bimodal role in CRC progression. To investigate the role of this protein in the host metastatic environment, Ceacam1(-/-) mice were injected intrasplenically with metastatic MC38 mouse CRC cells. A significant reduction in metastatic burden was observed in Ceacam1(-/-) compared with wild-type (WT) livers. Intravital microscopy showed decreased early survival of MC38 cells in Ceacam1(-/-) endothelial environment. Metastatic cell proliferation within the Ceacam1(-/-) livers was also diminished. Bone marrow-derived cell recruitment, attenuation of immune infiltrates and diminished CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 chemokine production participated in the reduced Ceacam1(-/-) metastatic phenotype. Transplantations of WT bone marrow (BM) into Ceacam1(-/-) mice fully rescued metastatic development, whereas Ceacam1(-/-) BM transfer into WT mice showed reduced metastatic burden. Chimeric immune cell profiling revealed diminished recruitment of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to Ceacam1(-/-) metastatic livers and adoptive transfer of MDSCs confirmed the involvement of these immune cells in reduction of liver metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W1976140125,"Recent studies demonstrated that factors derived from embryonic stem cells inhibit the tumorigenicity of a variety of cancer cell lines. Embryonic stem cell-secreted Lefty, an inhibitor of Nodal-signalling pathway, was implicated in reprogramming cancer cells. Whether adult stem cells exhibited similar properties has not been explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the conditioned medium (CM) derived from adult stem cells influence in vitro and in vivo tumor growth by a Nodal-dependent pathway. In particular we compared the anti-tumor effect of CM from human liver stem cells (HLSC) with that of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). We found that HLSC-CM inhibited the in vitro growth and promoted apoptosis in HepG2 cells that expressed a deregulated Nodal pathway. The effect of HLSC-CM was related to the presence of Lefty A in the CM of HLSC. Silencing Lefty A in HLSC or Lefty A blockade with a blocking peptide abrogated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of HLSC-CM. Moreover, the administration of human recombinant Lefty A protein mimicked the effect of HLSC-CM indicating that Nodal pathway is critical for the growth of HepG2. At variance of HLSC, bone marrow-derived MSC did not express and release Lefty A and the MSC-CM did not exhibited an anti-tumor activity in vitro, but rather stimulated proliferation of HepG2. In addition, the intra-tumor administration of HLSC-CM was able to inhibit the in vivo growth of HepG2 hepatoma cells implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. At variance, HLSC-CM derived from Lefty A silenced HLSC was unable to inhibit tumor growth. In conclusion, the results of present study suggest that Lefty A may account for the tumor suppressive activity of HLSC as a result of an inhibition of the Nodal-signalling pathway by a mechanism similar to that described for embryonic stem cells."

GRKs have also been implicated in phosphorylating other classes of proteins and can localize in a variety of cellular compartments, including the nucleus.

NPM1 is a nuclear protein that regulates a variety of cell functions including centrosomal duplication, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. GRK5 interaction with NPM1 is mediated by the N-terminal domain of each protein, and GRK5 primarily phosphorylates NPM1 at Ser-4, a site shared with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). NPM1 phosphorylation by GRK5 and PLK1 correlates with the sensitivity of cells to undergo apoptosis with cells having higher GRK5 levels being less sensitive and cells with lower GRK5 being more sensitive to PLK1 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GRK5 phosphorylates Ser-4 in nucleophosmin and regulates the sensitivity of cells to PLK1 inhibition."

Active NORs are associated with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including upstream binding factor (UBF) and RNA polymerase I (RPI). These regions often stain positive for silver and are, therefore, called Ag-NORs. rDNA repeat units in inactive NORs are highly methylated and are not associated with the RNA polymerase I machinery (2Roussel P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Nucleoli form at the end of mitosis around the rDNA and result in a subnuclear compartment, which are constituted of rRNA transcription and processing machineries and responsible for generating ribosome subunits. In the full functional nucleolus, the rDNA transcription initiation complex (including RPI and UBF) is localized to tentative fibrillar centers, where proteins of the early (FBL) and late (nucleolin and nucleophosmin/B23) rRNA-processing machineries are distributed to presumptive fibrillar centers/dense fibrillar component and the full nucleolar compartment, respectively (3Fair T.

By the end of oocyte growth, rRNA synthesis ceases. The nucleoli disassemble and change into non-functional nucleolar remnants (6Baran V. Pavlok A. Bjerregaard B. Wrenzycki C. Hermann D.

It is intriguing that mouse oocytes destroy a large amount of rRNA, ribosomal protein, and mRNAs during maturation (8Paynton B.V. Rempel R. Bachvarova R. Changes in state of adenylation and time course of degradation of maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). So the maternal ribosome storage is evidently not sufficient to support embryonic development beyond the zygotic genome activation. Then in late 2-cell stage, the zygotic genome activation becomes apparent (9Schultz R.M. Wassarman P.M. Biochemical studies of mammalian oogenesis. Protein synthesis during oocyte growth and meiotic maturation in the mouse.J. Cell Sci. 1977; 24: 167-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and assembly are included in the first gene activation burst (10Zeng F. Schultz R.M. RNA transcript profiling during zygotic gene activation in the preimplantation mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 2005; 283: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, fibrillo-granular nucleoli with full rRNA synthesis, processing, and ribosome subunit assembly functions are only established at the 4-cell stage in mouse (11Geuskens M. Alexandre H. Ultrastructural and autoradiographic studies of nucleolar development and rDNA transcription in preimplantation mouse embryos.Cell Differ. 1984; 14: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which then provides a large amount of ribosomes for early development. Therefore, the reactivation of rDNA during zygotic genome activation and establishment of full functional nucleolus at the 4-cell stage are very important to preimplantation development of mouse embryos. Actually, in mammalian cells only ∼50% rDNA is transcribed (1Grummt I. Different epigenetic layers engage in complex cross-talk to define the epigenetic state of mammalian rRNA genes.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: R21-R27Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the remaining genes inactivated through a combination of different epigenetic mechanisms including methylation (12Santoro R. Grummt I. Molecular mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). With the new cytological technique, researchers indicated that rDNA is regulated allelically in a regional manner in human, with one parental copy of each NOR repressed in any individual cell, which is similar to X-chromosome inactivation in females (13Schlesinger S. Selig S. Bergman Y. Cedar H. Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whether the same mechanism exists in other species is unknown. When the somatic cell was fused into bovine enucleated oocyte, the nucleolus progressively transformed into nucleolar bodies and lost vacuoles structure (14Baran V. Vignon X. LeBourhis D. Renard J.P. Fléchon J.E. Nucleolar changes in bovine nucleotransferred embryos.Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

Nucleolus in apoptosis-induced mouse preimplantation embryos.Zygote. 2003; 11: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the inactive rDNA copies in donor cells may become a barrier for full activation of rDNA in NT embryos. Recently, several studies reported that the nucleolus biogenesis in NT embryos was abnormal. In bovine granulosa cell nuclear transfer embryos, the reformation of fibrillo-granular nucleoli was initiated one cell cycle earlier than that in in vivo derived embryos. But the UBF localization to the nucleolar compartment was one cell cycle later, which indicated the NT embryos were lacking in development potentials (16Laurincik J. Zakhartchenko V. Stojkovic M. Brem G. Wolf E. Müller M. Ochs R.L. Maddox-Hyttel P. Nucleolar protein allocation and ultrastructure in bovine embryos produced by nuclear transfer from granulosa cells.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In pig, only half late 4-cell fibroblast NT embryos had transcriptionally active nucleoli, whereas in in vivo embryos the portion was 92% (17Bjerregaard B. Pedersen H.G. Jakobsen A.S. Rickords L.F. Lai L. Cheong H.T. Samuel M. Prather R.S. Strejcek F. Rasmussen Z.R. Laurincik J. Niemann H. Maddox-Hyttel P. Thomsen P.D. Activation of ribosomal RNA genes in porcine embryos produced in vitro or by somatic cell nuclear transfer.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 74: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mouse embryonic fibroblast or stem cell-cloned embryos, the activation of functional nucleoli was also one cell cycle-delayed (18Svarcova O. Dinnyes A. Polgar Z. Bodo S. Adorjan M. Meng Q. Maddox-Hyttel P. Nucleolar reactivation is delayed in mouse embryos cloned from two different cell lines.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2009; 76: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the reprogramming competence of oocyte to somatic cell nuclear is limited, we wonder whether all those inactive rDNA/NORs could be fully activated at the 4-cell stage in mouse NT embryos when compared with normal ones. If not, will it impair ribosome synthesis and intracellular metabolism of early embryonic development? Besides, donor cells with a different differentiation status would yield different outcomes in somatic cell cloning experiments (19Wakayama T. Perry A.C. Zuccotti M. Johnson K.R. Yanagimachi R. Full-term development of mice from enucleated oocytes injected with cumulus cell nuclei.Nature. 1998; 394: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar, 20Kato Y. Tani T. Tsunoda Y.

We also want to know if the rDNA epigenetic status in donor cells will result in different rRNA synthesis and processing activities in NT embryos and, furthermore, affect preimplantation developmental competence. In this study we chose mouse embryonic cells (ESCs), cumulus cells (CCs), and embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) as donor cells to reconstruct different NT embryos. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) embryos were used as control. The rDNA methylation level, active NORs numbers, and nucleolar-related gene expression were compared in donor cells and in corresponding NT embryos at different preimplantation development stages. The distribution of nucleolar protein (B23 and UBF) was also compared before and after NT. B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) female/male mice were obtained at 8–10 weeks of age from Vital River (Beijing, China). Animals were conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal experiments were performed under the Code of Practice Harbin Medicine University Ethics Committees. Derivation and culture of mouse ESCs were according to a previous protocol (22Bryja V. Bonilla S. Arenas E. Derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS, 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, 15140-148), 100 μm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, 11140-050), 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M7522), and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, ESG1107). The medium were changed every day, and the cells were passaged every 2 days. The day before nuclear transfer, 3 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma, M1404) was added to culture medium overnight to synchronize the cells to metaphase (23Gao S. McGarry M. Latham K.E. Wilmut I. Cloning of mice by nuclear transfer.Cloning Stem Cells. 2003; 5: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Wakayama T. Rodriguez I. Perry A.C. Yanagimachi R. Mombaerts P. Mice cloned from embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14984-14989Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Then the cells were harvested and used as donor cells. All the ESCs used in this study were within 10 passages. CCs were obtained during oocyte collection, then washed in HEPES-buffered CZB medium (HEPES-CZB) several times and cultured in DMEM containing 50 ng/ml FSH (Sigma, F2297) and 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, E4127). Partial cells were resuspended in HEPES-CZB containing 3% PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma, PVP360) and used as donor cells (G0/G1) for NT directly. MEFs were isolated from 13.5 post-coitum B6D2F1 mouse fetus as previous reported (25Conner D.A. Mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) feeder cell preparation.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 23, Unit 23.2)Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS under 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37 °C within three passages. Partial MEFs were treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma, M4287) for 2.5 h then used as feed layers for ES cells. MEFs at the third passage were kept in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 72 h as serum starvation treatment and then used as NT donor cells (G0/G1). The ESCs, CCs, and MEFs were kept in culture medium containing 3 μg/ml nocodazole for 1, 12, and 12 h, respectively, to synchronize the cells to metaphase. Then the cells were made into metaphase chromosome spreads as previous reported (26Henegariu O. Heerema N.A. Lowe Wright L. Bray-Ward P. Ward D.C. Vance G.H. Improvements in cytogenetic slide preparation. Controlled chromosome spreading, chemical aging, and gradual denaturing.Cytometry. 2001; 43: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For karyotype observation, several slides of each group were stained with 4% Giemsa in PBS for 10 min. For silver-staining of active NORs, slides were first incubated in a humidity box at 37 °C for at least 30 min and then stained with fresh mixed silver-stain medium (2% agar medium with 1% formic acid, 50% AgNO3 medium (1:2)) in the dark at 40–50 °C for 8 min. The slides were washed, dried, mounted, and finally observed with a 100× oil-immersion objective. Female B6D2F1 mice were superovulated by intraperitoneal injections of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (NSH, China) followed 48 h later by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (NSH, China). Oocytes were collected from the oviducts 14 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection. After collection, cumulus cells were removed from oocytes with 300 μg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma, H4272) in droplets of HEPES-CZB by gentle pipetting. Denuded oocytes with homogeneous ooplasm were selected and kept in new droplets of CZB medium containing 5.6 mm glucose (CZBG), covered with sterile mineral oil (Fisher, O121-20), then cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until use. Spermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymis of 8–12 weeks age of B6D2F1 males, then kept in CZB-HEPES medium and prepared for injection. ICSI was carried out by a piezo-driven unit using the methods as described elsewhere (27Tesarik J. Rienzi L. Ubaldi F. Mendoza C. Greco E.

Use of mouse oocytes to evaluate the ability of human sperm to activate oocytes after failure of activation by intracytoplasmic sperm injection.Zygote. 2004; 12: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that our experiment was performed in HEPES-CZB containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma, C6762) at room temperature (29Hu L.L. Shen X.H. Zheng Z. Wang Z.D. Liu Z.H. Jin L.H. Lei L. Cytochalasin B treatment of mouse oocytes during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) increases embryo survival without impairment of development.Zygote. 2011; (August, 15, doi: 10.1017/S0967199411000438)Google Scholar). Only the sperm head was injected into oocyte. After 10–20 min of recovery, the ICSI-generated embryos were washed several times and cultured in K-modified simplex optimized medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To eliminate any possible effects brought by NT methods to the following investigation, we adopted the same one-step micromanipulation technique to reconstruct ESCs nuclear transfer (ESNT), CCs nuclear transfer (CCNT), and MEFs nuclear transfer (MEFNT) embryos as described previously (30Zhou Q. Renard J.P. Le Friec G. Brochard V. Beaujean N. Cherifi Y. Fraichard A. Cozzi J. Generation of fertile cloned rats by regulating oocyte activation.Science. 2003; 302: 1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) with modifications. The outer diameters of injection pipettes used for ESCs, CCs, and MEFs were 13, 9, and 12 μm, respectively. Briefly, the donor cell membrane was broken with several Piezo pulses, then 5–10 cells were sucked into the injection pipette. The oocyte MII spindle was adjusted to 8–10 o'clock, then one donor cell was injected into the nearby plasma. The spindle was sucked into the injection pipette immediately and taken out of oocyte. One hour after NT, the reconstructed CCNT and MEFNT embryos were activated with 5 mm SrCl2 (Sigma, 439665) in Ca2+-free CZB containing 5 μg/ml CB for 6 h, whereas the ESNT embryos were just activated in SrCl2-added Ca2+-free CZB for 6 h. Then the embryos were washed in K-modified simplex optimized medium and cultured in the same conditions as ICSI embryos. Cells used for the immunofluorescent experiment were cultured in an 8-well glass slide (Thermo, 1256518). Embryos at 0, and 20-, 40-, and 60-min post donor cell/sperm injection and 4-, 6-, 8-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-activation/sperm injection (hpa) were collected. The cells and embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 40 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 30min. After incubation in Image-iTTM FX Signal Enhancer (Invitrogen, I36933) for 30 min, the cells and embryos were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, A9418) in PBS for 1 h, then incubated with monoclonal anti-B23 antibody (Sigma, FC82291, 1:100) or monoclonal anti-UBF antibody (Sigma, WH00007343M1, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, A21202, 1:400) incubation for 1 h. After the nuclei were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342, the cells were mounted on 8-well glass slides as per the manufacture's instruction, and the embryos were mounted on slides with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane; Beyotime, P0126) and observed with laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM700). For examination of UBF spots in 4-cell stage embryos at metaphase, the embryos were incubated in KOSM medium containing 3 μg/ml nocodazole for 6 h (started from 48 hpa) and then collected, and subjected to the same sample preparation procedures. Serial layer scanning was performed over the target metaphase plates. Embryos at 24, 48, 72, and 92 hpa were collected as at 2-cell, 4-cell, morula, and blastocyst stage, respectively. RNA extraction and qPCR evaluation were performed as described previously with modifications (31Suzuki T. Minami N. Kono T. Imai H. Comparison of the RNA polymerase I-, II-, and III-dependent transcript levels between nuclear transfer and in vitro fertilized embryos at the blastocyst stage.J. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 53: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Each embryo sample was added with 105 copies of XenoTM RNA from SYBR Green Cell-to-CTTM Control kit (Invitrogen, 4402959) during cell lysis as external control. The total RNA of cells and embryos was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, 74104) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (ABI, 4368814). qPCR reactions were performed based on 1.5 μl of cDNA sample, 10 μl of TransStartTM Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen, AQ131), and gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1) in a 20-μl reaction system on CFX96 Real-time System (Bio-Rad). H2afz, Hprt1, and ExnoTM were used as candidate references for embryos (31Suzuki T. Minami N. Kono T. Imai H.

HP1γ, cyclophilin-A, and cyclophilin-B were used as candidate references for cells (13Schlesinger S. Selig S. Bergman Y. Cedar H. Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 5′-ETS sequence (81–507, GenBankTM BK000964.1) was used as the target sequence for detection of rDNA methylation levels (13Schlesinger S. Selig S. Bergman Y. Cedar H. Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The experiment was conducted with the EZ DNA Methylation-DirectTM kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Around 10,000 cells for each cell group and 70–80 embryos for each 4-cell embryo group were used as samples. The samples were digested with proteinase K, then the unmethylated cytosines were converted to uracil by bisulfite. The target sequence was amplified by PCR and subjected to sequence analysis. The primers sequences used were TAGTTTATTTTTTTTATTGGTTTGG (forward) and TAACATAAACACTTAAACACCACAA (reverse). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. More than 5 slides and 50 metaphase plates were checked for each group in karyotype and silver-stain experiment. More than five embryos in each group were selected for nucleolar protein observation by confocal microscope. More than 20 4-cell embryos blocked at metaphase in each group were observed for detection of UBF spots. The data were compared using the Least Significant Difference test after analysis of variance in SPSS 13.0. In qPCR experiments, 20 2-cell embryos, 15 4-cell embryos, 10 morulas, and 10 blastocysts of each group were used as one repeat. The raw data were first imported to qBasePLUS 2.2 software (Biogazelle) for reference gene selection and data calculation. Then the relative gene expression in ICSI embryos was set to 1. Finally, the relative amount of gene expression was compared using the Least Significant Difference test after analysis of variance in SPSS. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first examined the karyotypes of ESCs, CCs, and MEFs. All the 3 cell lines showed normal karyotypes that contained 40 acrocentric chromosomes (Fig. 1, A–C). Then the metaphase slides were stained with AgNO3 to show the active NORs. At interphase, the silver-stain signals in three groups all showed as brown clusters with irregular shapes in the nucleus with no obvious differences (Fig. 1, A′′, B′′, and C′′). At metaphase, the silver-stain signals showed as brown spot pairs near centromeres of certain chromosomes (Fig. 1, A′, B′, and C′). The ESCs had significantly more chromosomes containing brown spot pairs than CCs and MEFs (7.66 versus 6.45 versus 4.70, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). After studying the pair numbers profile of these cell lines, we found that the majority of ESCs had eight pairs of spots. But for CCs, more than half of the cells had seven pairs of spots, and the rest were mainly below seven. However, MEFs had the least pair numbers, and most of the cells only had four or five pairs of spots (supplemental Fig. 1). Because the rDNA transcription machinery is still assembled during mitosis in active NORs and absent in inactive NORs (2Roussel P. André C. Comai L. Hernandez-Verdun D. The rDNA transcription machinery is assembled during mitosis in active NORs and absent in inactive NORs.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the spot pair numbers observed during metaphase plate could be directly considered as active NORs numbers. The result indicated that the three donor cells had different active NORs numbers during normal culture and passages.FIGURE 2Active NORs in donor cells and in 4-cell embryos. Metaphase spreads of ESCS, CCs, and MEFs were stained with AgNO3, then the active NORs numbers were counted (A). ICSI, ESNT, CCNT, and MEFNT embryos at the 4-cell stage were blocked to metaphase by nocodazole treatment, then the UBF signal spots were labeled and counted (B). Columns with different letters indicate significant difference (p < 0.05). ESCs had significantly more active NORs than CCs and MEFs (7.66 versus 6.45 versus 4.70, p < 0.05), and MEFs had the least. ICSI and ESNT embryos had no significant difference in active NORs numbers at the 4-cell stage, but their active NORs numbers were significantly more than CCNT and MEFNT embryos (7.44 versus 7.19 versus 6.68 versus 5.77).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To find out whether rDNA methylation accounts for the difference among the cell lines in active NORs numbers, we detected the rDNA methylation levels of the cells at 5′-ETS of rDNA (13Schlesinger S. Selig S. Bergman Y. Cedar H. Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results showed ESCs had the lowest methylation level (6.67%), whereas MEFs had the highest (22.57%), and CCs were in the middle (13.59%) (Fig. 10), which indicated rDNA methylation did contribute to the inactivation of certain NORs. We then studied the distribution of nucleolar protein UBF and B23 in three types of cells that represent rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA-processing machineries, respectively. In CCs, B23 signals showed as three or four condensed clusters in nuclear (Fig. 3E). For MEFs, the B23 signal displayed as 1–3 bigger rings (Fig. 3I). The B23 signals in ESCs nuclei were much stronger than those in CCs or MEFs but irregular in s"

Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind and sequester GTPases in the cytosol, restricting their actions. RhoGDI2 is a member of the GDI family that acts as a metastasis suppressor in a variety of cancer types; however, very little is known about the regulation of this protein. Here, we present a mechanism for inactivation of RhoGDI2 via protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Ser31 in a region that contacts GTPases. In cells, RhoGDI2 becomes rapidly phosphorylated at Ser31 in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Based on the effects of pharmacological inhibitors and knockdown by siRNA, we determine that conventional type PKCα is responsible for this phosphorylation. Phospho-mimetic S31E-RhoGDI2 exhibits reduced binding to Rac1 relative to wild type, with a concomitant failure to reduce levels of activated endogenous Rac1 or remove Rac1 from membranes. These results reveal a mechanism of downregulation of RhoGDI2 activity through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser31. We hypothesize that this mechanism may serve to neutralize RhoGDI2 function in tumors that express RhoGDI2 and active PKCα."
https://openalex.org/W2046677683,"Like ubiquitin, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) covalently attaches to specific target proteins and modulates their functional properties, including subcellular localization, protein dimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation of transcription factors. Diverse transcriptional co-regulator complexes regulate the ability of estrogen receptors to respond to positive and negative acting hormones. Zinc finger protein 131 (ZNF131) is poorly characterized but may act as a repressor of estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated trans-activation. Here, we identify ZNF131 as a target for SUMO modification and as a substrate for the SUMO E3 ligase human polycomb protein 2 (hPc2). We report that the SUMO-interacting motif 1 (SIM1) and the C-box of hPc2 are critical regions required for ZNF131 SUMOylation and define the ZNF131 SUMOylation site as lysine 567. We further show that SUMO modification potentiates the negative effect of ZNF131 on estrogen signaling and consequently attenuates estrogen-induced cell growth in a breast cancer cell line. Our findings suggest that SUMOylation is a novel regulator of ZNF131 action in estrogen signaling and breast cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2078710088,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a serine/threonine phosphotransferase whose sustained activation in response to genotoxic stress promotes apoptosis. In Drosophila, the normally rapid JNK-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic stress is significantly delayed in Dmp53 (Drosophila p53) mutants. Likewise, the extent of JNK activity after UV irradiation is dependent on p53 in murine embryonic fibroblasts with loss of p53 resulting in diminished JNK activity. Together, these results suggest that p53 potentiates the JNK-dependent response to genotoxic stress; however, the mechanism whereby p53 stimulates JNK activity remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that both Drosophila and human p53 can directly stimulate JNK activity independently of p53-dependent gene transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the Drosophila and human p53 orthologs form a physical complex with diphosphorylated JNK ((DP)JNK) both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the interaction is evolutionarily conserved. Focusing on human p53, we demonstrate that the interaction maps to the DNA binding domain (hp53(DBD)). Intriguingly, binding of p53(DBD) alone to (DP)JNK prevented its inactivation by MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-5; however, JNK was still able to phosphorylate c-Jun while in a complex with the p53(DBD). Apparent dissociation constants for the p53(DBD)·(DP)JNK (274 ± 14 nm) and MKP-5·(DP)JNK (55 ± 8 nm) complexes were established; however, binding of MKP-5 and p53 to JNK was not mutually exclusive. Together, these results suggest that stress-dependent increases in p53 levels potentiate JNK activation by preventing its rapid dephosphorylation by MKPs and that the simultaneous activation of p53 and JNK may constitute a ""fail-safe"" switch for the JNK-dependent apoptotic response."

https://openalex.org/W2059985804,"Primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) are aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies with median survival time <6 months post-diagnosis. Mutations in the TP53 gene seldom occur in PELs, suggesting that genetic alterations in the TP53 are not selected during PEL progression. We have reported that p53 reactivation by an inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction, Nutlin-3, induces selective and massive apoptosis in PEL cells leading to efficient anti-tumor activity in a subcutaneous xenograft model for PEL. Here, we show compelling anti-tumor activity of Nutlin-3 in the majority of intraperitoneal PEL xenografts in vivo. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that spontaneous induction of viral lytic replication in tumors could drastically attenuate the p53-dependent apoptotic response to Nutlin-3. Moreover, viral reactivation compromised p53-dependent apoptosis in PEL cells treated with genotoxic anti-cancer agents doxorubicin and etoposide. We have recently demonstrated that the Ser/Thr kinases Pim 1 and 3 are required to trigger induction of the lytic replication cascade of KSHV. We have now assessed the ability of a novel Pim kinase inhibitor to restore the Nutlin-3-induced cytotoxicity in lytic PEL cells. PEL cells induced to lytic replication by phorbol esters showed 50% inhibition of active viral replication following treatment with the Pim kinase inhibitor. Importantly, co-treatment of these cells with the kinase inhibitor and Nutlin-3 resulted in a robust restoration of the Nutlin-3-induced cell death. These results highlight the potential impact of activation of viral lytic replication on disease progression and response to treatment in KSHV-induced lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2024973479,"For many complex traits, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only explain a small percentage of heritability. Next generation sequencing technology makes it possible to explore unexplained heritability by identifying rare variants (RVs). Existing tests designed for RVs look for optimal strategies to combine information across multiple variants. Many of the tests have good power when the true underlying associations are either in the same direction or in opposite directions. We propose three tests for examining the association between a phenotype and RVs, where two of them jointly consider the common association across RVs and the individual deviations from the common effect. On one hand, similar to some of the best existing methods, the individual deviations are modeled as random effects to borrow information across multiple RVs. On the other hand, unlike the existing methods which pool individual effects towards zero, we pool them towards a possibly non-zero common effect by adding a pooled variant into the model. The common effect and the individual effects are jointly tested. We show through extensive simulations that at least one of the three tests proposed here is the most powerful or very close to being the most powerful in various settings of true models. This is appealing in practice because the direction and size of the true effects of the associated RVs are unknown. Researchers can apply the developed tests to improve power under a wide range of true models."
