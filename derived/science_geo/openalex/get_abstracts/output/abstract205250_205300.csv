https://openalex.org/W2025888300,"The transplantation of anterior pituitary glands of normal mice into hypophysectomized dwarf littermates has resulted in mice that are normal in appearance and growth rate. In contrast, the anterior pituitary gland of dwarf animals, when placed in the sella of hypophysectomized normal littermates, failed to promote the growth of these animals. These results indicate that the primary site of gene action in dwarfism lies in the anterior pituitary itself rather than in the hypothalamus."

Comprehensive reviews on sialic acids have been published by Zilliken and Whitehouse2 and by Blix3."

It seems likely, therefore, that this mutant can convert erotic acid and uracil to the pyrimidine bases of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and can utilize the nucleoside directly for ribonucleic acid biosynthesis and for conversion to deoxycytidine and thymidine of deoxyribonucleic acid. As the latter two nucleosides have not been studied before as possible growth supplements in pyrimidine-deficient Neurospora, it has not been determined previously whether these compounds might also function as sources of pyrimidine components for RNA, or for DNA, or for both types of nucleic acids. Recently, from experiments with uniformly labeled C14-cytidine in the pyrimidine-deficient Neurospora mutant 36601, McNutt (2) has demonstrated that this nucleoside is incorporated into RNA and is also converted to uridine, deoxycytidine, and thymidine. A surprising result, however, was that the specific activities of the nucleosides isolated from the recovered RNA and DNA were only about 70% of that of the starting cytidine. It was concluded that this mutant has a considerable capacity for synthesizing the pyrimidine nucleosides, even though provided with an outside pyrimidine source. By studying the incorporation of uracil-2-W into the nucleic acids of the mutant 1298, it seemed possible to determine whether uracil utilization was the only pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis in this organism, or whether some other pathway might also be involved. In the latter event the pyrimidine components of RNA and DNA would be expected to show decreased specific activities as compared to that of the initial uracil-2-C14. Similarly, if deoxycytidine or thymidine were utilized for DNA synthesis only, it should be possible to label RNA specifically with uracil-2-C14. In the present paper we have studied the availability of deoxyuridine, deoxycytidine, and thymidine for growth of mutant 1298, as well as the supplementary growth effects of the above nucleosides and of uridine and cytidine, in the presence of a minimal amount of uracil. The utilization of uracil-2-Cl4 for the formation of uracil, cytosine, thymine, adenine, and guanine,"

https://openalex.org/W2083931108,The irradiation of a soluition of two symmetric disulfides produces detectable amounts of the nonsymmetric mixed disulfide. The effect is abolished by the addition of ethylmaleimide. The finding indicates that radiation caulses a disulfide opening and recombining process which may be of radiobiological interest.

https://openalex.org/W4245259014,Eight rats were run through discrimination training sessions in which responses in the dark were not reinforced whereas the first response after the onset of a light was reinforced. The procedure generated orderly learning and latency data for the individual animal. The latency distributions are adequately described by a simple mathematical formulation.

https://openalex.org/W1651022666,"THE genus Fusarium has 16 sections, many of which have a sexual stage, belonging to such Ascomycete genera as Nectria, Calonectria, Hypomyces and Gibberella. Fusarium oxysporum, the form species of the section Elegans, is a widely distributed soil-borne fungus that causes wilt in many economically important crops. It has no known perfect analogue, although it can achieve genetic variation through asexual methods of recombination1,2."
https://openalex.org/W1964956785,"IT is well known that the proportion of noradrenaline to adrenaline in the adrenal glands of cats varies considerably from cat to cat. Butterworth and Mann1 have obtained a range of 13–91 per cent of noradrenaline in the adrenal glands of a group of 38 cats of both sexes. This animal-to-animal variation is in marked contrast to most other laboratory animals, where the proportion of noradrenaline to adrenaline is constant for a given species."

Nevertheless, the studies of Luers1 on the blood cells of Lagomorpha, and of Castro et al.2 on the ameloblasts of Rodentia, showed the possibility of determining the sex in these animals."

https://openalex.org/W2079713503,"PREVIOUS observations on feeding habits of the genus Arcyophora were summarized by Reid1. Only in African territories adult moths were found feeding nocturnally on the lachrymal secretions of cattle, horses, mules, donkeys and wounded antelopes. One particular observation was made by Neave (quoted by Reid1) in South Africa, where many moths were sucking fluid, but no blood, from the eyes of a wounded animal."
https://openalex.org/W1985287288,"ONE of the theories proposed for explaining the protective role of certain substances on animals submitted to a lethal dose of ionizing radiation involves the capture of free radicals by the protective compound (scavenger action). As a consequence of this process the compound is chemically modified in the biological structures where it happens to be, which then survive the irradiation. If such a theory is correct a certain degree of correlation would be expected between the protecting activity of a substance and its lability towards radiation, unless a catalytic mechanism is involved."
