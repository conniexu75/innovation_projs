Neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 20 BTN162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera against the three mutant viruses were 0.81- to 1.46-fold of the GMTs against parental virus, indicating small effects of these mutations on neutralization by sera elicited by two BNT162b2 doses."
https://openalex.org/W3126958162,"We used the 10x Genomics Visium platform to define the spatial topography of gene expression in the six-layered human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We identified extensive layer-enriched expression signatures and refined associations to previous laminar markers. We overlaid our laminar expression signatures on large-scale single nucleus RNA-sequencing data, enhancing spatial annotation of expression-driven clusters. By integrating neuropsychiatric disorder gene sets, we showed differential layer-enriched expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting the clinical relevance of spatially defined expression. We then developed a data-driven framework to define unsupervised clusters in spatial transcriptomics data, which can be applied to other tissues or brain regions in which morphological architecture is not as well defined as cortical laminae. Last, we created a web application for the scientific community to explore these raw and summarized data to augment ongoing neuroscience and spatial transcriptomics research ( http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD )."

https://openalex.org/W3128197056,"Abstract Organoid models of early tissue development have been produced for the intestine, brain, kidney and other organs, but similar approaches for the heart have been lacking. Here we generate complex, highly structured, three-dimensional heart-forming organoids (HFOs) by embedding human pluripotent stem cell aggregates in Matrigel followed by directed cardiac differentiation via biphasic WNT pathway modulation with small molecules. HFOs are composed of a myocardial layer lined by endocardial-like cells and surrounded by septum-transversum-like anlagen; they further contain spatially and molecularly distinct anterior versus posterior foregut endoderm tissues and a vascular network. The architecture of HFOs closely resembles aspects of early native heart anlagen before heart tube formation, which is known to require an interplay with foregut endoderm development. We apply HFOs to study genetic defects in vitro by demonstrating that NKX2.5 -knockout HFOs show a phenotype reminiscent of cardiac malformations previously observed in transgenic mice."

https://openalex.org/W3128428002,"Aberrant inflammation in the CNS has been implicated as a major player in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disease. We developed a new approach to derive microglia from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and built a defined hPSC-derived tri-culture system containing pure populations of hPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons to dissect cellular cross-talk along the neuroinflammatory axis in vitro. We used the tri-culture system to model neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease with hPSCs harboring the APPSWE+/+ mutation and their isogenic control. We found that complement C3, a protein that is increased under inflammatory conditions and implicated in synaptic loss, is potentiated in tri-culture and further enhanced in APPSWE+/+ tri-cultures due to microglia initiating reciprocal signaling with astrocytes to produce excess C3. Our study defines the major cellular players contributing to increased C3 in Alzheimer’s disease and presents a broadly applicable platform to study neuroinflammation in human disease. Guttikonda et al. engineered a human pluripotent stem cell-derived tri-culture system containing microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. This system recapitulates cell-type-specific inflammatory signaling in an in vitro model of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W3128572085,"Technological and computational advances in genomics and interactomics have made it possible to identify how disease mutations perturb protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks within human cells. Here, we show that disease-associated germline variants are significantly enriched in sequences encoding PPI interfaces compared to variants identified in healthy participants from the projects 1000 Genomes and ExAC. Somatic missense mutations are also significantly enriched in PPI interfaces compared to noninterfaces in 10,861 tumor exomes. We computationally identified 470 putative oncoPPIs in a pan-cancer analysis and demonstrate that oncoPPIs are highly correlated with patient survival and drug resistance/sensitivity. We experimentally validate the network effects of 13 oncoPPIs using a systematic binary interaction assay, and also demonstrate the functional consequences of two of these on tumor cell growth. In summary, this human interactome network framework provides a powerful tool for prioritization of alleles with PPI-perturbing mutations to inform pathobiological mechanism- and genotype-based therapeutic discovery."

https://openalex.org/W3127099806,"Cancer-associated, loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding subunits of the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes1–8 often cause drastic chromatin accessibility changes, especially in important regulatory regions9–19. However, it remains unknown how these changes are established over time (for example, immediate consequences or long-term adaptations), and whether they are causative for intracomplex synthetic lethalities, abrogating the formation or activity of BAF complexes9,20–24. In the present study, we use the dTAG system to induce acute degradation of BAF subunits and show that chromatin alterations are established faster than the duration of one cell cycle. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and a chemical degrader of the BAF complex ATPase subunits25,26, we show that maintaining genome accessibility requires constant ATP-dependent remodeling. Completely abolishing BAF complex function by acute degradation of a synthetic lethal subunit in a paralog-deficient background results in an almost complete loss of chromatin accessibility at BAF-controlled sites, especially also at superenhancers, providing a mechanism for intracomplex synthetic lethalities. Acute degradation of the BAF subunit SMARCA4 shows rapid chromatin accessibility changes, thus suggesting that maintenance of genome accessibility requires constant ATP-dependent remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3127234302,"Current methods for comparing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space, such as clusters of cells. Here we quantify the effects of perturbations at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is, on average, 57% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative algorithms in ground truth comparisons. Matched treatment and control single-cell RNA sequencing samples are more accurately compared at the single-cell level."
https://openalex.org/W3126875101,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true size of the currently infected population, which is arguably the most critical number for public health policy decisions. We developed a machine learning framework to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in all 50 U.S. states and the 50 most infected countries from reported test results and deaths. Using published epidemiological parameters, our algorithm optimized slowly varying daily ascertainment rates and a time course of currently infected cases each day. Severe under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases was found to be universal across U.S. states and countries worldwide. In 25 out of the 50 countries, actual cumulative cases were estimated to be 5–20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Our estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the existing seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states. Our framework projected for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. that ~10% of the population has been infected once. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population was estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York this fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases."
https://openalex.org/W3126944731,"Coordinated polymerization of actin filaments provides force for cell migration, morphogenesis and endocytosis. Capping protein (CP) is a central regulator of actin dynamics in all eukaryotes. It binds to actin filament (F-actin) barbed ends with high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics to prevent filament polymerization and depolymerization. However, in cells, CP displays remarkably rapid dynamics within F-actin networks, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that the conserved cytoskeletal regulator twinfilin is responsible for CP's rapid dynamics and specific localization in cells. Depletion of twinfilin led to stable association between CP and cellular F-actin arrays, as well as to its retrograde movement throughout leading-edge lamellipodia. These were accompanied by diminished F-actin turnover rates. In vitro single-filament imaging approaches revealed that twinfilin directly promotes dissociation of CP from filament barbed ends, while enabling subsequent filament depolymerization. These results uncover a bipartite mechanism that controls how actin cytoskeleton-mediated forces are generated in cells."

Human trophoblast stem (TS) cells have emerged as an attractive tool for studies on early trophoblast development. However, the use of TS cell models is constrained by the limited genetic diversity of existing TS cell lines and restrictions on using human fetal tissue or embryos needed to generate additional lines. Here we report the derivation of two distinct stem cell types of the trophectoderm lineage from human pluripotent stem cells. Analogous to villous cytotrophoblasts in vivo, the first is a CDX2- stem cell comparable with placenta-derived TS cells—they both exhibit identical expression of key markers, are maintained in culture and differentiate under similar conditions, and share high transcriptome similarity. The second is a CDX2+ stem cell with distinct cell culture requirements, and differences in gene expression and differentiation, relative to CDX2- stem cells. Derivation of TS cells from pluripotent stem cells will significantly enable construction of in vitro models for normal and pathological placental development.

Derivation of TS cells from pluripotent stem cells will significantly enable construction of in vitro models for normal and pathological placental development. Specification of the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass is the first differentiation event during human embryonic development. The trophectoderm mediates blastocyst implantation in the uterus and is the precursor to all trophoblast cells in the placenta. Upon embryo implantation, the trophectoderm forms the cytotrophoblast (CTB), a putative stem cell that can differentiate to form the two major cell types in the placenta, the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) and the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) (1Bischof P.

The EVTs are involved in remodeling of uterine arteries, which is critical to ensure adequate perfusion of the placenta with maternal blood, whereas the multinucleated STB mediates the nutrient and gas exchange at the maternal–fetal interface (3Yabe S.

Abnormalities in trophoblast development are associated with pregnancy-related pathologies such as miscarriage, preeclampsia, and placenta accreta. Yet, despite its relevance to maternal and fetal health, constraints on research with human embryos and early fetal tissue impede mechanistic insight into early trophoblast development. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells derived from first-trimester human placental samples and blastocyst-stage embryos have emerged as an attractive in vitro model system for early human trophoblast (5Okae H. Toh H. Sato T. Hiura H. Takahashi S. Shirane K. Kabayama Y. Suyama M. Sasaki H. Arima T.

However, restricted accessibility of embryos and placental samples from early gestation and low genetic diversity of existing cell lines limit the use of this model. In contrast, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a more accessible source for generating in vitro models of human trophoblast. Of more importance, unlike early gestation primary samples where the projected pregnancy outcome is uncertain, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can potentially provide models of validated normal and pathological trophoblast development (6Sheridan M.A. Yang Y.

However, whether bona fide trophoblast can be obtained from hPSCs has been a subject of intense debate (7Roberts R.M. Loh K.M. Amita M. Bernardo A.S. Adachi K. Alexenko A.P. Schust D.J. Schulz L.C.

A rigorous head-to-head comparison between trophoblast derived from hPSCs and their in vivo counterparts has proven difficult owing to multiple reasons. Previous studies have used varying experimental protocols (8Roberts R.M. Ezashi T. Sheridan M.A. Yang Y. Specification of trophoblast from embryonic stem cells exposed to BMP4†.Biol. Reprod. 2018; 99: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); both primary placental samples and cultures of terminally differentiated trophoblast obtained from hPSCs exhibit heterogeneity and contain many cell types, and until recently self-renewing TS-like cells had not been derived from hPSCs (9Dong C.

In this study, we report the derivation and maintenance of two distinct trophectoderm lineage stem cell types from hPSCs, specifically human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hiPSCs, in chemically defined culture conditions. The first is a CDX2- stem cell that is comparable with TS cells derived from early-gestation placental samples and similar to the villous CTB. The second is a CDX2+ cell type with distinct cell culture requirements, and differences in gene expression and differentiation, relative to CDX2- stem cells. Critically, the isolation of self-renewing stem cell populations allowed a direct comparison of placenta-derived TS cells with TS cells from hPSCs; genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and functional differentiation assays demonstrate very high similarity between placenta- and hPSC-derived CDX2- TS cells. The routine derivation of TS cells from hPSCs will provide powerful tools for mechanistic studies on normal and pathological early trophoblast development. Media formulations in previous studies on trophoblast differentiation of hESCs included components such as knockout serum replacement (KSR) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) that act as carriers for lipids. Albumin-associated lipids have been implicated in activation of G-protein–coupled receptor–mediated signaling (13Yu F.-X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H.

H1 and H9 hESCs cultured in E8 medium were differentiated for 6 days in E7 medium (E8 without transforming growth factor-beta1 [TGFβ1]) supplemented with S1P, by treatment with BMP4 and the activin/nodal inhibitor SB431542 (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, we observed upregulation of the trophectoderm marker CDX2 and the CTB marker ELF5 (Fig. S1, A and B). Upregulation of TBX4 was observed after 6 days. However, overall there were no significant changes in markers associated with neural or mesodermal differentiation after 6 days suggesting that differentiation to these lineages did not occur (Fig. S1, A and B). Immunofluorescence analysis at day 6 confirmed expression of the pan-trophoblast marker KRT7, and CTB markers P63 and GATA3; expression of CDX2 was not observed (Figs. 1B and S1C). The putative CTB cells obtained at day 6 were investigated for their ability to differentiate to EVTs and STB, using protocols similar to those previously employed (20Sarkar P. Randall S.M. Collier T.S. Nero A. Russell T.A. Muddiman D.C. Rao B.M. Activin/nodal signaling Switches the terminal fate of human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 8834-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We observed formation of mesenchymal cells from epithelial cells over a 6-day period when passaged into E8 medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and SB431542. Immunofluorescence analysis showed expression of KRT7 and the EVT markers VE-Cadherin and HLA-G (Figs. 1C, S1D). Alternatively, passaging CTB-like cells in E6 medium (E8 without TGFβ1 and fibroblast growth factor-2 [FGF2]) supplemented with activin and EGF resulted in the formation of KRT7+ multinucleate cells expressing the STB markers hCG and syncytin over an 8-day period (Figs. 1D, S1E). Removal of S1P from the medium during hESC differentiation to CTB-like cells abolished the formation of EVTs that express HLA-G and VE-Cadherin (Figs. 1E, S2A) under identical differentiation conditions (Fig. 1A). Differentiation to STB also did not occur in the absence of S1P, as evidenced by lack of expression of syncytin and KRT7 (Figs. 1F, S2B). Also, downregulation of the trophectoderm marker CDX2 and upregulation of transcripts of neural and mesoderm markers was observed in cells after 6 days of differentiation, upon removal of S1P (Fig. S2C). Taken together these results show that CTB-like cells, similar to those in previous studies utilizing more complex culture conditions (20Sarkar P. Randall S.M. Collier T.S. Nero A. Russell T.A.

Furthermore, addition of exogenous S1P is necessary for hESC differentiation to trophoblast in our chemically defined culture medium. Rho GTPase signaling, downstream of G-protein–coupled receptors activated by S1P, has been implicated in nuclear localization of YAP (22Ohgushi M. Minaguchi M. Sasai Y.

Both Rho/RhoA associated kinase (ROCK) and nuclear YAP play a critical role in trophectoderm specification in the mouse (24Nishioka N. Inoue K. Adachi K. Kiyonari H. Ota M. Ralston A. Yabuta N.

Inhibition of RHO-ROCK signaling enhances ICM and suppresses TE characteristics through activation of Hippo signaling in the mouse blastocyst.Dev.

The Rho/ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was included during differentiation of hESCs to CTB-like cells and subsequent differentiation to EVT and STB to investigate the role of Rho/ROCK signaling. Under these conditions, HLA-G expression was observed in cells obtained from H9 hESCs; however, VE-Cadherin expression was weak and observed in only a few cells (Fig. S3A). On the other hand, expression of EVT markers was not observed in cells derived from H1 hESCs. In addition, presence of ROCK inhibition abolished STB formation, as shown by the lack of expression of syncytin and KRT7 (Fig. S3B). To investigate the role of YAP signaling in CTB formation from hESCs, we used an hESC cell line (H9) that expresses an inducible shRNA against YAP (H9-YAP-ishRNA) or a scrambled shRNA control (26Hsiao C. Lampe M. Nillasithanukroh S. Han W. Lian X. Palecek S.P. Human pluripotent stem cell culture density modulates YAP signaling.Biotechnol. J. 2016; 11: 662-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). YAP knockdown abolished differentiation to EVT and STB, as evidenced by lack of expression of the relevant markers. It is notable that high cell death was observed (Fig. S3, A and B). Gene expression analysis revealed a significant reduction in ELF5 upon YAP knockdown, relative to the scrambled shRNA control (Fig. S3C). Significant downregulation of the mesodermal genes TBX4 and LMO2 was observed, whereas T was upregulated, in H9-YAP-ishRNA, relative to the scrambled control. Taken together, these results show that Rho/ROCK signaling and YAP are necessary for differentiation of hESCs to functional CTB that can give rise to both EVTs and STB, in our chemically defined culture medium. S1P acts through both receptor-mediated and receptor-independent pathways (14Mendelson K. Evans T. Hla T. Sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling.Development (Cambridge, England). 2014; 141: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27Maceyka M. Harikumar K.B. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and its role in disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 50-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To investigate the specific mechanism of S1P action during hESC differentiation to trophoblast, we replaced S1P with D-erythro-dihydrospingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) in our protocol. dhS1P acts as an agonist for the S1P receptors (S1PRs) but does not mediate an intracellular effect (28Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Replacing S1P with dhS1P yielded similar results—CTB-like cells showed expression of CDX2, GATA3, P63, and TEAD4 (Figs. 2A and S4A). Upon further differentiation as previously described (Fig. 1A), STB expressing KRT7 and hCG, and EVT expressing HLA-G and VE-Cadherin were obtained (Fig. 2, B and C; Fig. S4, B and C). These results suggest that S1PR signaling mediates the effect of exogenous S1P during hESC differentiation to trophoblast in our chemically defined medium.

We further used selective chemical agonists for S1PR1-3—CYM5442 hydrochloride, CYM5520, and CYM5541, respectively—to replace S1P in differentiation protocols previously discussed. Expression of CDX2, GATA3, P63, and TEAD4 was observed in CTB-like cells for all three agonists (Figs. 2A and S4A). Similarly, use of each agonist resulted in expression of the EVT markers HLA-G and VE-Cadherin and formation of multinucleate STB expressing KRT7 and hCG (Fig. 2, B and C; Fig. S4, B and C). However, we observed some variability between the agonists (Fig. S5). For instance, use of the S1PR2 agonist resulted in strong cytoplasmic expression of P63 and high heterogeneity in staining at day 6 relative to the other agonists. Formation of large multinucleated STB was more pronounced when the S1PR2 or S1PR3 agonists were used, as compared with the S1PR1 agonist. On the other hand, the S1PR1 and S1PR3 agonists enhanced the formation of mesenchymal EVTs, relative to the S1PR2 agonist. Taken together, our results further confirmed that S1PR signaling mediates effects of exogenous S1P during trophoblast differentiation of hESCs in our culture system. Since our qualitative observations showed that use of the S1PR3 agonist resulted in expression of CTB markers, and both multinucleate STB and mesenchymal EVTs could be obtained when the S1PR3 agonist was used, we chose the S1PR3 agonist for subsequent studies. We investigated whether CTB-like cells obtained by treatment of hESCs with BMP4 and SB431542 in E7 medium supplemented with the S1PR3 agonist CYM5541 for 6 days could be passaged and maintained under conditions used for culture of blastocyst- and placenta-derived primary TS cells (5Okae H.

Upon plating in trophoblast stem cell medium (TSCM) developed by Okae et al. (5Okae H. Toh H. Sato T. Hiura H. Takahashi S. Shirane K. Kabayama Y. Suyama M. Sasaki H. Arima T.

CDX2 expression is upregulated significantly in as little as 2 days after initiation of hESC differentiation but decreases by day 6 (Fig. S1, A and B). In addition, previous studies have reported differentiation of hESCs to CDX2+/p63+ cells upon treatment with BMP for 4 days (30Horii M. Li Y. Wakeland A.K. Pizzo D.P. Nelson K.K. Sabatini K. Laurent L.C. Liu Y. Parast M.M. Human pluripotent stem cells as a model of trophoblast differentiation in both normal development and disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. United States America. 2016; 113: E3882-E3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the use of a shorter differentiation step for obtaining CTB-like cells (Fig. 3A). After 3 days of differentiation, H9 and H1 hESCs expressed nuclear CDX2, P63, and TEAD4 uniformly (Fig. 3B). However, by day 6 most differentiated H1 and H9 hESCs lose expression of CDX2 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative image analysis showed that nearly all cells are CDX2+ at day 3, in contrast to CTB-like cells at day 6. Of note, use of a 6-day protocol resulted in a significantly reduced fraction of CDX2+ cells in the case of H1 hESCs in comparison with the 3-day protocol; on the other hand, a significant fraction of H9 cells retained CDX2+ at day 6 (Fig. 3D). Transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing identified 291 genes with significantly higher expression levels and 330 genes with significantly lower expression levels in day 3 differentiated hESCs versus undifferentiated hESCs (Tables S1 and S2).Expression of other trophectoderm-associated markers such as HAND1, GATA3, and TFAP2A, in addition to CDX2, was upregulated in differentiated hESCs at day 3, whereas expression of pluripotency-associated NANOG was downregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified 567 and 202 gene ontology (GO) categories (of 9996 queried categories) associated with higher and lower gene expression in day 3 differentiated cells versus undifferentiated hESCs, respectively (Tables S3 and S4). Consistent with differentiation to epithelial trophoblast, genes associated with the GO terms for epithelium development, epithelial cell proliferation, and epithelial cell differentiation were upregulated in day 3 differentiated hESCs. CDX2+ cells at day 3 were passaged into a chemically defined medium containing four major components (denoted TM4), the S1PR3 agonist CYM5541, the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021, the TGFβ inhibitor A83-01, and FGF10. CHIR99021 and A83-01 are components of TSCM used for culture of primary TS cells; FGF10 was included because FGFR2b signaling is active in blastocyst- and placenta-derived TS cells and the early placenta (5Okae H.

Cells in TM4 could be maintained as epithelial colonies for 30+ passages over the course of 5 months. In TM4 medium, cells derived from H9 and H1 hESCs retained expression of the trophoblast markers CDX2, TFAP2C, YAP, TEAD4, and GATA3 (Figs. 3E and S6) (15Yagi R. Kohn M.J. Karavanova I. Kaneko K.J.

However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Dilp8, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian insulin-like 3 peptide (INSL3), is secreted from tumour tissues and induces anorexia through the Lgr3 receptor in the brain. Activated Dilp8-Lgr3 signalling upregulated anorexigenic nucleobinding 1 (NUCB1) and downregulated orexigenic short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF expression in the brain. In the cancer condition, the protein expression of Lgr3 and NUCB1 was significantly upregulated in neurons expressing sNPF and NPF. INSL3 levels were increased in tumour-implanted mice and INSL3-treated mouse hypothalamic cells showed Nucb2 upregulation and Npy downregulation. Food consumption was significantly reduced in intracerebrospinal INSL3-injected mice. In patients with pancreatic cancer, higher serum INSL3 levels increased anorexia. These results indicate that tumour-derived Dilp8/INSL3 induces cancer anorexia by regulating feeding hormones through the Lgr3/Lgr8 receptor in Drosophila and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3126843008,"Objective Lack of ergonomic training and poor ergonomic habits during the operation leads to musculoskeletal pain and affects the surgeon’s life outside of work. The objective of the study was to evaluate the severity of ergonomic hazards in the surgical profession across a wide range of surgical subspecialties. We conducted intraoperative observations using Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) score system to identify ergonomic hazards. Additionally, each of the ten surgical subspecialty departments were sent an optional 14 question survey which evaluated ergonomic practice, environmental infrastructure, and prior ergonomic training or education. A total of 91 surgeons received intraoperative observation and were evaluated on the REBA scale with a minimum score of 0 (low ergonomic risk &lt;3) and a maximum score of 10 (high ergonomic risk 8–10). And a total of 389 surgeons received the survey and 167 (43%) surgeons responded. Of the respondents, 69.7% reported suffering from musculoskeletal pain. Furthermore, 54.9% of the surgeons reported suffering from the highest level of pain when standing during surgery, while only 14.4% experienced pain when sitting. Importantly, 47.7% stated the pain impacted their work, while 59.5% reported pain affecting quality of life outside of work. Only 23.8% of surgeons had any prior ergonomic education. Both our subjective and objective data suggest that pain and disability induced by poor ergonomics are widespread among the surgical community and confirm that surgeons rarely receive ergonomic training. Intraoperative observational findings identified that the majority of observed surgeons displayed poor posture, particularly a poor cervical angle and use of ergonomic setups, both of which increase ergonomic risk hazards. This data supports the need for a comprehensive ergonomic interventional program for the surgical team and offers potential targets for future intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3127915047,"Limited testing capacity for COVID-19 has hampered the pandemic response. Pooling is a testing method wherein samples from specimens (e.g., swabs) from multiple subjects are combined into a pool and screened with a single test. If the pool tests positive, then new samples from the collected specimens are individually tested, while if the pool tests negative, the subjects are classified as negative for the disease. Pooling can substantially expand COVID-19 testing capacity and throughput, without requiring additional resources. We develop a mathematical model to determine the best pool size for different risk groups , based on each group’s estimated COVID-19 prevalence. Our approach takes into consideration the sensitivity and specificity of the test, and a dynamic and uncertain prevalence, and provides a robust pool size for each group. For practical relevance, we also develop a companion COVID-19 pooling design tool (through a spread sheet). To demonstrate the potential value of pooling, we study COVID-19 screening using testing data from Iceland for the period, February-28-2020 to June-14-2020, for subjects stratified into high- and low-risk groups. We implement the robust pooling strategy within a sequential framework, which updates pool sizes each week, for each risk group, based on prior week’s testing data. Robust pooling reduces the number of tests, over individual testing, by 88.5% to 90.2%, and 54.2% to 61.9%, respectively, for the low-risk and high-risk groups (based on test sensitivity values in the range [0.71, 0.98] as reported in the literature). This results in much shorter times, on average, to get the test results compared to individual testing (due to the higher testing throughput), and also allows for expanded screening to cover more individuals. Thus, robust pooling can potentially be a valuable strategy for COVID-19 screening."
https://openalex.org/W3127887955,"Host-pathogen interactions play an important role in defining the outcome of a disease. Recent studies have shown that the bacterial quorum sensing molecules (QSM) can interact with host cell membrane proteins, mainly G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and induce innate immune responses. However, few studies have examined QSM-GPCR interactions and their influence on oral innate immune responses. In this study, we examined the role of bitter taste receptor T2R14 in sensing competence stimulating peptides (CSPs) secreted by cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans and in mediating innate immune responses in gingival epithelial cells (GECs). Transcriptomic and western blot analyses identify T2R14 to be highly expressed in GECs. Our data show that only CSP-1 from S. mutans induces robust intracellular calcium mobilization compared to CSP-2 and CSP-3. By using CRISPR-Cas9, we demonstrate that CSP-1 induced calcium signaling and secretion of cytokines CXCL-8/IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 is mediated through T2R14 in GECs. Interestingly, the NF-kB signaling activated by CSP-1 in GECs was independent of T2R14. CSP-1-primed GECs attracted differentiated HL-60 immune cells (dHL-60) and this effect was abolished in T2R14 knock down GECs and also in cells primed with T2R14 antagonist 6-Methoxyflavone (6-MF). Our findings identify S. mutans CSP-1 as a peptide ligand for the T2R family. Our study establishes a novel host-pathogen interaction between cariogenic S. mutans CSP-1 and T2R14 in GECs leading to an innate immune response. Collectively, these findings suggest T2Rs as potential therapeutic targets to modulate innate immune responses upon oral bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W3126489718,"Introduction Some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present systemic disease involving multiple systems. There is limited information about the clinical characteristics and events leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). We described the factors associated with the development of AKI and explored the relation of AKI and mortality in Mexican population with severe COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized at the largest third-level reference institution for COVID-19 care in Mexico between March and April 2020. Demographic information, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory data, dates of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and hospitalization, mechanical-ventilator settings and use of vasoactive drugs were recorded. Results Of 99 patients studied, 58 developed AKI (58.6%). The risk factors for AKI were older age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01–1.13, p = 0.024); obesity (OR = 6.58, 95% CI = 1.8–24.05, p = 0.040); and the need for IMV (OR = 6.18, CI = 1.29–29.58, p = 0.023). The risk factors for mortality were obesity (OR = 5.57, 95% CI = 1.48–20.93, p = 0.011); requirement of vasoactive drugs on admission (OR = 5.35, 95% CI = 1.16–24.61, p = 0.031); and AKI (OR = 8.61, 95% CI = 2.24–33.1, p = 0.002). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with AKI stage 3 (79.3%) and AKI stage 2 (68.7%) compared with those with AKI stage 1 (25%; p = 0.004). Fifty-three patients underwent the furosemide stress test (FST) to predict progression to AKI stage 3. Of those, 12 progressed to AKI stage 3 (22%). The ROC curve for the FST had an AUC of 0.681 (p = 0.009); a sensitivity of 81.6% and a specificity of 54.5%. Conclusions AKI was common in our cohort of patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity and the need for of IMV on admission. The risk factors for mortality were obesity, requirement of vasoactive drugs on admission and AKI. Mortality was more frequent in patients with AKI stages 2–3. The FST had an acceptable predictive capacity to identify patients progressing to AKI stage 3."
https://openalex.org/W3127727088,"Background Cerebral injury is a common cause of maternal mortality due to preeclampsia and is challenging to predict and diagnose. In addition, there are associations between previous preeclampsia and stroke, dementia and epilepsy later in life. The cerebral biomarkers S100B, neuron specific enolase, (NSE), tau protein and neurofilament light chain (NfL) have proven useful as predictors and diagnostic tools in other neurological disorders. This case-control study sought to determine whether cerebral biomarkers were increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a marker of cerebral origin and potential cerebral injury in preeclampsia and if concentrations in CSF correlated to concentrations in plasma. Methods CSF and blood at delivery from 15 women with preeclampsia and 15 women with normal pregnancies were analysed for the cerebral biomarkers S100B, NSE, tau protein and NfL by Simoa and ELISA based methods. MRI brain was performed after delivery and for women with preeclampsia also at six months postpartum. Results Women with preeclampsia demonstrated increased CSF- and plasma concentrations of NfL and these concentrations correlated to each other. CSF concentrations of NSE and tau were decreased in preeclampsia and there were no differences in plasma concentrations of NSE and tau between groups. For S100B, serum concentrations in preeclampsia were increased but there was no difference in CSF concentrations of S100B between women with preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. Conclusion NfL emerges as a promising circulating cerebral biomarker in preeclampsia and increased CSF concentrations point to a neuroaxonal injury in preeclampsia, even in the absence of clinically evident neurological complications."

However, the role of Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway in the immune evasion of cervical cancer remains unknown. This study is to investigate the expression, function, and regulation of Tim-3/Galectin-9 signaling pathway in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive cervical cancer. Flow cytometry showed that Tim-3 expression on T cell and Galectin-9 expression on monocytes in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and benign uterine fibroids Tim-3 + CD4+ Th1 cells and Tim-3 + CD8+ T cells in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly reduced after surgery. Serum TGF-β and IL-10 levels were positively correlated with Tim-3 + Treg cells, while IFN-γ and IL-2 were negatively correlated with Tim-3 + Th1 cells. Additionally, Tim-3 + CD4+ T cells were positively correlated with Galectin-9 + monocytes. Survival curve analysis showed that Tim-3 + CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with patient survival, and closely related to FIGO stage, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis of HPV positive cervical cancer. In vitro experiments showed that by blocking the Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway, the proliferation of T cells and their ability to express IFN-γ, IL-2, perforin, and granzyme B was significantly restored. In conclusion, high levels of Tim-3 and Galectin-9 in HPV positive cervical cancer patients play roles in the progression of disease by promoting Treg cells to inhibit the cytotoxic function of Th1 and CD8+ T cells. Tim-3/Galectin-9 may serve as a new immunotherapy target for patients with HPV positive cervical cancer."

To address this, we isolated human PARL expressed in yeast and used FRET-based kinetic assays to measure proteolytic activity in vitro. We show that PARL activity in detergent is enhanced by cardiolipin, a lipid enriched in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

These PARL KO mice present with a severe motor defect, the loss of gray matter (cell bodies of neurons) in the cortex, and early lethality. The mitochondria of the PARL KO mice have a distinct morphology lacking cristae that precedes neurodegeneration in gray matter (13Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M.

These studies emphasize the essential nature of the PARL-type proteases for cell viability across evolution. The PARL protease is a member of the rhomboid intramembrane protease family (17Ticha A.

Their functions range from cleavage and release of membrane-tethered signaling molecules to membrane protein degradation (17Ticha A. Collis B. Strisovsky K.

Intramembrane proteolysis at a glance: From signalling to protein degradation.J. Cell Sci. 2019; 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Regulation of PARL activity at the molecular level is thought to occur via posttranslational modifications. Different forms of PARL have been identified in various tissues as a result of processing events; these include a protein with a mitochondrial matrix targeting sequence (MTS), a full-length mature form after removal of the MTS (PARLΔ55), and a truncated form derived from cleavage at residue S77 (PARLΔ77), referred to as β-cleavage (20Jeyaraju D.V. McBride H.M. Hill R.B. Pellegrini L. Structural and mechanistic basis of Parl activity and regulation.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of this truncated form of PARL in tissue culture was shown to alter mitochondrial morphology leading to fusion defects and hence has been suggested to be more active (20Jeyaraju D.V. McBride H.M. Hill R.B. Pellegrini L. Structural and mechanistic basis of Parl activity and regulation.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was shown by others that truncation of PARL leads to decreased processing of PINK1 (7Shi G. Lee J.R. Grimes D.A. Racacho L. Ye D. Yang H. Ross O.A. Farrer M. McQuibban G.A. Bulman D.E. Functional alteration of PARL contributes to mitochondrial dysregulation in Parkinson's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 1966-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The truncation site at S77 was shown to be phosphorylated in response to stress, an event that influences β-cleavage of PARL and its activity in tissue culture cells (21Shi G. McQuibban G.A. The mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL is regulated by PDK2 to integrate mitochondrial quality control and metabolism.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 1458-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this putative regulatory switch remains to be determined, and it has not yet been established if PARLΔ77 is generated by PARL itself or other mitochondrial proteases. Despite this, PARL has not been characterized at the molecular level and thus the importance of β-cleavage in its regulation remains unclear. Our analysis with human recombinant PARL, comparing full-length and the truncated β-cleavage form, allows us to determine kinetics of substrate cleavage and examine the parameters influencing PARL activity. We evaluated PARL activity using SDS-PAGE and FRET-based fluorescent assays with peptide substrates. We observe that β-cleavage increases the catalytic activity of PARL. When PARL is reconstituted in a lipid environment similar to that found in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), we reveal similar substrate specificities yet at an enhanced catalytic rate of cleavage of all substrate peptides when compared with those measured with the enzyme in detergent micelles. In addition, we observe that PARL activity was increased by cardiolipin (CL). Multiplex substrate profiling reveals a substrate preference for PARL with a bulky side chain Phe in P1, which is distinct from the small side chain residues recognized by most bacterial rhomboids. Together, this work provides characterization of the PARL protease and further extends our mechanistic understanding of this important safeguard of mitochondrial homeostasis. To examine the molecular features that determine PARL activity, we took an approach to express and purify recombinant PARL to study it in vitro. Human PARL was cloned into a His-tagged pPICZ expression vector where we added a C-terminal Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tag, which allowed us to monitor protein expression in Pichia pastoris (22Brooks C.L. Morrison M. Joanne Lemieux M. Rapid expression screening of eukaryotic membrane proteins in Pichia pastoris.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PARL precursor, with the MTS intact, resulted in poor yield (results not shown). The full-length mature form (PARLΔ55), a truncated version representing β-cleavage (PARLΔ77), and a mutant with impaired-β-cleavage PARLΔ55-S77N were successfully expressed (Figs. 1A and S1). In addition, the active site mutant PARLΔ77-S277A was also generated. Recombinant PARL proteins were purified using affinity chromatography from dodecylmaltoside (DDM)-solubilized membrane fractions, followed by removal of the GFP-His-tag. Milligram quantities of all PARL variants were obtained using this expression system. The oligomeric states of expressed PARL proteases were examined using SEC, which revealed that PARL existed in a monomeric form in detergent solution (Fig. S2). To assess if the recombinant PARL was active, we first examined the cleavage of the transmembrane (TM) domain of PGAM5 fused to an N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) and a C-terminal Thioredoxin 1 domain (Fig. 1B). The approach of using a substrate TM segment fused to MBP was undertaken before for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboids and the presence of the tag did not affect their ability to cleave the substrates (23Strisovsky K.

Chem. 2017; 292: 2703-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of the MBP-PGAM5 fusion protein with PARLΔ77 in the presence of CL to increase rhomboid activity (see below), new bands, representing the N- and C-terminal cleavage products, were observed on SDS-PAGE. These bands are not present following incubation of MBP-PGAM5 with PARLΔ77-S277A (Figs. 1B and S3). This assay confirmed the functionality of human mitochondrial PARL generated in the P. pastoris system. To assess the catalytic properties of PARL protease and factors influencing its activity, we designed a FRET-PINK170–134 substrate with fluorophores that were previously used to measure bacterial rhomboid protease activity in vitro (26Arutyunova E. Panwar P. Skiba P.M. Gale N. Mak M.W. Lemieux M.J. Allosteric regulation of rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Arutyunova E. Smithers C.C. Corradi V. Espiritu A.C. Young H.S. Tieleman D.P. Lemieux M.J. Probing catalytic rate enhancement during intramembrane proteolysis.Biol. Chem. 2016; 397: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Residues 70–134 of PINK1, encompassing the predicted TM segment (residues 89–111) and adjacent residues, were cloned between two fluorescent protein reporters, YPet and CyPet, to allow for FRET activity measurement upon cleavage (Fig. 1C) (28Alford S.C. Wu J. Zhao Y. Campbell R.E. Knopfel T. Optogenetic reporters.Biol. Cell. 2013; 105: 14-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Given the fact that PARL protease has never been expressed and studied in vitro, all parameters of the activity assay were optimized. First, we examined the pH dependence of PARL activity using FRET-PINK170–134 substrate and determined that the optimum was pH 7.0 (Fig. S4). Lipids are known to influence membrane protein function (29Bondar A.N. Lemieux M.J. Reactions at biomembrane interfaces.Chem. Rev. 2019; 119: 6162-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, for example, increased CL amounts are observed during mitochondrial stress, which influences protein function at the molecular level (30Ruggiero F.M. Cafagna F. Petruzzella V. Gadaleta M.N. Quagliariello E. Lipid composition in synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria from rat brains and effect of aging.J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effect of the three primary lipids present in the IMM, namely CL, phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) on PARLΔ77 activity with the FRET-PINK70–134 substrate (Fig. 1D) (31Comte J. Maisterrena B. Gautheron D.C. Lipid composition and protein profiles of outer and inner membranes from pig heart mitochondria. Comparison with microsomes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 419: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The lipid-free conditions were used as a baseline and consisted of PARLΔ77 reconstituted in detergent (DDM) micelles, while all lipid conditions consisted of a mixed detergent-lipid micelle system. First we assess the effect of different classes of lipids. Compared with conditions with no lipid added, POPE at a molar ratio of 50:1 and 100:1 did not significantly increase PARL activity while POPC at a molar ratio of 50:1 increased activity by fourfold. CL at a molar ratio of 50:1 resulted in a significant increase in PARL activity and to a lesser extent at a molar ratio of 100:1 (Fig. 1D). In order to precisely determine the optimal concentration of CL for PARL activity, the initial velocities of PARL-mediated cleavage of FRET-PINK170–134 were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of CL. The influence of CL on PARL activity resulted in a bell-shaped curve with the 25:1 CL: PARL molar ratio having the most significant effect (Fig. S5). This data indicates that CL modulates the activity of the mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL by enhancing its overall structural stability through protein–lipid interactions, similar to other mitochondrial proteins (32Ghosh S. Basu Ball W. Madaris T.R. Srikantan S. Madesh M. Mootha V.K. Gohil V.M. An essential role for cardiolipin in the stability and function of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cardiolipin is required in vivo for the stability of bacterial translocon and optimal membrane protein translocation and insertion.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, CL was included in all subsequent protein preparations of detergent-solubilized PARL at the last purification step. Next, we used this optimized preparation and assay to determine the catalytic parameters of PARL. The cleavage of FRET-PINK170–134 by DDM-solubilized PARLΔ55 and PARLΔ77 in the presence of CL obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Fig. 1E and Table S1) and revealed slow rates of cleavage, 0.43 ± 0.09 h−1 and 0.73 ± 0.06 h−1, respectively. This, however, reflects the tendency of intramembrane proteases to have slow turnover rates (26Arutyunova E. Panwar P. Skiba P.M. Gale N. Mak M.W. Lemieux M.J.

The truncation of PARLΔ55 to PARLΔ77 was proposed to be autocatalytic (22Brooks C.L. Morrison M. Joanne Lemieux M. Rapid expression screening of eukaryotic membrane proteins in Pichia pastoris.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, this has not been confirmed in vitro. To ensure the integrity of PARLΔ55 in our kinetic assays, we tested if self-truncation occurred in vitro under the conditions of activity measurements. Purified PARLΔ55 was incubated at 37 °C at the concentration of 0.8 mg/ml for 4 h (the longest time used for kinetic assay), and protein samples taken after 2 and 4 h were run on SDS-PAGE (Fig. S6). No additional band corresponding to molecular weight of PARLΔ77 was observed after the time of incubation, suggesting that no autocleavage occurs under these conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic parameters of PARLΔ55S77N, the mutant that prevents β-cleavage, were similar to PARLΔ55, which again suggests that PARLΔ55 does not undergo auto processing since one would expect different catalytic parameters for PARLΔ77 (Fig. 1E). To further evaluate the cleavage of other known substrates of PARL, we adopted a more facile system to examine cleavage of multiple substrates and generated internally quenched (IQ) peptide substrates (25Ticha A.

Kinetic analysis using both full-length and β-truncated PARL with IQ-PINK199–108, IQ-PGAM520–29, and IQ-Smac/Diablo51–60 peptide substrates was first performed in detergent, which revealed similar Michaelis–Menten kinetics for all peptides (Fig. 1F). The assay allowed us to determine the catalytic parameters for the three primary PARL substrates and examine the substrate specificity (Fig. 2, Tables S2–S4). Similar to previously shown kinetic parameters for FRET-PINK170–134 cleavage, a slow turnover rate for all substrates was observed, with the kcat values ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 h−1 with the Smac/Diablo peptide being the fastest cleaved and PGAM5 being the most efficiently cleaved based on kcat/KM value. These data also revealed that the turnover rates of PARL proteases, with the short IQ-PINK199–108 peptide and longer FRET-PINK170–134 substrate, were comparable, being, for example, 0.42 ± 0.03 h−1 with PINK1 peptide and 0.46 ± 0.09 h−1 with FRET- PINK170–134 for full-length PARLΔ55 (Fig. 1E, Tables S1 and S2). We conclude that the regions adjacent to the PINK1 cleavage site do not influence the cleavage process, and thus the IQ-peptide substrates are suitable for performing further kinetic studies. To assess the activity of recombinant PARL toward known substrates in a lipid bilayer, full-length and β-truncated PARL were reconstituted in proteoliposomes (PLs) using Escherichia coli lipids that closely resemble the composition of the IMM (31Comte J. Maisterrena B. Gautheron D.C. Lipid composition and protein profiles of outer and inner membranes from pig heart mitochondria. Comparison with microsomes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 419: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We determined that the EDANS/Dabcyl - FRET tags prevented incorporation of the substrates into PL; however, the substrate could still be cleaved since the active site is proposed to be near the lipid/water interface (40Lemieux M.J. Fischer S.J. Cherney M.M. Bateman K.S. James M.N. The crystal structure of the rhomboid peptidase from Haemophilus influenzae provides insight into intramembrane proteolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Crystal structure of a rhomboid family intramembrane protease.Nature. 2006; 444: 1-5Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar) analogous to bacterial rhomboid proteases (Fig. 1). To calculate the specific activity of the protease, we quantified the fraction of PARL in the PLs with an outward facing active site using a membrane semipermeable activity-based TAMRA-labeled fluorophosphonate probe (42Sherratt A.R. Blais D.R. Ghasriani H. Pezacki J.P. Goto N.K. Activity-based protein profiling of the Escherichia coli GlpG rhomboid protein delineates the catalytic core.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7794-7803Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In PLs ∼70% of PARL could be labeled with the probe revealing the proportion with the active site in an outward-facing manner (Fig. S7). These values were used to calculate specific activity of the PARL protease. Next, we compared cleavage of three IQ-peptide substrates by reconstituted full-length mature PARLΔ55 and the β-truncated form, PARLΔ77 (Fig. 3, Tables S5 and S6). Overall, we observed that the lipid environment increased the activity of both forms of PARL toward all substrates and the reaction still displayed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Fig. 3, A and C and Table S5 and S6); only negligible background activity was detected for inactive PARLΔ77-S277A (Fig. S8). Of all peptides assessed, cleavage of Smac/Diablo by β-truncated PARLΔ77 was the fastest with a turnover rate of 58 ± 7 h−1, or 1.0 ± 0.1 min−1, and PGAM5 was the preferred substrate with the lowest KM and the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 26 ± 8 μM−1 h−1 (Table S6), which agrees with the data obtained in a detergent environment. To examine if CL influences PARL activity in a membrane environment, we prepared PL samples containing β-truncated PARL and conducted detailed kinetic analysis with the three IQ-peptide substrates (Fig. 3B). Two independent PL samples were generated: the first consisted only of POPC and POPE, while the second also contained CL. The turnover rates for the PINK1, PGAM5, and Smac/Diablo peptide substrates with the two PL samples demonstrated a trend similar to that observed in the detergent environment (Fig. 3C). When CL was omitted from the PL, we observed two to tenfold slower turnover rates of cleavage for IQ-peptide substrates by β-truncated PARL (Fig. 3B and Table S7). This result again demonstrates that CL, which is specific to the inner mitochondrial membrane where PARL resides, influences the proteolytic activity of PARL. The influence of PARL truncations on activity has been"

However, the mechanisms that initiate these pathways remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of a pro-inflammatory cytokine––osteopontin (OPN), in retinal microglia activation process along with the underlying mechanisms in glaucoma. A rat chronic ocular hypertension (COH) model was established presenting an increase in retinal OPN level and activation of microglia. Primary microglia cells were isolated and cultured under a pressure culture system showing heightened expressions of microglia-derived OPN with changes in inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). OPN and OPN neutralizing antibody (Anti-OPN) interventions were both applied systems for comparison, and cross-referenced with OPN knockdown in vitro. JAK/STAT, NF-κB, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK, recognized as the primary signaling pathways related to microglia activation, were then screened on whether they can facilitate OPN to act on microglia and their impact on specific inhibitors. Thereafter, retrograde labeling of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and flash visual evoked potentials (F-VEP) were used to investigate neuron protection in context of each blockade. Results suggest that OPN is able to enhance the proliferation and activation of retinal microglia in experimental glaucoma which may play a role in the glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and contribute to the eventual RGCs loss and vision function impairment. Such effect may be mediated through the regulation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway."

However, limited studies have examined the trends of these differences in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Objectives To study the trends in sex and gender differences in ACS using the Malaysian NCVD-ACS Registry. Methods Data from 24 hospitals involving 35,232 ACS patients (79.44% men and 20.56% women) from 1 st. Jan 2012 to 31 st. Dec 2016 were analysed. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, coronary risk factors, anthropometrics, treatments and outcomes. Analyses were done for ACS as a whole and separately for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Non-STEMI and unstable angina. These were then compared to published data from March 2006 to February 2010 which included 13,591 ACS patients (75.8% men and 24.2% women). Results Women were older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous heart failure and renal failure than men. Women remained less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and statin. Women were less likely to undergo angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) despite an overall increase. In the STEMI cohort, despite a marked increase in presentation with Killip class IV, women were less likely to received primary PCI or fibrinolysis and had longer median door-to-needle and door-to-balloon time compared to men, although these had improved. Women had higher unadjusted in-hospital, 30-Day and 1-year mortality rates compared to men for the STEMI and NSTEMI cohorts. After multivariate adjustments, 1-year mortality remained significantly higher for women with STEMI (adjusted OR: 1.31 (1.09–1.57), p&lt;0.003) but were no longer significant for NSTEMI cohort. Conclusion Women continued to have longer system delays, receive less aggressive pharmacotherapies and invasive treatments with poorer outcome. There is an urgent need for increased effort from all stakeholders if we are to narrow this gap."
https://openalex.org/W3127277163,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the resilience of public health, including diagnostic testing, antiviral development and transmission prevention. In addition, it also affected the medical education of many residents and learners throughout the country. Historically, physicians undergoing their residency training were not involved in telemedicine. However, in response to the challenges faced due to COVID-19, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) released a provision in May 2020 to allow residents to participate in telemedicine. Method Lincoln Medical Center, located in the South Bronx of New York City, currently has 115 Internal Medicine residents, and telemedicine clinic visits have been conducted by residents since June 2020. An anonymous 25-question survey was sent to all Internal Medicine residents between August 8, 2020 to August 14, 2020. Result Of 115 residents, 95 (82.6% of the residents) replied to this questionnaire. Residents revealed feeling less confident in managing chronic diseases through telemedicine visits. The survey also shows that 83.1% of respondents prefer in-person visits during their training, 65.3% feel that the telemedicine experience will affect their future career choice, and 67.4% would prefer less than 50% of visits to be telemedicine in their future careers. Outcome The purpose of the new ACGME rules allowing telemedicine was to prevent the undertraining of residents and maintain health care for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affects residency training and the experiences of residents, which in turn can influence their future career plans."

To examine the response of bats to landscape condition and the application of prescribed fire, in the winter of 2019, we mist-netted and affixed radio-transmitters to 16 Lasiurine bats, primarily Seminole bats ( Lasiurus seminolus ) at Camp Blanding Joint Training Center in northern Florida. We then located day-roost sites to describe roost attributes. For five Seminole bats, one eastern red bat ( Lasiurus borealis ), and one hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus ), we applied prescribed burns in the roost area to observe bat response in real-time. Generally, Seminole bats selected day-roosts in mesic forest stands with high mean fire return intervals. At the roost tree scale, Seminole day-roosts tended to be larger, taller and in higher canopy dominance classes than surrounding trees. Seminole bats roosted in longleaf ( Pinus palustris) , slash ( Pinus elliotii ) and loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) more than expected based on availability, whereas sweetbay ( Magnolia virginiana ), water oak ( Quercus nigra ) and turkey oak ( Quercus laevis ), were roosted in less than expected based on availability. Of the seven roosts subjected to prescribed burns, only one male Seminole bat and one male eastern red bat evacuated during or immediately following burning. In both cases, these bats had day-roosted at heights lower than the majority of other day-roosts observed during our study. Our results suggest Seminole bats choose winter day-roosts that both maximize solar exposure and minimize risks associated with fire. Nonetheless, because selected day-roosts largely were fire-dependent or tolerant tree species, application of fire does need to periodically occur to promote recruitment and retention of suitable roost sites."

Numerous observations concur that elevated membrane cholesterol (CLR) inhibits the activity of homomeric BKs consisting of channel-forming alpha subunits. In mammalian smooth muscle, however, native BKs include accessory KCNMB1 (β1) subunits, which enable BK activation at physiological intracellular calcium. Here, we studied the effect of CLR enrichment on BK currents from rat cerebral artery myocytes. Using inside-out patches from middle cerebral artery (MCA) myocytes at [Ca2+]free=30 μM, we detected BK activation in response to in vivo and in vitro CLR enrichment of myocytes. While a significant increase in myocyte CLR was achieved within 5 min of CLR in vitro loading, this brief CLR enrichment of membrane patches decreased BK currents, indicating that BK activation by CLR requires a protracted cellular process. Indeed, blocking intracellular protein trafficking with brefeldin A (BFA) not only prevented BK activation but led to channel inhibition upon CLR enrichment. Surface protein biotinylation followed by Western blotting showed that BFA blocked the increase in plasmalemmal KCNMB1 levels achieved via CLR enrichment. Moreover, CLR enrichment of arteries with naturally high KCNMB1 levels, such as basilar and coronary arteries, failed to activate BK currents. Finally, CLR enrichment failed to activate BK channels in MCA myocytes from KCNMB1-/- mouse while activation was detected in their wild-type (C57BL/6) counterparts. In conclusion, the switch in CLR regulation of BK from inhibition to activation is determined by a trafficking-dependent increase in membrane levels of KCNMB1 subunits.

Considering the critical role of elevated CLR in cardiovascular pathology, major efforts have been put forth for uncovering the molecular mechanisms that determine the mode of vascular smooth muscle BK current responses to increased CLR levels. In this tissue, BK channels consist of a homotetramer of channel-forming alpha (slo1) subunits that is accompanied by small accessory proteins of beta1 (KCNMB1) and gamma (LRRC26) types (6Orio P. Rojas P. Ferreira G. Latorre R. New disguises for an old channel: MaxiK channel beta-subunits.News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 156-161PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brenner R. Peréz G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M.

Calcium- and voltage-gated BK channels in vascular smooth muscle.Pflugers Arch. 2018; 470: 1271-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Upon activation, BK channels generate outward potassium currents that dampen the membrane potential toward its resting level and thus oppose depolarization-induced calcium entry and myocyte contraction (6Orio P. Rojas P. Ferreira G. Latorre R. New disguises for an old channel: MaxiK channel beta-subunits.News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 156-161PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J.

Calcium- and voltage-gated BK channels in vascular smooth muscle.Pflugers Arch. 2018; 470: 1271-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present work, we employed a rat model of high-CLR diet, patch-clamp electrophysiology on freshly isolated cerebral artery myocytes, CLR in vitro enrichment, surface protein biotinylation followed by Western blotting, and KCNMB1 knockout (KO) mouse to demonstrate that the CLR effect on native smooth muscle BK current was determined by a CLR-driven increase in surface KCNMB1 protein. Our findings contribute to explain the differential outcomes from earlier studies on CLR modification of BK currents and open a new avenue for designing pharmacological interventions against unwanted effects of elevated CLR on vascular smooth muscle BK channel activity. First, we established the efficiency of the CLR enrichment in vitro procedure using fluorescence staining with filipin after a 20 min-long incubation of rat MCAs in MβCD:CLR complex. The cerebral artery smooth muscle layer within the tunica media was identified by a positive immunofluorescence staining against BK channel smooth muscle-specific KCNMB1 protein, which is scarce in the endothelium (Fig. S1, A and B) (32Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A. Liu Y. Aldrich R.W. Cloning and functional characterization of novel large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6453-6461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunostaining against the endothelial cell marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD-31) showed a fluorescence peak within the presumed tunica intima layer with scarce (if any) staining in tunica media. This fluorescence pattern is opposite to that of KCNMB1 labeling (Fig. S1, A and C and (33Miettinen M. Lindenmayer A.E. Chaubal A. Endothelial cell markers CD31, CD34, and BNH9 antibody to H- and Y-antigens--evaluation of their specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of vascular tumors and comparison with von Willebrand factor.Mod. Pathol. 1994; 7: 82-90PubMed Google Scholar)). Moreover, nuclei and cytoplasm of BK KCNMB1-positive cells were in a perpendicular orientation, as opposed to CD-31-positive cells, which were oriented parallel to the artery side (Fig. S1A and (34North K. Bisen S. Dopico A.M. Bukiya A.N. Tyrosine 450 in the voltage- and calcium-gated potassium channel of large conductance channel pore-forming (slo1) subunit mediates cholesterol protection against alcohol-induced constriction of cerebral arteries.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2018; 367: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). The perpendicular orientation of cells relative to the artery side was used to identify smooth muscle cells in our filipin staining studies. Z-stack imaging of MCA smooth muscle layer detected a 1.5-fold averaged enhancement of filipin-associated fluorescence in the CLR-enriched arteries when compared with their counterparts with naïve CLR (p = 0.0087, Fig. 1, A and B). This finding was validated via biochemical detection of CLR level in MCA lysates (Fig. S2). To determine whether CLR modifies the activity of native BK channels in rat MCA smooth muscle, we recorded BK currents in membrane patches from freshly isolated myocytes that were either loaded with CLR for ≥20 min prior to patch excision or incubated in CLR-free bath solution for the same time interval to maintain naïve CLR levels (control). Free Ca2+ in recording solutions was set at 30 μM to mimic calcium levels in the vicinity of the BK channel during myocyte contraction (30Pérez G.J. Bonev A.D. Nelson M.T. Micromolar Ca(2+) from sparks activates Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels in rat cerebral artery smooth muscle.Am. J. Phys. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1769-C1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with findings from other laboratories, BK channel open probability and Vhalf data exhibited a noticeable variability across patches (Fig. 1, D and E). A parallel shift of current–voltage curves along the voltage- (x-) axis has been reported for homomeric BK channels made of different isoforms (35DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H.

Aldrich R.W. Coupling between voltage sensor activation, Ca2+ binding and channel opening in large conductance (BK) potassium channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 267-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We also observed variability in the steepness of the current–voltage curves across patches (Fig. 1, D and E). A reduced steepness of current–voltage curves is characteristic of the presence of accessory KCNMB1 subunits within the BK channel protein complex (41Cox D.H. Aldrich R.W. Role of the β1 Subunit in large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel gating energetics: Mechanisms of enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity.J. Gen.

Physiol. 2005; 125: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the variability in the current–voltage curve steepness is consistent with the very likely differential distribution of accessory KCNMB1 subunits within functional BK channels across patches. Indeed, the number of these accessory subunits can vary between 1 and 4 per functional BK channel, with BK current characteristics changing incrementally per each KCNMB subunit addition (reviewed in (43Gonzalez-Perez V. Lingle C.J. Regulation of BK channels by beta and gamma subunits.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2019; 81: 113-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). Consistent with previous reports (32Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A. Liu Y. Aldrich R.W. Cloning and functional characterization of novel large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4.J. Biol.

The BK channel accessory beta1 subunit determines alcohol-induced cerebrovascular constriction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2779-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Vhalf of BK current at 30 μM [Ca2+]free averaged –53.9 ± 10.9 mV (Fig. 1, C–E). In vitro CLR enrichment of myocytes prior to patch excision robustly increased BK channel activity, as evidenced by a leftward shift in the NPo/NPomax-V curve along the x-axis with a consequent significant decrease in Vhalf (-92.2 ± 10.3 mV; p = 0.0365 when compared with naïve CLR) (Fig. 1, C–E). To ensure that the observed increase in BK channel activity was not exclusive to our particular method of CLR in vitro enrichment, we next conducted experiments in smooth muscle cell patches excised from MCAs that were harvested from rats on a high-CLR diet and from their counterparts on standard rodent chow (control). Subjecting rats to a high-CLR diet for 29–32 weeks significantly increased CLR levels in MCA smooth muscle layer (p = 0.0027, Fig. 2, A and B). Similar to CLR in vitro enrichment, this in vivo route of CLR delivery resulted in a statistically significant upregulation of BK currents with Vhalf decreasing from –39.8 ± 9.8 mV in control to –102.6 ± 11.2 in high-CLR chow (p = 0.0095, Fig. 2, C–E). Consistent with a recent report from our group (45Slayden A. North K. Bisen S. Dopico A.M. Bukiya A.N. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Enrichment of mammalian tissues and Xenopus oocytes with cholesterol.J. Vis. Exp. 2020; 157https://doi.org/10.3791/60734Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a time course of MCA in vitro enrichment with CLR showed a statistically significant increase in MCA CLR levels within 5 min of MCA incubation in CLR-enriching solution (Fig. S2). To establish a possible role of the intracellular environment and/or cell organelles other than the plasmalemma in the CLR-driven increase in BK channel activity, patch-clamp experiments were conducted on membrane patches that were perfused with CLR-enriching solution for 5 min following patch excision from the rat MCA myocytes. Remarkably, CLR enrichment of excised patches did not result in increased BK channel activity, a result that contrasts with that obtained after a 5 min-long enrichment of the intact myocyte with CLR immediately prior to patch excision (Fig. 3A). Moreover, cell-free enrichment of patches with CLR actually decreased BK channel activity, as evidenced by a rightward shift in NPo/NPomax-V curve along the x-axis and consequent significant increase in Vhalf: 32.9 ± 4.6 mV versus -51.5 ± 5.2 mV in patches that were CLR-enriched prior to excision (p = 0.0260) (Fig. 3, B and C). The fact that a 5 min in vitro incubation of myocytes in CLR-enriching media rendered effective increase in CLR levels of the myocyte yet it was not sufficient to evoke BK channel potentiation indicates that CLR diffusion across membranes cannot simply account for the CLR-driven activation of BK currents observed with longer incubation times. Moreover, the differential responses of BK channels to CLR enrichment of the intact cell versus the isolated membrane patch underscore that CLR-enrichment-evoked channel potentiation requires the intracellular environment and/or organelles additional to the plasmalemma. To test whether this regulatory role of the intracellular environment on CLR action involved actual protein trafficking between internal organelles, we utilized brefeldin A (BFA). BFA is a pan-inhibitor of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex (46Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. Brefeldin A causes disassembly of the Golgi complex and accumulation of secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hence some nonspecific effects cannot be ruled out. In the presence of BFA, however, the fundamental phenotype of the BK channels under study was preserved (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with our hypothesis, block of endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi traffic with 10 μM brefeldin A (BFA; (47Leo M.D. Bannister J.P. Narayanan D. Nair A. Grubbs J.E. Gabrick K.S. Boop F.A.

Smooth muscle-prevalent KCNMB1 accessory proteins in BK channel complexes increase the apparent calcium sensitivity and upregulate BK currents (6Orio P. Rojas P. Ferreira G. Latorre R.

Compared with BK alpha subunits, KCNMB1 is primarily an intracellular protein (47Leo M.D. Bannister J.P. Narayanan D. Nair A. Grubbs J.E. Gabrick K.S. Boop F.A. Jaggar J.H. Dynamic regulation of β1 subunit trafficking controls vascular contractility.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 2361-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our hands, a 20 min-long incubation of rat MCAs in CLR-enriching solution significantly increased KCNMB1 plasmalemmal fraction when compared with MCAs with naïve CLR level (Fig. 5). Consistent with a KCNMB1-driven mechanism to explain the inability of CLR enrichment to increase BK channel activity in the presence of BFA (Fig. 4C), BFA prevented the CLR-driven increase in KCNMB1 plasmalemmal fraction (Figs. 5 and S3). In contrast, BK channel alpha subunit surface protein was similar in naïve CLR (93.5 ± 5.4%), upon CLR enrichment (94.3 ± 4.2%) and CLR enrichment in the presence of BFA (95.0 ± 3.5%) (p = 0.9008 by ANOVA for comparison of all three groups; p = 0.8857 by two-tailed Mann–Whitney test comparing naïve CLR versus CLR enrichment; p = 0.6857 by two-tailed Mann–Whitney test comparing naïve CLR versus CLR enrichment in the presence of BFA) (Fig. 5). To further test the hypothesis that increased KCNMB1 levels in the plasmalemma play a role in CLR-enrichment-driven potentiation of smooth muscle BK current, we evaluated the effect of CLR enrichment in myocytes isolated from basilar (BA) or coronary (CA) artery. These myocytes naturally have higher levels of plasmalemmal KCNMB1 when compared with their MCA counterparts (48Kuntamallappanavar G. Bisen S. Bukiya A.N. Dopico A.M. Differential distribution and functional impact of BK channel beta1 subunits across mesenteric, coronary, and different cerebral arteries of the rat.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Consistent with the proposed major role for KCNMB1 levels in CLR potentiation of BK current, CLR enrichment failed to increase BK currents in BA and CA myocytes (Fig. 6) where KCNMB1 levels are high before CLR loading. Moreover, CLR enrichment of MCA myocytes from rats subjected to high-CLR diet and thus, having elevated KCNMB1 in plasmalemma (49Bukiya A. Dopico A.M. Leffler C.W. Fedinec A.

Indeed, CLR enrichment of these myocytes actually decreased BK channel activity, as evidenced by a rightward shift in NPo/NPomax-V curve along X-axis (Fig. 7B). Consistently, there was a significant increase in Vhalf that reached –37.4 ± 6.1 mV compared with –102.6 ± 11.2 mV observed in patches from myocytes of rats on high-CLR diet without subsequent in vitro enrichment with CLR (p = 0.0286) (Fig. 7C).Figure 7In vitro CLR enrichment of myocytes from MCA of rats on high-CLR diet inhibits BK channels.

https://openalex.org/W3126496681,"Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a vital tool in interventional radiology. Usually, a circular source-detector trajectory is used to acquire a three-dimensional (3D) image. Kinematic constraints due to the patient size or additional medical equipment often cause collisions with the imager while performing a full circular rotation. In a previous study, we developed a framework to design collision-free, patient-specific trajectories for the cases in which circular CBCT is not feasible. Our proposed trajectories included enough information to appropriately reconstruct a particular volume of interest (VOI), but the constraints had to be defined before the intervention. As most collisions are unpredictable, performing an on-the-fly trajectory optimization is desirable. In this study, we propose a search strategy that explores a set of trajectories that cover the whole collision-free area and subsequently performs a search locally in the areas with the highest image quality. Selecting the best trajectories is performed using simulations on a prior diagnostic CT volume which serves as a digital phantom for simulations. In our simulations, the Feature SIMilarity Index (FSIM) is used as the objective function to evaluate the imaging quality provided by different trajectories. We investigated the performance of our methods using three different anatomical targets inside the Alderson-Rando phantom. We used FSIM and Universal Quality Image (UQI) to evaluate the final reconstruction results. Our experiments showed that our proposed trajectories could achieve a comparable image quality in the VOI compared to the standard C-arm circular CBCT. We achieved a relative deviation less than 10% for both FSIM and UQI metrics between the reconstructed images from the optimized trajectories and the standard C-arm CBCT for all three targets. The whole trajectory optimization took approximately three to four minutes."

We assessed the characteristics and risk factors of clinically relevant potential drug–drug interactions to facilitate their efficient monitoring in pediatric intensive care units. This retrospective cohort study reviewed the medical records of 159 patients aged &lt;19 years who were hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit at Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Korea) for ≥3 days between August 2019 and February 2020. Potential drug–drug interactions were screened using the Micromedex Drug-Reax ® system. Clinical relevance of each potential drug–drug interaction was reported with official terminology, magnitude of severity, and causality, and the association with the patient’s clinical characteristics was assessed. In total, 115 patients (72.3%) were exposed to 592 potential interactions of 258 drug pairs. In 16 patients (10.1%), 22 clinically relevant potential drug–drug interactions were identified for 19 drug pairs. Approximately 70% of the clinically relevant potential drug–drug interactions had a severity grade of ≥3. Exposure to potential drug–drug interactions was significantly associated with an increase in the number of administrated medications (6–7 medications, p = 0.006; ≥8, p&lt; 0.001) and prolonged hospital stays (1–2 weeks, p = 0.035; ≥2, p = 0.049). Moreover, clinically relevant potential drug–drug interactions were significantly associated with ≥8 prescribed drugs ( p = 0.019), hospitalization for ≥2 weeks ( p = 0.048), and ≥4 complex chronic conditions ( p = 0.015). Most potential drug–drug interactions do not cause clinically relevant adverse outcomes in pediatric intensive care units. However, because the reactions that patients experience from clinically relevant potential drug–drug interactions are often very severe, there is a medical need to implement an appropriate monitoring system for potential drug–drug interactions according to the pediatric intensive care unit characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3126861715,"UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferases are enzymes that produce UDP-glucose from UTP and glucose-1-phosphate. In Bacillus subtilis 168, UDP-glucose is required for the decoration of wall teichoic acid (WTA) with glucose residues and the formation of glucolipids. The B. subtilis UGPase GtaB is essential for UDP-glucose production under standard aerobic growth conditions, and gtaB mutants display severe growth and morphological defects. However, bioinformatics predictions indicate that two other UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferases are present in B. subtilis. Here, we investigated the function of one of them named YngB. The crystal structure of YngB revealed that the protein has the typical fold and all necessary active site features of a functional UGPase. Furthermore, UGPase activity could be demonstrated in vitro using UTP and glucose-1-phosphate as substrates. Expression of YngB from a synthetic promoter in a B. subtilis gtaB mutant resulted in the reintroduction of glucose residues on WTA and production of glycolipids, demonstrating that the enzyme can function as UGPase in vivo. When WT and mutant B. subtilis strains were grown under anaerobic conditions, YngB-dependent glycolipid production and glucose decorations on WTA could be detected, revealing that YngB is expressed from its native promoter under anaerobic condition. Based on these findings, along with the structure of the operon containing yngB and the transcription factor thought to be required for its expression, we propose that besides WTA, potentially other cell wall components might be decorated with glucose residues during oxygen-limited growth condition."
https://openalex.org/W3129048676,"Background Unhealthy alcohol use among young adults is a major public health concern. Brief motivational interventions for young adults in the Emergency Department (ED) have shown promising but inconsistent results. Methods Based on the literature on brief intervention and motivational interviewing efficacy and active ingredients, we developed a new motivational intervention model for young adults admitted in the ED with alcohol intoxication. Using an iterative qualitative design, we first pre-tested this model by conducting 4 experimental sessions and 8 related semi-structured interviews to evaluate clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions of the intervention’s acceptability and feasibility. We then conducted a consultation meeting with 9 international experts using a nominal group technique. The intervention model was adjusted and finally re-tested by conducting 6 new experimental sessions and 12 related semi-structured interviews. At each round, data collected were analyzed and discussed, and the intervention model updated accordingly. Results Based on the literature, we found 6 axes for developing a new model: High level of relational factors (e.g. empathy, alliance, avoidance of confrontation); Personalized feedback; Enhance discrepancy; Evoke change talk while softening sustain talk, strengthen ability and commitment to change; Completion of a change plan; Devote more time: longer sessions and follow-up options (face-to-face, telephone, or electronic boosters; referral to treatment). A qualitative analysis of the semi-structured interviews gave important insights regarding acceptability and feasibility of the model. Adjustments were made around which information to provide and how, as well as on how to deepen discussion about change with patients having low levels of self-exploration. The experts’ consultation addressed numerous points, such as information and advice giving, and booster interventions. Discussion This iterative, multi-component design resulted in the development of an intervention model embedded in recent research findings and theory advances, as well as feasible in a complex environment. The next step is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of this model."

This work aimed at assessing HCV prevalence and associated risk factors in patients and health-care workers (HCWs) of Ain Shams University (ASU) hospitals in Cairo. Methods We included 500 patients admitted to the internal medicine or surgery hospital from February to July, 2017, as well as 50 HCWs working in these same hospitals. Participants were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. A questionnaire was administered to collect data on demographic characteristics and medical/surgical history. For HCWs, questions on occupational exposures and infection control practices were also included. Results The overall prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 19.80% (95% CI: 16.54–23.52) among participating patients, and 8.00% (95% CI: 0.48–15.52) among participating HCWs. In HCWs, the only risk factors significantly associated with anti-HCV antibodies were age and profession, with higher prevalence in older HCWs and those working as cleaners or porters. In patients, in a multivariate logistic regression, age over 50 (aOR: 3.4 [1.9–5.8]), living outside Cairo (aOR: 2.1 [1.2–3.4]), admission for liver or gastro-intestinal complaints (aOR: 4.2 [1.8–9.9]), and history of receiving parenteral anti-schistosomiasis treatment (aOR: 2.7 [1.2–5.9]) were found associated with anti-HCV antibodies. Conclusions While HCV prevalence among patients has decreased since the last survey performed within ASU hospitals in 2008, it is still significantly higher than in the general population. These results may help better control further HCV spread within healthcare settings in Egypt by identifying at-risk patient profiles upon admission."
https://openalex.org/W3127007475,"The high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein is a transcription-regulating protein located in the nucleus. However, it serves as a damage-associated molecular pattern protein that activates immune cells and stimulates inflammatory cytokines to accentuate neuroinflammation after release from damaged cells. In contrast, Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIPs) are proteins with immunomodulatory effects including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have demonstrated that IAIPs exhibit neuroprotective properties in neonatal rats exposed to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the light chain of IAIPs, bikunin, may exert its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting HMGB1 in a variety of different injury models in adult subjects. The objectives of the current study were to confirm whether HMGB1 is a target of IAIPs by investigating the potential binding characteristics of HMGB1 and IAIPs in vitro, and co-localization in vivo in cerebral cortices after exposure to HI injury. Solid-phase binding assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were used to determine the physical binding characteristics between IAIPs and HMGB1. Cellular localizations of IAIPs-HMGB1 in neonatal rat cortex were visualized by double labeling with anti-IAIPs and anti-HMGB1 antibodies. Solid-phase binding and SPR demonstrated specific binding between IAIPs and HMGB1 in vitro. Cortical cytoplasmic and nuclear co-localization of IAIPs and HMGB1 were detected by immunofluorescent staining in control and rats immediately and 3 hours after HI. In conclusion, HMGB1 and IAIPs exhibit direct binding in vitro and co-localization in vivo in neonatal rats exposed to HI brain injury suggesting HMGB1 could be a target of IAIPs."
https://openalex.org/W3127806701,"Blocking of myostatin and activins effectively counteracts muscle atrophy. However, the potential interaction with physical inactivity and fasting in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis is poorly understood. We used blockade of myostatin and activins by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated follistatin (FS288) overexpression in mouse tibialis anterior muscle. To investigate the effects on muscle protein synthesis, muscles were collected 7 days after rAAV-injection in the nighttime or in the daytime representing high and low levels of activity and feeding, respectively, or after overnight fasting, refeeding, or ad libitum feeding. Muscle protein synthesis was increased by FS288 independent of the time of the day or the feeding status. However, the activation of mTORC1 signaling by FS288 was attenuated in the daytime and by overnight fasting. FS288 also increased the amount of mTOR colocalized with lysosomes, but did not alter their localization toward the sarcolemma. This study shows that FS288 gene delivery increases muscle protein synthesis largely independent of diurnal fluctuations in physical activity and food intake or feeding status, overriding the physiological signals. This is important for eg cachectic and sarcopenic patients with reduced physical activity and appetite. The FS288-induced increase in mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis may be in part driven by increased amount of mTOR colocalized with lysosomes, but not by their localization toward sarcolemma."

Many GH families are composed of enzymes with a single well-defined specificity. In contrast, enzymes from the GH16 family can act on a range of different polysaccharides, including β-glucans and galactans. SCLam, a GH16 member derived from a soil metagenome, an endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6), can cleave both β-1,3 and β-1,4 glycosidic bonds in glucans, such as laminarin, barley β-glucan, and cello-oligosaccharides. A similar cleavage pattern was previously reported for other GH16 family members. However, the molecular mechanisms for this dual cleavage activity on (1,3)- and (1,4)-β-D-glycosidic bonds by laminarinases have not been elucidated. In this sense, we determined the X-ray structure of a presumably inactive form of SCLam cocrystallized with different oligosaccharides.

The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose and hemicellulose, which are the most abundant biopolymers on Earth. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are major enzymes involved in the breakdown of plant cell wall carbohydrates (1Chundawat S.P.S. Beckham G.T. Himmel M.E. Dale B.E.

Owing to the recalcitrance and variation in composition of different plants, tissues, stage, and growth conditions, a wide variety of GHs are required for plant cell wall deconstruction (3Gilbert H.J.

The enzymatic conversion of plant cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable monosaccharides has been extensively studied to produce second-generation biofuels and other chemicals. Furthermore, chemical synthesis of specific oligosaccharides is extremely difficult but can potentially be done with enzymatic technologies (5Bissaro B. Monsan P. Fauré R. O'Donohue M.J. Glycosynthesis in a waterworld: New insight into the molecular basis of transglycosylation in retaining glycoside hydrolases.Biochem. J. 2015; 467: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). GHs typically display hydrolytic activity, where the glycosidic bond is cleaved using water by either a single (inverting) or double (retaining) displacement mechanism. The retaining hydrolysis mechanism occurs in two steps: first, known as glycosylation, when the glycosidic bond is broken to form the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. This step is followed by a second, deglycosylation, step, in which a water molecule acts as an acceptor cleaving the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate through hydrolysis (6Koshland D.E. Application of a theory of enzyme specificity to protein synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, transglycosylation may occur when an oligosaccharide is used as an acceptor during the deglycosylation step, instead of a water molecule (5Bissaro B. Monsan P. Fauré R. O'Donohue M.J.

The main difference between these two subgroups is that, (1,3,1,4)-β-D-glucan endohydrolases hydrolyze only (1,4)-β-D-glycosyl bonds, whereas (1,3/1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan endohydrolases are able to cleave both β-1,3 and β-1,4 bonds (11Strohmeier M.

Previously we described the identification and biochemical characterization of a (1,3/1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan endohydrolase derived from the soil metagenome, named as SCLam (14Alvarez T.M. Liberato M.V.

A novel member of GH16 family derived from sugarcane soil metagenome.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2015; 177: 304-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Of interest, SCLam is able to cleave cellohexaose, which contains only 1,4-β-D-glycosyl linkages. This behavior contradicted the definition of (1,3/1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan endohydrolase stated above. In 1998, Krah et al. reported a similar pattern for the laminarinase LamR from Rhodothermus marinus (15Krah M. Misselwitz R. Politz O. Thomsen K.K. Welfle H. Borriss R.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this broad specificity has not been elucidated. In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural investigation to understand the molecular basis of the cleavage and formation of (1,3)- and (1,4)-β-D-glycosyl bonds by SCLam, via hydrolysis and transglycosylation, respectively. In order to do so, SCLam was crystallized and its inactive mutant form was cocrystallized with different oligosaccharides. The cleavage pattern of SCLam was evaluated with different substrates, such as mixed-linkage (1,3,1,4)-β-D-glucans and mixed linkage gluco- and cello-oligosaccharides. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis with the mutant enzyme was also performed to determine the binding affinities for different oligosaccharides. Finally, molecular dynamic simulations of SCLam complexed with (1,3,1,4)-β-glucopentaose, cellohexaose (C6), and laminarihexaose (L6) provided new insights on the mechanisms of hydrolysis and transglycosylation. As described previously (14Alvarez T.M. Liberato M.V. Cairo J.P.L.F. Paixão D.A.A. Campos B.M. Ferreira M.R. Almeida R.F. Pereira I.O. Bernardes A. Ematsu G.C.G. Chinaglia M.

Furthermore, SCLam was able to cleave cellohexaose, confirming its capacity to cleave β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. To further investigate substrate specificity, SCLam was evaluated in reactions containing a variety of oligosaccharides displaying different proportions and structural organization of β-1,3 and β-1,4 bonds. Initially, SClam activity was evaluated in 1,3-β-D-cellotriosyl-glucose (BGB) and 1,3-β-D-cellobiosyl-cellobiose (BGC), which are gluco-oligosaccharides that contain two β-1,4-bonds and one β-1,3-bond. BGB has the β-1,3-bond on the reducing end and BGC in the middle of the chain (Fig. 1). As shown in Figure 2B, after 12 h of incubation, SCLam (4 μM) was able to completely degrade BGC into smaller oligosaccharides and monosaccharides. On the other hand, BGB was only partially degraded by SCLam (Fig. 2A). These results reveal that SCLam displays a preference for BGC, which possesses the β-1,3 bond in the middle of the chain, in comparison with BGB that has its β-1,3 bond at the reducing end. Next, the activity of SCLam was tested against cello-oligosaccharides (Figs. 2C and S1A). As a result, it was possible to observe the formation of oligosaccharide products with lower DP in all cases, including glucose. However, even after 12 h of reaction, the initial substrates could not be fully degraded. Finally, ScLam promoted the complete degradation of L6 as shown in Figure 2D.Figure 2Evaluation of the SCLam cleavage pattern in different substrates revealed by capillary zone electrophoresis. Activity against the oligosaccharides BGB (A) and BGC (B) was tested in 12-h reactions resulting in glucose and oligosaccharides with two and three degrees of polymerization (DP2 and DP3, respectively). Reactions against cellohexaose (C) and laminarihexaose (D) were performed in different times, resulting in a range of substrates with lower DP down to glucose. The red arrows indicate oligosaccharide products with higher degree of polymerization than the substrate, suggesting transglycosylation activity. The double peaks observed between 5.5 and 6.0 min were assigned as Cellobiose and Laminaribiose (see Fig. S6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The degradation pattern of cello-oligosaccharides observed for SCLam was similar to the laminarinase, LamR, from R. marinus (15Krah M.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the ability to cleave β-1,4 glycosidic bonds could be common to another (1,3/1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucanase from family GH16, we also evaluated the activity of the TpLam from Thermotoga petrophila (17Cota J. Alvarez T.M. Citadini A.P. Santos C.R. de Oliveira Neto M. Oliveira R.R. Pastore G.M. Ruller R. Prade R.A. Murakami M.T. Squina F.M. Mode of operation and low-resolution structure of a multi-domain and hyperthermophilic endo-β-1,3-glucanase from Thermotoga petrophila.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 406: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in C5, under the same conditions evaluated for SCLam. As a result, a similar pattern of cleavage was observed (Fig. S1B), indicating that this ability can be potentially found in other enzyme members of the subgroup classified as (1,3/1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan endohydrolases. Collectively, the assays with ScLam (and TpLam) using cellohexaose (and cellopentaose, respectively) as substrate demonstrated the ordered production of C5 (C4) followed by C4 (C3), C3 (C2, respectively), which is expected for typical exo mode of action when cleaving β-1,4 bonds. The assays demonstrated that SCLam fully cleaves L6 and BGC (Figs. 2 and S3), which present a β-1,3 linkage next to the scissile bond toward the nonreducing end (Fig. 1). Enzymatic reactions (5 nM SCLam) containing L6 and BGC were further monitored by ion chromatography to provide additional insights into the SCLam mode of operation (Figs. 3 and S2). The results indicated a very similar activity rate with L6 and BGC, where both substrates were entirely degraded in about 50 min. However, the L6 products (L5, L4, and L3) may impact the competition for the binding site. In the case of BGC, the primary degradation products are not further degraded. Considering the initial step of the curves (linear degradation phase), SCLam degraded L6 and BGC at rates 2.3 and 1.3 nmol/min, respectively. Therefore, SCLam is slightly more active when cleaving L6 than BGC. As indicated by red arrows in Figure 2 (more evidently represented in Fig. S3), the appearance of peaks corresponding to products of high DP for all evaluated substrates suggests the occurrence of transglycosylation activity, which is a property related to retaining hydrolases (18Sinnott M.L. Catalytic mechanism of enzymic glycosyl transfer.Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), such as GH16 family members (19Johansson P. Brumer H. Baumann M.J. Kallas A.M.

Moreover, SCLamE144S presented evident transglycosylation activity toward all tested substrates, concomitantly with a substantial reduction in hydrolytic activity. As previously described, the substitution of the nucleophile by serine or alanine leads to a decrease in glucosidase activity (21Cheng Y.-S. Huang C.-H. Chen C.-C. Huang T.-Y. Ko T.-P. Huang J.-W. Wu T.-H. Liu J.-R. Guo R.-T. Structural and mutagenetic analyses of a 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase from Paecilomyces thermophila.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Of interest, the mutation of these residues in the sucrose-binding region of invertases also enhances transglycosylation activity (5Bissaro B. Monsan P. Fauré R. O'Donohue M.J. Glycosynthesis in a waterworld: New insight into the molecular basis of transglycosylation in retaining glycoside hydrolases.Biochem. J. 2015; 467: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The putative transglycosylation also explains the appearance of L2 and C2 as products of the cleavage of C6 and L6, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). The binding affinity of SCLam for different oligosaccharides was assessed through ITC, using the inactive mutant SCLamE144S (catalytic nucleophile mutation). The complete description of ITC results is shown in Table 1 and the corresponding graphs are displayed in Figure S4.Table 1Thermodynamic parameters calculated from ITC for SCLamE144S interaction with different oligosaccharidesLigandKa × 104 (M−1)ΔG (kcal mol−1)ΔH (kcal mol−1)TΔS (kcal mol−1)nBGB66.7 (±1.4)−7.81−16.10 (±0.03)−8.291.2 (±0.01)L6 site 117.8 (±2.2)−6.93−17.80 (±0.11)−10.87C6 site 19.7 (±0.56)−6.69−6.54 (±0.06)0.15BGC0.59 (±0.07)−5.08−11.5 (±4.29)−6.421.21 (±0.42)L6 site 2NDNDNDNDC6 site 2NDNDNDNDC4NDNDNDNDNDND, not determined.The parameters for BGB and BGC curves were calculated using single-site binding models, while for L6 and C6 a sequential binding model was applied.

The parameters for BGB and BGC curves were calculated using single-site binding models, while for L6 and C6 a sequential binding model was applied. For L6 and C6 site 2, the parameters could not be calculated with reasonable errors, as well as for C4. As revealed by crystallographic structures, site 1 corresponds to the catalytic negative subsites and site 2, to the positive subsites. ITC curves of SCLamE144S to BGB and BGC ligands were fitted with single-site binding models. However, a sequential binding model had to be used to properly fit the L6 binding curve. For C6, both models generated a reasonable fit (Fig. S4), but the statistics from the single-site binding model resulted in n = 1.81, indicating a second site. Hence, the sequential binding model was also used for C6. All interactions resulted from favorable enthalpy, but a variation in entropy was observed among the ligands, which is correlated to the presence or absence of the β-1,3 glycosidic bond. As shown in Table 1, interactions of SCLamE144S with BGB, L6, and BGC, all presenting β-1,3 linkages, led to a considerable reduction in entropy. By contrast, the thermodynamics of binding to C6 is defined by a lower enthalpic contribution, with a small, but positive, entropic component. The ligands composed of a β-1,3 linkage at the reducing end (BGB and L6) showed higher affinity for SCLamE144S compared with BGC, C6, and C4. The highest affinity for SCLamE144S was observed for BGB (Ka = 66.7 × 104 M−1) followed by L6 (Ka = 17.8 × 104 M−1), C6 (Ka = 9.7 × 104 M−1), and BGC (Ka = 0.6 × 104 M−1). C4 ligand displayed very low affinity for SCLamE144S, and the data could not be fitted to a binding model. According to activity data, it was expected that the β-1,3-containing substrates (BGB and L6) would have higher affinity to SCLamE144S in comparison with cello-oligosaccharides. The SCLamE144S showed a 100-fold higher affinity to BGB than to BGC. This result is in contrast to the activity assays where the enzyme displays stronger preference for BGC over BGB (Fig. 2). The reason for this apparent contradiction can be explained by the crystallographic structures, which showed a trisaccharide with β-1,3 linkage at the reducing end bound to only negative subsites, a position not suitable for cleavage (discussed below). In summary, BGB may have high affinity to bind into negative subsites, thus preventing cleavage, whereas the BGC structure leads to optimal binding for hydrolysis. The crystallographic structures of SCLam and SCLamE144S were determined at resolutions varying from 1.5 to 2.2 Å. Statistics from data collection and refinement are given in Table S1. All structures have a monomer in the asymmetric unit, and all amino acids from SCLam were built in the final models. The amino acid residues of the SCLamE144S models that were not built owing to poor electron density are shown in Table S2. The six models generated, including the wildtype and ligand-bound mutant, were nearly identical. Their overlap resulted in an RMSD of 0.228 Å, and all amino acid residues in the binding site have the same positions and orientations. The unique difference is the presence of a glycerol molecule, modeled in three alternative conformations, at subsite -1 and the position of the N-terminal loop in SCLam. Owing to the absence of ligands, the N-terminal region in SCLam is fitted to one end of the binding cleft, with the residue M1 occupying the subsite +2 and part of +1 (Fig. S5). In contrast, the N-terminal regions in all SCLamE144S structures are solvent exposed and exhibit multiple conformations. The enzyme SCLam has the typical β-jellyroll fold of GH16 family. This fold is characterized by two curved β-sheets with loops connecting the β-strands (Fig. 4A). The substrate-binding site is located on the concave face and is composed of the catalytic residues E144 and E149 (defined as nucleophile and acid/base, respectively) as well as other residues responsible for the substrate anchoring (Fig. 4B). All structures have a calcium-binding site with a Ca2+, heptacoordinated by a hydroxyl group from the E28, G72, and D258 main chain; D258 side chain; and three waters (Fig. 4C). The location of the ion was inferred by comparison with similar structures. Although SCLamE144S has been crystallized with 0.1 to 0.2 mM magnesium chloride, the SCLam crystal was obtained in malic acid and all the structures have the same electron density representing the atom. Therefore, the Ca2+ probably came from the bacterial host. The calcium-binding site is partially conserved in the GH16 family (22Qin H.-M. Miyakawa T. Inoue A. Nakamura A. Nishiyama R. Ojima T.

Although we did not manage to obtain the apo form of the mutated enzyme, the structures of SCLamE144S cocrystallized with five different substrates, BGB, BGC, C3, C6, and L6, were solved. It is surprising that, in all structures of enzyme-ligand complexes, except for SCLamE144S/L6, clear electron densities confirm the presence of a 1,3-β-D-cellobiosyl-glucose (G3), where the β-1,3 linkage is located at the reducing end, from subsite −3 to −1 (Fig. 5). SCLamE144S/L6 reveals a laminaribiose (L2) at subsites −2 and −1, and a continuous electron density from carbon C3 of glucose at subsite −2 suggests that there is at least another glucose monomer, resulting in a laminaritriose (L3) or longer oligosaccharide. This third glucose could not be modeled owing to poor electron density. Considering that C6 and C3 comprise exclusively 1,4 glycosidic bonds, the presence of a glucotriose containing a β-1,3 glycosidic bond can only be explained by substrate cleavage together with transglycosylation activity of the mutant. The presence of the same ligand (G3) in most structures, even when the enzyme was cocrystallized with cello-oligosaccharides, indicates a high affinity of G3 for this site. It is also noteworthy that all SCLamE144S structures have an α-anomeric glycan in subsite −1. According to Cheng et al. (21Cheng Y.-S. Huang C.-H. Chen C.-C. Huang T.-Y. Ko T.-P. Huang J.-W. Wu T.-H. Liu J.-R. Guo R.-T. Structural and mutagenetic analyses of a 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase from Paecilomyces thermophila.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although the proportion of α/β anomers in solution is 50:50, the nucleophile mutation to serine can shift its preference toward α configuration. Considering the positive subsites, SCLamE144S/C3 has a cellobiose at subsites +1 and +2. SCLamE144S/L6 contains a glucose at subsite +1 and a continuous electron density resembling another glucose at subsite +2, which was not modeled owing to uncertainty about the precise orientation of the ligand in this position. Furthermore, SCLamE144S/C6 has a less precise electron density at subsite +1 that could be a glucose. The electron densities found in these subsites are not perfectly defined (Fig. 5). It is therefore possible that more flexible oligosaccharides are occupying the positive subsites. In contrast, SCLamE144S/BGB and SCLamE144S/BGC do not have a clear electron density at positive subsites. Coincidentally, ITC curves from BGB and BGC were fitted to a single-site binding model. No other undefined electron density was observed in these structures. Thus, we may conclude that the negative subsites could be the ""site 1"" described based on th"

Although the pathogenic mechanisms of aging and AMD remain unclear, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is known to induce oxidative stress, morphometric changes, and EMT as a senescence-promoting factor. In this study, we examined whether intravitreal injection of TGF-β1 into the mouse eye elicits senescence-like morphological alterations in the RPE and if this can be prevented by suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) or NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling. We verified that intravitreal TGF-β1-induced stress fiber formation and EMT in RPE cells, along with age-associated morphometric changes, including increased variation in cell size and reduced cell density. In RPE cells, exogenous TGF-β1 increased endogenous expression of TGF-β1 and upregulated Smad3-ERK1/2-mTORC1 signaling, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and EMT. We demonstrated that inhibition of the mTORC1-NOX4 pathway by pretreatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an activator of AMP-dependent protein kinase, or GKT137831, a NOX1/4 inhibitor, decreased ROS generation, prevented stress fiber formation, attenuated EMT, and improved the regularity of the RPE structure in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that intravitreal TGF-β1 injection could be used as a screening model to investigate the aging-related structural and functional changes to the RPE. Furthermore, the regulation of TGF-β-mTORC1-NOX signaling could be a potential therapeutic target for reducing pathogenic alterations in aged RPE and AMD."

The objective was to assess at a national level, the frequency and determinants of misuse of augmentation of labor (AL). Material and methods Women of the French perinatal survey of 2016 with a singleton cephalic fetus, delivering at term after a spontaneous labor were included. “Misuse of AL” was defined by artificial rupture of the membranes (ROM) and/or oxytocin within one hour of admission and/or duration between ROM and oxytocin of less than one hour. Women, labor and maternity unit’s characteristics were compared between the “misuse of AL” and “no misuse of AL” groups by bivariate analysis. To identify the determinants of misuse of AL, a multivariable multilevel logistic regression was performed taking into account the data’s hierarchical structure (first level: women, second level: maternity units). Results Among the 7196 women included, 1524 (21.2%) had a misuse of AL. The determinants of misuse of AL were middle school educational level (reference high school), aOR = 1.21; 95%CI[1.01–1.45], gestational age at delivery ≥41weeks (reference 39–40 weeks), aOR = 1.19; 95%CI[1.00–1.42], cervical dilation ≥6cm at admission (reference &lt;3cm), aOR = 1.39; 95%CI[1.10–1.76], epidural analgesia aOR = 1.63; 95%CI[1.35–1.96], delivery in a private hospital (reference public teaching hospital), aOR = 2.25; 95%CI[1.57–3.23]; and maternity units with &lt;1000 deliveries/year and 1000–1999 deliveries/year (reference ≥3000 deliveries/year), respectively aOR = 1.52; 95%CI[1.11–2.08] and aOR = 1.42; 95%CI[1.05–1.92]. Less than 3% of the variance was explained by women characteristics, and 24.17% by the maternity units’ characteristics. Conclusions In France, one spontaneous laboring woman among five is subject to misuse of AL. The misuse is mostly explained by maternity unit’s characteristics. The determinants identified in this study can be used to implement targeted actions in small and private maternity units."
https://openalex.org/W3128339895,"Objective This study aimed to investigate how load expectations modulate neuromuscular and postural strategies in the anticipation of a freestyle lifting task with varying expected loads in individuals with and without chronic low back pain (cLBP). Methods Forty-seven participants, 28 with cLBP pain and 19 without, were recruited and completed a series of freestyle lifting trials (3 sets of box lifted for a total of 36 lifts). Verbal cues were used to modulate their expectations about the boxes’ weight: no expectation, lighter or heavier load expectations. Following each set, participants rated their perceived exertion on a visual analog scale. During the lifting protocol, kinematics (time to maximal flexion, angular velocity and joint angles), electromyography muscle activity (erector spinae and quadriceps) and center of pressure displacement were simultaneously recorded. Results Results showed that time to maximal knee flexion was modulated by load expectations in both groups (mean lighter load expectations = 1.15 ± 0.32 sec.; mean heavier load expectations = 1.06 ± 0.31 sec.). Results also showed a load expectations X group interaction for that time to maximal hip and lumbar flexion. Time to maximal hip flexion decreased with heavier load expectations (mean lighter load expectations = 1.20 ± 0.36; mean heavier load expectations = 1.16 ± 0.33) for cLBP only. Time to maximal lumbar flexion increased with heavier load expectation (mean lighter load expectations = 1.41 ± 0.27 sec.; mean lighter load expectations = 1.46 ± 0.29 sec.) for participants without LBP. However, no difference in lumbar, hip nor knee angles were observed between groups or conditions. Results highlighted significant load expectation effects for erector spinae electromyography activity, as lower muscle activations was observed for both groups with heavier load expectations (mean = 0.32 ± 0.15), compared to lighter load expectations (mean = 0.52 ± 0.27). Force plates analyses did not reveal any significant load expectation effects. Conclusion Present findings showed that load expectations modulate movement strategies and muscle activation similarly but not identically in individuals with chronic low back pain and healthy adults during freestyle lifting. Results of the present study partially differ from previous studies and suggest only minor differences in lifting strategies between healthy individuals and individuals with cLBP experiencing low level of pain and disability. More studies are needed to investigate the potential role of load expectations in the development and persistence of chronic low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W3126572064,"Domestic ducks are of paramount importance as a cheap source of protein in rural India. Andaman local duck (ALD) is an indigenous avian genetic resource of Andaman and Nicobar islands (ANI) and is mainly distributed in Middle and Northern parts of these islands. Negligence has brought this breed on the edge of extinction necessitating immediate conservation efforts. Here, we report the genetic diversity, population structure and matrilineal genetic root of ALD. Partial mtDNA D-loop sequences were analyzed in 71 ALD samples and analysis revealed 19 polymorphic sites and 13 haplotypes. Estimated haplotype (Hd ± SD) and nucleotide diversity (π ± SD) were 0.881 ± 0.017 and 0.00897 ± 0.00078 respectively. The high genetic diversity of ALD indicates introgression of genetic material from other local duck breeds. In addition, it can be postulated that ALD bearing high genetic diversity has strong ability to adapt to environmental changes and can withstand impending climate change. Phylogenetic and network analysis indicate that ALD falls under Eurasian clade of mallard and ALD forms three clusters; one cluster is phylogenetically close to Southeast Asian countries, one close to Southern part of mainland India and the third one forms an independent cluster. Therefore, ALD might have migrated either from Southeast Asian countries which enjoy a close cultural bondage with ANI from time immemorial or from Southern part of India. The independent cluster may have evolved locally in these islands and natural selection pressure imposed by environmental conditions might be the driving force for evaluation of these duck haplotypes; which mimics Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The results of the study will be beneficial for formulating future breeding programme and conservation strategy towards sustainable development of the duck breed."
https://openalex.org/W3127235005,"Background The burden of diabetes is considerable not only globally but also nationally within Korea. The Global Burden of Disease study derived the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of diabetes depending on its complications as individual severity using prevalence-based approach from 2017. Conversely, the Korean National Burden of Disease study based on an incidence-based approach does not incorporate the severity of diseases. This study aimed to simulate incidence-based DALYs of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), given diabetic complications as disease severity using a Markov model. Methods We developed a model with six Markov states, including incident and existing prevalent cases of diabetes and its complications and death. We assumed that diabetes and its complications would not be cured. The cycle length was one year, and the endpoint of the simulation was 100 years. A 5% discount rate was adopted in the analysis. Transition cases were counted by 5-year age groups above 30 years of age. Age- and sex-specific transition probabilities were calculated based on the incident rate. Results The total DALY estimates of T2DM were 5,417 and 3,934 per 100,000 population in men and women, respectively. The years of life lost in men were relatively higher than those in women in most age groups except the 80–84 age group. The distribution of years lived with disability by gender and age group showed a bell shape, peaking in the 55–59 age group in men and 65–69 age group in women. Conclusions The burden of T2DM considering its complications was larger compared to the outcomes from previous studies, with more precise morbid duration using the Markov model."

To evaluate the influencing factors for life preserver donning tests, 109 college students and 42 villagers were chosen as subjects. A total of fourteen variables with seven categorical variables and seven continuous variables were considered as potential influencing factors. T-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, for three or more categories) were used to judge whether grouping in categorical variables had a significant effect on the donning performance. Then all variables were offered into the stepwise linear regression (SLR) to evaluate the influential factors for life preserver donning tests. Results showed that four of fourteen variables, including gender, instruction condition, age group, and tool test time (representing the subject’s flexibility), had a significant effect on the donning performance. To evaluate the relationship between the donning performance and influencing factors, models of the retrieving time, the opening time, and the donning time were built based on the SLR analysis. The paper also highlights recommendations for modification of the donning test procedure, which helps to improve the validation and reliability of life preserver donning tests."

https://openalex.org/W3128727625,"In recent years, the flow characteristics research of the interstage region in counter-rotating axial fans in terms of fluid dynamics has attracted much attention. Especially, the dynamic relationship between interstage pressure pulsation and blade vibration in counter-rotating axial fans has not yet been clarified. This paper performs the signal processing method of wavelet decomposition and reconstruction in time-frequency analysis process. Under different flow conditions, weak-coupling numerical simulation program is employed to analyze the fluid-structure coupling interaction between interstage pressure pulsations and blade vibrations in counter-rotating axial fans. The results indicate that the fluid-structure coupling interaction field in the interstage of counter-rotating axial fans mainly excites the first-order vibration of the second-stage blade. At the same time, the consistency between the pulsation frequency and the vibration frequency of the airflow reflects the good coupling property. Two stage blades cut the airflow to cause field changes and airflow pulsation, and then, airflow pulsation causes blades deformation and produces vibrations of the same frequency at the blade. The deformation of the blades, in turn, causes the flow field changes. Rotating stall, vortex movement and breakdown produced low-frequency airflow pulsation and vortex vibration of the blade."

The decision rule is simple and straightforward in that it compares the observed median event time to the identified threshold. Moreover, it is extended to optimal two-stage design for practice, which extends the idea of Simon’s optimal two-stage design for survival endpoint. We investigate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies. The proposed methods are applied to redesign a trial based on median event time for trial illustration, and practical strategies are given for application of proposed methods."
https://openalex.org/W3126611190,"A minute thrombus can pass through a small type of interatrial communication, which can result in a stroke or transient ischemic attack and several associated symptoms. This study sought to investigate a new type of interatrial communication. Thirty-one hearts from embalmed adult cadavers were investigated. Each interatrial channels (IACs) was classified as either an open or obstructed channel according to the connection of each hole on the right and left surfaces of the interatrial septum. Open channels were found in two specimens (6.5%). Both open and obstructed IACs followed tortuous courses through the interatrial septum. On the right surface of the interatrial septum, the hole was usually found adjacent to the left border of the interatrial septum between the opening of the superior vena cava into the right atrium and the superior margin of the fossa ovalis. Conversely, holes on the left surface of the interatrial septum were usually found in the upper and middle parts adjacent to the left border of the interatrial septum. This novel finding is expected to support our understanding of the onset of possible symptoms such as stroke in the absence of classical atrial septal defects."
https://openalex.org/W3127001226,"Background We tried to investigate the effect of non-persistence with antiplatelets after ischemic stroke on long-term all-cause mortality (ACM). Methods and findings We selected newly diagnosed ischemic stroke patients aged ≥20years who were newly treated with aspirin or clopidogrel from 2003–2010 Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, a random sample of 2.2% of total population. Subjects were divided into two pairs of groups according to persistence with antiplatelets at 6 and 12 months: those who discontinued antiplatelets within 6 months (DA6M) and those who continued them for 6 or months or more (CA6M); and those who discontinued antiplatelets within 12 months (DA12M) and those who continued them for 12 months or more (CA12M). Those who died within 6 months among DA6M and those who died within 12 months among DA12M were excluded along with those with medication possession ratio&lt;80% among CA6M and CA12M. Subjects were followed-up until death or December 31, 2013. Among 3,559 total subjects, DA6M were 1,080 and CA6M were 2,479 while, out of 3,628 total patients, DA12M were 1,434 and CA12M were 2,194. The risks of ACM [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.94–2.61], cerebro-cardiovascular disease (CVD) death (aHR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.96–3.24) and non-CVD death (aHR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.76–2.64) of DA6M were all significantly increased compared to CA6M. DA12M also had significantly higher risks of ACM (aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.65–2.25), CVD mortality (aHR, 2.13; 95% CI; 1.63–2.77) and non-CVD mortality (aHR, 1.83;95% CI 1.51–2.22) than DA12M but aHRs were lower than that between DA6M and CA6M. The difference rates of ACM, CVD death, and non-CVD death between non-persistent and persistent groups all continuously widened over time but the degree of difference was gradually decreased. Conclusions Maintaining antiplatelets for the first 12 months after ischemic stroke reduces long-term risks of both CVD death and non-CVD death."
https://openalex.org/W3128658681,"Background To determine accuracy of partial coherence interferometry (PCI) in patients with large inter-eye axial eye length (AEL) difference. Methods Patients undergoing cataract surgery at two academic medical centers with an inter-eye axial eye length (AEL) difference of &gt; 0.30 mm were identified and were matched to control patients without inter-eye AEL difference &gt; 0.30 mm on the basis of age, sex, and AEL. The expected post-operative refraction for the implanted IOL was calculated using SRK/T, Holladay II, and Hoffer Q formulae. The main outcome measures were the refractive prediction error and the equivalence of the refractive outcomes between the subjects and controls. Results Review of 2212 eyes from 1617 patients found 131 eyes of 93 patients which met inclusion criteria. These were matched to 131 control eyes of 115 patients. The mean AEL was 24.92 ± 1.50 mm. The mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 0.47 D to 0.69 D, and was not statistically different between subjects and controls. The refractive prediction error was equivalent between the cases and controls, with no significant difference between the MAE for any formula, nor in the number of cases vs. controls with a refractive prediction error of at least 0.50 D or 1.00 D. Conclusions Among eyes in our study population, good-quality PCI data was equally accurate in patients with or without an inter-eye AEL difference &gt; 0.30 mm. Confirmatory AEL measurements using different AEL measuring modalities in patients with a large inter-eye AEL difference may not be necessary."
