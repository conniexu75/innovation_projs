https://openalex.org/W2158023121,"Countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis, a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus. The complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv, has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The genome comprises 4,411,529 base pairs, contains around 4,000 genes, and has a very high guanine + cytosine content that is reflected in the biased amino-acid content of the proteins. M. tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis, and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2098781795,"The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential interaction of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Although gp120 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, HIV eludes the immune system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed with a two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden CD4-gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion. Our results provide a framework for understanding the complex biology of HIV entry into cells and should guide efforts to intervene."

https://openalex.org/W2113297137,"The treatment of cultured rat-1 fibroblasts or H35 hepatoma cells with high concentrations of serum induces the circadian expression of various genes whose transcription also oscillates in living animals. Oscillating genes include rper1 and rper2(rat homologs of the Drosophila clock gene period), and the genes encoding the transcription factors Rev-Erbα, DBP, and TEF. In rat-1 fibroblasts, up to three consecutive daily oscillations with an average period length of 22.5 hr could be recorded. The temporal sequence of the various mRNA accumulation cycles is the same in cultured cells and in vivo. The serum shock of rat-1 fibroblasts also results in a transient stimulation of c-fos and rper expression and thus mimics light-induced immediate-early gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2072472133,"We describe a novel 25 kDa protein, geminin, which inhibits DNA replication and is degraded during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Geminin has a destruction box sequence and is ubiquitinated anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in vitro. In synchronized HeLa cells, geminin is absent during G1 phase, accumulates during S, G2, and M phases, and disappears at the time of the metaphase-anaphase transition. Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of MCM complex into prereplication complex (pre-RC). We propose that geminin inhibits DNA replication during S, G2, and M phases and that geminin destruction at the metaphase-anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2068619217,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs due to degeneration of corticospinal axons. We found that patients from a chromosome 16q24.3–linked HSP family are homozygous for a 9.5 kb deletion involving a gene encoding a novel protein, named Paraplegin. Two additional Paraplegin mutations, both resulting in a frameshift, were found in a complicated and in a pure form of HSP. Paraplegin is highly homologous to the yeast mitochondrial ATPases, AFG3, RCA1, and YME1, which have both proteolytic and chaperon-like activities at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Immunofluorescence analysis and import experiments showed that Paraplegin localizes to mitochondria. Analysis of muscle biopsies from two patients carrying Paraplegin mutations showed typical signs of mitochondrial OXPHOS defects, thus suggesting a mechanism for neurodegeneration in HSP-type disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1972812883,"The dynamin family of GTPases is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, and it has recently been shown to play a role in vesicle formation from the trans–Golgi network. Dynamin is believed to assemble around the necks of clathrin-coated pits and assist in pinching vesicles from the plasma membrane. This role would make dynamin unique among GTPases in its ability to act as a mechanochemical enzyme. Data presented here demonstrate that purified recombinant dynamin binds to a lipid bilayer in a regular pattern to form helical tubes that constrict and vesiculate upon GTP addition. This suggests that dynamin alone is sufficient for the formation of constricted necks of coated pits and supports the hypothesis that dynamin is the force-generating molecule responsible for membrane fission."
https://openalex.org/W2135124405,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is one of at least eight human neurodegenerative diseases caused by glutamine-repeat expansion. We have recreated glutamine-repeat disease in Drosophila using a segment of the SCA3/MJD protein. Targeted expression of the protein with an expanded polyglutamine repeat led to nuclear inclusion (NI) formation and late-onset cell degeneration. Differential sensitivity to the mutant transgene was observed among different cell types, with neurons being particularly susceptible; NI formation alone was not sufficient for degeneration. The viral antiapoptotic gene P35 mitigated polyglutamine-induced degeneration in vivo. Our results demonstrate that cellular mechanisms of human glutamine-repeat disease are conserved in invertebrates. This fly model will aid in identifying additional factors that modulate neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1983412918,"Cohesion between sister chromatids during G2 and M phases depends on the “cohesin” protein Scc1p (Mcd1p). Loss of cohesion at the metaphase to anaphase transition is accompanied by Scc1p's dissociation from chromatids, which depends on proteolysis of Pds1p mediated by a ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase promoting complex (APC). We show that destruction of Pds1p is the APC's sole role in triggering Scc1p's dissociation from chromatids and that Pds1p forms a stable complex with a 180 kDa protein called Esp1p, which is essential for the dissociation of Scc1p from sister chromatids and for their separation. We propose that the APC promotes sister separation not by destroying cohesins but instead by liberating the “sister-separating” Esp1 protein from its inhibitor Pds1p."

https://openalex.org/W2159634179,"Upon exposure to ethanol, Drosophila display behaviors that are similar to ethanol intoxication in rodents and humans. Using an inebriometer to measure ethanol-induced loss of postural control, we identified cheapdate, a mutant with enhanced sensitivity to ethanol. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that cheapdate is an allele of the memory mutant amnesiac. amnesiac has been postulated to encode a neuropeptide that activates the cAMP pathway. Consistent with this, we find that enhanced ethanol sensitivity of cheapdate can be reversed by treatment with agents that increase cAMP levels or PKA activity. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological reduction in PKA activity results in increased sensitivity to ethanol. Taken together, our results provide functional evidence for the involvement of the cAMP signal transduction pathway in the behavioral response to intoxicating levels of ethanol."

https://openalex.org/W2015674575,"The p70 S6 kinase is activated by diverse stimuli through a multisite phosphorylation directed at three separate domains as follows: a cluster of (Ser/Thr) Pro sites in an autoinhibitory segment in the noncatalytic carboxyl-terminal tail; Thr-252 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain; and Ser-394 and Thr-412 in a segment immediately carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain. Phosphorylation of Thr-252 in vitro by the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-dependent kinase-1 or mutation of Thr-412 → Glu has each been shown previously to engender some activation of the p70 S6 kinase, whereas both modifications together produce 20–30-fold more activity than either alone. We employed phospho-specific anti-peptide antibodies to examine the relative phosphorylation at several of these sites in wild type and various p70 mutants, in serum-deprived cells, and in response to activators and inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase activity.Substantial phosphorylation of p70 Thr-252 and Ser-434 was present in serum-deprived cells, whereas Thr-412 and Thr-444/Ser-447 were essentially devoid of phospho-specific immunoreactivity. Activation of p70 by insulin was accompanied by a coordinate increase in phosphorylation at all sites examined, together with a slowing in mobility on SDS-PAGE of a portion of p70 polypeptides. Upon addition of rapamycin or wortmannin to insulin-treated cells, the decrease in activity of p70 was closely correlated with the disappearance of anti-Thr-412(P) immunoreactivity and the most slowly migrating p70 polypeptides, whereas considerable phosphorylation at Ser-434 and Thr-252 persisted after the disappearance of 40 S kinase activity. The central role of Thr-412 phosphorylation in the regulation of kinase activity was further demonstrated by the close correlation of the effects of various deletions and point mutations on p70 activity and Thr-412 phosphorylation.In conclusion, although p70 activity depends on a disinhibition from the carboxyl-terminal tail and the simultaneous phosphorylation at both Thr-252 and Thr-412, p70 activity in vivo is most closely related to the state of phosphorylation at Thr-412. The p70 S6 kinase is activated by diverse stimuli through a multisite phosphorylation directed at three separate domains as follows: a cluster of (Ser/Thr) Pro sites in an autoinhibitory segment in the noncatalytic carboxyl-terminal tail; Thr-252 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain; and Ser-394 and Thr-412 in a segment immediately carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain.

We employed phospho-specific anti-peptide antibodies to examine the relative phosphorylation at several of these sites in wild type and various p70 mutants, in serum-deprived cells, and in response to activators and inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase activity. Substantial phosphorylation of p70 Thr-252 and Ser-434 was present in serum-deprived cells, whereas Thr-412 and Thr-444/Ser-447 were essentially devoid of phospho-specific immunoreactivity. Activation of p70 by insulin was accompanied by a coordinate increase in phosphorylation at all sites examined, together with a slowing in mobility on SDS-PAGE of a portion of p70 polypeptides.

The p70 S6 kinase, an enzyme critical for cell cycle progression through G1, was among the first insulin/mitogen-activated protein (Ser/Thr) kinases to be identified, purified, and molecularly cloned. The enzyme was shown early on to be regulated by insulin/mitogen-stimulated (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation, and along with the kinases now known as Rsk provided the first evidence that insulin/mitogen signal transduction involved the recruitment of multiple, independently regulated cascades of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases (reviewed in Ref. 1Avruch J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whereas the in vitroactivation of Rsk kinases by mitogen-activated protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation was accomplished early on (2Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), in vitroactivation of p70 S6 kinase has proved much more difficult to reconstruct. During activation in vivo, p70 is phosphorylated at 10 or more sites by an array of independently regulated protein kinases. Enumerating the sites of phosphorylation, determining their individual functional roles in the process of p70 activation as well as the potential site-site interactions, has provided a formidable challenge. Work to date has identified four sets of phosphorylation sites on p70 that undergo insulin or mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation in situ, and whose mutation affects substantially p70 kinase activity. The first to be characterized were a cluster of 4–5 residues (Ser-434, Ser-441, Ser-447, Ser-452, and Thr-444) situated within an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate segment in the p70 noncatalytic tail (3Banerjee P.

The phosphorylation of Thr-252 in the p70 activation loop within the catalytic domain is stimulated by serum and PI-3 kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI-3 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CHO-IR, Chinese hamster ovary-insulin receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; PDK, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-dependent kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. overexpression in vivo and is inhibited by wortmannin, and only a Ser or Thr at this site enables p70 activity (8Weng Q.-P.

Thr-412 is another site of mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation, situated in a conserved 65-amino acid segment located immediately carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain; conversion of Thr-412 to Ala strongly suppresses p70 activity, whereas conversion to Glu increases basal activity and restores mitogen responsiveness (7Han J.-W.

Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Most recently Ser-394, which like Thr-412 is also located in the catalytic domain carboxyl-terminal extension, has also been shown to influence p70 activity (10Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As to the kinases that act on these sites, the sites clustered in the carboxyl-terminal tail (Ser-434, Ser-441, Ser-447, Ser-452, and Thr-444) are each followed immediately by a proline residue and can be phosphorylated in vitro by an array of proline-directed kinases, including Erk1 and Erk2, the stress-activated protein kinases, and Cdc2 (the latter acting particularly at Ser-434) (5Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser-394 is also followed by a proline and may also be a substrate for these kinases. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of PP2A-treated p70 in vitro with one or several proline-directed kinases does not restore any p70 S6 kinase activity (5Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the kinase PDK1 was shown to phosphorylate p70 in vitro selectively at Thr-252, with a resultant increase in p70 S6 kinase activity (11Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 12Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This finding together with the earlier demonstration of PI-3 kinase-stimulated, wortmannin-sensitive Thr-252 phosphorylation in vivo (8Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 5744-5748Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) establishes Thr-252 as a critical site of regulatory phosphorylation. Nevertheless, both the ability of p70 to be phosphorylated by PDK1 and the relative and absolute extent of p70 activation engendered by PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation are greatly altered by a variety of p70 mutations (11Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus conversion of the five clustered (Ser/Thr-Pro) phosphorylation sites in the p70 carboxyl-terminal tail to Ala strongly suppresses PDK1-catalyzed Thr-252 phosphorylation, whereas deletion of the entire carboxyl-terminal tail (to give p70ΔCT104) increases both the rate and extent of Thr-252 phosphorylation by PDK1 and also the degree of S6 kinase activation achieved at any level of Thr-252 phosphorylation. Deletion of p70 amino-terminal noncatalytic residues 2–46, a modification previously shown to greatly inhibit p70 activity, essentially abolishes the ability of p70 to be phosphorylated by PDK1in vitro, whereas the additional deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail (to give Δ2–46/ΔCT104), which restores p70 activity and mitogen responsiveness in vivo, also restores the ability of PDK1 to catalyze p70 Thr-252 phosphorylation in vitro. These results indicate that the p70 carboxyl-terminal tail exerts a strong influence on both the ability of PDK1 to catalyze the phosphorylation of Thr-252, as well as the extent of activation of S6 kinase activity resulting therefrom (11Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (519) Google Scholar). As regards the other sites of p70 phosphorylation, Thr-412 appears to play an especially important role, in that it influences both the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr-252 in vitro and the absolute extent of p70 activity that results from Thr-252 phosphorylation (11Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, conversion of Thr-412 in p70ΔCT104 to either Ala or Glu facilitates PDK1-catalyzed Thr-252 phosphorylationin vitro. Moreover, the functional interaction of Thr-252(P) and Thr-412 is the major, perhaps predominant, factor in determining p70 activity. Thus, whereas protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A1)-treated p70ΔCT104 is essentially inactive, the selective phosphorylation of p70ΔCT104 at Thr-252 by PDK1 results in a 15-fold increase in 40 S kinase activity to a level comparable to that exhibited by PP2A1-treated p70ΔCT104 (Thr-412 → Glu). This indicates that modification of either Thr-252 or Thr-412 singly is sufficient to confer some S6 kinase activity. This activity, however, represents no more than 3–5% of maximal S6 kinase activity, inasmuch as PDK1 phosphorylation of PP2A1-treated p70ΔCT104(T412E) increases its S6 kinase activity by a further 20–30-fold, to a level 240-fold greater than that exhibited by PP2A1-treated (i.e. fully dephosphorylated) p70ΔCT104, demonstrating clearly the strong positive cooperativity between Thr-252 and Thr-412 in p70 activation (11Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation state of the p70 carboxyl-terminal tail and Thr-412 both strongly influence the rate and extent of p70 Thr-252 phosphorylation catalyzed by PDK1 in vitro, as well as the absolute level of 40 S kinase activity engendered by a given extent of Thr-252 phosphorylation. These data, derived for PDK1-catalyzed p70 phosphorylation in vitro, strongly suggest that any significant activation of S6 kinase in vivo requires the concurrent phosphorylation of both Thr-412 and Thr-252; the relevance of these in vitrodata to p70 regulation in vivo as well as the determinants of Thr-252 and Thr-412 phosphorylation in vivo remain to be fully defined. To explore these questions we have employed anti-phosphopeptide antibodies developed toward several of the functionally important p70 phosphorylation sites as follows: Thr-412(P), Thr-252(P), Ser-434(P), and the cluster Ser-444(P)/Thr-447(P). These antibodies were used to examine the effects of insulin, recombinant PI-3 kinase, wortmannin, and rapamycin as well as the effects of p70 truncations and point mutations on site-specific p70 phosphorylation in vivo. We have attempted to correlate the changes in p70 S6 kinase activity with the site-specific phosphorylation, to verify whether the potent site-site interactions detected with in vitro phosphorylation obtainin vivo, and to identify which phosphorylation events determine S6 kinase activity during activation and deactivationin vivo.

HEK293 cells and CHO-IR cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. HEK293 cells were transfected at 60% confluence in 100-mm dishes by the calcium phosphate method using 5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding wild type or variant p70. CHO-IR cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were placed in serum-free medium for 16 h and then treated with insulin or 20% serum for the times indicated; in some experiments, rapamycin (50 nm) or wortmannin (100 nm) was added 10 min after insulin. Incubations were terminated by two rapid rinses with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; the cells were then extracted with lysis buffer (13Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of supernatants were matched for protein content, and HA p70 polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by addition of the monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody 12CA5 and protein-G agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with 1 mNaCl in lysis buffer, and once with kinase reaction buffer. Endogenous p70 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against a recombinant fragment encoding p70 amino acids 422–525 (14Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes of the p70 S6 kinase were used to assay for p70 kinase activity using 40 S ribosomal subunit as described previously (13Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), which was subjected to autoradiography for the detection of 32P-S6, and immunoblot analysis. Phospho-specific antibodies directed against the various sites of p70 S6 kinase were produced by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the following synthetic phosphopeptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: Thr-252(P) (IHDGTVTHT*FCGTI), Thr-412(P) (NQVFLGFT*YVAPKKC), Ser-434(P) (EPKIRS*PRRFIGC), and Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P) (SPRT* PVS*PVKFSC). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using the phosphopeptide and corresponding nonphosphopeptide, was employed to identify the rabbits responding best. IgG was purified using protein A-Sepharose. Antibodies reactive with the nonphosphopeptide were removed by adsorption to a nonphosphopeptide (same sequence as above) affinity column. Antibodies that flowed through this column were next passed over a column of immobilized phosphopeptide; after washing, antibodies were eluted at low pH and dialyzed; these are subsequently referred to as “type 1” antibodies. The resulting antibodies were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against phospho- and nonphosphopeptides to determine the extent of phospho-specificity and subsequently by Western blotting to examine specificity against whole cell extracts. “Type 2” antibodies (seen only with the Thr-252(P) peptide immunogen) were those that bound to the affinity column that contained the nonphosphorylated peptide but showed little or no reactivity on immunoblot with a p70 Thr-252 → Ala mutant polypeptide (see “Results” and Fig. 1 C). The electroblotted p70 polypeptides were analyzed using a standard Western blot protocol. Briefly, the membrane was first blocked with 5% low-fat milk in TBST-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mmNaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed once with TBS-T, and probed with anti-phosphopeptide antibody at (0.02–0.05 μg/ml) in TBS-T for 1 h. Following three 20-min washes, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 20-min washes with TBS-T. The membrane was wetted in ECL solution for 3 min, exposed to x-ray film, and developed. For sequential immunoblot analysis, the membranes were stripped in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, washed extensively with TBS-T, and reused. The anti-p70 phosphopeptide antibodies were generated by immunization of female New Zealand White rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptide covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The presence of phosphopeptide-specific immunoreactivity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. After purification of IgG with protein A-agarose, the phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were purified by first passing the IgG over immobilized, nonphosphorylated peptide to remove antibodies reactive with nonphosphorylated epitopes; the nonadsorbed fraction was then passed over a column of immobilized phosphopeptide. After extensive washing, the retained immunoglobulins were eluted at low pH, rapidly neutralized, dialyzed, and concentrated. In this manner phosphopeptide-specific antibodies toward Thr-412(P), Thr-434(P), and the doubly phosphorylated peptide containing Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P) were isolated. The ability of each of these anti-p70 phosphopeptide antibodies to immunoblot recombinant p70 polypeptides was compared with an antibody prepared to a synthetic peptide corresponding to p70 amino acids 337–352, which contains no Ser or Thr residues (14Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As is evident in Fig. 1 A, this anti-p70 peptide antibody exhibits comparable reactivity with each of the recombinant wild type and mutant p70 polypeptides that is unaffected by insulin or serum treatment prior to extraction. The anti-p70 phosphopeptide antibodies react with all p70 variants except those wherein the Ser and/or Thr residue that was phosphorylated in the synthetic peptide antigen has been mutated to a nonphosphorylatable residue (Ala, Glu, or Asp). These features indicate that the anti-(Thr-412(P)), anti-(Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P)), and anti-(Ser-434(P)) antibodies each are indeed specific for the peptide segment containing only a phosphorylated Ser and/or Thr. In addition, and to a varying extent, the immunoreactivity of each of these anti-p70 phosphopeptide antibodies is increased by insulin treatment prior to extraction. As regards the anti-p70 Thr-252(P) antibodies, some sera (type 1) yielded anti-phosphopeptide antibodies with properties identical to those described above, i.e. nonadsorption to unphosphorylated peptide, adsorption to the phosphopeptide, and reactivity with wild type p70 but not with a p70 (Thr-252 → Ala) mutant polypeptide (Fig. 1 B). These antibodies were, however, recovered in low yield, insufficient to complete the studies required. A second type of anti-(Thr-252(P)) antibody was found to adsorb to columns containing the immobilized nonphosphorylated peptide. These antibodies, when eluted from the peptide column, also showed highly selective reactivity with wild type p70 polypeptide over the p70 (Thr-252 → Ala), as well as a stimulus-dependent increase in immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 C). It is not clear whether these type 2 antibodies are directly reactive with Thr-252(P) itself; conceivably, these antibodies may react with a conformationally dependent epitope on the activation loop that is generated as a consequence of Thr-252 phosphorylation but does not include the Thr-252(P) residue itself. This epitope must be highly dependent on Thr-252 phosphorylation inasmuch as the p70 (Thr-256 → Ala) mutant, which like the p70 (Thr-252 → Ala) mutant, is completely inactive, nevertheless exhibits an unimpaired insulin-stimulated increase in immunoreactivity with the type 2 anti-(Thr-252(P)) antibodies (Fig. 5 B), a finding similar to that seen previously with32P labeling in vivo (8Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 5744-5748Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In practice, therefore, both types of anti-p70 (Thr-252(P)) antibodies provide a reliable monitor of the state of Thr-252 phosphorylation, even though the type 2 anti-p70 (Thr-252(P)) antibodies also have some reactivity with an epitope(s) present in the nonphosphorylated peptide segment. Having defined the specificity of these antisera, we next examined the effects of serum (in 293 cells), insulin (in CHO-IR cells), or cotransfection with various candidate upstream activators on the 40 S kinase activity and site-specific phosphorylation of full-length, p70α1 polypeptides expressed transiently in 293 cells or CHO-IR cells. Insulin elicited a rapid 3–4-fold increase in 40 S kinase activity in CHO-IR cells, which attained 60% of maximal by the first time point examined, 2.5 min after insulin addition. All sites exhibited an increase in phosphorylation, with the largest relative increases observed with Thr-412 and Thr-444/Ser-447, primarily because these sites contain little or no detectable phosphate in serum-deprived cells (Fig. 2 A). Thr-252 exhibits clear-cut basal phosphorylation, which nevertheless rapidly increases after insulin addition in parallel with the increased S6 kinase activity. Thus, even after the addition of submaximal concentrations of insulin, the increase in overall phosphorylation at all sites is comparably rapid, such that it cannot be reliably inferred from such data as to whether p70 phosphorylation occurs in an ordered sequence. Given the relatively concerted phosphorylation in vivo of the wild type p70 after insulin addition, we attempted to evaluate the pattern of dephosphorylation that accompanies inhibition of p70in vivo after addition of rapamycin or wortmannin, each added 10 min after the addition of insulin (Fig. 2 B). Rapamycin led to the rapid inactivation of p70, with dephosphorylation evident at all sites, accompanied by a striking downshift,i.e. increase in p70 mobility on SDS-PAGE. The decrease in 40 S kinase activity, the disappearance most slowly migrating immunoreactive p70 polypeptide band (best seen in the anti-p70 (Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P)) blot), and the disappearance of overall anti-(Thr-412(P)) immunoreactivity were each entirely congruent. Thr-252(P) immunoreactivity also diminished, but slightly more slowly, and did not disappear; this slower response was paralleled by the pattern seen with anti-(Ser-434(P)) immunoreactivity. The response to wortmannin, although somewhat slower, was also characterized by the concomitant disappearance of 40 S kinase activity, the most slowly migrating immunoreactive p70 polypeptide band, and total anti-p70 (Thr-412(P)) immunoreactivity, with somewhat slower and less pronounced dephosphorylation of Thr-252 and Ser-434. These properties of recombinant p70 expressed in CHO-IR cells were compared with the behavior of the p70 polypeptide endogenous to these cells. Each of the anti-phosphopeptide antisera was sufficiently sensitive to dependably monitor the phosphorylation of the endogenous p70 except for the various anti-p70 (Thr-252(P)) antisera, whose sensitivity was at the limit of detection; visualization of p70 Thr-252(P) was therefore not achieved in every experiment. Given this limitation, insulin, after a brief lag, promoted the coordinate phosphorylation of Thr-444/Ser-447 and Thr-412 concomitant with activation of 40 S kinase; the phosphorylation of Ser-434 increased somewhat more slowly (Fig. 3 A). Deactivation of p70 by wortmannin or rapamycin was paralleled by the dephosphorylation of Thr-412(P) and Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P), whereas phosphorylation at the other sites including Thr-252, although decreased substantially by both inhibitors, was better preserved than 40 S activity or Thr-412 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the disappearance of 40 S kinase and anti-Thr-412(P), Thr-444(P)/Ser-447(P) immunoreactivity is associated with a slightly faster mobility on SDS-PAGE of the residual immunoreactive bands visualized by the anti-Thr-252(P) and anti-Thr-434(P) antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the regulation and phosphorylation of recombinant and endogenous p70 in CHO-IR appears quite similar. Based on this fidelity, we next examined the regulation of a variety of p70 truncation and point mutations. Deletion of the p70 carboxyl-terminal tail (amino acids 422–525) has little effect on Thr-412 phosphorylation but substantially diminishes the phosphorylation of Thr-252; the 40 S kinase activity of p70ΔCT104, however, is very similar to that of the full-length enzyme. Inasmuch as previous work has shown that the activity of p70ΔCT104, as with full-length p70, requires Thr-252 phosphorylation (8Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 5744-5748Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we infer that the efficiency of Thr-252 and/or Thr-412 phosphorylation in causing activation of 40 S kinase is enhanced by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail. Deletion of the p70 amino-terminal segment Δ2–46 has been shown previously to greatly diminish 40 S kinase activity (13Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4 A, the Δ2–46 deletion is accompanied by a marked reduction in Thr-252 phosphorylation comparable to that seen with carboxyl-terminal deletion; in contrast to ΔCT104, the"

GBP inhibits in vivo phosphorylation by Xgsk-3, and ectopic GBP expression induces an axis by stabilizing beta-catenin within Xenopus embryos.

Thus, HSCs derived from an adult animal survive after injection into blastocysts and are able to participate in hematopoietic development. We further find that the erythroid progeny of transplanted adult HSCs express embryonic/fetal-type globin genes and, conversely, that embryonic and fetal progenitor cells transplanted into adult recipients transcribe the adult-type globin gene.

In this study, the role of the TorD protein, encoded by the third gene of torCADoperon, is investigated. Construction of a mutant, in which thetorD gene is interrupted, showed that the absence of TorD protein leads to a two times decrease of the final amount of TorA enzyme. However, specific activity and biochemical properties of TorA enzyme were similar to those of the enzyme produced in the wild type.

This probably indicates a new folding state of the cytoplasmic TorA protein when TorD is overexpressed. BIAcore techniques demonstrated direct specific interaction between the TorA and TorD proteins. This interaction was enhanced when TorA was previously unfolded by heating.

Furthermore, in 293 cells expressing Kv1.2 and ml muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, inactivating RhoA using C3 exoenzyme blocked the ability of ml receptors to suppress Kv1.2 current.
