Until now there has been little evidence for native cardiac precursor cells in the postnatal heart. Herein, we report the identification of isl1+ cardiac progenitors in postnatal rat, mouse and human myocardium. A cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer allows renewal of the isolated progenitor cells with maintenance of their capability to adopt a fully differentiated cardiomyocyte phenotype. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox technology enables selective marking of this progenitor cell population including its progeny, at a defined time, and purification to relative homogeneity. Co-culture studies with neonatal myocytes indicate that isl1+ cells represent authentic, endogenous cardiac progenitors (cardioblasts) that display highly efficient conversion to a mature cardiac phenotype with stable expression of myocytic markers (25%) in the absence of cell fusion, intact Ca2+-cycling, and the generation of action potentials. The discovery of native cardioblasts represents a genetically based system to identify steps in cardiac cell lineage formation and maturation in development and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2083004270,"X-ray lasers do exist — table-top ones even — but they generally produce ‘soft’ X-rays with wavelengths of 5–120 nanometres, a little longer than those used in medical X rays, and energies of only a few hundred electronvolts. New applications in chemical, biological and materials research beckon for lab X-ray lasers producing ‘harder’ X rays with higher energy. An advance towards that goal is reported this week. The new table-top device emits X-rays at a wavelength of about 1 nm and at photon energies of up to 1.3 keV, with the prospect of increasing to 2.5 keV. A practical source with that performance would operate on timescales relevant to a range of investigations of electronic dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids at near-atomic-scale resolution. Generating X-rays that have the properties of laser light has been a long-standing goal for experimental science. Here we describe the emission of highly collimated, spatially coherent X-rays, at a wavelength of about 1 nanometre and at photon energies extending to 1.3 kiloelectronvolts, from atoms that have been ionized by a 5-femtosecond laser pulse. This means that a laboratory source of laser-like, kiloelectronvolt X-rays, which will operate on timescales relevant to many chemical, biological and materials problems, is now within reach."

Multiple splice variants of c-FLIP have been described on the mRNA level; so far only two of them, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, had been found to be expressed at the protein level. In this report, we reveal the endogenous expression of a third isoform of c-FLIP. We demonstrate its presence in a number of T and B cell lines as well as in primary human T cells. We identified this isoform as c-FLIPR, a death effector domain-only splice variant previously identified on the mRNA level. Impor-/tantly, c-FLIPR is recruited to the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) death-inducing signaling complex upon CD95 stimulation. Several properties of c-FLIPR are similar to c-FLIPS: both isoforms have a short half-life, a similar pattern of expression during activation of primary human T cells, and are strongly induced in T cells upon CD3/CD28 costimulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate endogenous expression of c-FLIPR and similar roles of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS isoforms in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. c-FLIPs (c-FLICE inhibitory proteins) play an essential role in regulation of death receptor-induced apoptosis.

Apoptotic cell death is common to multicellular organisms. Apoptosis can be triggered by a number of factors including UV or γ-irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and signaling from death receptors. Eight members of the death receptor family have been characterized so far: tumor necrosis factor-R1 (DR1, CD120a, p55, p60), CD95 (DR2, APO-1, Fas), DR3 (APO-3, LARD, TRAMP, WSL1), TRAIL 1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; DED, death effector domain; FADD, Fas-associated DED; DD, death domain; c-FLIP, c-FLICE inhibitory protein; AICD, activation-induced cell death; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHX, cycloheximide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

A death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is formed upon CD95 stimulation within seconds (8Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The DISC consists of oligomerized, probably trimerized, CD95 molecules, the adaptor molecule FADD (Fas-associated DED), two isoforms of procaspase-8 (procaspases-8a and -8b), procaspase-10, and c-FLIPL/S (c-FLICE inhibitory protein) (5Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The interactions between molecules at the DISC are based on homotypic contacts. The death domain (DD) of the receptor interacts with the DD of FADD, whereas the death effector domain (DED) of FADD interacts with the N-terminal tandem DEDs of procaspases-8 and -10 and c-FLIPL/S. The binding of procaspase-8 to the DISC results in processing of the zymogen. As a result the active heterotetramer p102-p182 of caspase-8 is released into the cytosol to propagate the apoptotic signal (9Lavrik I. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Weyd H. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 144-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Death receptor-mediated apoptosis can be blocked at different levels. One of the well described inhibitors is c-FLIP, which is also known as FLAME-1/I-FLICE/CASPER/CASH/MRIT/CLARP/Usurpin (10Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). On the mRNA level c-FLIP seems to exist in multiple splice variants, whereas on the protein level only two forms, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, have been detected so far (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Hadano S. Houtzager V.M. Seiden I. Keen S.L. Tawa P.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS contain two DED domains that are structurally similar to the N-terminal part of procaspase-8. The C terminus of c-FLIPL consists of two catalytically inactive caspase-like domains (p20 and p12), whereas the short C terminus of c-FLIPS shows no homology to procaspases-8 or -10. Both isoforms of c-FLIP are recruited to the DISC by DED-DED interactions (13Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol.

The role of c-FLIPL at the DISC is controversial (16Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J. Nicholson D.W. Briand C. Grutter M.G. J. Biol.

Some reports characterize c-FLIPL as an anti-apoptotic molecule that functions in a way analogous to c-FLIPS, whereas others ascribe pro-apoptotic functions to c-FLIPL, referring to its assistance in the autocatalytic activation of procaspase-8 at the DISC. This pro-apoptotic function would help to explain the phenotype of c-FLIP-deficient mice characterized by heart failure and death at embryonic day 10.5. The same phenotype is described for caspase-8- and FADD-deficient mice (12Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Hadano S. Houtzager V.M. Seiden I. Keen S.L. Tawa P. Xanthoudakis S. Nasir J. Martindale D.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). c-FLIP was shown to play an important role not only in CD95 signaling but also in tumor necrosis factor- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis (21Wajant H. Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Several reports show a correlation between the resistance of freshly activated T cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis or activation-induced cell death (AICD) and increased expression levels of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS. In vitro restimulation of preactivated primary human T cells induces expression of c-FLIPS, rendering the proportion of cells that survive induction of AICD again resistant to CD95 ligation (22Kirchhoff S. Muller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the observed induction of c-FLIP expression does not in itself prevent AICD. Therefore, the exact roles of different c-FLIP isoforms in resistance of short-term activated T cells remain to be determined. We considered the fact that there are multiple splice variants of c-FLIP on the mRNA level that might contribute to the establishment of sensitivity or resistance toward apoptosis, and we decided to investigate the presence of other c-FLIP isoforms on the protein level. Using a monoclonal antibody directed against the DED-containing N terminus of c-FLIP, we detected a short isoform of c-FLIP in a number of cell lines that was different from c-FLIPS. We identified this isoform as c-FLIPR. It was initially cloned in 2001 by Djerbi et al. (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed differential expression of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS in several cell lines. In some cell lines only one isoform was detected, whereas in others both were present. c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS demonstrated comparable biochemical characteristics with respect to their recruitment to the CD95 DISC. Furthermore, both isoforms possessed similar anti-apoptotic properties with respect to CD95-mediated apoptosis. We also observed similar characteristics of c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR with respect to half-life and CD3/CD28-induced up-regulation in primary human T cells. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time the presence of c-FLIPR protein in a number of T and B cell lines as well as in primary human T cells and show that its role in apoptosis is comparable with that of c-FLIPS. Cell Lines—The T cell lines HUT78, CEM, H9, Jurkat FADD-deficient (clone I.21), Jurkat caspase-8-deficient (clone I.92), Jurkat wild type clone A3, and Jurkat clone J16, the B lymphoblastoid cell lines SKW6.4, Raji, and BJAB, and the pre-B cell line BoeR were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamycine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. The caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cell line (clone I.92), the FADD-deficient Jurkat cell line (clone I.21), and the wild type Jurkat clone A3 were obtained from J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School). Preparation of Primary Human T Cells, Cell Culture, and CD3, CD28, CD3/CD28 Stimulations—Human peripheral T cells were prepared as described previously (23Klas C. Debatin K.M. Jonker R.R. Krammer P.H. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For activation, resting primary human T cells (day 0) were cultured at 2 × 106 cells/ml with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin for 16 h (day 1). T cells were then washed three times and cultured for 5 additional days in the presence of 25 units/ml interleukin-2 (day 6). To reactivate day 5 primary human T cells via T cell receptor/CD3, 2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (30 μg/ml). Costimulation via CD28 was achieved by the addition of anti-CD28 antibodies (1.5 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse cross-linking antibodies (2 μg/ml) to the culture. The anti-CD28 isotype-identical antibody I2DIII was added to cells treated with OKT3 only. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-FADD monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG1) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-CD95 polyclonal antibody C-20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-caspase-8 mAb C15 (mouse IgG2b) recognizes the p18 subunit of caspase-8 (24Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

Anti-APO-1 is an agonistic monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG3) recognizing an epitope on the extracellular part of CD95 (APO-1/Fas) (7Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, -2a, and -2b were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Echingen, Germany). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Sigma. Reverse Transcription PCR for c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR—4 × 106 cells were lyzed for 10 min in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. 50 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used to amplify c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR from cDNA: c-FLIP sense, 5′-ATGTCTGCTGAAGTCATCC-3′; c-FLIPS antisense, 5′-CATGGAACAATTTCCAAG-3′; c-FLIPR antisense, 5′-TGCTGGGATTCCATATG-3′. Primers were purchased from MWG. Cloning of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS—c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS were cloned into the pEF4 expression vector (Invitrogen) using the polymerase chain reaction and the following primers: c-FLIP sense, 5′-ggggtaccccATGTCTGCTGAAGTCATCC-3′; c-FLIPS antisense, 5′-gctctagagcctaCATGGAACAATTTCCAAG-3′; c-FLIPR antisense, 5′-gctctagagcctaTGCTGGGATTCCATATG-3′. Cloning was performed using KpnI and XbaI (Fermentas). CD95 DISC Analysis by Immunoprecipitation—The composition of the CD95 DISC was determined as follows. 5 × 107 cells were either treated with 2 μg/ml anti-APO-1 (IgG3) for 5 min at 37 °C or left untreated, washed twice in 1 × PBS, and subsequently lyzed in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Triton X-100 (Serva, Germany), and 10% glycerol). CD95 was immunoprecipitated with anti-APO-1 antibody and Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed five times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro assays or analyzed using Laemmli gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The gels were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS/Tween at 4 °C overnight. Blots were developed with a chemoluminescence method following the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NF6 Immunoprecipitation—5 × 107 cells were lyzed in a volume of 1 ml for 30 min at 0 °C, followed by the addition of 100 μl of NF6 hybridoma supernatant together with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C, and then the beads were washed five times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting as described before. Cycloheximide (CHX) Experiments—For CHX treatment cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide as indicated. For assaying apoptosis in a cytotoxicity assay, 106 cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml CHX for 4 h, washed, and incubated with indicated concentrations of anti-APO-1 for 12 h at 37 °C in 24-well plates. Cell death was measured by forward scatter/side scatter via flow cytometry, and specific cell death was calculated as follows: (percentage of experimental cell death–percentage of spontaneous cell death)/(100–percentage of spontaneous cell death) × 100%. In Vitro DISC Recruitment Assay—The CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated from 5 × 107 HUT78 or SKW6.4 cells as described above, and DISC-containing beads were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]-labeled c-FLIPS or c-FLIPR (TNT, T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0,1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) overnight at 4 °C (26Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Reactions were separated into supernatants and beads, and the beads were washed five times in lysis buffer. Beads and supernatants were separated on 15% Laemmli gels, blotted, and subjected to autoradiography. Stable Transfection of BJAB Cells—Stable transfection of BJAB cells was performed using expression vectors encoding c-FLIPS, c-FLIPR, and the empty vector by electroporation (960 microfarads, 200 V). Selection pressure was added 48 h after transfection (100 μg/ml Zeocin) for 2 weeks. Expression was controlled by Western blot using anti-FLIP mAb NF6. Cytotoxicity Assay—For assaying apoptosis, 5 × 105 cells were incubated in 48-well plates with or without the indicated amounts of anti-APO-1 for 48 h at 37 °C. Cell death was measured by forward scatter/side scatter via flow cytometry, and specific cell death was calculated as described above. A New Short Variant of c-FLIP Is Detected on the Protein Level—Two c-FLIP isoforms, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, were found on the protein level (5Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 10Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To confirm these data we probed different T and B cell lines for c-FLIP expression (Fig. 1A). Cellular lysates were blotted, and c-FLIP proteins were detected with the mAb NF6 directed against the DED region of c-FLIP. Interestingly, we detected a third prominent band different from c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS in the B cell lines SKW6.4, BoeR, and Raji. The molecular mass of this product is lower than that of c-FLIPS. Raji and SKW6.4 mainly contained this new variant of c-FLIP, whereas it is coexpressed with c-FLIPS in BoeR cells. In the T cell lines HUT78 and JA3, coexpression of c-FLIPS and the shorter band could also be detected. To confirm our data we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-FLIP mAb NF6 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the results of total cell lysates, we detected both short variants, c-FLIPS and the new one in BoeR cells, whereas in Raji and SKW6.4 only the new c-FLIP variant was observed. Thus, we revealed a new protein product with a molecular mass lower than that of c-FLIPS that was recognized by anti-FLIP mAb NF6. Identification of the New c-FLIP Variant as c-FLIPR—Several alternatively spliced messenger RNAs for c-FLIP have been reported (10Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the newly observed c-FLIP variant is similar to the predicted molecular mass of the splice variant c-FLIPR (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mRNA encoding c-FLIPR had been cloned from Raji cells, but endogenous expression of the corresponding protein had never been shown so far. c-FLIPR possesses two tandem DEDs like c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL (Fig. 2A). Similar to c-FLIPS, c-FLIPR does not contain caspase-like domains (Fig. 2A). The human c-FLIP gene, with an estimated size of ∼48,000 bp, consists of 14 exons and gives rise to 13 distinct isoforms after splicing. Fig. 2B shows the exon composition of the coding portions of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS, and c-FLIPR mRNAs: the first three translated exons encode the two DEDs. The caspase-like domain of c-FLIPL is encoded by exons 8–10, 12, and 14. As the molecular mass of the new c-FLIP variant was similar to that predicted for c-FLIPR, we examined the possibility that the identified product was indeed c-FLIPR. To address this question we performed reverse transcription PCR. As a reverse primer for c-FLIPR we selected the sequence at the beginning of intron 6 and as a reverse primer for c-FLIPS the sequence at the beginning of exon 7 (Fig. 3A). In Raji and SKW6.4 cells we observed a product of ∼642 bp, which corresponds to the size of c-FLIPR mRNA (Fig. 3B) (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In HUT78 and J16 as well as in primary human T cells, we observed that both isoforms, c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS, were expressed on the mRNA level, although expression of the protein could not be detected in these cell lines (Fig. 1). To confirm that the new variant of c-FLIP was indeed c-FLIPR, we added in vitro translated c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS to cell lysates of HUT78 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLIP mAb NF6 (Fig. 3C). The products of immunoprecipitation were analyzed by Western blotting. As a control we used lysates of HUT78 cells that, according to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A), contain both c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS, with c-FLIPR present in a lower amount. We observed that the molecular mass of in vitro translated c-FLIPR was identical to the endogenous c-FLIPR. These results provide evidence that the new c-FLIP variant found at the protein level is indeed identical to c-FLIPR. c-FLIPR Is Recruited to the CD95 DISC and Exhibits Anti-apoptotic Characteristics in CD95-induced Apoptosis—The central function of c-FLIPS in CD95-mediated apoptosis is the inhibition of caspase-8 activation at the DISC (13Krueger A.

To check whether c-FLIPR is also recruited to the DISC, we performed CD95 DISC immunoprecipitation from HUT78, J16, SKW6.4, and Raji cell lines. Based on our analysis of c-FLIPR expression (Fig. 1A), we selected Raji and SKW6.4 cell lines as c-FLIPR-containing cell lines and HUT78 and J16 cell lines as cell lines predominantly expressing c-FLIPS. We observed c-FLIPS at the DISC immunoprecipitated from HUT78 cells (Fig. 4A). However, in Raji and SKW6.4 cells c-FLIPR was recruited to the DISC. The specificity of the CD95 DISC immunoprecipitation was controlled with Western blot analysis of DISC composition. We observed FADD, CD95, c-FLIPL, and procaspase-8 (p55/p53) as well as the caspase-8 cleavage products p43/p41 and p18 in the DISC immunoprecipitated from all cell lines. DISC formation in Jurkat cells was lower as these are reported to be CD95 “type II” cells, which are characterized by reduced CD95 DISC formation. Therefore, detection of DISC-associated proteins such as procaspase-8 cleavage products or full-length c-FLIPL is difficult (28Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To compare the binding of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS to the DISC in a semi-quantitative way, we employed an in vitro DISC recruitment assay. In vitro translated [35S]-labeled c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS were added to immunoprecipitates containing CD95 DISC proteins from SKW6.4 or HUT78 cells. Protein complexes were washed and recovered, and the amounts of c-FLIPS or c-FLIPR bound to the DISC were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). This assay revealed a similar recruitment of c-FLIPR (Fig. 4B, lane 5) and c-FLIPS (lane 3) into the DISC of HUT78 cells. The same result was obtained when CD95 DISC from SKW6.4 cells was used in this assay (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, we concluded that c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS have similar biochemical properties in vitro with respect to DISC binding. To assess the apoptotic properties of c-FLIPR in vivo, we constructed stable BJAB cell lines that overexpress c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS. The sensitivity of the corresponding cell lines toward CD95-mediated apoptosis was checked using different concentrations of anti-APO-1 (Fig. 4C). We observed that c-FLIPR protects cells from CD95-mediated death with the same efficiency as observed for c-FLIPS. c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS Have a Similar Half-life—c-FLIP proteins are reported to have a short half-life (27Schmitz I. Weyd H. Krueger A. Baumann S. Fas S.C. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Fulda S. Meyer E. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3947-3956PubMed Google Scholar). To monitor the half-life of c-FLIPR we followed the degradation of c-FLIPR upon addition of CHX to SKW6.4 cells (Fig. 5A). In parallel, degradation of c-FLIPS in HUT78 cells was monitored. The kinetics of degradation of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS were similar. Namely, both c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS were strongly down-regulated after 4 h of CHX treatment, whereas c-FLIPL levels were hardly affected. Identical results were obtained using BoeR cells, which coexpress c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS (Fig. 5B). To obtain more insight into the function of c-FLIPR we decided to check the correlation between the sensitivity of BoeR and SKW6.4 cells toward CD95-mediated apoptosis and the expression level of c-FLIPR. BoeR and SKW6.4 cells were pretreated with CHX for 4 h. According to our data this time point corresponds to the strong down-regulation of c-FLIPR (Fig. 5, A and B). Subsequently the cells were incubated for another 12 h with different concentrations of anti-APO-1. In previous studies BoeR cells were reported to be resistant toward CD95-mediated apoptosis despite high expression of CD95 (28Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Interestingly, addition of CHX sensitized the BoeR cells toward CD95-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Addition of CHX to SKW 6.4 cells, which contain only c-FLIPR, also resulted in an increased sensitivity to CD95 ligation (Fig. 5D). Thus, apoptosis sensitivity correlates with the decrease in the expression level of c-FLIPR. c-FLIPR in Primary Human T Cells—c-FLIPS is known to contribute to the resistance of short-term-activated T cells toward CD95-mediated apoptosis (22Kirchhoff S. Muller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Schmitz I. Weyd H. Krueger A. Baumann S. Fas S.C. Krammer P.H.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, c-FLIPS was identified as a new effector of CD28-mediated costimulation and as a mediator of resistance toward AICD after T cell receptor restimulation. Because we found the mRNA of c-FLIPR (Fig. 3B) in primary human T cells, we decided to examine the role of c-FLIPR in T cells in more detail. To examine the expression of c-FLIPR in primary human T cells we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-FLIP mAb NF6 from T cell lysates of several donors (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, we observed variations in the ratio between c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS from donor to donor. The expression of c-FLIPS was always higher than that of c-FLIPR. Moreover, in some donors c-FLIPR could not be detected. In addition, we analyzed the expression of c-FLIPR during the activation cycle of primary human T cells before and after both primary stimulation and restimulation on day 6 (Fig. 6B). According to previous reports, expression of c-FLIPL did not undergo drastic changes up to day 6. At the same time, we observed that expression of both short isoforms, c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR, was down-regulated from day 1 to day 6. Restimulation with anti-CD3 antibody resulted in up-regulation of c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR. To study the effects of CD3 restimulation as well as CD3/CD28 costimulation on FLIPR expression, we performed c-FLIP immunoprecipitation from day 6 primary human T cells (Fig. 6C). We analyzed primary human T cells from several donors, observing strong up-regulation of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS in response to all three stimuli. The up-regulation of c-FLIP was higher for CD3/CD28 costimulation as was already reported for c-FLIPS. Interestingly, for donors lacking c-FLIPR (Fig. 6C, left panel) costimulation with CD3/CD28 did not result in detection of c-FLIPR. Thus, we observed comparable expression patterns for both isoforms in primary human T cells, suggesting similar functions for both isoforms in this cellular context. c-FLIP plays an essential role in CD95-mediated apoptosis as well as in other death receptor-signaling pathways (tumor necrosis factor R1, TRAILR1, TRAILR2) (10Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 21Wajant H. Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thirteen splice variants of c-FLIP were discovered on the mRNA level, and only two of them, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, were detected on the protein level (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The role of c-FLIPS in CD95 signaling is well studied. When recruited to the DISC it inhibits caspase-8 activation and blocks CD95-mediated apoptosis. The role of c-FLIPL in CD95 signaling is controversial. According to recent reports it catalyzes caspase-8 processing at the DISC rather than playing an inhibitory role. In this study we demonstrate endogenous expression of a third splice variant of c-FLIP, c-FLIPR, on the protein level, the mRNA of which had been cloned previously. c-FLIPR has so far not been reported to exist as an endogenously expressed protein. In the study by Djerbi et al. (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), mRNA of c-FLIPR was found in Raji cells, but protein expression is not shown. However, in the literature, we find that authors often describe c-FLIPR in SKW6.4 cells as c-FLIPS, as these isoforms have very similar molecular masses (27Schmitz I. Weyd H. Krueger A. Baumann S. Fas S.C. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the study by Scaffidi et al. (14Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), where the expression of c-FLIP was analyzed in a panel of cell lines, it is evident that the molecular mass of the isoform described as c-FLIPS in Raji and SKW6.4 cells is clearly lower than in other cell lines analyzed. In our work we clearly show that c-FLIPS is detected neither on the mRNA nor on the protein levels in these two cell lines, thus demonstrating exclusive expression of c-FLIPR. c-FLIPR is structurally highly similar to c-FLIPS. Both isoforms contain two DED at their N terminus (Fig. 2A) but differ in their C termini (Fig. 2). The C terminus of c-FLIPR has a fragment corresponding to translation of the small part of intron 6 that is shorter than the C terminus of c-FLIPS resulting from the translation of the fragment of exon 7. The actual sizes of the different C termini are 11 and 19 amino acids for c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS, respectively. Therefore, we expected c-FLIPR to have a similar affinity to the CD95 DISC as c-FLIPS. As expected, we observed c-FLIPR recruitment to the CD95 DISC in Raji and SKW6.4 cell lines. Moreover, in vitro translated c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR bound to the CD95 DISC with comparable affinity. Most likely, c-FLIPR blocks activation of procaspase-8 at the CD95 DISC by a mechanism similar to c-FLIPS. In a study by Djerbi et al. (11Djerbi M. Darreh-Shori T. Zhivotovsky B. Grandien A. Scand J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), retroviral expression of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS inhibited death receptor-dependent apoptosis with comparable efficiency in the murine lymphoma cell line A20. We observed a similar inhibition of CD95-induced apoptosis upon overexpression of c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS in the B lymphoblastoid cell line BJAB. This seems plausible in light of the high similarity between those two isoforms and the fact that both short variants of c-FLIP seem to be expressed independently of each other. c-FLIP isoforms are characterized by a short half-life. It has been proposed previously that mechanisms of differential degradation of c-FLIP isoforms might be important for apoptosis sensitivity (27Schmitz I. Weyd H. Krueger A. Baumann S. Fas S.C. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in the half-life of c-FLIPR. Our data demonstrate that c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR have similar proteolytic degradation rates, strengthening our hypothesis of functional redundancy between both short variants of c-FLIP. At the same time we have demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic properties of c-FLIPR are similar to that of c-FLIPS. We observed that down-regulation of both isoforms in CHX-treated BoeR cells rendered them sensitive toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, down-regulation of only the c-FLIPR isoform in SKW6.4 cells resulted in an increase of their sensitivity. Sensitization of those two cell lines with CHX was reported before, but the correlation with down-regulation of c-FLIPR was not found. Thus, most probably c-FLIPR plays an important role in the resistance toward CD95-mediated apoptosis, similar to that of c-FLIPS. Moreover, one might speculate that the resistance of BoeR cells is based on the presence of both short c-FLIP isoforms, which provide a very efficient blockage of the CD95 DISC by unclear mechanisms. This question should be addressed in future studies. Recently, CD95 was demonstrated to trigger the NF-κB pathway (31Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Rumpf J.J. Samel D. Leverkus M. Janssen O. Hacker G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Legembre P. Barnhart B.C. Zheng L. Vijayan S. Straus S.E. Puck J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL were shown to be important regulators of CD95L-induced NF-κB (31Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Rumpf J.J. Samel D. Leverkus M. Janssen O. Hacker G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both isoforms blocked CD95L-induced NF-κB activation. The structural similarity of c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR and the redundancy of their anti-apoptotic functions in CD95 signaling make it most likely that both short isoforms play similar roles in CD95L-induced NF-κB activation. Addressing this issue in detail in future experiments would help to better understand the role of c-FLIP proteins in NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, we detected the expression of both short isoforms, c-FLIPS and c-FLIPR, in primary human T cells. c-FLIPS was reported to rescue cells from AICD in primary human T cells (22Kirchhoff S. Muller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We studied expression of c-FLIPR during T cell restimulation and found that, similar to c-FLIPS, it also undergoes up-regulation after CD3 or CD28 triggering and CD3/CD28 costimulation. Thus, c-FLIPR and c-FLIPS seem to be similar in primary human T cells. In this study we have shown the presence of c-FLIPR protein in a number of cell lines. In two cell lines we observed the exclusive presence of c-FLIPR, suggesting functional redundancy between both short variants of c-FLIP. The mechanism by which differential expression of splice variants in different cell lines is regulated requires clarification.

https://openalex.org/W2004186443,"The phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance in manganites is generally agreed to be a result of competition between crystal phases with different electronic, magnetic, and structural order; a competition which can be strong enough to cause phase separation between metallic ferromagnet and insulating charge modulated states. Nevertheless, closer inspection of phase diagrams in many manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of magnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist. Here we show that such experiments can be naturally explained within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory. In contrast to models where phase separation originates from disorder or as a strain induced kinetic phenomenon, we argue that magnetic and charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich diagram of equilibrium phases, qualitatively similar to those seen in experiment. The success of this model argues for a fundamental reinterpretation of the nature of charge modulation in these materials from a localised to a more extended ""charge density wave"" picture. The same symmetry considerations that favour textured coexistance of charge and magnetic order may apply to many electronic systems with competing phases. The resulting ""Electronically soft"" phases of matter with incommensurate, inhomogeneous and mixed order may be general phenomena in correlated systems."

The mutations were introduced into a stabilized variant. The cancer hot spot mutation R273H simply removes an arginine involved in DNA binding without causing structural distortions in neighboring residues. In contrast, the “structural” oncogenic mutations H168R and R249S induce substantial structural perturbation around the mutation site in the L2 and L3 loops, respectively. H168R is a specific intragenic suppressor mutation for R249S. When both cancer mutations are combined in the same molecule, Arg168 mimics the role of Arg249 in wild type, and the wild type conformation is largely restored in both loops. Our structural and biophysical data provide compelling evidence for the mechanism of rescue of mutant p53 by intragenic suppressor mutations and reveal features by which proteins can adapt to deleterious mutations.

Our structural and biophysical data provide compelling evidence for the mechanism of rescue of mutant p53 by intragenic suppressor mutations and reveal features by which proteins can adapt to deleterious mutations. The tumor suppressor p53 is a tetrameric multidomain transcription factor that has an essential role in maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell. In response to DNA damage, UV irradiation, hypoxia, and other stresses, p53 activates the expression of a variety of genes that encode proteins responsible for G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 2Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). p53 is inactivated in virtually all human cancers. In about 50% of all human cancers, this inactivation is a direct result of mutations in the p53 gene. Most cancer-associated p53 mutations map to the DNA binding core domain of the protein (p53C). 1The abbreviations used are: p53C, p53 core domain (residues 94–312); AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MME, monomethyl ether; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s., root mean square; T-p53C, p53 core domain (residues 94 –312) containing the four point mutations M133L, V203A, N239Y and N268D. Six hot spot sites are most frequently mutated in human cancers (Arg175, Gly245, Arg248, Arg249, Arg273, and Arg282) (4Hainaut P. Hollstein M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 81-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human p53 core domain in complex with consensus DNA has provided a framework for understanding the deleterious effect of many cancer mutants (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). A large immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich, forming a compact barrel-like structure, provides the basic scaffold for the conserved DNA binding surface (Fig. 1A). This extended surface, rich in basic amino acids, consists of a loop-sheet-helix motif and two large loops (L2 and L3). These two loops are stabilized by a zinc ion, which is coordinated by three cysteines and a histidine (Cys176, His179, Cys238, and Cys242) (Fig. 1B). On the basis of this structure, common cancer mutations have been classified as “structural” mutations resulting in structural perturbations of the core domain or “contact” mutations resulting in the loss of a DNA-contacting residue. A more detailed picture has emerged from quantitative stability and DNA binding studies for wild type p53 and several cancer-associated mutants (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 7Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The core domain of human p53 has low intrinsic thermodynamic stability, and its melting temperature is only slightly above body temperature. Hence, even weakly destabilizing mutations can have a detrimental effect and result in a large population of unfolded protein under physiological conditions. On the basis of these studies, cancerassociated mutations in the core domain can be subdivided into three classes: (i) DNA contact mutations, such as R273H, with little effect on the overall stability of the protein but impaired function because of the loss of a residue mediating DNA contacts. (ii) Mutations causing local distortions that destabilize the core domain by <2 kcal/mol. Many mutations in the DNA binding surface such as the hot spot mutations G245S and R249S fall into this category. (iii) Mutations that are highly destabilizing (>3 kcal/mol) and result in global unfolding of the protein at body temperature. The deleterious effect of some cancer mutants can be reversed by intragenic second-site suppressor mutations. Using a yeast selection system in combination with mammalian reporter gene and apoptosis assays, Brachmann et al. (8Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have identified several such second-site suppressor mutations. Some of these second-site suppressor mutations are not specific for one cancer mutation, but restore activity in a whole subset of cancer mutants albeit at different levels. Remarkably, H168R, which in conjunction with T123A is reported to rescue the cancer hot spot mutant R249S, is oncogenic when on its own. In a more recent study, it was shown that 16 of 30 common cancer mutants are rescued by mutations in codons 235, 239, and 240, either alone or in combination (9Baroni T.E. Wang T. Qian H. Dearth L.R. Truong L.N. Zeng J. Denes A.E. Chen S.W. Brachmann R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4930-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Double-mutant cycles have shown that some of these second-site suppressor mutations rescue mutant p53 by increasing its thermodynamic stability and thus compensate for the stability loss induced by the oncogenic mutation (10Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By adopting a semirational approach based on the molecular evolution of p53 and known second-site suppressor mutations, Nikolova et al. (11Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) designed a superstable quadruple mutant (M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D) of human p53 core domain (T-p53C). The four mutations stabilize the core domain by 2.65 kcal/mol without impairing its DNA binding activity. The effects of the four point mutations on stability are nearly additive. The main contributions come from the N239Y and N268D mutations, which are both known to restore activity in several cancer-associated mutants (8Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T-p53C in its DNA-free form reveals that the four point mutations cause only local structural changes, whereas the overall structure of the β-sandwich and the DNA binding surface is conserved (12Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The observed local structural changes caused by the mutations, however, seem to affect the flexibility of the protein and reduce the plasticity of the core domain structure both locally and globally. The N268D mutation, for instance, resulted in an altered hydrogen bond pattern, which links the two sheets of the β-sandwich in an energetically more favorable way than in the wild type structure. This structure provided a first insight into how the two second-site suppressor mutations might rescue some of the common structurally destabilized cancer mutants such as G245S and the temperature-sensitive mutant V143A. Structural studies of destabilized mutants of p53 have been hampered because of low stability of the wild type scaffold. Here, we report the high resolution crystal structures of the cancer hot spot mutants R273H and R249S in the structural context of T-p53C to establish the molecular basis for the carcinogenic effect of these mutations. In addition, we have solved the crystal structures of T-p53-H168R, T-p53-H168R/R249S, and T-p53-T123A/H168R/R249S to elucidate how the cancer hot spot mutant R249S is rescued by intragenic suppressor mutations. The structural studies were further complemented with DNA binding studies and stability measurements. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—The DNA coding for human p53 core domain mutant M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D (residues 94 –312) in vector pRSET(A) (11Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P.

Additional point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified following published protocols (11Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Urea Denaturation—Samples for urea denaturation experiments were prepared using a Hamilton Microlab dispenser from stock solutions of urea, buffer, and protein to contain 1 μm protein in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, and increasing concentrations of urea. Samples were incubated at 10 °C for 14 h prior to measurement. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the p53 core domain, excited at 280 nm, were recorded in the range of 300–400 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer equipped with Waters 2700 sample manager and controlled by laboratory software. The data were analyzed as described previously (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Determination of DNA Binding Affinities by Analytical Ultracentrifugation—DNA binding studies by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) were performed with fluorescein-labeled DNA containing the gadd45 recognition element. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-fluorescein-GAGCAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGCTC-3′ and an unlabeled oligonucleotide with the complementary sequence. Annealing and purification of double-stranded DNA were carried out as described previously (14Weinberg R.L. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All AUC experiments were performed at 10 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-I centrifuge and a 60Ti rotor. Samples of 5 μmgadd45 DNA and 100 μm p53 core domain variant were made up in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT. To measure the stoichiometry and dissociation constant for protein binding to fluorescein-labeled DNA, absorbance at 495 nm and interference data were recorded, and data were analyzed using UltraSpin software (www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk). The size of the complex, the concentrations of free protein, free DNA, and complex formed at the reference position were calculated from the absorbance and interference data. The dissociation constant was calculated as shown in Equation 1. KD=([free DNA]/[complex])∗[free protein]eq.1 Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown at 17 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. The drops typically contained 3 μl of protein solution (5.8 –7.7 mg/ml protein in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, or 150 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and 3 μl of the appropriate reservoir solution above a reservoir solution of 400 μl. The crystals used for data collection were obtained with the following reservoir conditions: T-p53C-R273H: 50 mm MgSO4, 19% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 10 mm DTT; T-p53C-R249S: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether (MME), 0.8 m sodium formate, 10 mm DTT; T-p53C-H168R: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 26% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 0.3 m sodium formate, 10 mm DTT; T-p53C-H168R/R249S and T-p53C-T123A/H168R/R249S: 33 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 67 mm Mes, pH 6.4, 26% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 0.8 m sodium formate, and 10 mm DTT. Crystals of T-p53C-R273H were isomorphous to those obtained for the previously published structure of T-p53C (12Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab For x-ray data collection, all crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) PEG 200 and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. A full diffraction data set for T-p53C-R273H was collected at 100 K on a rotating anode (Rigaku RuRH3R generator) fitted with an Oxford Cryostream cooling system and a Mar Research image plate scanner (Mar 300). The other data sets were collected at 100 K on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France (T-p53C-H168R) and beamline 14.1 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK (T-p53C-R249S, T-p53C-H168R/R249S, T-p53C-T123A/H168R/R249S). All data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM (15Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and further processed using CCP4 (16Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

As search model we used molecule A of T-p53C (PDB code 1UOL). 5% of all reflections were flagged for the calculation of Rfree and excluded from subsequent refinement. The rotation and translation searches gave unambiguous solutions for one molecule in the asymmetric unit for the hexagonal crystals and two molecules in the case of the orthorhombic crystals. All subsequent structure refinement was carried out with CNS. Water molecules were added to the structure using the waterpick option implemented within CNS. The final models were obtained after several cycles of refinement with CNS and manual rebuilding in MAIN (18.Turk, D.

PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Model refinement statistics are summarized in Table III. The figures were generated using MOLSCRIPT (20Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Effects of Mutations on the Stability of T-p53C—T-p53C was chosen as a framework for studying the structural effects of cancer hot spot mutations by x-ray crystallography because its higher thermodynamic stability should make it more amenable for crystallographic studies, in particular in the case of highly destabilizing mutations. The effect of common cancer mutations on the thermodynamic stability of wild type p53 has been well studied by urea denaturation (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 7Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have performed the same experiments for some of these cancer mutants in the context of the superstable quadruple mutant T-p53C, which is stabilized by 2.65 kcal/mol, to assess whether they have the same effect on stability as in wild type p53. Our results show that this is exactly the case independent of the type of cancer mutation (Table I). The mutation R273H only marginally affects the stability of both wild type and T-p53C, whereas the R249S cancer mutation in the L3 loop destabilizes the protein by almost 2 kcal/mol in both cases. A much larger effect is observed for mutation H168R, which destabilizes the core domain by 3 kcal/mol. If the two mutations did not interact, then the double mutant would be destabilized by the sum of their individual values (10Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The destabilizing effects of the H168R and R249S mutations, however, are not additive, and their combined value is 1.88 kcal/mol, considerably less than the 5 kcal/mol expected for structurally independent mutations. The lack of additivity shows that there are interacting structural changes upon mutation (10Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R.

Open table in a new tab DNA Binding Properties of T-p53C Mutants—We analyzed the binding of p53 core domain to specific double-stranded DNA containing the gadd45 recognition element by AUC. For wild type, we measured a dissociation constant KD = 14 μm in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 150 mm KCl (Table II). The KD for T-p53C under these conditions was slightly lower (KD = 10 μm). The DNA contact mutant T-p53C-R273H had a much reduced but still appreciable affinity, with a dissociation constant KD = 51 μm. The affinity for T-p53C-H168R (KD = 27 μm) was between that of wild type and the contact mutant T-p53C-R273H. Most interestingly, DNA binding is gradually restored along the series p53C-R249S → T-p53C-R249S → T-p53C-H168R/R249S and T-p53C-T123A/H168R/R249S. The KD for gadd45 binding is decreased along this series from ≈ 200 μm → 56 μm → 13 μm, which brings it back to the wild type level, despite the presence of the cancer hot spot mutation R249S.Table IIBinding of p53 core domain mutants to gadd45 DNAp53 variantKDaKD values were determined by AUC at 10 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT.

The resolution for all five structures was in the range of 1.80 –1.98 Å. Crystals of mutant T-p53C-R273H were isomorphous to those of the previously published structure of the superstable quadruple mutant T-p53C and contained two molecules/asymmetric unit. The structures of the four remaining mutants were all solved in a new crystal form belonging to the hexagonal space group P6522 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. In all structures, the C-terminal residues beyond 291 were disordered, which is consistent with previously reported structures of p53 core domain (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 12Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mutant T-p53C-R273H—The cancer hot spot mutation R273H is the classic example of a DNA contact mutant. The mutation significantly impairs DNA binding but has no noteworthy effect on the thermodynamic stability of the core domain (7Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In the structure of p53 wild type in complex with consensus DNA (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar), the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg273 is in close contact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the DNA. Further, it forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of Asp281 on the C-terminal helix, and the aliphatic moiety of the side chain packs against the aromatic ring of Phe134. The same interactions with neighboring residues can also be observed in the DNA-free form of the wild type and T-p53C (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 12Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The structures of mutant T-p53C-R273H and T-p53C, which were both solved in the same space group at a similar resolution, are almost identical. A superposition of the Cα atoms gives a r.m.s. deviation of 0.13 Å (molecule A) and 0.16 Å (molecule B) for individual chains and a r.m.s. deviation of 0.21 Å when the non-crystallographic dimers are superimposed. The R273H mutation induces only minor changes in neighboring residues (Fig. 2). The imidazole ring of His273 makes several specific contacts. Via the Nδ atom it is linked to a water molecule and the hydroxyl of Ser240. A second water molecule bridges the Nϵ atom and the carboxylate group of Asp281. The Cβ, Cγ, and Cδ atoms are within van der Waals distance of the aromatic ring of Phe134 and occupy almost the same positions as the equivalent atoms of Arg273 in the wild type and T-p53C. Apart from this very localized structural change, the architecture of the DNA binding surface is perfectly conserved. This explains why binding of specific DNA is not completely abolished in T-p53C-R273H. The KD for binding of gadd45 DNA was only increased 5-fold relative to T-p53C, under our experimental conditions (Table II). On the basis of the crystal structure of T-p53C-R273H, this effect can be ascribed exclusively to the loss of interactions with DNA mediated by the guanidinium group of Arg273. Mutant T-p53C-R249S—The cancer hot spot mutant R249S has been described as a structural mutant. It is thermodynamically destabilized by almost 2 kcal/mol concomitant with an impaired DNA binding function (7Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T-p53C-R249S now reveals the reason for the deleterious effect of this mutation. Superposition of the Cα atoms in the structures of T-p53C-R249S and T-p53C gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 Å. The structure of the β-sandwich is not affected by the mutation, whereas there are substantial structural changes in the DNA binding surface (Fig. 3, A and B). Loop L3 adopts a conformation that is very different from the one observed in wild type. Residues 244 –248 next to the mutation site are hi"

The pleiotropic role of trehalose in the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its absence from mammalian cells suggests that its biosynthesis may provide a useful target for novel drugs. However, there are three potential pathways for trehalose biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis, and the aim of the present study was to introduce mutations into each of the pathways to determine whether or not they are functionally redundant. The results show that the OtsAB pathway, which generates trehalose from glucose and glucose-6-phosphate, is the dominant pathway required for M. tuberculosis growth in laboratory culture and for virulence in a mouse model. Of the two otsB homologues annotated in the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis, only OtsB2 (Rv3372) has a functional role in the pathway. OtsB2, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, is strictly essential for growth and provides a tractable target for high throughput screening. Inactivation of the TreYZ pathway, which can generate trehalose from α-1,4-linked glucose polymers, had no effect on the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro or in mice. Deletion of the treS gene altered the late stages of pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis in mice, significantly increasing the time to death in a chronic infection model. Because the TreS enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of trehalose and maltose, the mouse phenotype could reflect either a requirement for synthesis of additional trehalose or, conversely, a requirement for breakdown of stored trehalose to liberate free glucose.

The non-reducing disaccharide trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1, 1)-α-d-glucopyranoside) is found in bacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, and invertebrates, but not in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Elbein A.D.

Trehalose can function as a compatible solute to stabilize cells during osmotic stress, and its accumulation has been widely implicated in preserving cell viability during exposure to a range of environmental stresses, including heat shock, dehydration, and hypoxia (2Arguelles J.C.

Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ryll R. Kumazawa Y. Yano I. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 45: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We are interested in analyzing the role of trehalose in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Current models of tuberculosis envisage the contribution of at least two phenotypic forms of the bacteria: an actively replicating form involved in the initial establishment of infection and during active disease and a non-replicating form involved in latent infection and, in persistence, during chemotherapy. Current drugs act primarily on replicating bacteria, and a key challenge for improved tuberculosis control is to develop novel compounds that are equally active against the non-replicating populations. It is anticipated that these would allow shortening of the conventional six-month treatment regimen, as well as providing preventive therapy for individuals who are carrying a latent infection. We hypothesized that the dual role of trehalose, in biogenesis of the cell wall of replicating bacteria and as a stress protectant in non-replicating bacteria, would make its biosynthesis an appropriate target for this new class of drug. However, we have reported previously (7De Smet K.A. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that three independent pathways are available for trehalose biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis: the OtsAB pathway (which utilizes glucose and glucose-6-phosphate), the TreYZ pathway (which makes trehalose from glycogen), and the TreS enzyme (which can convert maltose to trehalose). If each of these pathways is able to generate the trehalose pool required for growth and survival of M. tuberculosis, this would obviously compromise the activity of a drug targeting any single enzyme. In addition, genome sequence analysis has identified two open reading frames in M. tuberculosis with homology to the otsB gene that encodes the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase required for the OtsAB pathway (8Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. II I Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Interestingly, one of the homologues (otsB1, Rv2006) is a member of a regulon that is induced by exposure to hypoxia or to low concentrations of nitric oxide and is associated with non-replicating survival of M. tuberculosis (9Voskuil M.I.

Again, the existence of alternative branching pathways is an important consideration in the assessment of potential drug targeting. Recent reports have analyzed the role of these three pathways for trehalose biosynthesis in the fast growing saprophytic mycobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis (10Klutts S. Pastuszak I. Edavana V.K.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicated that the three pathways are functionally redundant in M. smegmatis (13Woodruff P.J. Carlson B.L. Siridechadilok B. Pratt M.R. Senaratne R.H. Mougous J.D. Riley L.W. Williams S.J. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol.

Single mutations targeting each of the pathways generated no apparent phenotypic defects in the resulting clones as assessed by growth or by glycolipid content. A triple mutant, with all three pathways inactivated, was dependent on the provision of exogenous trehalose for growth and was defective in stationary phase survival and in exposure to elevated temperature (13Woodruff P.J. Carlson B.L. Siridechadilok B. Pratt M.R. Senaratne R.H. Mougous J.D. Riley L.W. Williams S.J. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol.

Again, mutation of all three pathways was accompanied by a marked growth defect, but in C. glutamicum this was also observed in the case of an otsA-treY double knockout. Analysis of the effect of different combinations of mutations on trehalose content and bacterial survival following osmotic stress led to the conclusion that TreYZ represents the major pathway for trehalose biosynthesis in C. glutamicum, with OtsAB playing a minor accessory role, and TreS contributing to trehalose degradation through its ability to catalyze the interchange of trehalose and maltose (14Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Wolf A. Kramer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To date, the only information on the contribution of the various pathways to trehalose anabolism in M. tuberculosis comes from a transposon site hybridization mutagenesis study carried out by Sassetti, Boyd, and Rubin (16Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). This showed that insertions into the otsA and otsB2 genes were associated with severe growth defects in vitro and that insertions into treS showed significantly reduced growth. The aim of the present study was to assess the relative role of each of the three trehalose biosynthesis pathways in M. tuberculosis, during growth in laboratory medium and during infection in a mouse model. In contrast to the results with M. smegmatis and with C. glutamicum, our studies demonstrated that OtsAB is the predominant pathway in M. tuberculosis. The mutagenesis results are consistent with biochemical studies demonstrating that trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase activity is associated with only one of the OtsB homologues in M. tuberculosis (17Edavana V.K. Pastuszak I. Carroll J.D. Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and highlight this enzyme as an attractive target for drug development. Construction of Knock-out Mutants—Approximately 1.5 kb flanking otsA, otsB1, otsB2, treS, and treY was amplified using the upstream and downstream primers listed in Table I and the Roche Expand High Fidelity PCR system. Constructs were designed to remove the entire coding region of the gene. Fragments were cleaved with the enzymes indicated in the table and cloned either side of the hygromycin resistance cassette in the vector pSMT100, which contains sacB as a counter-selectable marker (18Stewart G.R. Snewin V.A. Walzl G. Hussell T. Tormay P. O'Gaora P. Goyal M. Betts J. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ligations were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and selected on LB plates containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin. Plasmids were purified and verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and sequencing. Approximately 1 μg of DNA was exposed to 1000 μJ cm–2 of UV irradiation using a UVP CL-1000 cross-linker before electroporation into M. tuberculosis H37Rv, Moraxella bovis AF2122/97, and M. bovis BCG Pasteur as described by Stewart et al. (18Stewart G.R. Snewin V.A. Walzl G. Hussell T. Tormay P. O'Gaora P. Goyal M. Betts J. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Double cross-overs were selected on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with OADC (Difco), 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2% sucrose. Colonies were visible after 3–4 weeks. Recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting, PCR, and sequencing (data not shown).Table IPrimers used for knock-out and expression plasmid constructionGeneaRv gene designations: otsA, Rv3490; otsB, Rv2006; otsB2, Rv3372; treY, Rv1563c; treS, Rv0126.Regionb1.5 kb upstream and downstream were cloned either side of the hygromycin cassette for knock-out plasmid construction.PurposecKO, knock-out; Exp, expression.PrimerREdRE, restriction endonucleases.Sequence (5′-3′)eRestriction endonuclease recognition sites are underlined.otsAUpKOA1FBamHICGGGATCCGGAGAGATGGCCACTATTGCCotsAUpKOA2RSpeIGGACTAGTCATTAGCTCTCGAGTTTGGCCotsADownKOA3FBglIIGAAGATCTTAACGGTCAAGCCGCTCCCGotsADownKOA4RXbaIGCTCTAGAAACCGGTTCGTCAACGGCACCotsBUpKOB1FBamHICGGGATCCTGCCAACGCCGCGCCACCGotsBUpKOB2RSpeIGGACTAGTCACGCTTGGATTCGGGCGTCGotsBDownKOB3FXbaIGCTCTAGATGACCAATGTCGCACATGGTGGGotsBDownKOB4RPstIAACTGCAGCGGCCCGGTTTCTTATCCTGGGotsB2UpKOB21FBamHICGGGATCCGGCGGACACTTATACCTGGGGotsB2UpKOB22RSpeIGGACTAGTCACGACCCACCCTCTCACGGotsB2DownKOB23FBglIIGAAGATCTTGAGACGCGGTGCCGCCGotsB2DownKOB24RXbaIGCTCTAGAGATAGCCGAGATAGGCCCCCotsB2ExpB2FNdeICCCATATGCGCAAGTTGGGCCCGGTCotsB2ExpB2RXhoICCCTCGAGTCACGTTGCCCGCAGGGGAGCtreSUpKOS1FBamHICGGGATCCCAGCTATACGGCAACGGCGtreSUpKOS2RSpeIGGACTAGTCATTGCTTCCACGATGCCACGtreSDownKOS3FBglIIGAAGATCTTGACTCGCGCCGGCGACGATGCtreSDownKOS4RXbaIGCTCTAGAACGCCCAGGACGCACGCACGCtreSExpSFor1NdeICCCATATGAACGAGGCAGAACACAGCGTCtreSExpSRev1XhoICCCTCGAGTCATAGGCGCCGCTCTCCCtreYUpKOY1FBamHICGGGATCCGCGATAAAACCGGTGCAACCtreYUpKOY2RSpeIGGACTAGTTGAATTCCGAGTATGGGACCtreYDownKOY3FBglIIGAAGATCTCATATTTCACAACGTCTTACGCAGtreYDownKOY4RXbaIGCTCTAGACACCGCCGTTGAGTTGATGCa Rv gene designations: otsA, Rv3490; otsB, Rv2006; otsB2, Rv3372; treY, Rv1563c; treS, Rv0126.b 1.5 kb upstream and downstream were cloned either side of the hygromycin cassette for knock-out plasmid construction.c KO, knock-out; Exp, expression.d RE, restriction endonucleases.e Restriction endonuclease recognition sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab To facilitate inactivation of the otsB2 gene, a diploid strain was constructed by integrating a second copy of the gene at the attB site (19Lee M.H. Pascopella L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3111-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, the otsB2 gene plus the upstream flanking sequence were amplified by PCR using primers B21F and B2R (Table I). This 3-kb fragment was cloned into pCRBlunt II (Invitrogen) and restricted with NheI to release the otsB2 gene plus a 400-bp upstream fragment that includes the promoter; this was cloned into the integrating vector pKINTA (20Stewart G.R. Wernisch L. Stabler R. Mangan J.A. Hinds J. Laing K.G. Young D.B. Butcher P.D. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3129-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated and electroporated into M. tuberculosis H37Rv as described above but without prior UV irradiation treatment. Deletion of the chromosomal copy of the otsB2 gene after transformation with the knock-out construct was monitored as described above. In Vivo Analysis of Knock-out Mutants—Groups of 22 female C57BL/6 mice 10–14 weeks of age were infected intravenously in the tail vein with 106 filtered single cell mycobacterial suspension. The preparation of clump-free mid-log-phase mycobacteria suspensions has been described elsewhere (21Lyadova I. Yeremeev V. Majorov K. Nikonenko B. Khaidukov S. Kondratieva T. Kobets N. Apt A.

Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the concentration of bacilli (>90% single cells) was directly estimated by microscopy using a conventional cytometer and adjusted for all mycobacterial strains tested. The accuracy of estimations was confirmed by counting mycobacterial microcolonies as described by Mischenko et al. (23Mischenko V.V. Kapina M.A. Eruslanov E.B. Kondratieva E.V. Lyadova I.V. Young D.B. Apt A.S. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The variation between strains was <10%. Four mice from each group were culled on days 10, 35, and 56 post-infection and colony forming units counted in lungs and spleens. To assess mycobacterial loads in the organs, 0.1 ml of serial 10-fold dilutions of whole organ homogenates were plated onto Dubos agar, and the colonies were counted after 18–20 days of incubation at 37 °C. The remaining 10 mice from each infection were assessed for survival over 10 months. Expression and Purification of Trehalose Biosynthesis Enzymes—The genes encoding OtsB2 and TreS were amplified using the primers for expression indicated in Table I and restricted with NdeI and XhoI for cloning into pET15b (Novagen). These expression plasmids were transformed into the E. coli B strains BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLysS, Origami(DE3), and Origami(DE3)pLysS and the E. coli K12 host HMS174(DE3) (all from Novagen). No significant differences in protein expression were found using these strains, and all subsequent experiments were carried out using BL21(DE3). Fifty-ml log phase cultures (A600 nm = 0.5–0.6) grown at 22 °C were induced overnight with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The pellet was solubilized in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1× Novagen Bugbuster) and the cleared lysate applied to an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography spin column (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen). The column was washed according to the manufacturer's instructions before the bound protein was eluted using 250 mm imidazole dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and then stored at –70 °C. The samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Samples of TreS for NMR analysis were obtained from a pQE30-TreS clone (7De Smet K.A. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid and Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography. Analytical gel filtration studies of His6-TreS samples of between 1 and 10 mg/ml protein concentration found that the protein eluted at a volume consistent with an apparent molecular mass of ∼140k Da, suggesting that TreS was dimeric under these conditions. Trehalose-6-phosphate Phosphatase Enzyme Assay—Recombinant OtsB2 protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, to remove free phosphate, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Phosphatase activity was measured in a final volume of 50 μl containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm trehalose-6-phosphate (Sigma) and 100 ng of purified enzyme. This was incubated in a microtitre plate at 37 °C for 10 min. 200 μl of filtered 1% ammonium molybdate, 0.15% malachite green, and 12.5% v/v concentrated HCl were then added, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured to determine the amount of free phosphate produced, which was linear in the range of 0–0.1 mm (24Matula M. Mitchell M. Elbein A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate specificity was determined by replacing the trehalose-6-phosphate with 1 mm of fructose-6-phosphate, galactose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, mannose-6-phosphate, maltose-6-phosphate, or sucrose-6-phosphate (all from Sigma). Co-factor specificity was determined by replacing the 2 mm MgCl2 in the above incubation buffer with 2mm CaCl2, CoCl2, FeCl2, or MnCl2. A combination of 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2 was tested, as was 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA. 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Varian UNITYplus spectrometer (operating at a nominal frequency of 500 MHz) equipped with a triple resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) probe including z-axis pulse field gradients. One-dimensional 1H spectra were obtained for 5 mm maltose and trehalose (time 0), and then ∼10 μm TreS enzyme was added and spectra collected after 5, 120, and 240 min. Construction of M. tuberculosis Mutants with Deletions in Trehalose Biosynthesis Pathways—Previous bioinformatic and biochemical analysis demonstrates the presence of three potential pathways for biosynthesis of trehalose in M. tuberculosis (7De Smet K.A. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To assess their relative contribution to mycobacterial biology, we targeted five genes from the three pathways for mutagenesis. Flanking regions for otsA, otsB1, otsB2, treS, and treY were cloned on either side of the hygromycin resistance cassette in the pSMT100 vector and transformed into M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Clones in which a double cross-over had resulted in replacement of the targeted gene by the hygromycin cassette were identified by counter-selection against the sacB marker on the plasmid vector. Between 30 and 40 colonies/μgof transforming DNA were recovered for treS, treY, and otsB1; the majority of those screened corresponded to the anticipated knock-outs. Fewer than 10 colonies/μg of transforming DNA were obtained for otsA, some of which were mutants. Only a few colonies were recovered on otsB2 plates; none were the required mutants. Recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting and PCR (data not shown). The ΔotsB1, ΔtreY, and ΔtreS clones showed no obvious growth impairment, but the ΔotsA clone grew slowly in liquid medium, and colonies on agar plates were visibly smaller than those formed by the other mutants. To explore the reason for the failure to obtain an otsB2 knock-out, we generated a diploid strain of M. tuberculosis carrying a second copy of the otsB2 gene integrated into the attB site on the chromosome. Transformation of this strain with the pSMT100::otsB2 deletion construct resulted in multiple double cross-over mutants in which the hygromycin cassette had replaced the original chromosomal copy of the gene. This result confirms that failure to isolate the otsB2 mutant is because of the fact that this gene has an essential role for in vitro replication of M. tuberculosis. This role cannot be performed by the otsB1 gene, and the lack of phenotype for the ΔotsB1 clone is consistent with the biochemical observation that the protein product of otsB1 lacks functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase activity (17Edavana V.K. Pastuszak I. Carroll J.D. Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We repeated the deletion strategy with two other members of the M. tuberculosis complex, M. bovis AF2122/97 and M. bovis BCG Pasteur, the attenuated vaccine strain. M. bovis AF2122/97 belongs to a subset of M. bovis isolates that lack a functional treY gene as a result of a spontaneous chromosomal deletion (25Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Camus J.C. Medina N. Mansoor H. Pryor M. Duthoy S. Grondin S. Lacroix C. Monsempe C. Simon S. Harris B. Atkin R. Doggett J. Mayes R. Keating L. Wheeler P.R. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Again, we were unable to generate ΔotsB2 clones in M. bovis BCG (M. bovis AF2122/97 was not attempted), but in contrast to M. tuberculosis, we were also unable to generate ΔotsA clones in the M. bovis strains, despite attempts to select for transformants on medium containing 0.5% trehalose. The ΔtreS mutant in M. bovis AF2122/97 (i.e. the ΔtreSΔtreY double mutant) resembled the corresponding M. tuberculosis mutant in having no obvious growth phenotype in vitro. Characterization of Trehalose Biosythesis Mutants in a Mouse Model of Tuberculosis—M. tuberculosis mutants representative of each of the three trehalose biosynthesis pathways (ΔotsA, ΔtreY, and ΔtreS) were tested for their ability to cause progressive disease in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were infected by intravenous inoculation of 106 bacteria, and the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) 1The abbreviation used is: CFU, colony-forming unit. was measured in the lungs and spleens from animals sacrificed 10, 35, and 56 days after infection (Fig. 1). The bacterial load in animals receiving the ΔotsA mutant was lower at all time points compared with controls in both lungs and spleens (p < 0.01 at days 35 and 56). Animals receiving the ΔtreS and ΔtreY mutants developed similar bacterial loads to the wild-type control, except at the late stage of infection (day 56) when the ΔtreS mutant showed a small but significant reduction in CFUs in the lungs (p = 0.05). The same pattern for all mutants was observed in a second independent experiment. Mutant phenotypes were further analyzed by monitoring the time to death for animals in the different groups (Fig. 2). Again the ΔotsA mutant had a marked phenotype, with >70% of the animals surviving longer than 300 days compared with the animals infected with the wild-type strain, which had all died by day 168 (mean survival time of 132 ± 14 days). The ΔtreS mutant showed a significant attenuation in comparison to wild type, with a mean survival time of 235 ± 23 days. The ΔtreY mutant showed no significant difference from the wild-type control. These results showed that the growth defect associated with the ΔotsA mutation observed during in vitro culture is also evident during murine infection and uncovered a further in vivo phenotype for the ΔtreS mutation during long term infection in the mouse. Purification and Characterization of Trehalose Biosynthesis Enzymes—To further characterize trehalose biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis and to explore options for drug targeting, genes encoding OtsB2 and TreS were cloned into pET15b, and soluble protein products with an N-terminal hexahistidine peptide tag were obtained. The corresponding protein products were purified by immobilized metal ion (Ni2+) affinity chromatography. The trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase encoded by the otsB2 gene was analyzed in a 96-well plate format suitable for high throughput screening. The purified enzyme was incubated with a range of sugar-phosphates to determine its substrate specificity; no release of phosphate was detected from any substrate other than trehalose-6-phosphate (Table II). Co-factor requirements were established by the addition of cations and EDTA to the incubation reaction with trehalose-6-phosphate as substrate (Table III). The preferred cation was found to be Mg2+; the reaction was inhibited by Ca2+ or by chelation of cations in the presence of EDTA. The Km was determined to be 0.6 mm (Fig. 3).Table IISpecificity of M. tuberculosis trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (OtsB2)SubstrateA6305 min10 minTrehalose-6P1.271.62Fructose-6P0.060.09Galactose-6P0.040.05Glucose-6P0.030.03Mannose-6P0.010.01Maltose-6P0.000.00Sucrose-6P0.000.00 Open table in a new tab Table IIIAssessment of co-factor requirements for trehalose-6-phosphate phosphataseCo-factorMg2+NoneCa2+Co2+Fe2+Mn2+Mg2+/Ca2+Mg2+/EDTA% Activity100.026.00.030.065.026.071.63.8 Open table in a new tab We observed previously (7De Smet K.A.

To extend and confirm that the trehalose synthase activity resides solely in the TreS protein product, we attempted to assay our recombinant TreS using one-dimensional 1H NMR to collect spectra that monitored the intensity of the α anomeric proton resonances of the substrate and product carbohydrates (Fig. 4). The NMR assay has the advantage over the biochemical assay in that the progress of the reaction can be monitored in real time, and from the identification of the anomeric proton chemical shifts, we obtain simultaneous and unambiguous identification of all the reaction components (reactants and products).

https://openalex.org/W2023721865,"ClpP is a conserved serine-protease with two heptameric rings that enclose a large chamber containing the protease active sites. Each ClpP subunit can be divided into a handle region, which mediates ring-ring interactions, and a head domain. ClpP associates with the hexameric ATPases ClpX and ClpA, which can unfold and translocate substrate proteins through the ClpP axial pores into the protease lumen for degradation. We have determined the x-ray structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae ClpP(A153P) at 2.5 A resolution. The structure revealed two novel features of ClpP which are essential for ClpXP and ClpAP functional activities. First, the Ala → Pro mutation disrupts the handle region, resulting in an altered ring-ring dimerization interface, which, in conjunction with biochemical data, demonstrates the unusual plasticity of this region. Second, the structure shows the existence of a flexible N-terminal loop in each ClpP subunit. The loops line the axial pores in the ClpP tetradecamer and then protrude from the protease apical surface. The sequence of the N-terminal loop is highly conserved in ClpP across all kingdoms of life. These loops are essential determinants for complex formation between ClpP and ClpX/ClpA. Mutation of several amino acid residues in this loop or the truncation of the loop impairs ClpXP and ClpAP complex formation and prevents the coupling between ClpX/ClpA and ClpP activities."

https://openalex.org/W2050620674,"Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an anionic phosphorylated glycoprotein that is expressed almost exclusively in mineralized tissues and has been shown to be a potent nucleator of hydroxyapatite formation. The binding of BSP to collagen is thought to be important for the initiation of bone mineralization and in the adhesion of bone cells to the mineralized matrix. Using a solid phase assay, we have investigated the interaction between BSP and collagen. Initial studies showed that raising the ionic strength, decreasing the pH below 7, or introducing divalent cations diminishes but does not abolish the binding of BSP to collagen, indicating that the interaction is only partly electrostatic in nature. Both bone-extracted and recombinant (r)BSP exhibited similar binding affinities, indicating that post-translational modifications are not critical for binding. To identify the collagen-binding domain, recombinant peptides of BSP were studied. Peptide rBSP-(1–100) binds to type I collagen with an affinity similar to that of full-length rBSP, whereas peptides containing the sequences 99–201 or 200–301 do not bind. Further studies showed that rBSP-(1–75) competitively inhibits the binding of rBSP-(1–100), whereas rBSP-(21–100) inhibits binding to a lesser extent, and rBSP-(43–100) does not inhibit binding. These results suggest that the collagen-binding site of rat BSP is within the sequence 21–42, with residues N-terminal of this region likely also involved. This site was confirmed by the demonstration of collagen-binding activity of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 19–46. The collagen-binding domain, which is highly conserved among species, is enriched in hydrophobic residues and lacks acidic residues. We conclude that residues 19–46 of BSP represent a novel collagen-binding site. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an anionic phosphorylated glycoprotein that is expressed almost exclusively in mineralized tissues and has been shown to be a potent nucleator of hydroxyapatite formation. The binding of BSP to collagen is thought to be important for the initiation of bone mineralization and in the adhesion of bone cells to the mineralized matrix. Using a solid phase assay, we have investigated the interaction between BSP and collagen. Initial studies showed that raising the ionic strength, decreasing the pH below 7, or introducing divalent cations diminishes but does not abolish the binding of BSP to collagen, indicating that the interaction is only partly electrostatic in nature. Both bone-extracted and recombinant (r)BSP exhibited similar binding affinities, indicating that post-translational modifications are not critical for binding.

Bone sialoprotein (BSP) 1The abbreviations used are: BSP, bone sialoprotein; rBSP, recombinant BSP; TBS, tris-buffered saline; CD, circular dichroism. 1The abbreviations used are: BSP, bone sialoprotein; rBSP, recombinant BSP; TBS, tris-buffered saline; CD, circular dichroism. is a highly anionic phosphoprotein normally expressed only in mineralized tissues and at sites of new mineral formation (1.Chen J.

Studies by nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism (CD), and small angle x-ray scattering have concluded that BSP has a flexible conformation with very little, if any, secondary structure (3.Fisher L.W.

BSP has been shown to be involved in cell attachment, cell signaling, hydroxyapatite binding, hydroxyapatite nucleation, and collagen binding (7.Ganss B. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the unstructured, flexible nature of BSP is required for its function as a bridging molecule with multiple binding partners (3.Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). An understanding of the interaction between BSP and collagen is important, as the matrix-mineral relationship in bone is characterized by the presence of hydroxyapatite crystals in the hole zones of the collagen fibrils and by their preferential orientation parallel to the fibril axes (8.Fratzl P. Fratzl-Zelman N. Klaushofer K. Vogl G. Koller K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 48: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 9.Fratzl P. Schreiber S. Klaushofer K. Connect.

To account for this pattern of initial mineral deposition, it is believed that BSP, which has been shown to be a potent nucleator of hydroxyapatite in vitro (5.Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J.

Bone (NY). 2000; 27: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), is closely associated with type I collagen fibrils. An interaction between BSP and collagen type I has been described previously. BSP, but not osteopontin or osteonectin, is associated with the demineralized and guanidine-extracted collagenous matrix of bone (13.Kasugai S. Nagata T. Sodek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14.Gerstenfeld L.C. Feng M. Gotoh Y. Glimcher M.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), implying a close relationship between BSP and collagen. It has been shown that BSP interacts with reconstituted fibrillar collagen (15.Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Fujisawa R. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and delays collagen fibrillogenesis in a manner similar to that of decorin (16.Fujisawa R. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that BSP localizes to the “hole” region of type I collagen fibrils (17.Fujisawa R. Nodasaka Y. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a site associated with early mineral deposition (8.Fratzl P. Fratzl-Zelman N. Klaushofer K. Vogl G. Koller K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 48: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the BSP-collagen interaction is not known. It has previously been postulated that binding may be because of an electrostatic interaction with the positively charged collagen, as was originally suggested for the phosphophoryn-collagen interaction (18.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies by Fujisawa and Kuboki (16.Fujisawa R. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have indicated that BSP binds to gelatin (heat-denatured collagen) as well as to fibrillar collagen. This suggests that binding is not dependent on a triple helical or fibrillar collagen structure and is consistent with a generalized electrostatic interaction. Studies by Zhu et al. (19.Zhu X.L. Ganss B. Goldberg H.A. Sodek J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have indicated that BSP isoforms enriched either in phosphate or sulfate have differing affinities for collagen and mineral crystals. Thus, post-translational modifications of BSP may be relevant in binding to collagen. Many proteins have been found to bind collagens, and the mechanisms of interaction vary greatly. For example, the von Willebrand factor A3 domain has a rather hydrophobic type III collagen-binding site (20.Romijn R.A. Westein E. Bouma B. Schiphorst M.E. Sixma J.J. Lenting P.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15035-15039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), decorin has multiple binding sites with lysine residues essential for binding (21.Tenni R. Viola M. Welser F. Sini P. Giudici C. Rossi A. Tira M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), phosphophoryn binds two or more collagen molecules by an electrostatic mechanism (22.Dahl T. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 203-213Google Scholar), osteonectin binds collagen in a calcium-dependent manner (23.Maurer P. Gohring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. Nischt R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with polar and non-polar residues contributing to electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, respectively (24.Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Gohring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and two acidic clusters in dentin matrix protein 1 drive binding to collagen (25.He G. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11649-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This variability in the collagen-binding sites of extracellular matrix proteins makes it extremely difficult to predict a collagen-interaction domain by sequence alone. In this study, we have used recombinant and synthetic peptides to identify a hydrophobic sequence close to the N terminus as the collagen-binding domain of BSP. Materials—Rat tail tendon type I collagen was prepared as described previously (26.Hunter G.K. Poitras M.S. Underhill T.M. Grynpas M.D. Goldberg H.A. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2001; 55: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). BSP was purified from the long bones of adult rats (27.Goldberg H.A. Sodek J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 211-215Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang Q. Domenicucci C. Goldberg H.A. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7583-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and biotinylated with EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Rat recombinant BSP (rBSP) and rBSP-(43–101) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (5.Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J. Gordon J.A.R. Sodek J. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). rBSP-pE1,2D and rBSP-pE1,2A are mutants of rBSP in which the two contiguous poly(Glu) sequences of rBSP are mutated to aspartic acid and alanine residues, respectively (5.Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J. Gordon J.A.R. Sodek J. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of rBSP Peptides—Partial-length BSP polypeptides incorporating amino acids 1–75, 1–100, 21–100, 99–201, or 200–301 were prepared as follows. Novel restriction sites were introduced into rat BSP cDNA by overlap extension PCR (29.Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar), and a His6-tag added to the 3′-end of the cDNA. Our studies have shown that the poly-His tag does not interact with collagen. 2C. E. Tye, G. K. Hunter, and H. A. Goldberg, unpublished observation. The resulting peptides were subcloned into the pET28a expression vector (Novagen). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The rBSP peptides were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells and were purified by nickel-affinity, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography following established protocols (5.Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J. Gordon J.A.R. Sodek J. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed for purity and protein content by SDS-PAGE and amino acid analysis. Synthetic Peptides—Peptides corresponding to residues 19–32 (NGVFKYRPRYFLYK), 33–46 (HAYFYPPLKRFPVQ), or 19–46 (NGVFKYRPRYFLYKHAYFYPPLKRFPVQ) of rat BSP were synthesized and purified as described previously (30.Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar, 31.Pampena D.A. Robertson K.A. Livinova O. Lajoie G. Goldberg H.A. Hunter G.K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and included an N-terminal biotin label. Peptides were purified by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography to >95% purity, and their identities were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Micromass Quattro II). Solid Phase Collagen-binding Assay—The binding of proteins and peptides to type I collagen was studied by a modification of the method of Calderwood et al. (32.Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Type I collagen (1 μg/100 μl) in phosphate-buffered saline was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 96-well Maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc). Wells were blocked with 1% myoglobin for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated with His6-tagged protein or peptide for 3 h at room temperature. The wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1/2000 Penta·His antibody (Qiagen) and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 45 min with 1/4000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The bound proteins were then detected using 0.4 mg/ml ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma) in phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5 (200 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm citric acid), and 0.012% H2O2. The reaction was stopped after 6 min by the addition of 2.5 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm. Duplicate experiments were performed with each concentration in triplicate, and data were fitted to a one-site binding model using GraphPad Prism™. To detect the binding of biotinylated synthetic peptides and bone-extracted BSP to type I collagen, the bound protein was incubated with 10 μg/ml ExtrAvidin peroxidase (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, wells were washed, and bound biotinylated protein was determined using 0.4 mg/ml ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as above. Competition of rBSP Binding to Type I Collagen—As a measure of specificity of binding, the ability of unlabeled proteins to compete with biotinylated protein was assessed. rBSP and rBSP-(1–100) were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-biotin following the manufacturer's protocol. Solutions of labeled rBSP or rBSP-(1–100) including various concentrations of unlabeled protein were incubated with collagen for 3 h as above. Following the collagen incubation, the wells were incubated with 10 μg/ml ExtrAvidin peroxidase in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. The bound protein was then detected as above with ortho-phenylenediamine in phosphate-citrate buffer. The A492 of biotinylated rBSP in the absence of competitor was set to 100%, and the percentage of biotinylated rBSP bound with increasing competitor was plotted. The competition assays included 10 nm biotinylated rBSP incubated with 0–1000 nm of unlabeled rBSP-pE1,2D, rBSP-pE1,2A, 25 nm biotinylated rBSP incubated with 0–1000 nm of unlabeled rBSP-(1–100), rBSP-(99–201), or rBSP-(200–301), 50 nm biotinylated rBSP-(1–100) incubated with 0–1000 nm of unlabeled rBSP-(1–100), rBSP-(1–75), rBSP-(21–100), or rBSP-(43–101), and 50 nm rBSP-(1–100) incubated with 0–1000 nm of synthetic peptides 19–32, 33–46, and 19–46. Characterization of the Interaction Between Type I Collagen and BSP—The above assay was modified to examine the role of electrostatic interactions in the binding of rBSP and rBSP-(1–100) to collagen. The effect of varied pH on binding was examined using 0.1 m phosphate, adjusted to pH 2.5–8.0, as the buffer during the protein incubation and in all washes. Similarly, the effect of ionic strength was investigated by using 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0–1000 mm NaCl. The effect of divalent or trivalent cations on collagen binding was examined using increasing concentrations of CaCl2, MnCl2, or LaCl3 in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, during protein binding. The A492 of 50 nm rBSP or rBSP-(1–100) in the absence of NaCl or cation at pH 7.0 was set to 100%, and the percentage of protein bound with increasing ionic strength, decreasing pH, or increasing cation concentration was plotted. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The effect of pH and ionic strength on the conformation of rBSP-(1–75) was studied by CD spectroscopy. The far-UV spectra of rBSP-(1–75) was recorded in quartz cells of 1-mm optical path length using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter between 190 and 260 nm, in 0.5-nm steps. The protein was studied at 0.2 mg/ml in buffers containing 0.1 m phosphate with pH 2.5–8.0 or 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, with 0–1000 mm NaCl, as used above. A base line with buffer only was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. All spectra were recorded at room temperature. The molar ellipticity (θ) expressed in degrees cm2 dmol–1 was calculated on the basis of mean residue molecular mass. Estimates of protein secondary structure from the CD data were made using the Circular Dichroism Deconvolution by Backpropagation Neural Networks (CDNN) program (33.Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) as well as a calculation from [Φ]220 nm. Role of Post-translational Modifications in Collagen Binding—Bone-extracted and recombinant BSP were tested for collagen-binding activity to examine the contributions of the numerous post-translational modifications of BSP to collagen binding. Both the bone-extracted and rBSP demonstrate saturable binding to type I collagen (Fig. 1) and based on a one-site binding model have similar affinities for collagen. Bone-extracted BSP has a KD = 12.14 ± 1.10 nm, and rBSP has a KD = 14.24 ± 1.27 nm. Role of the Poly(Glu) Domains in Collagen Binding—rBSP, rBSP-pE1,2D and rBSP-pE1,2A were tested for collagen-binding activity to examine the contributions of the contiguous glutamic acid residues to collagen binding. rBSP, rBSP-pE1,2A, and rBSP-pE1,2D demonstrate saturable binding to type I collagen (Fig. 2A). Based on a one-site binding model, rBSP has a KD = 22.85 ± 3.9 nm, rBSP-pE1,2D has a KD = 15.25 ± 2.0 nm, and rBSP-pE1,2A has a KD = 4.82 ± 0.76 nm. Confirmation of the specificity of these mutated proteins for collagen is evident by the ability of these mutant proteins to compete with labeled rBSP for binding to collagen (Fig. 2B). Localization of the Collagen-binding Domain on rBSP—To locate the collagen-binding domain of rBSP, several peptides were expressed and tested for collagen-binding activity. Both rBSP-(99–201) and rBSP-(200–301) show negligible binding to collagen (Fig. 3A), which is confirmed by the inability of either peptide to compete with the binding of rBSP to collagen (Fig. 3B). rBSP-(1–100), however, bound to collagen with a KD = 5.64 ± 0.59 nm, which is an increased affinity compared with the full-length protein (KD = 22.85 ± 3.9 nm). This strong affinity for collagen is evident by the ability of rBSP-(1–100) to compete with rBSP for binding (Fig. 3B). rBSP-(1–75) shows binding comparable with rBSP-(1–100) with a KD = 4.04 ± 0.59 nm; however, the binding of rBSP-(21–100) was somewhat lower, with KD = 50.26 ± 9.46 nm (Fig. 3C). The specificity of these two peptides was demonstrated by their ability to compete for binding with rBSP-(1–100), as shown in Fig. 3D. rBSP-(43–101) was not tested for binding activity; however, it was not able to compete for binding with rBSP-(1–100), which indicates that the binding domain is not within residues 43–101 (Fig. 3D). Synthetic peptides incorporating residues 19–32, 33–46, and 19–46 were tested for binding activity. Only the longer 19–46 peptide was able to bind to collagen, with a KD = 149.9 ± 10.4 nm (Fig. 4A), and inhibit binding of rBSP-(1–100) (Fig. 4B). The two smaller peptides, 19–32 and 33–46, showed little binding to collagen and were unable to inhibit the binding of rBSP-(1–100) (Fig. 4). Electrostatic Interactions in the Binding of rBSP to Type I Collagen—No difference in rBSP binding was observed when using Tris or phosphate buffers at physiological pH (data not shown). The binding of rBSP to collagen was reduced by increasing the ionic strength of the buffer (Fig. 5A). Similarly, binding decreased at pH values lower than 7 (Fig. 5B). Increasing concentrations of CaCl2, MnCl2, or LaCl3 caused binding to decrease until physiological strengths were reached, and then binding stayed constant (Fig. 5C). These studies indicate that there is an electrostatic component to the binding of BSP to collagen. However, 25–45% of the protein still remained bound at high salt or low pH, implying that binding is not entirely electrostatic. Effect of Varying pH and Ionic Strength on Conformation of rBSP-(1–75)—The CD spectrum of rBSP-(1–75) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and at physiological ionic strength is shown in Fig. 6. The CD spectrum of this peptide in 25 mm Tris is very similar (data not shown). Secondary structure estimates by the CDNN program estimates that rBSP-(1–75) at pH 7.0 exhibits 5.9% α-helix, 36.4% anti-parallel β-sheet, 3.2% parallel β-sheet, 20.2% β-turn, and 34.1% unordered structure. Increasing concentrations of NaCl do not alter these conformations as the spectra are identical (data not shown). Decreasing the pH of the buffer, however, does alter the conformation of the peptide slightly and a shift of the minima to the right is seen (Fig. 6). This right shift is indicative of an increase in α-helical content. The α-helical content of rBSP-(1–75) is 6.2% at pH 4, 6.9% at pH 3.5, and 7.5% at pH 2.5. The other secondary structure elements are unchanged. A calculation of secondary structure from [Φ]220 nm gives different percentages; however, it shows the same trend of increasing α-helical content. By this method, the α-helical content is 1.9% at pH 7.0 and begins to increase to 2.3% at pH 4.5, 3.0% at pH 4.0, 5.6% at pH 3.5, and 6.2% at pH 2.5. Binding of BSP to collagen has been proposed to involve either nonspecific electrostatic interactions (16.Fujisawa R. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or specific interactions (34.Veis A. Sabsay B. Dahl T. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont2000Google Scholar). It was suggested that the negatively charged post-translational modifications of phosphoproteins may bind electrostatically to the slightly positively charged surface of collagen (18.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, however, we have demonstrated that both the bone-extracted BSP and the prokaryotically expressed protein are able to interact with type I collagen, and both show comparable affinities and binding capacities for collagen. This suggests that it is not simply a nonspecific interaction between the numerous post-translational modifications of BSP and collagen and that a more specific interaction between the residues of BSP and collagen is involved. BSP is also enriched in glutamic acid residues, notably two poly(Glu) regions, which may interact with the positively charged collagen. However, synthetic homopolymers of poly-(Glu) do not bind to collagen (data not shown) suggesting that the poly(Glu) sequences of BSP may have only a minor role in binding to collagen. Although the poly(Glu) sequences of BSP may not be directly responsible for binding activity, there is the possibility that electrostatic interactions, and therefore these sequences, are involved in the stabilization of binding of BSP to collagen. Electrostatic interactions have been found to be involved in protein-protein interactions in two ways. Nonspecific, long range electrostatic forces can lead to the formation of a low affinity complex, prior to the formation of short range interactions that give the final high affinity complex. If favorable electrostatic interactions exist between the two proteins, a higher reaction rate is achieved (35.Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that electrostatic interactions can confer specificity on protein-protein interactions without being energetically favorable. Essentially, the energy of electrostatic interactions between charged residues at the binding surface will equal the energetically unfavorable desolvation. The net result is that the electrostatic interactions increase the specificity of binding without affecting the affinity (36.Davis S.J. Davies E.A. Tucknott M.G. Jones E.Y. van der Merwe P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37.Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). The involvement of the poly(Glu) sequences within BSP in binding to collagen was studied by testing rBSP-pE1,2D and rBSP-pE1,2A (mutated proteins that have the poly(Glu) sequences mutated to poly(Asp) and poly(Ala), respectively). Both proteins showed saturable binding to collagen and had a slightly higher affinity for collagen than wild-type protein. The increase in affinity seen with rBSP-pE1,2A implies that the poly(Glu) regions are likely not involved in collagen binding and may be decreasing the affinity of rBSP for collagen. It is more likely, however, that a mutation of the poly(Glu) domains to poly(Ala) increases the collagen-binding affinity by increasing the hydrophobicity of the protein. It is also possible that a conformational change in the protein allowed for the higher affinity. rBSP is an unordered, flexible protein (3.Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S.

In this instance, the mutation of the poly(Glu) sequences to poly(Ala) may have induced the protein to fold into a more ordered conformation that was favorable to collagen binding, thereby increasing the rate of association, ka, and accordingly the KD, of the two proteins. Our previous work has shown that mutation of the poly(Glu) domains to poly(Ala) does cause a conformational change in the protein, as indicated by CD studies; however; the exact changes in secondary structure have not been elucidated (5.Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J. Gordon J.A.R. Sodek J. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). rBSP-pE1,2D is thought to be structurally similar to rBSP as indicated by these same CD studies, and there may be some small, localized changes in conformation that were not detected by CD, and these may have caused the slightly higher affinity seen with the rBSP-pE1,2D mutant. To locate the collagen-binding domain within the rBSP sequence, three peptides, each encompassing a third of the protein, were tested for collagen-binding activity. rBSP-(1–100) bound to collagen with high affinity and competitively inhibited the binding of rBSP, indicating the high specificity of the peptide. rBSP-(99–200) and rBSP-(200–301), however, demonstrated no affinity for collagen, and this was confirmed by their inability to competitively inhibit the binding of rBSP to collagen. The lack of binding by the poly(Glu)-containing rBSP-(99–200) shows once again that the poly(Glu) regions are not responsible for binding. Two smaller N-terminal peptides were tested for collagen-binding activity, and it was found that rBSP-(1–75) bound to collagen with similar affinity to the rBSP-(1–100) peptide, indicating that the binding domain is within the N-terminal 75 residues of BSP. The rBSP-(21–100) peptide demonstrated saturable binding to collagen but with a lower affinity than rBSP-(1–100). This suggests that the first 21 residues of BSP are somewhat involved in collagen binding but are not entirely necessary to achieve binding. The specificities of the rBSP-(1–75) and rBSP-(21–100) peptides was confirmed by their abilities to competitively inhibit the binding of rBSP-(1–100) to collagen. A final peptide, rBSP-(43–101), was not able to inhibit binding of rBSP-(1–100), giving further insight into the location of the collagen-binding domain. It appears that the collagen-binding domain is located within residues 21–42. However, residues outwith this region may be involved in long range electrostatic interactions. The synthetic peptide encompassing residues 19–46 was found to bind collagen with relatively high affinity and could inhibit the binding of rBSP-(1–100), which indicates that these residues do indeed contain the collagen-binding domain of BSP. Neither peptide 19–32 nor peptide 33–46 was found to bind collagen, which suggests that amino acids in the overlapping sequence of these peptides are required for binding. The lower affinity of the 19–46 peptide compared with rBSP-(1–100) also suggests that residues outwith this region may be involved in long range electrostatic interactions. Varying ionic strength has often been conveniently used to test for the presence of electrostatic interactions (38.Zhou H.X. Biopolymers. 2001; 59: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39.Schreiber G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The bond energy of a salt bridge will depend on the extent of protonation of both groups involved. Thus, a general treatment of electrostatic contributions must effectively describe the pH dependence of electrostatic interactions (40.Xiao L. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Therefore, the involvement of electrostatic interactions in the binding of rBSP and rBSP-(1–100) to collagen was examined by increasing the ionic strength or decreasing the pH of the buffer used during binding. Both of these changes caused a considerable decrease in binding to collagen; however; higher than physiological concentrations of salt did not have a significant effect on binding. Although altering the pH of the buffer does cause an increase in α-helical content of the rBSP-(1–75) peptide, it does not seem that conformational changes are solely responsible for the decrease in binding, as no change in conformation is seen with increasing ionic strength. The observed decreases in binding therefore indicate an electrostatic interaction between BSP and collagen. Interestingly, binding to collagen was never completely abolished, even at very low pH or very high salt, so it would appear that electrostatics are only a component of the binding mechanism. The binding of BSP to collagen is calcium-independent. In fact, addition of calcium, as well as manganese and lanthanum, was found to decrease the amount of protein bound to collagen. In vivo, binding of BSP to collagen will occur in a calcium-rich environment. However, the binding to collagen was not completely abolished by calcium even at the highest concentration studied. Once again, an electrostatic mechanism of binding is evident, as the cations are likely binding weakly to the negatively charged surface of BSP and interfering with the electrostatic interactions involved in collagen binding. Our results indicate that electrostatic interactions are involved in the binding of BSP to collagen, potentially through long range electrostatic interactions that stabilize the formation of an initial low affinity complex prior to the formation of more specific, short range interactions. What these short range interactions are remains unclear. In general, protein-protein interfaces usually have a higher proportion of charged and polar residues (41.Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and these heterocomplexes are dominated by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions where salt bridges are common (42.Ofran Y. Rost B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions are more frequent in the interior of the monomers and in permanent interactions than in the interior of the transient protein-protein interfaces (41.Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 42.Ofran Y. Rost B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The residues involved in the non-electrostatic interactions in BSP are apparently located within residues 19–46, with residues on either side of this region likely involved in electrostatic interactions. There are five positively charged and four negatively charged residues within the first 19 residues of BSP, as well as numerous negatively charged residues downstream of residue 46, which may be involved in these long range electrostatic interactions. Residues 19–46 (rat, NGVFKYRPRYFLYKHAYFYPPLKRFPVQ) are in a region that is very highly conserved. Between the rat, mouse, pig, cow, and human sequences 20 residues are identical, 4 are highly conserved, 2 are conserved, and 1 is non-conserved. Uncharacteristic of the rest of the sequence of BSP is the lack of negatively charged residues within this region. There are positively charged Lys, Arg, and His residues, however, as well as an enrichment of Pro, Tyr, and Phe residues. The conservation of Phe residues has been found to imply a binding site, and binding sites are often enriched in both Tyr and Arg (43.Ma B. Elkayam T. Wolfson H. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5772-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 44.Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that binding of BSP to type I collagen involves long range electrostatic interactions that aid in the formation of an initial low affinity complex, prior to the formation of a high affinity complex characterized by specific short range interactions. It appears that the specific residues involved in collagen binding are located within residues 19–46, with charged residues both upstream and downstream of this region likely contributing electrostatically to binding. Future studies will aim to identify specific residues within both the BSP and collagen sequences that are involved in binding. Of note, our recent unpublished data show that rBSP is a more potent nucleator of hydroxyapatite in the presence of collagen than in its absence. Therefore, we believe that the characterization of the BSP-collagen interaction and the identification of the collagen-binding domain on BSP is of profound significance to understanding mineral formation.

https://openalex.org/W2019894008,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cardiac hypertrophy. We have recently shown that the serotonin-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) is an important source of hydrogen peroxide in rat heart. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of hydrogen peroxide generated by MAO A in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by serotonin. Serotonin (5 microM, 48 h) induced hypertrophy in cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes, as reflected by increased 3H-leucine incorporation (+43%, P<0.001) and total protein content (+22%, P<0.001). Serotonin also increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide and oxidative stress production, measured respectively by DCF fluorescence intensity and GSH/GSSG ratio, and promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation (P<0.001). Serotonin effects were only partially inhibited by the 5-HT2B receptor antagonist SB 206553. In contrast, they were extensively (>80%) prevented by the amine uptake inhibitor imipramine, the MAO inhibitor pargyline and the MEK inhibitor PD 98059. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and ERK activation were also inhibited by decreasing intracellular ROS by adenoviral overexpression of catalase or cardiomyocytes treatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine. These data suggest that part of cardiac hypertrophic effect of serotonin requires hydrogen peroxide production by MAO A and ERK1/2 activation. This newly recognized, receptor-independent mechanism of serotonin may contribute to myocardial remodeling and failure."

It is therefore necessary to understand the control and consequential regulatory activity of the Runx2 gene within the context of chondrogenic differentiation of a mesenchymal progenitor cell. We identify the homeodomain protein Nkx3.2 as a potent sequence-specific repressor of the Runx2 promoter that acts through a regulatory element 0.1 kb upstream from the site of transcriptional initiation. The biological significance of this repression is established by utilizing bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2)-induced chondrogenic differentiation of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells as a model for the initial events of mesenchymal chondrogenesis. We demonstrate that induction of the chondrogenic phenotype and endogenous Nkx3.2 expression is accompanied by a repression of Runx2 gene activity. Bypassing Runx2 repression by adenoviral-mediated introduction of Runx2 into C3H10T1/2 cells can prevent the induction of chondrogenesis, but cannot reverse the chondrogenic phenotype once it has been initiated, as evidenced by Sox9 and type II collagen expression and extracellular matrix deposition. Our results demonstrate that Runx2 is a direct transcriptional target of Nkx3.2, and that repression of Runx2 at the onset of chondrogenesis is a prerequisite for the activation of a chondrocyte-specific program of gene expression. We postulate that Runx2 is a critical link in BMP-2-mediated initiation of mesenchymal chondrogenesis that results in activation of Sox9 at least in part through the Nkx3.2-dependent repression of Runx2.

During mammalian embryogenesis, the axial skeleton is initially formed as a cartilaginous template prior to conversion into mineralized bone through the coordinated actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

The sequential and cooperative action of these molecules results in the induction of the pro-chondrogenic NK-related homeodomain protein Nkx3.2 in mesenchymal progenitor cells. Nkx3.2 mediates transcriptional repression of target genes through its interactions with BMP-responsive SMAD proteins and histone deacetylase HDAC1 (5Kim D.W. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell.

Activation of Nkx3.2 is required for and closely followed by activation of the master chondrogenic transcriptional regulator Sox9. The activation of Sox9 through Nkx3.2 ultimately leads to activation of chondrocyte phenotypic genes, including type II collagen and aggrecan, and formation of a cartilaginous extracellular matrix (1Murtaugh L.C.

The observation that the Runx2 gene is active in progenitor cells that are destined to undergo chondrogenesis rather than osteogenesis necessitates determining whether Runx2 plays a role in BMP-2-induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells in addition to the well characterized function of Runx2 in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast precursors later during skeletogenesis. In this study, we identify the Runx2 gene as a target of Nkx3.2-mediated transcriptional repression and demonstrate that Runx2 is a critical link in the BMP-2 induced pathway of chondrogenesis. We show that Nkx3.2 represses Runx2 activity through an interaction with a regulatory element in the Runx2 promoter. Furthermore, our results suggest that at the onset of BMP-2-induced chondrogenesis of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal progenitor cells, an increase in Nkx3.2 activity suppresses Runx2 gene expression. We demonstrate that bypassing the observed suppression of Runx2 at the onset of chondrogenesis inhibits chondrocytic differentiation. Our findings establish that Runx2 is a critical modulator of the commitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells to the chondrogenic lineage. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—C3H10T1/2 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, GA). MC3T3 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. ROS17/2.8 cells were maintained in F-12 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed in 6-well plates at 70% confluence using 5 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and 4 μg of total DNA per well in accordance with the manufacturers protocol. For Nkx3.2 expression, 100 ng of an Nkx3.2 expression vector in a PCS2 plasmid backbone (a kind gift from Dr. Andrew Lassar, Harvard Medical School) was transfected into each well unless otherwise noted. As a control, 100 ng of PCS2 expression vector (empty vector) was transfected into each well. For Sox9 expression, 100 ng of a Sox9 expression construct was introduced into each well of a 6-well plate. Shh (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and BMP-2 (a kind gift from Dr. John Wozney, Wyeth Ayerst, Cambridge, MA) were added exogenously at concentrations of 200 and 100 ng/ml, respectively. To observe repression of endogenous Runx2 protein in the presence of Nkx3.2, C3H10T1/2 cells were co-transfected with either Nkx3.2 and cytomegalovirus-driven enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) or empty vector (PCS2) and EGFP. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and FACS sorted to collect cells positive for EGFP fluorescence. EGFP positive cells were replated and harvested 12 h later for Western analysis. To monitor transfection efficiency, transfections included 0.5 μg of a cytomegalovirus-driven LacZ expression vector per well. For Runx2 promoter-reporter assays, transfections included 2 μg of either a Runx2 0.6-kb promoter-luciferase construct, or an empty PGL3 luciferase construct. All results were normalized to activity of the PGL3 empty vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells transfected with Runx2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs were harvested 36–48 h after transfection and each well was lysed at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 0.5 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activity was quantitated in a luminometer using a 12-s read time immediately after addition of 20 μl of cell lysate to 100 μl of substrate (Promega Luciferase Assay System). With the exception of Fig. 1A, all results were normalized to the luciferase activity resulting from transfection of the promoterless PGL3 luciferase construct (Promega). Chondrogenic Induction and Adenoviral Infection of C3H10T1/2 Cells—Induction of chondrogenesis was carried out by plating C3H10T1/2 cells (between passages 19 and 25) in high-density micromass cultures (105 cells in a 10-μl drop of media) (23Ahrens P.B.

Following adhesion, micromass cultures were fed with F-12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml recombinant hBMP-2 (kindly provided by Dr. John Wozney, Wyeth-Ayerst, MA). For adenoviral transduction experiments, C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with viruses containing either the Runx2 cDNA or the β-galactosidase cDNA as a control at a multiplicity of infection of 100. To introduce adenovirally expressed proteins prior to chondrogenic induction, C3H10T1/2 cells were infected while proliferating in a monolayer at ∼80% confluence. At 12 h after infection, cells were trypsinized and plated in high-density micromass cultures for chondrogenic differentiation as described above. Cultures were harvested 24 h after induction of chondrogenesis for analysis of gene expression. To deliver adenovirally expressed proteins after induction of chondrogenesis, C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in high-density cultures, allowed to adhere, then infected with viruses containing either the Runx2 cDNA or the β-galactosidase cDNA. Immediately after infection, cultures were fed with F-12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml recombinant hBMP-2. Cultures were harvested 24 h after the induction of chondrogenesis for analysis of gene expression. RNA Isolation and Analysis—RNA was isolated from cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After purification, 5 μg of total RNA was DNase treated using a DNA-free RNA column purification kit (Zymol Research, Orange, CA). RNA (1 μg) was then reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript 1st Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (Sox9, Nkx3.2, type II collagen, type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and Runx2). Quantitative PCR was performed using either SYBR Green 2 × master mixture (Eurogentec, Belgium) or Fam-conjugated Taqman probes and Taqman 2× master mixture in the case of Nkx3.2 and Runx2 (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA) and a two-step cycling protocol (anneal and elongate at 60 °C, denature at 94 °C). Specificity of primers was verified by dissociation of amplicons when using SYBR Green as a detector.

In vitro synthesis of recombinant Nkx3.2 was verified by Western blotting against the HA tag present in the PCS2 vector (data not shown). Wild type and mutant oligonucleotides containing the Nkx3.2 consensus site derived from the Runx2 P1 promoter was end labeled by incubating 10 μm of the sense strand of each oligo with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 10 units of polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. Unlabeled antisense oligo (30 μm) was then added to the reaction followed by boiling the mixture for 5 min. The reaction was then gradually allowed to cool to room temperature to allow the annealing of sense and antisense strands to occur. Double stranded oligos were then purified over a Sephadex G-25 column to remove unincorporated nucleotides. DNA binding assays were performed by incubating 10 fmol of double-stranded oligo with 2 μg of nuclear proteins from C3H10T1/2 cells along with or without 0.4 μg of rabbit polyclonal α-HA antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) or a nonspecific antibody, α-cMYC (Santa Cruz), at room temperature for 20 min. Complexes were visualized after separation on a 16% 40:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide gel in the presence of 0.5× TBE buffer followed by autoradiography. Western Blotting—For the detection of Nkx3.2, Runx2, and actin proteins, each well of a 6-well plate was lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 12% urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 25 μm MG132 proteosome inhibitor, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were then quantified using Bradford reagent (Pierce) and taking spectrophotometric readings at 590 nm. Concentrations were estimated against a standard curve generated using bovine serum albumin. Total protein (20 μg) was subjected to electrophoreses in a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% SDS. Proteins were then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Membranes were blocked in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 containing 2% nonfat powdered milk (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected by incubating with antibodies at a concentration of 50 ng/ml in blocking solution. Antibodies used in this study are as follows: Nkx3.2, α-HA epitope mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA); Runx2 mouse monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Drs. Yoshi Ito and Kosei Ito, National University, Singapore; and α-actin goat polyclonal antibody. Primary antibodies were detected with goat α-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Secondary antibodies were detected using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—To cross-link proteins to DNA, C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 1× PBS (3 ml/plate) containing 1% formaldehyde, 25 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem/Sigma), and 1× protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). A final concentration of 0.125 m glycine was added to the 1% formaldehyde, PBS solution for neutralization. Cells were collected in PBS after plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm MG-132, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor. To isolate the nuclei, cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 1,100 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 300 μl (300 μl/100-mm plate) of sonication buffer (50 μm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 μm MG132, 1× Complete protease inhibitor). Samples were sonicated to shear DNA into 0.2–0.6-kb fragments. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the resulting chromatin-containing solutions were distributed into multiple 1-ml aliquots that were used as the starting material of all subsequent steps. Chromatin aliquots were precleared with 100 μl of a 25% (v/v) suspension of 2 μg of single-stranded DNA-coated protein A/G and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Samples were used directly for immunoprecipitation reaction with 2 μgof α-HA epitope or α-Runx2 (M-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody and normal rabbit/mouse IgG as a control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions were allowed to proceed for 2–4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immune complexes were mixed with 100 μl of 25% (v/v) pre-coated protein A/G-agarose suspension followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were collected by brief centrifugation and the immunocomplexes were eluted twice by adding 150 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). After reversal of cross-links at 68 °C overnight, the eluate was treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using 5 μg of glycogen as carrier. An aliquot (2–3 μl) of each sample was assayed using quantitative PCR for the presence of specific DNA fragments using primers in the proximal Runx2 promoter. This region contains both the Nkx3.2 binding motif as well as Runx2 autoregulatory motifs. The primers are: forward, 5′-CTCCAGTAATAGTGCTTGCAAAAAAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCGAATGAAGCATTCACACAA-3′. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using 2 × SYBR Green mixture (Eurogentec, Belgium) and a 2-stage cycling protocol (60 °C annealing and extension, 94 °C denaturation, 40 cycles). Amplicon specificity was verified by analysis of melting temperature. All data were collected during the linear phase of amplification. The Runx2 P1 Promoter Is Highly Active in C3H10T1/2 Cells and Is Suppressed by Nkx3.2—To gain insight into the regulation of the Runx2 gene in a pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cell, we transfected a vector containing 600 base pairs of the Runx2 P1 promoter (26Drissi H.

This promoter (P1-Luc) was transcriptionally active (∼10 times that of a promoterless luciferase construct, PGL3, Fig. 1A) in this cell line, comparable with luciferase activity observed in osteogenic ROS17/2.8 cells that express high levels of Runx2 protein. This observation is consistent with previous findings that the endogenous Runx2 gene is active in mesenchymal progenitor cells during development in vivo (10Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L.

We next examined the effect of various signaling molecules and transcription factors known to be critical for mesenchymal chondrogenesis in vivo on the activity of the Runx2 P1 promoter, including Shh, BMP-2, Nkx3.2, and Sox9. These molecules act sequentially during murine embryogenesis and are critical at different stages for the expansion and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into mature chondrocytes (Fig. 1B). Our results demonstrate that Shh, BMP-2, and Sox9 exhibit little to no effect on the activity of the Runx2 promoter. In contrast, expression of the transcription factor Nkx3.2 in C3H10T1/2 cells resulted in a dramatic, dose-dependent suppression of Runx2 promoter activity (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that the robust activity of Runx2 regulatory regions in mesenchymal progenitor cells is negatively regulated by Nkx3.2, a molecule that acts to promote chondrogenic differentiation of these cells. Nkx3.2 Represses the Runx2 Promoter via Interaction with an Nkx3.2 Consensus Binding Sequence—We examined the possibility that the Nkx3.2-mediated repression of the Runx2 promoter occurred through direct interaction of Nkx3.2 with its consensus-binding site, HRAGTG (H = A, C, or T; R = A or G) (28Kim D.W. Kempf H. Chen R.E. Lassar A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27532-27539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, we identified two consensus binding sites for Nkx3.2 within the Runx2 P1 promoter (at –580 bp and –98 bp from the Runx2 transcription initiation site) (Fig. 2A). To define the contribution of these sites to Nkx3.2-mediated repression of the Runx2 promoter, we co-transfected the Nkx3.2 expression construct into C3H10T1/2 cells along with various deletion constructs of the Runx2 promoter. Fig. 2A demonstrates that the distal Nkx3.2 binding site is dispensable for repression. However, the –108-bp Runx2 promoter construct still exhibits repression in response to Nkx3.2, and removal of this site (–92 bp deletion) results in a loss of repression, as well as an abrogation of basal promoter activity. When the data is examined as -fold repression mediated by Nkx3.2 upon the deletion constructs, it becomes evident that an additional promoter region between –458 and –351 bp may be playing a contributing role (Fig. 2B). Because there is no acceptable Nkx3.2 consensus binding sequence in the –458/–351 region, this effect may occur independently of Nkx3.2. To validate the interaction between Nkx3.2 and its consensus binding site at –98 bp in the Runx2 promoter, EMSAs were performed using a 24-bp oligo containing the Nkx3.2 site (Fig. 3A). This site lies downstream of a purine-rich region of the promoter in a highly conserved area that contains binding sequences for a number of transcriptional regulators including HLH, ATF, vitamin D, as well as Runx2 itself. Nkx3.2 binds to this site in a sequence-specific manner as mutation of this site completely abrogates binding activity (Fig. 3B compare WT to MT). The specificity of this complex was confirmed using supershift analysis of the Nkx3.2 interaction with the wild type oligo. Incubation of the radiolabeled wild type oligo results in the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex only in the presence of Nkx3.2 expression vector (Fig. 3C). The addition of mouse polyclonal α-HA antibody completely supershifts this complex. To further confirm that Nkx3.2 is occupying this site in the native promoter, CHiP assays were performed 24 h after transfection of Nkx3.2 into C3H10T1/2 cells using antibodies against endogenous Runx2 or HA-tagged Nkx3.2. We were able to immunoprecipitate the Runx2 promoter using an α-HA antibody, but not using an α-Runx2 or nonspecific (IgG) antibody, demonstrating that Nkx3.2 is indeed occupying the Runx2 promoter (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the Nkx3.2 transcription factor interacts with a functional consensus binding site in the Runx2 P1 promoter ∼100 bp upstream from the site of initiation of transcription. The Proximal Nkx3.2 Binding Site in the Runx2 Promoter Is Required for Maximal Repressive Effects of Nkx3.2—To determine whether the proximal Nkx3.2 binding site is responsible for mediating the observed repression of the Runx2 promoter in the presence of Nkx3.2, we introduced the mutation used for EMSA into both the –600-bp and –108-bp Runx2 promoter constructs. Mutation of this site in the –600-bp promoter resulted in significant abrogation of the Nkx3.2-mediated repression of the –600-bp Runx2 promoter (Fig. 4A, from 5- to 2-fold). The persistence of repression of the mutated –600-bp promoter in the presence of Nkx3.2 may be due to the Nkx3.2-responsive region between –458 and –351 bp observed in Fig. 2B. To minimize the effects of other potential promoter regions through which Nkx3.2 may act, we introduced the m"

A critical component of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is caspase-9, which is activated by Apaf-1 in the apoptosome, a large complex assembled in response to release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Caspase-9 cleaves and activates effector caspases, predominantly caspase-3, resulting in the demise of the cell. Here we identified a distinct mechanism by which cyclic AMP regulates this apoptotic pathway through activation of protein kinase A. We show that protein kinase A inhibits activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 downstream of cytochrome c in Xenopus egg extracts and in a human cell-free system. Protein kinase A directly phosphorylates human caspase-9 at serines 99, 183, and 195. However, mutational analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation at these sites is not required for the inhibitory effect of protein kinase A on caspase-9 activation. Importantly, protein kinase A inhibits cytochrome c-dependent recruitment of procaspase-9 to Apaf-1 but not activation of caspase-9 by a constitutively activated form of Apaf-1. These data indicate that extracellular signals that elevate cyclic AMP and activate protein kinase A may suppress apoptosis by inhibiting apoptosome formation downstream of cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death that is fundamental for cell selection during development and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is important for the removal of cells damaged by cellular stresses or those that have undergone oncogenic transformation (2Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The apoptotic program involves activation of a group of cysteine proteases termed caspases, which are present in cells as inactive or low activity proenzymes (3Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Initiation of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway by a wide variety of stimuli causes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (4Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds the apoptotic factor Apaf-1 and induces Apaf-1 oligomerization, leading to recruitment and activation of procaspase-9 in a large complex termed the apoptosome (7Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 8Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). As a result, procaspase-9 autoprocesses and cleaves the effector procaspases 3 and 7, which are activated to cleave key structural and regulatory proteins and thereby bring about the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death (3Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways activated by extracellular and intracellular stimuli can impinge on this apoptotic pathway to control cell fate.The cyclic AMP signal transduction pathway regulates a diverse array of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and secretion. Activation of this signaling pathway occurs through specific ligation of G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating formation of cAMP from ATP through the action of adenylate cyclase. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunits of the heterotetrameric cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase A (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. dissociating the holoenzyme and releasing the free catalytic (C) subunits. The active C subunits subsequently phosphorylate target proteins on serine or threonine residues within a relatively well defined consensus sequence (9Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP may act independently of PKA through Epac, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the Rap1 GTPase that is directly activated by cAMP (11de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Recently, it has emerged that one important facet of cAMP signal transduction is to regulate apoptosis. While elevation of cAMP is associated with induction of apoptosis in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids (12Zhang L. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in many cell types elevated cAMP protects against apoptosis (13Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I.

In contrast to the well characterized molecular mechanisms by which cAMP regulates other biological processes, little is known about the mechanism by which this ubiquitous second messenger modulates apoptosis.The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway can be regulated at multiple stages to promote or suppress cell death (22Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3989) Google Scholar). One important point of control is the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This event is regulated by the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (4Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 6Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). In addition, this apoptotic pathway can be regulated downstream of cytochrome c release by caspase inhibitor proteins such as XIAP (23Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). The activity of XIAP may be controlled by release of other factors such as Smac/Diablo from mitochondria (24Shiozaki E.N.

Abnormal or constitutive activation of these signaling pathways may contribute to the survival of cancer cells despite initiation of upstream apoptotic responses. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which signaling pathways regulate caspase activation downstream of cytochrome c remain to be fully characterized.Cell-free systems that faithfully reproduce the regulation of apoptosis have proved to be useful for dissecting the biochemical mechanisms controlling caspase activation, including regulation by signaling pathways (28Clarke P.R. Jacobson M.D. McCarthy N. Apoptosis: The Molecular Biology of Programmed Cell Death. 40. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 176-199Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the ability of the cAMP signaling pathway to regulate caspase activation using cell-free systems derived from Xenopus eggs and mammalian cultured cells. We show that activation of PKA by cAMP blocks caspase-9 activation downstream of cytochrome c. Caspase-9 is phosphorylated directly by PKA, although mutational analysis shows that this phosphorylation is not required to inhibit caspase-9 activation. We demonstrate that PKA inhibits the recruitment of procaspase-9 to Apaf-1 in response to cytochrome c, indicating that PKA controls apoptosome formation by a novel mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human Caspase-9 and Apaf-1-(1–541) cDNAs were amplified from U2OS cells and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Codons for specific residues in caspase-9 were replaced with those encoding alanine or glutamate using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), and the mutations were verified by sequence analysis. For subsequent expression of caspase-9 proteins in bacteria, cDNAs were used that also encoded alanine at residue 287 instead of the cysteine required for catalytic activity. These cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and expression of recombinant proteins was induced in Escherichia coli BLR(DE3) at 30 °C for 2 h by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins were affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with 15 mm glutathione in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg ml-1 each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Glutathione was removed by filtration through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of mouse Apaf-1 (cDNA generously provided by Dr. J. Silke, Parkville, Australia) was cloned into pET28a and expressed as a His6-tagged protein which was purified on a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer B (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol), and then imidazole was removed using a PD-10 column.Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase-9 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-caspase-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal mouse anti-Apaf-1 antibody (Pharmingen) were purchased from commercial suppliers. Secondary antibodies for Western blots were goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). A sheep polyclonal antibody was generated against His6-tagged caspase-9C287A protein and affinity-purified on a GST-caspase-9C287A column. A rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific antibody, pS183-Casp-9, was raised against a phosphopeptide derived from caspase-9, LRTRTGS*NIDCEK, where S* represents phosphoserine (Moravian Biotech, Brno, Czech Republic). This antibody was affinity-purified by two rounds of negative selections against nonphosphorylated peptide followed by one round of positive selection with phosphorylated peptide.Cell Extracts—HeLa cell cytosolic (S100) extracts were purchased from Cilbiotech (Mons, Belgium) and were supplied in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at a protein concentration of 8–12 mg ml-1. HEK293 S16 extracts and Xenopus laevis egg extracts were prepared as described previously (26Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Measurement of Caspase Activation—Caspase activation was induced by incubating 200 μg of HeLa S100 extract together with 1 mm ATP, 10 μg ml-1 creatine kinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate (Roche Diagnostics), and 10 μm bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma) at 30 °C for the times indicated. HEK293 extracts were incubated with the same additions except that 200 nm cytochrome c was used. Caspase activation in Xenopus egg extracts was performed as described previously (29Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other reagents were used at the following concentrations: 0.48 unit μl-1 PKA catalytic subunit (Promega, Southampton, UK), 10 μm H89, 300 μm dibutyryl cAMP, and 300 μm 8-Br-cAMP (Calbiochem). For analysis of caspase-9 processing, 25-μg samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using chemiluminescence detection. For measurement of caspase-3 activity, samples were incubated with Ac-DEVD-AMC (Calbiochem), and the release of free AMC was measured using a fluorescence microtiter plate reader as described (26Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of Apoptosomes—Apoptosome formation was stimulated by incubating 1.5 mg of HeLa S100 extract together with 1 mm ATP, 10 μg ml-1 creatine kinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 10 μm cytochrome c for 4 h at 30 °C. Where indicated, 10 μm H89 and 0.24 unit μl-1 PKA catalytic subunit were added. The sample was incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal sheep anti-caspase-9 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of washed protein A beads (Sigma) were then added and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) before boiling in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.Phosphorylation of Recombinant GST-Caspase-9 and GST-Apaf-1-(1–541)—GST-caspase-9 proteins (all C287A) were incubated for the times indicated at 30 °C with 0.48 unit μl-1 PKA catalytic subunit in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]-ATP (specific activity 6 × 106 cpm nmol-1). GST-Apaf-1-(1–541) was phosphorylated under the same conditions, except that the incubation was for 90 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For identification of phosphorylation sites, 10 μg of GST-caspase-9 was incubated in a total volume of 30 μl for 90 min. Tryptic digestion, purification of the phosphopeptides by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and sequencing were carried out as described previously (26Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). For analysis by Western blotting, reactions contained 0.25 μg of GST-caspase-9 and nonradioactive ATP, and blots were probed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase-9 phosphospecific antibody, pS183-Casp-9.In Vitro Translation and Assay of Caspase-9 Activity—In vitro translation of caspase-9 cDNAs (which encoded the active site cysteine at residue 287) was performed according to the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation protocol (Promega). For induction of caspase-9 processing, 1 μl of in vitro translated caspase-9 labeled with [35S]methionine was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with 200 nm cytochrome c together with 2 μl of TnT lysate in a 10-μl buffered reaction (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Alternatively, caspase-9 processing was induced using 1 μl of in vitro translated caspase-9 incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with 2–8 ng of Apaf-1-(1–541) or 300 ng of Apaf-1 CARD in the same reaction buffer. Caspase-9D330A was used for the incubation with Apaf-1-(1–541). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Immunodepletion of Caspase-9 —For immunodepletion of caspase-9, 40 μl of washed protein A beads (Sigma) were incubated with 5 μl of sheep polyclonal antibody against caspase-9 in 200 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C overnight. Unbound antibody was removed by washing in the same buffer. Beads were then added to 100 μl of HeLa S100 extract (10 mg/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant was incubated with a second aliquot of anti-caspase-9 antibody bound to protein A beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered and used as caspase-9-depleted extract. For analysis of caspase-3 activation by caspase-9, HeLa cytosolic extract depleted of endogenous caspase-9 was reconstituted with in vitro translated caspase-9 and cytochrome c.RESULTSActivation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 Is Inhibited by cAMP Analogues through PKA—To investigate the role of the cAMP signal transduction cascade in apoptotic regulation, we sought to determine whether this signaling pathway modulated activation of the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway. We made use of cell-free systems that allow dissection of the biochemical molecular mechanisms by which signal transduction cascades may impinge on this pathway. Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system undergo caspase activation upon prolonged incubation as cytochrome c is released from mitochondria (6Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar, 29Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The addition of a stable cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, to egg extracts at the start of the incubation completely blocked caspase-3 activation detected by cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate, AcDEVD-AMC (Fig. 1A). When egg extracts were fractionated to yield a post-mitochondrial supernatant and a pellet containing mitochondria, 8-Br-cAMP inhibited the activation of caspase-3 in the supernatant in response to addition of the mitochondrial pellet or exogenous cytochrome c (Fig. 1A). 8-Br-cAMP also blocked upstream caspase-9 processing induced by cytochrome c in the supernatant (Fig. 1B).Similarly, in human somatic cell (HeLa) extracts lacking mitochondria, caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2, A and B) and caspase-9 processing (Fig. 2C) induced by the addition of exogenous cytochrome c was inhibited by co-incubation with 8-Br-cAMP or another cAMP analogue, dibutryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP). Fig. 2C shows that Bt2cAMP inhibited both autoprocessing of caspase-9 from the proenzyme to a p35 form (a direct measure of caspase-9 activation) and processing to a p37 form that is produced by caspase-3, which is activated downstream of caspase-9 (30Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Inhibition of both caspase-3 activation and caspase-9 activation by cAMP analogues was reversed by the pharmacological PKA inhibitor, H89. Consistent with a role for PKA in the regulation of this apoptotic pathway, we found incubation of HEK293 (Fig. 3A) or HeLa (Fig. 3, B and C) cytosolic extracts with active PKA catalytic subunit strongly inhibited activation of both caspase-3 (Fig. 3, A and B) and caspase-9 (Fig. 3C) in response to cytochrome c. These inhibitory effects were substantially reversed by H89. These results show that cAMP signaling inhibits the caspase-9/caspase-3 apoptotic pathway at the stage of caspase-9 activation and that this inhibitory effect is mediated through PKA.Fig. 2Inhibition of caspase-9/caspase-3 activation in a human cell-free system by cAMP analogues. HeLa cytosolic extract incubated with 8-Br-cAMP (8Br) or dibutryl cAMP (db-cAMP) in the presence or absence of H89. Caspase activation was induced by cytochrome c.

Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To test whether PKA could target caspase-9 directly, we incubated recombinant caspase-9 expressed as a GST fusion protein with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. We found that GST-caspase-9 was phosphorylated with a stoichiometry of 0.52 mol phosphate/mol protein in this reaction (Fig. 4A). To identify the phosphorylation sites, 32P-labeled GST-caspase-9 was digested with trypsin, and the resulting phosphopeptides were purified by HPLC (Fig. 4B). Four major phosphopeptides (P1–P4) were obtained; these were analyzed by mass spectrometry and sequencing. This analysis revealed that P1 (Mr 2653.50) corresponded to amino acids 94–116 of caspase-9 (Fig. 4C) phosphorylated at a single residue (predicted Mr 2653.48). The identity of this peptide was confirmed by amino acid sequencing using Edman degradation, with serine 99 identified as the phosphorylation site by release of radioactivity at cycle 6. Analysis of P4 (Mr 2637.53) revealed this peptide to be a modified form of P1 in which the N-terminal Gln residue was converted to pyroglutamate (predicted Mr 2636.45). P2 (Mr 1151.44) corresponded to amino acids 181–189 of caspase-9 with serine 183 identified as the phosphorylated residue (predicted Mr 1151.43; release of radioactivity at cycle 3). Finally, P3 (Mr 1559.77) corresponded to amino acids 193–204 phosphorylated at serine 195 (predicted Mr 1559.74; release of radioactivity at cycle 3).Fig. 4PKA phosphorylates caspase-9 on Ser-99, Ser-183, and Ser-195.A, recombinant GST-caspase-9 incubated with active PKA catalytic subunit and [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Phosphorylation was abolished in GST-caspase-9S99A/S183A/S195A (Fig. 4D), confirming that these were indeed the only sites targeted directly by PKA.Phosphorylation of Caspase-9 at Ser-183 in Cell Extracts—To test whether caspase-9 was phosphorylated in response to PKA activation in cell extracts, we raised an antibody against one phosphorylated site, Ser-183. The purified antibody recognized caspase-9 only when phosphorylated at this site, since GST-caspase-9S183A was not recognized even after incubation with PKA (Fig. 5A). Using this phosphospecific antibody, we showed that caspase-9 was indeed phosphorylated at Ser-183 in HeLa cytosolic extracts in response to the addition of the active catalytic subunit of PKA or the cAMP analogues 8-Br-cAMP and Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5B). However, phosphorylation of Ser-183 in response to cAMP analogues was rather weak compared with the addition of the active catalytic subunit, indicating a relatively low stoichiometry of phosphorylation. Using the pSer-183 antibody, we were unable to detect significant phosphorylation of this site in cells in response to elevation of cAMP (data not shown), possibly because the antibody was insufficiently sensitive or because this site was not phosphorylated strongly by PKA in vivo.Fig. 5Phosphorylation of caspase-9 at serine 183 by PKA.A, recognition of GST-caspase-9 (WT, wild type) but not GST-caspase-9S183A (S183A) after incubation with PKA by a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a caspase-9 phosphopeptide containing phospho-Ser-183 (pS183-Casp-9).

https://openalex.org/W1966044017,"In cells that allow replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), there are two phases of translation inhibition: an early block of host translation and a later inhibition of viral translation. We investigated the phosphorylation of the α subunit of the eIF2 complex during these two phases of viral infection. In VSV-infected cells, the accumulation of phosphorylated (inactivated) eIF2α did not begin until well after host protein synthesis was inhibited, suggesting that it only plays a role in blocking viral translation later after infection. Consistent with this, cells expressing an unphosphorylatable eIF2α showed prolonged viral protein synthesis without an effect on host protein synthesis inhibition. Induction of eIF2α phosphorylation at early times of viral infection by treatment with thapsigargin showed that virus and host translation are similarly inhibited, demonstrating that viral and host messages are similarly sensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation. A recombinant virus that expresses a mutant matrix protein and is defective in the inhibition of host and virus protein synthesis showed an altered phosphorylation of eIF2α, demonstrating an involvement of viral protein function in inducing this antiviral response. This analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation, coupled with earlier findings that the eIF4F complex is modified earlier during VSV infection, supports a temporal/kinetic model of translation control, where at times soon after infection, changes in the eIF4F complex result in the inhibition of host protein synthesis; at later times, inactivation of the eIF2 complex blocks VSV protein synthesis.

Many viruses can selectively inhibit host translation and still use the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Schneider R.J. Mohr I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 130-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2.Bushell M. Sarnow P. J.

This provides two advantages for viral replication. It facilitates the rapid production of viral proteins, and it can also inhibit the production of host antiviral proteins (4.Lyles D.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both factors are important in the race of the virus against the cellular antiviral response. On the other hand, a critical part of the cellular antiviral response is the global inhibition of translation that blocks viral protein synthesis, effectively dampening virus production (5.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The inhibition of both host and viral translation are apparent during infection with the prototype rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). 1The abbreviations used are: VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PKR, protein kinase R; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; wt, wild type; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; rwt, recombinant wild-type; hpi, hours postinfection. During VSV infection, there is a rapid inhibition of host mRNA translation early after infection. This block of host translation is followed by a later inhibition of viral mRNA translation (6.Rose J.K. Whitt M.A. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. 1. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1221-1244Google Scholar). The experiments presented here address the question of whether these two events reflect differing sensitivities of viral and host mRNAs to a single translation inhibition response or whether there are separate mechanisms controlling each inhibitory event. A substantial body of evidence implicates the phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2α as a major player in inhibiting viral translation (5.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). eIF2α is a subunit of eIF2, the multiprotein complex that is responsible for recruiting the initiator tRNA to the 40 S subunit of the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits the exchange of GDP for GTP and inhibits translation initiation by blocking the recruitment of the initiator methionine tRNA. The phosphorylation of eIF2α can be carried out by several different kinases (7.Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), but the double-stranded RNA-activated kinase PKR is believed to be responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2α during viral infection (5.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Early studies showed that eIF2 was inactivated in VSV-infected cells (8.Jaye M.C. Godchaux 3rd, W. Lucas-Lenard J. Virology. 1982; 116: 148-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9.Centrella M. Lucas-Lenard J. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro experiments showed that adding eIF2 to lysates from VSV-infected cells could restore translational activity (10.Dratewka-Kos E. Kiss I. Lucas-Lenard J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recent studies using cells derived from PKR knock-out mice suggested that the inactivation of eIF2 was caused by eIF2α phosphorylation and was primarily a function of PKR (11.Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Brown L.E. Truong H. Pattnaik A.K. Archer D.R. Barber G.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 12.Stojdl D.F. Abraham N.

Virol. 2000; 74: 9580-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), although a recent publication has demonstrated that there is an additional contribution from pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (13.Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Papadopoulou S. Blais J.D. Bell J.C. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12747-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of eIF2 function during VSV infection suggests two different models for the biphasic inhibition of host and then viral protein synthesis. The first is that eIF2 is the dominant complex that controls host and viral translation in VSV-infected cells, but that VSV messages are more resistant to eIF2 inhibition than are host messages. This would be a situation similar to that seen for cricket paralysis virus mRNAs and some cellular mRNAs (14.Wilson J.E. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Cell. 2000; 102: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The second model is that there are distinct mechanisms that regulate the early inhibition of host and the late inhibition of viral protein synthesis, and that eIF2 is responsible for only one of these events. Support for the latter model has come from recent studies showing the alteration of the eIF4F initiation factor complex in VSV-infected cells (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The eIF4F complex is a multiprotein complex that contains the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, the helicase eIF4A, the protein kinase MNK1, and additional proteins (17.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). This complex is responsible for binding to the m7-GTP cap of mRNAs and bringing them to the 40 S ribosome complex. We showed that after VSV infection, there is a rapid alteration of the eIF4F complex, indicated by the dephosphorylation of the eIF4E subunit (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which was correlated with the inhibition of host protein synthesis. The dephosphorylation of eIF4E was associated with the activation of the eIF4E binding protein eIF4E-BP1/PHAS1, a protein that is known to dissociate eIF4E from the eIF4F complex, although additional mechanisms also contribute to eIF4E dephosphorylation (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not determine whether there were concurrent alterations in eIF2α phosphorylation that might also contribute to the inhibition of host protein synthesis. In this study, we analyzed the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in the inhibition of host versus viral translation during VSV infection. The results showed that eIF2α phosphorylation occurring after host protein synthesis is inhibited, suggesting that eIF2α phosphorylation does not play a role in inhibiting host protein synthesis. Consistent with this, a dominant active form of eIF2α that cannot be phosphorylated had no effect on host translation inhibition. EIF2α phosphorylation did seem to be sufficient for the inhibition of viral protein synthesis, in that pharmacological inducers of eIF2α phosphorylation blocked viral protein synthesis even early after infection, and a viral mutant that expresses viral proteins for a longer period of time than the wild-type virus did not induce the phosphorylation of eIF2α to the same extent as the wild-type virus, showing that the viral M protein can play a role in the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation.

Lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 8 min in a refrigerated centrifuge, and 360 μl of the supernatant was added to 40 μl of 10× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Equal volumes of lysate were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, + 5% dry milk. Antibodies were diluted as recommended by the manufacturers. Band intensities were quantitated by first scanning the film and then analyzing the images with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Thapsigargin Treatment—BHK cells were treated with thapsigargin for 1 h before 35S labeling or lysis. For 35S labeling, thapsigargin was included in the initial methionine depletion step. Thapsigargin was made as a 1 mm stock in Me2SO. Metabolic Labeling and Rate of Protein Synthesis Determination—BHK cells were mock-infected or infected with VSV and then labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min at varying times after infection, as described previously (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After labeling, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 8 min. 360 μl of supernatant was added to 40 μl of 10× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 10 μl was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were stained with Coomasie blue to determine their protein content, then were analyzed by phosphorescence imaging (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorescence intensities were analyzed using ImageQuant software. The rate of viral protein synthesis was determined from experiments by quantitation of the radioactivity in the viral L, G, N/P, and M bands in each lane. The rate of host protein synthesis was determined by quantitation of the radioactivity between the L and G bands, the N/P and M bands, and below the M band. For all experiments, three separate experiments were analyzed in this manner to determine an average. EIF2α Phosphorylation Occurs after Host Protein Synthesis Is Inhibited in VSV-infected Cells—Fig. 1A illustrates the changes in both viral and host protein synthesis during VSV infection of BHK cells. Cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (an image of the Coomassie-stained gel is shown in Fig. 1B to demonstrate protein loading). The synthesis of host proteins, apparent as a ladder of bands in the lane from mock-infected cells, decreased over the first few hours of VSV infection, and was largely inhibited by 6 h after infection. Synthesis of the VSV proteins L, G, N, P, and M was apparent by 4 h after infection, approximately the time that the inhibition of host protein synthesis began. VSV proteins were synthesized at high levels between 6 and 8 h after infection, but by 12 h after infection, the synthesis of VSV protein was noticeably diminished. Fig. 1C shows a quantitation of the host and viral protein synthesis in VSV-infected BHK cells. Host protein synthesis, determined by the sum of the radioactivity between the viral L and G bands, the P and M bands, and the region below the M band, showed a decrease by 4 h after infection and was only 30% of mock-infected control by 6 h after infection. In contrast, viral protein synthesis began to increase dramatically at 4 h after infection, approximately the same time that host protein synthesis began to decrease. We have shown previously that this increase parallels the increase in viral mRNA in infected cells (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Viral protein synthesis reached a maximum at 8 h after infection, and then decreased to only 20% of its maximum at 12 h after infection. To determine the change in the phosphorylation of eIF2α during the inhibition of host and viral protein synthesis, we assessed eIF2α phosphorylation over a time course similar to that shown in Fig. 1A. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated and total forms of eIF2α. As a control, cells were treated for 1 h with 1 μm thapsigargin, a pharmacological agent that induces eIF2α phosphorylation by the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum protein kinase through destabilization of Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (20.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1D. A low level of phosphorylated eIF2α was detectable in mock-treated cells and, as expected, thapsigargin caused the rapid phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 1D, top left). VSV infection did cause an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation, as reported previously (11.Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Brown L.E. Truong H. Pattnaik A.K. Archer D.R. Barber G.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 12.Stojdl D.F. Abraham N. Knowles S. Marius R. Brasey A. Lichty B.D. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9580-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, this occurred long after the inhibition of host protein synthesis seen in Fig. 1A. At early times after infection, eIF2α phosphorylation was at the level of mock-infected cells. Phosphorylation of eIF2α did not begin to noticeably increase until well after host protein synthesis was inhibited, becoming clearly elevated at 10 and 12 h after infection. The extent of eIF2α phosphorylation was quantitated as a ratio of signal from the phosphospecific antibody to the signal from the total eIF2α antibody and normalized to the amount of eIF2α phosphorylation that is caused by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 1E). In this analysis, the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to VSV infection did not increase significantly above mock-infected controls until 8 h after infection, but the level of phosphorylation by 12 h after infection was approximately equal to that that of thapsigargin-treated cells. This lack of significant phosphorylation until later after infection suggests that the inactivation of eIF2 through eIF2α phosphorylation is not involved in VSV's inhibition of host protein synthesis. However, the increase in eIF2α phosphorylation did correlate with the decrease in VSV protein synthesis, consistent with the idea that it is involved in blocking viral protein synthesis. Host and Viral Protein Synthesis Are Similarly Sensitive to eIF2α Phosphorylation—It has been proposed that translation of VSV messages during infection is more resistant than host messages to the phosphorylation of eIF2α (9.Centrella M. Lucas-Lenard J. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A resistance of viral protein synthesis to eIF2α inactivation could account for the results seen in Fig. 1A. For example, host protein synthesis would be inhibited early after infection by a level of eIF2α phosphorylation too low to be detected by the phosphospecific antibody, whereas later after infection, higher levels of eIF2α phosphorylation would block viral protein synthesis. To determine whether the translation of VSV messages was more resistant than cellular messages to the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation, VSV- and mock-infected cells were treated with 200 nm thapsigargin, and the levels of protein synthesis were determined. Consistent with previous reports, the effects of thapsigargin were transient; protein synthesis was inhibited for ∼2 h but thereafter began to recover (21.Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This allowed us to determine both the short-term effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and the recovery of protein synthesis. Rates of protein synthesis were determined at 6 h after infection for both VSV- and mock-infected cells treated for various times with thapsigargin; a diagram of the experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 2A. Thapsigargin was added either coincident with infection (6 h Tgn), 2 h after infection (4 h Tgn), 4 h after infection (2 h Tgn), or 5 h after infection (1 h Tgn), and cells were then either pulse-labeled to determine the rate of protein synthesis or lysed and analyzed for the state of eIF2α phosphorylation by Western blotting. Western blot analysis of VSV-infected, thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 2B) showed that eIF2α was extensively phosphorylated after the 1-h Tgn treatment, but little eIF2α phosphorylation was seen in cells infected with VSV alone for 6 h. Phosphorylation of eIF2α decreased over longer periods of TGN treatment, consistent with the transient effects of the drug treatment. In virus-infected cells that were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 2C), a 1-h treatment with thapsigargin resulted in a dramatic inhibition of both VSV protein synthesis and host protein synthesis (lane 3). Treatment of cells with thapsigargin for longer times resulted in a lessening of this effect (lanes 4–6) because of the cells' recovery from thapsigargin treatment. A similar effect was seen in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2D). A 1- or 2-h treatment with thapsigargin resulted in a significant inhibition of protein synthesis, but at 4 and 6 h of treatment, recovery of protein synthesis was evident, consistent with the reversal of eIF2α phosphorylation. The inhibition and recovery of VSV protein synthesis was quantitated and compared with the recovery of host protein synthesis in mock-infected cells that were treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 2E). The rates of recovery for both viral and host protein synthesis were very similar for 1, 2, and 4 h, indicating that the inhibition and recovery of viral and host protein synthesis was correlated with the phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of eIF2α. In some cases, the treatment of cells with thapsigargin coincident with VSV infection (6 h) resulted in a level of VSV protein synthesis (Fig. 2E) and protein accumulation (data not shown) that was variable and somewhat greater than values for uninfected cells for reasons that are not well understood. The conclusion to be drawn from Fig. 2 is that the rates of viral and host protein synthesis are similarly sensitive to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, the different timing of viral and host translation inhibition seen in Fig. 1 cannot be explained by different sensitivities to the level of eIF2α phosphorylation. Host Protein Synthesis Inhibition by VSV Is Not Altered in Cells Overexpressing a Nonphosphorylatable eIF2α—To further test the conclusion that the phosphorylation of eIF2α was not a critical factor in the inhibition of host protein synthesis during VSV infection, we used MEF cells expressing eIF2α that contained a serine-to-alanine mutation at residue 51 (S51A knock-in cells; kindly provided by Donalyn Scheuner and Ronald Kaufman), which prevents the phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2α. This S51A mutation has previously been shown to block the phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α and the associated decrease in host protein synthesis in response to several different cell stress events (22.Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 23.Donze O. Jagus R. Koromilas A.E. Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3828-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Control and knock-in MEFS were infected with VSV for 4, 6, 8, and 10 h or treated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 1 h. In cells expressing wild-type eIF2α (Fig. 3A), thapsigargin treatment resulted in the inhibition of protein synthesis as expected. Infection with VSV also resulted in the inhibition of host protein synthesis by 6 h after infection, similar to the effects seen in BHK cells. In these cells, there was a more rapid inhibition of viral protein synthesis than in BHK cells, so that maximal levels of viral protein synthesis occurred at 6 hpi. Assessing the level of eIF2α phosphorylation in these cells by Western blotting (Fig. 3D), we found that there was a rapid phosphorylation of eIF2α that became apparent at 6 hpi and increased up to 10 hpi consistent with a role in blocking viral protein synthesis (band intensities of phospho eIF2α signal normalized to total eIF2α are printed at the bottom of Fig. 3D). In cells expressing the eIF2α S51A mutant, protein synthesis was not markedly inhibited after thapsigargin treatment, consistent with previous results showing that the S51A mutant does not allow the phosphorylation of eIF2α and inactivation of protein synthesis. However, when these cells were infected with VSV, the time course of host protein synthesis inhibition was very similar to that seen in MEFs expressing wt eIF2α, so that by 6 h after infection, host protein synthesis was largely inhibited (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–6), although viral protein synthesis continued for much longer. As expected, Western blotting for eIF2α phosphorylation showed no signal in these cells (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3E shows a quantitative comparison of the rate of host protein synthesis in control cells and cells expressing the S51A mutant eIF2α. For control cells, thapsigargin treatment reduced the rate of protein translation to ∼20% of control, but the protein synthesis rate remained above 80% of control in cells overexpressing the nonphosphorylatable eIF2α. VSV infection resulted in the inhibition of host protein synthesis in control cells, dropping to 30% of mock-infected cells by 8 h after infection. This pattern was virtually identical in cells expressing the S51A mutant eIF2α, further supporting the idea that eIF2α does not play a significant role in the inhibition of host protein synthesis. However, viral protein synthesis (Fig. 3F) was both increased and persisted for longer times in the S51A MEFs. This was particularly noticeable at 10hpi, where viral protein synthesis in the knock-in MEFs was 4-fold that seen in MEFs expressing wt eIF2α, consistent with previous data showing that eIF2α phosphorylation plays a role in blocking viral protein synthesis (24.Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 51-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). EIF2α Phosphorylation Is Disregulated in Cells Infected with the VSV M51R M Protein Mutant—The data shown above suggest that independent factors control viral and host protein synthesis during VSV infection. To further test this hypothesis, we used a virus containing a point mutant in the VSV matrix protein that is delayed in the inhibition of both host and viral translation. Fig. 4A shows an autoradiograph of lysates from cells that were mock-infected or infected with isogenic recombinant viruses derived from cDNA clones containing either wt or M51R M proteins (rwt or rM51R-M virus, respectively) for the indicated times, after which they were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. Two important results are illustrated by this image: first, the M51R virus is defective in its ability to inhibit host protein synthesis. Quantitation of three separate experiments (Fig. 4B) showed that although the rwt virus inhibited host protein synthesis by more than 80% by 12 hpi, the rM51R-M virus inhibited only approximately 50% of host protein synthesis at the same time. The second important result is the fact that viral protein synthesis was not inhibited to the same extent in cells infected with the rM51R-M virus as it was in cells infected with the rwt virus (Fig. 4A, compare lane 4 with lane 8). Fig. 4C shows eIF2α phosphorylation in response to infection with rwt or rM51R-M virus. Quantitation of three separate experiments is shown in Fig. 4D. Cells were mock-infected or infected with rwt or rM51R-M virus, and at 4, 8, or 12 h after infection, cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. When these lysates were probed for levels of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 4C, left), cells infected with rwt virus showed a pattern of phosphorylation at 8 and 12 h after infection that was similar to that of cells infected with the wild-type Orsay strain used in Figs. 1, 2, 3. In cells infected with the rM51R-M virus, eIF2α phosphorylation was observed at a level higher than that seen in the rwt virus-infected cells at 4 h after infection (Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus lane 5). This level of eIF2α phosphorylation in the rM51R-M virus-infected cells remained constant throughout infection but was only 60% of the level that was induced by the rwt virus at 12 hpi (Fig. 4D). Thus, the M protein mutant virus induced more eIF2α phosphorylation than the wt virus early after infection, but the inhibition of host protein synthesis by the mutant virus was less than that of the wt virus. This result is inconsistent with a role for eIF2 complex inactivation in the early inhibition of host protein synthesis. In contrast to early times after infection, the M protein mutant virus induced less eIF2α phosphorylation at late times after infection. This may account for the higher levels of protein synthesis seen in the rM51R-infected cells and is consistent with a role for eIF2 in blocking viral protein synthesis. Previous reports have suggested a role for both eIF2 and eIF4 in the inhibition of translation in VSV-infected cells, but the relative roles of these complexes in the inhibition of host versus virus translation had not been established (9.Centrella M. Lucas-Lenard J. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Dratewka-Kos E. Kiss I. Lucas-Lenard J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J.

Of particular importance was the possibility that host and viral mRNAs might be differently susceptible to inhibition by eIF2α phosphorylation. The results presented here, combined with our earlier findings regarding how VSV infection impacts eIF4F function (16.Connor J.H. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10177-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), support a model for understanding the differential inhibition of host versus viral protein synthesis as being caused by the alteration of two different translation initiation factors, eIF2 and eIF4F, at different times. Our model for the changes in these translation initiation factors after VSV infection is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. In normal cells, the eIF2 and eIF4F complexes are fully functional, and host protein synthesis proceeds normally (far left), but after VSV infection, there are two discernible changes to the translation apparatus. The first is an early event after infection, illustrated in the middle column of Fig. 5, a change in the eIF4F complex, indicated by the dephosphorylation of eIF4E. This change in the eIF4F complex results in an exclusion of host messages while viral mRNAs are translated. The second effect on translation occurs later after infection and is depicted in the right column of Fig. 5, where eIF2α phosphorylation increases, inhibiting proper eIF2 function and blocking both host and viral translation. This model emphasizes the role of eIF2 and eIF4F; however, it is possible that other translation control mechanisms contribute to the inhibition of host and viral translation. With this model as a basis, similar approaches could be used to test the roles of other mechanisms. The data in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 support the model in Fig. 5. During the course of viral infection, eIF2α was phosphorylated in VSV-infected cells, but this occurred well after the inhibition of host protein synthesis and was coincident with the inhibition of viral protein synthesis (Fig. 1). Blocking eIF2α phosphorylation with a dominant active eIF2α did not affect the inhibition of host protein synthesis during VSV infection (Fig. 3). When eIF2α phosphorylation was induced by thapsigargin treatment during viral infection, it blocked the translation of both viral and host proteins (Fig. 2). The synthesis of both viral and host proteins was recovered on the same timescale, showing that neither viral nor host translation is more susceptible to eIF2α phosphorylation. In contrast to these results with eIF2α phosphorylation, the alteration of the eIF4F complex indicated by eIF4E dephosphorylation correlates very well with the inhibition of host translation. The sensitivity of VSV translation to eIF2α phosphorylation is fully consistent with previous reports showing that the activation of PKR (12.Stojdl D.F. Abraham N. Knowles S. Marius R. Brasey A. Lichty B.D. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9580-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27.Durbin R.K. Mertz S.E. Koromilas A.E. Durbin J.E. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α (24.Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 51-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26.Perkins D.J. Barber G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2025-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is an important host defense mechanism against VSV infection. These studies showed that removing PKR or keeping eIF2α phosphorylation from blocking eIF2 function allows enhanced VSV replication. One question raised by these findings is how VSV still manages to replicate well in animal hosts such as mice, where the PKR pathway is still intact. Our results showing a delay in eIF2α phosphorylation until after VSV has been producing both RNA and protein for a significant period of time (8 hpi in BHK cells) suggests that the kinetics of eIF2α phosphorylation may be important for viral replication. The reason that some cell types are resistant to VSV infection and others are sensitive may result from the fact that cells that rapidly phosphorylate eIF2α are more resistant to VSV infection, whereas those that have a significant delay in eIF2α phosphorylation block viral protein synthesis at a point that is too late to inhibit effective replication. This idea is supported by our results, where BHK cells that replicate virus at titers up to 109 plaque-forming units have a longer delay in eIF2α phosphorylation than do MEFs that only replicate VSV to titers of ∼106 plaque-forming units. The previous reports showing that VSV infection inactivates the eIF2 complex have all suggested that VSV infection rapidly induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α (28.Chesler D.A. Reiss C.S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results showing a delay in eIF2α phosphorylation until after VSV has been producing both RNA and protein for well over 6 h suggests a more complex interpretation. VSV infection has multiple triggers (dsRNA production, ER stress through G protein production, RNA synthesis inhibition, etc.) that could lead to the eIF2α phosphorylation seen in the wt virus infection. Because eIF2α phosphorylation is not seen until later after infection, it is possible that one or more VSV gene products act to delay this inhibitory event. Our results suggest that the M protein is a good candidate protein for this effect, in that cells infected with an M protein mutant virus (rM51R-M) showed more eIF2α phosphorylation early after infection, consistent with the M protein mutant being a loss-of-function mutant that no longer delays eIF2α phosphorylation. The fact that eIF2α phosphorylation at late times after infection was decreased relative to cells infected with the rwt virus could also be caused by the loss of an important function in this M protein mutant, in that it no longer inhibits RNA synthesis and nuclear/cytoplasmic transport (29.Ahmed M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), stresses that could increase eIF2α phosphorylation. It is also possible that the ability of the cell to synthesize new proteins in the M51R virus infected cells leads to the expression of proteins that counteract eIF2α kinases, such as the GADD-34 protein, which has been shown to be induced by M51 mutant VSV by other researchers (32.Stojdl D.F. Lichty B.D. tenOever B.R. Paterson J.M. Power A.T. Knowles S. Marius R. Reynard J. Poliquin L. Atkins H. Brown E.G. Durbin R.K. Durbin J.E. Hiscott J. Bell J.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Our results have led to a new proposal of translation control during VSV infection. In this model (illustrated in Fig. 5), VSV infection results in the rapid modification of eIF4F, which is responsible for blocking host translation. A later phase of translation control is exerted by the host antiviral response, which induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α and blocks viral translation. This model predicts that the kinetics of eIF2α phosphorylation is important for viral replication. This prediction will be tested in future experiments.

Synapse-associated proteins (SAPs), for example, PSD-95 and SAP97 organize the molecular architecture of synapses and regulate interactions between receptors and downstream-signaling molecules. Here, we show that expression and subcellular distribution of PSD-95 and SAP97 are altered in the striatum of unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats following repeated vehicle (a model of PD) or L-DOPA administration (a model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia). Furthermore, following dopamine-depletion and development of behavioral deficits in Rotorod performance, indicative of parkinsonism, we observed a dramatic decrease in total striatal levels of PSD-95 and SAP97 (to 25.6 +/- 9.9% and 19.0 +/- 5.0% of control, respectively). The remaining proteins were redistributed from the synapse into vesicular compartments. L-DOPA (6.5mg/kg twice a day, 21 days) induced a rotational response, which became markedly enhanced with repeated treatment (day 1: -15.8+/-7.3 rotations cf day 21: 758.2+/-114.0 rotations). Post L-DOPA treatment, PSD-95 and SAP97 levels increased (367.4 +/- 43.2% and 159.9 +/- 9.5% from control values, respectively), with both being redistributed toward synaptic membranes from vesicular compartments. In situ hybridization showed that changes in total levels of PSD-95, but not SAP97, were accompanied by qualitatively similar changes in mRNA. These data highlight the potential role of abnormalities in the subcellular distribution of SAPs in the pathophysiology of a neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W2047953146,"The modification of serine/threonine residues on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is suggested to play a role in the regulation of a variety of signal transduction pathways. We have previously shown that glucosamine (GlcNH2), a metabolic precursor of O-GlcNAcylation, increases 2O-GlcNAc and enhances motility in neutrophils. Here, we extend this correlation by showing that a mechanistically distinct means of increasing O-GlcNAc, achieved by inhibition of O-GlcNAc removal with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), increases basal cellular motility and directional migration induced by the chemoattractant formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Furthermore, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modulates the activities of signaling intermediates known to regulate neutrophil movement. GlcNH2 and PUGNAc increase both the basal and fMLP-induced activity of a central mediator of cellular motility, the small GTPase Rac. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, an important regulator of Rac activity and neutrophil motility, is shown to regulate the signaling pathway on which GlcNH2 and PUGNAc act. Rac is an important upstream regulatory element in p38 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in neutrophils, and these MAPKs are implicated in chemotactic signal transduction. We show that GlcNH2 and PUGNAc treatment increases p42/44 and p38 MAPK activities and that these increases are associated with activation of upstream MAPK kinases. These data indicate that O-GlcNAcylation is an important signaling element in neutrophils that modulates the activities of several critical signaling intermediates involved in the regulation of cellular movement.

Rac is an important upstream regulatory element in p38 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in neutrophils, and these MAPKs are implicated in chemotactic signal transduction. We show that GlcNH2 and PUGNAc treatment increases p42/44 and p38 MAPK activities and that these increases are associated with activation of upstream MAPK kinases. These data indicate that O-GlcNAcylation is an important signaling element in neutrophils that modulates the activities of several critical signaling intermediates involved in the regulation of cellular movement.

The sugar donor for the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that catalyzes this modification is a product of glucose metabolism through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) (3Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 824-831Google Scholar). OGT activity is sensitive to changes in substrate availability such that increases in HBP flux, mediated either through glucose or glucosamine (GlcNH2) administration, lead to increased levels of its substrate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which then drives OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation (3Marshall S.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for such a regulatory role comes from the variety of signaling pathways that are regulated by protein O-GlcNAc. For example, protein O-GlcNAc is associated with transcriptional regulation (13Gao Y. Miyazaki J. Hart G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Hiromura M. Choi C.H. Sabourin N.A. Jones H. Bachvarov D. Usheva A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Using a neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte or PMN) model, we recently demonstrated that rapid protein O-GlcNAcylation could occur in response to agonist stimulation through a cell-surface receptor-mediated mechanism (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data provided further support for the concept that O-GlcNAc may function in a highly dynamic regulatory capacity analogous to protein phosphorylation. PMNs are a vital component of the innate immune response to infection and tissue damage. Their effectiveness in this capacity is dependent on the activation of actin-based cytoskeletal machinery that allows for directed migration toward a focus of inflammation. Lipid kinase, protein kinase, and small G protein activities are central mediators of PMN motility; however, we have recently implicated substrate-driven O-GlcNAcylation as an additional modulator of this essential PMN function (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Specifically, GlcNH2-associated increases in O-GlcNAc were found to correlate with enhanced basal and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-(fMLP) induced motility. The intracellular signals that mediate PMN motility involve a complex interconnected signaling network that includes phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The generation of PI3Kγ knock-out mice and the use of PI3K-specific inhibitors have demonstrated an important role for PI3K and its lipid products in chemotaxis (19Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C.

Knock-outs have also been generated for the small GTPases Rac1 and Rac2, and these also show significant deficiencies in PMN chemotaxis (23Gu Y. Filippi M.D. Cancelas J.A. Siefring J.E. Williams E.P.

Interestingly, Rac activation may be regulated in large part by a recently identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor, P-Rex1 (27Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R.

This Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor is activated by either phosphatidylinositol phosphates or heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, thus providing for a direct link between PI3K and Rac activation. PMNs lacking Rac are also deficient in p38 and p44/42 activation (23Gu Y. Filippi M.D. Cancelas J.A. Siefring J.E. Williams E.P. Jasti A.C. Harris C.E. Lee A.W. Prabhakar R. Atkinson S.J.

In light of our recent study correlating GlcNH2-induced increases in O-GlcNAc with enhanced PMN motility (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the goal of this study was to examine the impact of O-GlcNAc on motility-associated signal transduction. Importantly, we also sought to confirm that protein O-GlcNAcylation was indeed the mechanism through which GlcNH2 alters PMN function by examining whether an alternate, unrelated means of increasing O-GlcNAc has effects similar to those seen with GlcNH2. We considered this essential because GlcNH2 may have metabolic effects unrelated to protein O-GlcNAcylation (3Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 824-831Google Scholar, 46Anello M. Spampinato D. Piro S. Purrello F. Rabuazzo A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E602-E608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 47Hresko R.C.

Biophys. 1984; 235: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore we compared the effect of O-GlcNAcylation induced by GlcNH2 to that induced by the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) (49Horsch M.

By using these mechanistically unrelated methods of manipulating the enzymes responsible for O-GlcNAc cycling, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modulates neutrophil motility. In accordance with its effects on motility, we show that protein O-GlcNAc increases the amount of GTP-bound, or activated, Rac. Furthermore, O-GlcNAc-associated changes in cell motility are shown to be wortmannin sensitive. Increases in O-GlcNAc are also associated with increased activity of the MAPKs p38 and p44/42, and of the MAPK kinases (MKKs) MKK3/6 and MEK1/2. In addition to confirming that protein O-GlcNAcylation modulates motility and motility-associated signaling, our data support the idea that O-GlcNAc is an important signaling mechanism in PMNs akin to phosphorylation. Furthermore, our results are of general interest because they define a novel axis of O-GlcNAc-modulated signal transduction that involves Rac/PI3K/MAPK, each of these being important signaling intermediates in a variety of systems and cellular processes. Materials—PUGNAc was purchased from Carbogen. Wortmannin and fMLP were purchased from Calbiochem. GTPγS and GDP were from Upstate. Hanks' buffered salt solution was purchased from Cellgro. Anti-actin antibody was purchased from Abcam. Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. PMN Isolation—Whole blood from volunteers was obtained by venipuncture and layered onto a double discontinuous gradient formed with equal volumes of Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) over Histopaque-1119 (Sigma) (52English D. Anderson B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The blood was centrifuged at 700 × g for 30 min. Granulocytes were collected from the 1077/1119 interface and washed in Hanks' salt solution buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (Hanks' buffered salt solution). Contaminating red blood cells were lysed by incubation in 0.15 m NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. The granulocytes were then washed twice in Hanks' buffered salt solution and resuspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Cell viability was assessed through trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion. Immunoblotting—For protein O-GlcNAc immunoblots 2 × 106 PMNs were treated as indicated and directly lysed in 5× sample buffer (0.3 m Tris-HCl, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 5% mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. 7.5 × 105 cell equivalents per lane (∼60 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed using a rapid immunodetection method for Immobilon-P (Millipore TN051). Briefly, the membranes were equilibrated in methanol and air-dried. The dry membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-O-GlcNAc antibody CTD110.6 (54Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal.

The membrane was then incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Calbiochem) in 1% casein/phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h. After further washing in phosphate-buffered saline the immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce). For Rac and Ras immunoblots, the affinity purified products from the Rac- and Ras-GTP assays and the total input lysates (see below) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and then immunoblotted with Rac1- and Ras-specific antibodies (Upstate) according to the antibody manufacturer's directions. The immunoblots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. The activities of p38, p44/42, MKK3/6, and MEK1/2 were assessed by phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). 2 × 106 PMNs were treated as indicated and then directly lysed in 5× sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. 7.5 × 105 cell equivalents per lane (∼60 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P. Immunoblotting was performed according to the antibody manufacturer's directions and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Motility Assays—2 × 105 PMNs were pretreated as indicated, washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% bovine serum albumin and then placed in the upper filter plate of a 96-well MultiScreen-MIC chemotaxis plate (Millipore) with 3-μm membrane pores. The lower receiver plate contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 100 μm fMLF where indicated. Basal motility was assessed in the absence of fMLF. The assays were performed in a 37 °C incubator for 45 min. The filter plate was then carefully removed and migrating cells counted by microscopic examination of receiver plates (55Frevert C.W. Wong V.A. Goodman R.B. Goodwin R. Martin T.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 213: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The data were normalized to the mean value of the control to provide a percent of the control value in each experimental set. Rac and Ras Activity Assays—Rac and Ras activities were assessed by the affinity capture of Rac- and Ras-GTP (56Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

The lysates were cleared of insoluble debris by spinning at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. ∼30 μgof the resulting supernatant was mixed with 5× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then set aside for determination of total (input) Rac or Ras by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. The remainder of each supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of an agarose conjugate of either PAK-1 PBD or Raf-1 RBD (Upstate), for Rac- and Ras-GTP assays, respectively, for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1× Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer and finally resuspended in 2× sample buffer and boiled. The resulting affinity purified products, active Rac or Ras, were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as described above. GTPγS- and GDP-loaded positive and negative controls, respectively, were prepared as described above, except that before the addition of beads to the supernatant, the supernatants were first incubated with either 100 μm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP for 30 min at 30 °C with gentle agitation, followed by the addition of 60 mm MgCl2 to stop the loading.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As we have previously shown that GlcNH2 effectively drives protein O-GlcNAcylation in PMNs through a substrate driven, or metabolic, mechanism involving the HBP (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) we assessed whether PUGNAc could serve as an alternative and complementary means of increasing O-GlcNAc levels. Treatment with 100 μm PUGNAc for selected times significantly increased protein-associated O-GlcNAc as determined by immunoblot analyses of whole cell extracts with the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 (Fig. 1A). A variety of proteins with molecular masses above ∼50 kDa displayed increased O-GlcNAc levels that were proportional to the duration of PUGNAc treatment, beginning within 30 min and increasing to maximal levels of O-GlcNAcylation by 2 h. Interestingly, the pattern of O-GlcNAcylation was grossly similar to that induced by GlcNH2 (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There were no changes to cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, at any of the time points examined (data not shown). These results suggest a rapid rate of intrinsic O-GlcNAc cycling, providing further evidence of the highly dynamic nature of this post-translational modification in PMNs, and indicated that at least some of the same proteins may be O-GlcNAcylated in response to both GlcNH2 and PUGNAc treatments. Furthermore, they indicate that PUGNAc can serve as an effective tool for rapidly inducing increases in O-GlcNAc, and should be useful therefore for furthering our investigation of O-GlcNAc-associated changes in PMN motility. As mentioned above, we have previously found that GlcNH2 pretreatment increases basal (in the absence of chemoattractant) and fMLP-induced PMN migration in Boyden chamber-type assays and such increases correlate with increases in protein O-GlcNAc (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Having established that PUGNAc increases O-GlcNAc levels, we sought to test whether PUGNAc similarly increases PMN migration. Cells were pretreated with 100 μm PUGNAc for various durations and were then assayed for cell migration using simple 45-min Boyden chamber-type assays. PUGNAc increased basal cell motility (in the absence of chemoattractant) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Changes in basal motility were significant (p < 0.05) at 90 and 180 min of pretreatment. In assays of fMLP-associated chemotaxis (100 nm fMLP), 100 μm PUGNAc pretreatments of 90, 120, and 180 min were associated with significant increases (over the levels induced by fMLP without pretreatment, p < 0.05 where n ≥ 6 for all conditions), of 17, 26, and 42%, respectively, in cell migration (Fig. 1C). Thus the effects of PUGNAc treatment are grossly similar in terms of basal motility and chemotaxis to the aforementioned results obtained using GlcNH2 (18Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45759-45765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The finding that two unrelated mechanisms of inducing protein O-GlcNAc similarly enhance motility strongly suggests that O-GlcNAc modulates neutrophil physiology.

https://openalex.org/W2005283529,"The N-terminal domain (NTD) of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptors plays an important role in controlling subtype specific receptor assembly. To identify NTD subdomains involved in this process we generated AMPA glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3) mutants having intra-NTD substitutions with the corresponding regions of the kainate receptor GluR6 and tested their ability to form functional heteromers with wild-type subunits. The chimeric design was based on the homology of the NTD to the NTD of the metabotropic GluR1, shown to form two globular lobes and to assemble in dimers. Accordingly, the NTD was divided into four regions, termed here N1–N4, of which N1 and N3 correspond to the regions forming lobe-1 and N2 and N4 to those forming lobe-2. Substituting N1 or N3 impaired functional heteromerization but allowed protein-protein interactions. Conversely, exchanging N2 or N4 preserved functional heteromerization, although it significantly decreased homomeric activity, indicating a role in subunit folding. Moreover, a deletion in GluR3 corresponding to the hotfoot mouse mutation of the glutamate receptor δ2, covering part of N2, N3, and N4, impaired both homomeric and heteromeric oligomerization, thus explaining the null-like mouse phenotype. Finally, computer modeling suggested that the dimer interface, largely formed by N1, is highly hydrophobic in GluR3, whereas in GluR6 it contains electrostatic interactions, hence offering an explanation for the subtype assembly specificity conferred by this region. N3, however, is positioned perpendicular to the dimer interface and therefore may be involved in secondary interactions between dimers in the assembled tetrameric receptor.

Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, activates two receptor families: metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate; iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; NTD, N-terminal domain; LIVBP, leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; DTT, dithiothreitol; DN, dominant negative; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid.1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate; iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; NTD, N-terminal domain; LIVBP, leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; DTT, dithiothreitol; DN, dominant negative; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. which are coupled to G-proteins, and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which form cation selective ion channels. The iGluRs are further divided into three subtypes: AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors, originally named after their most selective agonist (1Watkins J.C. Evans R.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1981; 21: 165-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Each subtype, in turn, consists of several subunits that assemble as tetramers in various combinations to form channels with distinct properties (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Of the cloned subunits, GluR1–4 form the AMPA receptors, GluR5–7 and KA1–2 form the kainate receptors, and NR1, NR2A-D, and NR3A-B form the NMDA receptors. The δ1–2 subunits constitute an orphan group of iGluRs, and their relation to the three principal subtypes is unclear. Overall, all iGluR subunits have a common domain organization (3Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains four membrane regions (M1–M4), of which M1, M3, and M4 traverse the plasma membrane and M2 is a reentrant loop aligning the channel pore. The N terminus is extracellular and comprises an ∼400-residue N-terminal domain (NTD; also termed “X domain”), which is homologous to bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins and to the N-terminal domain of mGluRs (4O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Following the NTD is S1, an ∼150-residue segment, which together with S2, the segment between M3 and M4, forms the glutamate-binding domain (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The S1S2 domain, like the NTD, is related to bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins (4O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 6Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G-Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The C terminus is intracellular and is involved in receptor trafficking, anchoring, and signal transduction (7Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Despite this common subunit organization and substantial sequence similarities, especially between AMPA and kainate receptor subunits, hetero-oligomers form exclusively within subtypes (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study using AMPA/kainate chimeras, we showed that the NTD, the membrane sector and part of S2 determine the subunit compatibility in the assembly process (8Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, our data fit a model in which iGluRs assemble as dimer-of-dimers in a two-step basic process: 1) two monomers associate at their NTDs to form dimers; and 2) two dimers undergo a secondary dimerization at the glutamate-binding domains and at the membrane domains to form the tetramer, which is then stabilized by secondary NTD interactions. The notion that NTD compatibility is also required in the second step emerged from the observation that heteromerization was abolished between chimeras having incompatible NTDs, whereas the rest of their polypeptides were compatible (8Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). If the NTDs were playing a role only in the first step of monomer dimerization, the two different resulting homodimers could then co-assemble via their compatible C termini. These secondary NTD interactions likely take place after the interaction of the downstream regions, because when expressed as a soluble protein detached from the rest of the subunit, the NTD has been shown to form only dimers (9Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Wells G.B. Lin L. Jeanclos E.M. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, the NTD seems to serve as a subtype compatibility gatekeeper throughout the assembly process. Interestingly, Pasternack et al. (11Pasternack A. Coleman S.K. Jouppila A. Mottershead D.G. Lindfors M. Pasternack M. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49662-49667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed recently that AMPA receptor GluR4 subunits lacking their NTD are able to form functional homomeric receptors, and yet, the ability to form heteromers was not tested. Given the important role that the NTD plays in iGluR restricted assembly, we further examined the contributions of NTD subdomains to this process. Employing electrophysiological experiments on Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing AMPA/kainate chimeras confined to the NTD, we found that compatibility in two regions is required for functional assembly. Computer modeling based on the solved crystal structure of the mGluR1-NTD (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) further suggests that one of these regions may comprise the initial dimerization interface, and the other may be attributed to a second interface formed between two dimers in the assembled tetramer. Molecular Biology and in Vitro cRNA Transcription—All AMPA receptor constructs used here contained the flip isoform. Generation of R3(R6S1) and R6TM1R3 (termed herein N(3333) and N(6666), respectively) was described previously (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Intra-NTD GluR3/GluR6 chimeras were constructed by a similar approach and subcloned in R3(R6S1) between XmaI and NruI sites. For each construct, the amino acids at the appropriate junction are indicated in Fig. 1 and are numbered relative to the first methionine in the open reading frame. GluR3 point mutations were constructed by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing throughout the cassette insert. All constructs were inserted in pGEMHE, which was used for expression in Xenopus oocytes. Plasmids were linearized with NheI, and capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX). GluR2(M599R) in pRK5 and GluR6(M589R) in pCDNA3 (termed here GluR2DN and GluR6DN, respectively) were a gift from James R. Howe (Yale University) (13Robert A. Hyde R. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cRNAs were obtained by plasmid linearization with HindIII (GluR2DN) and XbaI (GluR6DN) followed by transcription using SP6 and T7 polymerase, respectively. The yield and quality of transcripts were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and recently also quantified by analytical UV spectroscopy (ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, Inc. Rockland, DE). Preparation of Oocytes and Electrophysiology—Stage V-VI X. laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected up to 24 h after preparation, usually with 10–20 ng of cRNA in 50 nl/oocyte (unless stated), and assayed 3 days later. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature using GeneClamp500 connected to DIGIDATA1200 and pCLAMP8 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of ∼1 megohm. Oocytes were continuously perfused with recording solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm MgCl2 to minimize the activation of the endogenous Ca2+-gated Cl– channels. Where indicated, to avoid interference from receptor desensitization, oocytes were treated with cyclothiazide (0.1 mm, mixed in the glutamate solution; RBI, Natick, MA). Current/voltage (I/V) relationships were obtained by applying 1-s voltage ramps (–70 to +40 mV) on plateau responses to 1 mm glutamate. Measurements in the presence of glutamate were subtracted from the average values obtained before and after glutamate application and normalized to the value obtained at –70 mV. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP8 and ORIGIN 6.0 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Whole-cell currents measured at –70 mV were typically 3–5 μA for the control subunits R3(R6S1) and wild-type GluR3. Cell Surface Labeling, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Determination of Subunit Protein Ratios Using Western Blot Analysis—Cell surface labeling of proteins with biotin, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Prestained protein standards were usually from Fermentas (PageRuler; Burlington, Canada), and those shown in Fig. 6 were from Invitrogen. Primary antibodies (directed to the subunit C terminus) and their respective working dilutions were: rabbit anti-rat GluR1, 1:1000; anti-rat GluR2/3, 1:2000 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); and anti-rat GluR6/7, 1:2000 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The protein ratio between co-expressed subunits was determined by densitometry analysis using ImageJ version 1.30 software on scanned autoradiograms. Specific activity was calculated by dividing whole-cell current by whole-cell protein and normalizing to the values obtained for R3(R6S1) or wild-type GluR3 as indicated. For co-immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of GluR1 antibody was incubated with 25 μl (volume of packed resin) of protein A-agarose (Oncogene, La Jolla, CA) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times and mixed overnight with 200 μl of 1.5% Triton X-100 homogenates prepared from 10 oocytes as described previously (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged briefly, and the unbound fraction was removed. The resin was washed three times in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then boiled (3 min) in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation, separated on 8% gels, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Computer Modeling of GluR3-NTD and GluR6-NTD Dimers—Models of GluR3-NTD and GluR6-NTD homodimers were generated using Modeler (DS Modeling, Accelrys, Inc.) based on the structure of mGluR1-NTD in complex with glutamate (Protein Data Bank code 1EWK). The structure of mGluR1 was chosen as a template for the model building because running the sequences of GluR3-NTD and GluR6-NTD on several threading servers (such as SAM_T02 (14Karplus K. Karchin R. Barrett C. Tu S. Cline M. Diekhans M. Grate L. Casper J. Hughey R. Proteins. 2001; 45: 86-91Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Karplus K. Karchin R. Draper J. Casper J. Mandel-Gutfreund Y.

Rychlewski L. Sternberg M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 209-217Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and mGenTHREADER (19McGuffin L.J. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 20Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar)) indicated the mGluR1 structures as good candidates for serving as a template for GluR3-NTD and GluR6-NTD model building. The alignment was done using the procedure Align 2D of Modeler, giving identity values of 8.3 and 10% and similarity values of 21.8 and 26.8% for mGluR1 with GluR3-NTD and mGluR1 with GluR6-NTD, respectively. Model building was followed by energy minimization using CHARMm (DS Modeling, Accelrys, Inc.), choosing charmm22 as a force field. Comparing the structures of GluR3-NTD and GluR6-NTD models with the template used (Protein Data Bank code 1EWK) gives root-mean-square deviation values of 1.39 and 1.44 Å using the Cα atoms of 732 and 738 residues, respectively. The fraction of charged residues buried in the model was 22% for GluR3-NTD and 19% for GluR6-NTD, values similar to mGluR1-NTD (23%). In addition, all of the putative glycosylation sites (Fig. 1, triangles; Fig. 5, black Corey Pauling Koltun (CPK) presentation) mapped to the surface of the structure in both models. Although the S1S2 glutamate-binding domain, like the mGluR1-NTD, folds in a bi-lobed structure and associates primarily in dimers (3Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Mayer M.L. Armstrong N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the threading server searches did not identify any of the S1S2 structures available as potential templates for GluR3/GluR6 NTDs. Superimposition of the predicted GluR3-NTD structure with the structure of the GluR2 S1S2 domain, either in complex with glutamate or in its apo state (Protein Data Bank codes 1FTJ and 1FTO, respectively), by exploring similar fragments using the Swiss-PdbViewer (22Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9502) Google Scholar) showed only weak structural resemblance, mostly in lobe-2 (root-mean-square deviation > 5 Å). GluR3/GluR6 Intra-NTD Chimeric Design—Applying the approach taken in our previous study (8Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) we further investigated the contribution of the NTD to subtype-specific assembly by generating chimeras containing AMPA(GluR3) and kainate-(GluR6) substitutions confined to the NTD and tested their ability to assemble with wild-type subunits. The chimeric design was based on the weak but nonetheless significant homology of the NTD of the iGluRs to the NTD of the mGluRs, exemplified by mGluR1 (4O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and to bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins, specifically the leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein (LIVBP) (4O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Both the LIVBP and mGluR1-NTD fold into a structure containing two lobes, where each lobe is formed by two alternating regions of the primary amino acid sequence (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 23Saper M. Quiocho F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike LIVBP, the mGluR1-NTD assembles in dimers (at the level of lobe-1), a feature that fits with the proposed predominant dimeric organization of the iGluR-NTD (9Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Wells G.B. Lin L. Jeanclos E.M. Anand R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and therefore was chosen as the primary alignment template. Nonetheless, the structure of the S1S2 glutamate-binding domain was also considered, because, like the mGluR1-NTD (which is the glutamate-binding domain in mGluRs), S1S2 folds in a bi-lobed structure, also formed by alternating regions, and it associates primarily in dimers (3Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Mayer M.L. Armstrong N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, the S1S2 and the mGluR1-NTD modes of dimerization are different. In mGluRs the dimer interface is formed only by the N-terminal part of lobe-1 (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), whereas in S1S2 it involves both parts (25Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, all of the S1S2 structures currently available gave very poor fit compared with the mGluR1 structure (see “Experimental Procedures”), and therefore were excluded. It is also noteworthy that although the function of the NTD as a substance-binding domain in AMPA and kainate receptors is unclear, in NMDA receptors it has been shown to bind various allosteric modulators (26Paoletti P.

A. 2000; 97: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in a region corresponding to the glutamate-binding cleft in mGluR1. Taking all the above considerations into account, we divided the NTD into four parts, termed here N1–N4, according to its alignment with mGluR1-NTD (Fig. 1). N1 and N3 correspond to the regions forming the predicted lobe-1 and N2 and N4 to those forming lobe-2 (Figs. 1, 2A, and 5). N1, N2, and N3 each comprise approximately one-third of the NTD sequence, whereas N4 is only ∼15 residues long and may function only as a connector between the NTD and S1. For practical reasons (see “Experimental Procedures”) these substitutions were made on the backbone of R3(R6S1), a GluR3 subunit having S1 from GluR6. This subunit is identical to GluR3 except for an increased affinity to some agonists (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and a complete loss of receptor desensitization (29Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The terminology used to describe the resulting intra-NTD chimeras is N(XXXX), where X stands for either “3” or “6,” representing a GluR3 or a GluR6 sequence in the corresponding N1–N4 regions. For example, a NTD chimera having N1 from GluR3 and N2, N3, and N4 from GluR6 is termed N(3666). The template, R3(R6S1), is therefore termed N(3333) throughout this article, and its NTD reciprocal chimera, having the entire NTD from GluR6 (originally named R6TM1R3 (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)), is termed N(6666). GluR3/GluR6 Substitutions Confined to the NTD Reduce Homomeric Activity—First, to evaluate the functionality of the different chimeras, X. laevis oocytes were injected with the respective cRNA (∼10 ng/oocyte), and 3 days later whole-cell recordings were made. Except for N(3336), the homomeric activity of the various chimeras was markedly lower (Fig. 2B, left panel). Two additional chimeras made at the N1-N2 junction (Fig. 1, A1 and A2) produced nonfunctional subunits (not shown). For all chimeras, under these expression conditions total subunit protein, as well as cell surface expression (as measured by labeling intact oocytes with biotin followed by Western blot analysis), was comparable with N(3333) (not shown). This result may exclude severe problems in subunit assembly/folding and/or trafficking, suggesting rather that only the receptor functional properties (such as agonist binding or channel biophysical parameters) are altered. However, it may also be that minor problems in subunit assembly, which would impair receptor function, may escape the oocyte quality control system, especially at high expression levels. To further test this issue, we then injected oocytes with consecutive dilutions of cRNA of selected intra-NTD chimeras as well as N(3333) and N(6666), which served as controls. As shown in Fig. 2C, both the whole-cell current activity and the protein surface expression of N(3333) and N(6666) gradually decreased with decreasing cRNA concentrations. However, the activity as well as surface expression of N(3366), N(6333), and N(3633), but not total protein expression, was dramatically affected compared with the control subunits. Although at high concentrations (>5 ng/oocytes) surface expression was similar (or slightly lower) compared with N(3333), at low concentrations (<1.5 ng/oocytes) only a small fraction of surface protein was detected (Fig. 2C, middle panels). Finally, we also measured glutamate EC50 values, which were all found to be similar (N(3333) = 46 ± 5 μm; N(3366) = 62 ± 4 μm; N(6333) = 42 ± 5 μm; N(3633) = 80 ± 4 μm; n = 5), thus excluding problems in agonist recognition as the cause of reduction in homomeric activity. Altogether, based on these results we may conclude that the observed lower homomeric activity is probably due to problems in subunit assembly/folding or trafficking rather than a direct effect of receptor-channel properties. Functional Heteromerization of NTD Chimeras With GluR2R Requires Compatibility in the N1 and N3 Regions—Functional heteromerization was determined by the current rectification assay as was done in our previous work (8Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, in AMPA receptors, current rectification and single channel conductance are inversely controlled by a single amino acid located in M2, which as a result of RNA editing can be either a glutamine (Q) or an arginine (R) (30Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The unedited Q-form exhibits high conductance and strong inward current rectification, which is due to an intracellular block by polyamines. In contrast, the edited R-form (in nature only GluR2) exhibits very low conductance and lack of sensitivity to polyamines, thus generating a linear current/voltage (I/V) relationship. Heteromers made of R- and Q-form subunits are highly conducting and exhibit a clear linear I/V relationship. Because of its low single channel conductance, the activity of homomeric GluR2 R-form (GluR2R) is hardly detectable (<10 nA), and thus a linear I/V relationship obtained for a Q-form chimera co-expressed with GluR2R is an indication of functional heteromerization. As shown previously (8Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) when N(3333) was expressed with GluR2R at 1:1 ratio (∼20 ng of total cRNA/oocyte) we observed large macroscopic currents with a linear I/V relationship, reflecting the predominant heteromeric formation between these two subunits (Fig. 2, B, right, and D). At similar expression conditions, Q-form chimeras having either N1 or N3 from GluR6 exhibited strong inward current rectification in the presence of GluR2R, indicating that compatibility in each one of these regions is required for subtype-specific functional assembly. Conversely, chimeras N(3633) and N(3336), in which N2 or N4 where exchanged, did undergo linearization, indicating their ability to functionally heteromerize with GluR2R. In all cases the presence of GluR2R and its ratio to the chimeric subunit were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D, inserts). Substitution of Either N1 or N3 Results in Partial Protein-Protein Interactions—The apparent lack of functional heteromerization when either N1 or N3 was substituted could result from a complete lack of interaction between the chimera and GluR2R or from partial interactions that were not sufficient to generate functional channels. To test this issue, we first coexpressed the intra-"

To characterize the signaling pathway mediated by ASC, we established cell lines in which muramyl dipeptide, the bacterial component recognized by another Apaf-1-like molecule, Nod2, induced an interaction between a CARD12-Nod2 chimeric protein and ASC, and elicited cell autonomous NF-κB activation. This response required caspase-8, and was suppressed by CLARP/FLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8. The catalytic activity of caspase-8 was required for the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation when caspase-8 was expressed at an endogenous level, although it was not essential when caspase-8 was overexpressed. In contrast, FADD, the adaptor protein linking Fas and caspase-8, was not required for this response. Consistently, ASC recruited caspase-8 and CLARP but not FADD and Nod2 to its speck-like aggregates in cells. Finally, muramyl dipeptide induced interleukin-8 production in MAIL8 cells. These results are the first to indicate that caspase-8 plays an important role in the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation, and that the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation actually induces physiologically relevant gene expression.

Animals and plants have several types of so-called pattern recognition receptors that recognize characteristic molecular structures of microorganisms (pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; LRRs, leucine-rich repeats; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; PYD, pyrin-like domain; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FMF, familial Mediterranean fever; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; HEK, human embryonic kidney.1The abbreviations used are: PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; LRRs, leucine-rich repeats; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; PYD, pyrin-like domain; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FMF, familial Mediterranean fever; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; mAb, monoclonal antibody; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; HEK, human embryonic kidney.) and activate innate immune responses. In mammals, Toll-like receptors, homologs of Drosophila's Toll, recognize PAMPs using their extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and play an important role in innate immunity (1Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4655) Google Scholar). Recently, another class of mammalian PAMPs receptors, homologous to Apaf-1 and plant disease resistance-related NB-LRR proteins, has emerged (2Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). More than 20 genes encoding Apaf-1-like molecules that have a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) with homology to Apaf-1 and C-terminal LRRs have been discovered in the human genome. Many of them have a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) or a pyrin-like domain (PYD) at the N-terminal. Among mammalian Apaf-1-like molecules, Nod1 and Nod2 were found to recognize partial structures of bacterial peptidoglycan, namely γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), respectively, using their C-terminal LRRs, and to activate NF-κB and caspase-9 through their N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (3Chamaillard M.

A recent report that CARD12-deficient macrophages do not produce mature IL-1β upon Salmonella typhimurium infection supports this notion (11Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M.

Because truncation of the C-terminal LRRs enhances the activity of Apaf-1-like molecules, it has been postulated that the LRRs have a negative regulatory function, and that ligand binding to this region relieves the suppression (6Manji G.A.

ASC (also called TMS1) is a 21.5-kDa cytosolic protein consisting of a PYD and a CARD, and was originally identified as (a) a protein that generates speck-like aggregations in apoptotic HL-60 cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents (15Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and (b) a gene product whose expression is suppressed in human breast cancers by methylation-induced gene silencing (16Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ASC has been implicated in apoptosis and tumor suppression. PYD and CARD domains belong to the death domain-fold domains that are involved in homophilic protein-protein interactions. In this context, ASC resembles FADD and RAIDD, adaptor proteins involved in the signal transduction of death receptors. In fact, ASC mediates the recruitment of caspase-1 to several PYD-containing members of the Apaf-1-like family (also called the NALP or PYPAF family), and induces caspase-1-mediated IL-1β maturation (6Manji G.A.

In addition, CARD12, another Apaf-1-like molecule, requires ASC to induce apoptosis and NF-κB activation, although CARD12 induces caspase-1-mediated IL-1β processing through direct interaction with caspase-1 in the absence of ASC (7Srinivasula S.M.

Apoptosis induced by the expression of CARD12 plus ASC or by forced oligomerization of ASC is mediated by caspase-8 (17Masumoto J. Dowds T.A. Schaner P. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Li M. Zhu L. Katsuyama T.

In contrast, it was recently reported that the tumor suppressor p53 induces ASC expression, and ASC promotes the translocation of Bax to mitochondria and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis (18Ohtsuka T.

Thus, ASC may activate different apoptotic signaling pathways in different contexts. On the other hand, the molecules that link ASC to the NF-κB activation pathway have not been described. In this study, we established an experimental system in which MDP induced NF-κB activation causing IL-8 production in cells expressing a CARD12-Nod2 chimeric protein and ASC. Using this system, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of ASC-mediated NF-κB activation. Reagents—MDP was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant TNF-α was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA).

Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA)—The FADD- or caspase-8-targeting siRNAs were described previously (21Imamura R. Konaka K. Matsumoto N. Hasegawa M. Fukui M. Mukaida N. Kinoshita T. Suda T. J. Biol.

RICK-targeting siRNA (sense, 5′-GAUCCAGAGCAAAAGGGAAGACAUUAG-3′; antisense, 5′-AAUGUCUUCCCUUUUGCUCUGGAUCAU-3′) was custom-synthesized (iGENE, Tsukuba, Japan). HEK293 or MAIL8 cells were transfected with double-stranded siRNA using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, cells were transfected with plasmids using linear polyethyleneimine 12 h later. Forty-eight hours after the initial transfection, the cells were subjected to various assays. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 3% fetal calf serum, phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with anti-ASC mAb followed by Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), anti-caspase-8 mAb (MBL) followed by Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG2b, and/or anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG. The stained cells were examined under an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100M with Plan-Neofluor ×40/0.75 Ph2 objective; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an LSM510 laser-scanning module and 488 nm argon, 543 nm HeNe, and 633 nm HeNe lasers, and the images were acquired and analyzed using LSM510 software version 3.2 in multitrack mode. Establishment of an Experimental System in Which MDP Induces NF-κB Activation through a CARD12-Nod2 Chimeric Protein and ASC—As reported previously (17Masumoto J. Dowds T.A. Schaner P. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Li M. Zhu L. Katsuyama T. Sagara J. Taniguchi S. Gumucio D.L. Nunez G. Inohara N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), transient expression of CARD12 together with ASC induced NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells, and deletion of the LRRs from CARD12 (CARD12Δ) enhanced this activity (Fig. 1A). To investigate the function of CARD12 and ASC under more physiological conditions, we generated a cDNA encoding a chimeric molecule (C12N2) consisting of the CARD from CARD12 and the NOD and LRRs from Nod2 protein. MDP induced potent NF-κB activity in HEK293 or human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells that transiently expressed C12N2 in combination with ASC (Fig. 1B). In contrast, MDP did not induce significant NF-κB activation in cells expressing C12N2 or ASC alone. We next established stable cell lines (MAIL8) expressing FLAG-tagged C12N2 and ASC (Fig. 1, C and D) that were derived from HEK293 cells that had been stably transfected with an NF-κB-responsive GFP-expressing construct. The expression level of ASC in MAIL8 cells was comparable with the endogenous ASC expression levels in the monocytic THP-1 and promyelocytic HL-60 cell lines. MAIL8 cell lines expressed GFP upon MDP stimulation (Fig. 1E). Consistent with this, MDP-induced nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity in MAIL8 cells, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1F). The detected NF-κB complex contained the p65 subunit, as revealed by a supershift assay using an anti-p65 mAb. Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα inhibited the MDP-induced NF-κB activation in MAIL8 cells (Fig. 1G). To investigate whether MDP induces an interaction between C12N2 and ASC, we performed an immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1H). ASC was coprecipitated with FLAG-C12N2 upon stimulation with MDP. Furthermore, FLAG-C12N2 and ASC formed speck-like aggregates upon MDP treatment (see Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). The results suggest that MDP induced an interaction between C12N2 and ASC that led to proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα or its homolog and nuclear translocation of the active NF-κB complex containing the p65 subunit in MAIL8 cells. ASC-mediated NF-κB Activation Is Cell Autonomous—The NF-κB activation induced by the transient expression of CARD12Δ + ASC could be direct (cell autonomous) or indirect (dependent on the production of some paracrine factor). To distinguish between these possibilities, we investigated whether we could detect NF-κB activity when we cocultured HEK293 cells transfected with expression plasmids for CARD12Δ and ASC and HEK293 cells transfected with an NF-κB-responsive luciferase gene construct (NF-κB-Luc) (Fig. 2A). When the same cells were transfected with the CARD12Δ, ASC, and the reporter gene, NF-κB activity was detected. However, when the reporter gene and the mixture of CARD12Δ and ASC genes were introduced into cells separately, no NF-κB activation was observed. Thus, the NF-κB activation induced by CARD12Δ + ASC was cell autonomous. Similarly, MDP induced only weak NF-κB activation when MAIL8 cells transfected with an empty vector and HEK293 cells transfected with an NF-κB reporter construct were cocultured. In contrast, MDP induced potent NF-κB activation when the HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector and the MAIL8 cells were transfected with the NF-κB reporter construct (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the MDP-induced NF-κB activation in MAIL8 cells was a mainly cell-autonomous response, although upon MDP stimulation, MAIL8 cells produced some paracrine factor(s) that could induce significant NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells. Caspase 8 Is Involved in the ASC-mediated NF-κB Activation—Others and we recently found that caspase-8 plays an essential role not only in apoptosis but also in the NF-κB activation induced by Fas ligand (21Imamura R.

Another recent finding indicated that caspase-8 interacts with ASC and is involved in the ASC-induced apoptosis (17Masumoto J. Dowds T.A. Schaner P. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Li M. Zhu L. Katsuyama T. Sagara J. Taniguchi S. Gumucio D.L. Nunez G. Inohara N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to investigate whether caspase-8 is involved in the ASC-induced NF-κB activation. On the other hand, Nod2-induced NF-κB activation is mediated by RICK (14Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 26Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of caspase-8- and RICK-targeting siRNAs on CARD12Δ + ASC- and Nod2-induced NF-κB activation. These siRNAs specifically inhibited casapse-8 and RICK expression, respectively (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the caspase-8 targeting siRNA suppressed the expression level of endogenous caspase-8 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the caspase-8 targeting siRNA inhibited the CARD12Δ + ASC-induced but not the Nod2-induced NF-κB activation, whereas the RICK-targeting siRNA did the opposite (Fig. 3C). The caspase-8 targeting siRNA also inhibited the NF-κB activation induced with MDP but not TNF-α in MAIL8 cells (Fig. 3D). To further confirm the requirement for caspase-8 in ASC-mediated NF-κB activation, we used a subline (293-K) of the HEK293 cell line, which expressed caspase-8 at a level at least 10 times lower than HEK293 cells based on Western blot analyses (Ref. 23Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, and Fig. 3E and data not shown). Importantly, the 293-K cells did not show NF-κB activation upon CARD12Δ + ASC expression, but they did activate it in response to Nod2 expression (Fig. 3F). When exogenous caspase-8 was expressed in 293-K cells, they became responsive to CARD12Δ + ASC expression. These results indicate that caspase-8 is required for the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation. MDP-induced NF-κB Activation in MAIL8 Cells Requires the Catalytic Activity of Caspase-8 —We next investigated whether the catalytic activity of caspase-8 is required for the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD as well as a caspase-8-specific inhibitor, Z-IETD, inhibited the NF-κB activation induced by CARD12Δ + ASC but not Nod2, whereas a granzyme B inhibitor Z-AAD inhibited neither of these responses (Fig. 4A). Z-VAD completely inhibited the MDP- but not TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in MAIL8 cells (Fig. 4B). To further investigate the role of caspase activity in the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation, we tested whether a catalytically inactive mutant of caspase-8 (C377S) could complement the responsiveness of 293-K cells to CARD12Δ + ASC. Surprisingly, both the wild-type and mutant caspase-8 complemented the CARD12Δ + ASC-induced NF-κB activation in 293-K cells (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, Z-VAD did not inhibit the NF-κB activation in this system (Fig. 4D). Because caspase-8 might be overexpressed by transient transfection, we then generated stable transfectants constitutively expressing the wild-type or mutant caspase-8 (Fig. 4E). The wild-type caspase-8 at levels close to normal restored the CARD12Δ + ASC-induced NF-κB activation in 293-K cells. In contrast, stable transfectants expressing caspase-8 (C377S) at normal levels exhibited no or weak NF-κB activation upon CARD12Δ + ASC expression. There was a trend that cells expressing higher levels of the mutant caspase-8 showed significant NF-κB activation in response to CARD12Δ + ASC expression, but there was no such trend in the Nod2-induced response. Consistent results were obtained when these stable transfectants were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for C12N2 and ASC and then stimulated with MDP (see Supplemental Materials Fig. S2A). As expected, Z-VAD inhibited the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation in 293-K stable transfectants expressing the wild-type caspase-8 but not the weak NF-κB activation observed in cells expressing the mutant caspase-8. (see Supplemental Materials Fig. S2, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that the catalytic activity of caspase-8 is essential for the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation when the expression of caspase-8 is at the endogenous level in MAIL8 cells, but is dispensable when caspase-8 is overexpressed. FADD Is Not Required for the ASC-induced NF-κB Activation—Because FADD plays an important role in Fas-mediated NF-κB activation (21Imamura R. Konaka K. Matsumoto N. Hasegawa M. Fukui M. Mukaida N.

https://openalex.org/W2099442305,"T-cadherin (T-cad) is an atypical GPI-anchored member of the cadherin superfamily. Ligation of T-cad receptors on endothelial cells prevents cell spreading, promotes elongation and polarization, decreases adhesion to the matrix, and facilitates migration. This study investigates involvement of Rho GTPases in T-cad signaling. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing dominant-negative and/or constitutively active mutants of RhoA (N19RhoA/RhoA63), ROCK (RB/PH(TT)/CAT), and Rac1 (N17RAC). Mutant-infected and empty vector-infected cells were compared with respect to their ability to detach and polarize when plated on substratum containing recombinant T-cad protein used as a ligand mimicking homophilic T-cad interactions. ROCK involvement was also studied using specific inhibitor Y-27632. Adhesion assays, analysis of cell phenotype, and actin cytoskeleton organization using TRITC-labeled phalloidin demonstrated that T-cad-induced cell polarization includes two complementary components: RhoA/ROCK pathway is necessary for cell contraction, stress fiber assembly, and inhibition of spreading, whereas Rac is required for formation of actin-rich lamellipodia at the leading edges of polarized cells. Individual repression of either pathway only partially prevented cell polarization and detachment, while simultaneous repression of RhoA and Rac pathways fully eliminated responses to homophilic T-cad ligation. In conclusion, these data suggest that T-cad induces cell deadhesion and polarization via RhoA-ROCK- and Rac-dependent mechanisms."

Bacterial and archaeal cells have Hint homologs annotated in a variety of ways, but the enzymes have not been characterized, nor have phenotypes been described due to loss of enzymatic activity. We developed a quantitative 31P NMR assay to determine whether Escherichia coli possesses an adenosine phosphoramidase activity. Indeed, soluble lysates prepared from wild-type laboratory E. coli exhibited activity on the model substrate adenosine 5′-monophosphoramidate (AMP-NH2). The E. coli Hint homolog, which had been comprehensively designated ycfF and is here named hinT, was cloned, overexpressed, purified, and characterized with respect to purine nucleoside phosphoramidate substrates. Bacterial hinT was several times more active than human or rabbit Hint1 on five model substrates. In addition, bacterial and mammalian enzymes preferred guanosine versus adenosine phosphoramidates as substrates. Analysis of the lysates from a constructed hinT knock-out strain of E. coli demonstrated that all of the cellular purine nucleoside phosphoramidase activity is due to hinT. Physiological analysis of this mutant revealed that the loss of hinT results in failure to grow in media containing 0.75 m KCl, 0.9 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOAc, or 10 mm MnCl2.

Consequently, in addition to gaining an understanding of their natural function, the study of Hint hydrolases may facilitate the design of tissue- and species-specific pronucleotides of potential therapeutic utility.In this study, we developed a simple 31P NMR assay capable of detecting total phosphoramidase activity in cell lysates. We scanned the Escherichia coli genome (27Brenner C. Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Huebner K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for a Hint homolog and discovered an open reading frame designated ycfF at the 16-min position (161090–1161467) on the E. coli genetic map with 47% amino acid sequence identity to rabbit and human Hint1. Testing the hypothesis that ycfF encodes a E. coli Hint homolog (here named hinT) that is responsible for observed cellular phosphoramidase activity, we cloned, purified, and characterized the activity of hinT in vitro and also constructed a mutant strain in which the hinT gene was disrupted. Supporting the view that the hinT gene is entirely responsible for nucleoside monophosphoramidate hydrolysis, such substrates were completely stable in extracts of E. coli hinT knock-out mutants. Further characterization demonstrated that bacterial hinT is homodimeric and capable of hydrolyzing adenosine and guanosine 5′-phosphoramidate monoesters significantly faster than mammalian Hint (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, evaluation of an E. coli hinT knock-out mutant established a requirement for protein expression when grown on NaCl, KCl, MnCl2, and NaOAc.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEvaluation of Phosphoramidase Activity in E. coli Cell Lysates— AMP-NH2 was used to investigate the phosphoramidase activity in E. coli cell lysates because it was earlier shown to be a specific substrate for rabbit and yeast Hint hydrolases (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphoramidase activity in cell lysates was measured by the 1H-decoupling mode of 31P NMR spectroscopy (Varian VAC-300 spectrometer), which can clearly distinguish the substrate, AMP-NH2, and the product, AMP. NMR spectrometry is suitable for quantitation by integration of the area under the peak, which is proportional to the amount of nuclei present. The relative ratio of peak areas can be used to calculate the amount of turnover based on a standard curve (supplemental data Fig. 1). Chemical shift information is described in Fig. 1 of the supplemental data. Cell lysates from E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI cells (Novagen) were obtained by treatment with lysozyme (1 mg/ml), and the DNA was precipitated by protamine sulfate followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was dialyzed extensively against Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm DTT, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to remove cellular phosphates and nucleotides. Phosphate-free cell lysates (0.75 mg of total protein) were incubated with 5 mm AMP-NH2 in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) at 37 °C for intervals of 15 min, 30 min, and at 22 °C for 12 h. Reactions were terminated by snap-freezing in a dry ice/acetone slush bath and lyophilized for 5 h. Samples were resuspended in NMR buffer (600 μl, 50 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1 mm TMP (internal standard)), and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 5 min. A 31P NMR spectrum was then collected for the supernatant. For the low pH control experiment, 10 mm AMP-NH2 in reaction buffer (500 μl, pH 2.0) was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, and the 31P signal was detected under the same conditions.Genetic Disruption of E. coli hinT—The E. coli hinT gene in strain BW25113 was disrupted as described (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar). Primers 7024 and 7025 (sequences in Supplemental Table I) were used for amplification of the chloramphenicol resistance marker (Cmr) in plasmid pKD3. Stable chloramphenicol-resistant transformants of BW25113 were tested by PCR with primers 7026 and 7027 to confirm correct recombination of the Cmr marker into the hinT locus. A strain that tested positive by PCR was named BB1. Strain BB3 was constructed by removing the antibiotic resistance marker using Red recombinase as described previously (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar).Plasmid Constructions—The hinT gene was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain BW25113 with primers 7328 and 7329. The product of this reaction was cloned into Bluescript SK+ using EcoRI and BamHI sites included in the sequences of the primers. The resulting plasmid was named pB429. Mutagenesis (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) of phagemid DNA with primer 7330 resulted in plasmid pB431 containing hinT with an H101A substitution. Plasmids pB432 and pB433 were obtained by cloning HindIII-EcoRI fragments containing wild-type and H101A mutated alleles of hinT from plasmids pB429 and pB431 into plasmid pACYC184. The expression construct pPH70D contains the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene followed by a thrombin cleavage site and the protein of interest (30Sticha K.R. Sieg C.A. Bergstrom C.P. Hanna P.E. Wagner C.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins are purified with a methotrexate affinity chromatography followed by cleavage with human thrombin to release the native protein. Plasmids were constructed by replacing the NAT2 (hamster polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2) cDNA in pPH70D with the desired open reading frames. After PCR amplification from the chromosomal DNA of the E. coli K12 strain, EMG2, with the primers 101 and 102 containing XhoI and XbaI sites, the product was cloned into the T/A cloning vector, pSTBlue 1 (Novagen). Double digestion of pTFCY-TA followed by subcloning into pPH70D resulted in the plasmid, pTFCF15DmY. The plasmid pJLCF15DmH, containing human HINT1 cDNA was obtained by a similar procedure after PCR amplification with primers 103 and 104 from cDNA prepared from the human T-lymphoblast leukemia cell line, CEM. E. coli hinT-pSAG02 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using primer 105 and 106 to create E. coli hinT-H101A mutant.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The cell growth and cell lysate extraction were described previously except that 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used for induction (30Sticha K.R. Sieg C.A. Bergstrom C.P. Hanna P.E. Wagner C.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Bacterial or human Hint-DHFR fusion proteins were purified by methotrexate-agarose (Sigma) using a 12.5-ml column, washed with 40 column volumes of buffer A, 60 column volumes of buffer A with 1 m NaCl, and followed by folate elution with 5 mm folate, 32 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions (8 ml) were collected at a flow rate 3 ml/min, and an aliquot (10 μl) of each fraction was assayed for protein concentration with the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing more than 0.1 mg/ml protein were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and DHFR activities were determined (31Stone S.R. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5499-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The standard DHFR assay mixture contained 50 μm DHF, 100 μm NADPH, and 1 mm DTT in the assay buffer (50 mm 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, 25 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 25 mm ethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and the enzyme in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of DHF (32Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5499-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fractions containing pure Hint-DHFR fusion proteins were pooled and concentrated to 2 mg/ml, and the buffer was exchanged with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The fusion protein was digested at 4 °C for 19 h with 8 units of human thrombin (Sigma)/mg of protein. To separate Hint hydrolases from DHFR, reaction mixtures were applied onto a 10-ml AMP-agarose affinity column (Sigma) and washed with 16 column volumes of buffer A with 1 m NaCl and 4 column volumes of buffer A and then eluted with adenosine buffer (2 mm adenosine, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm DTT). Fractions (8 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 3 ml/min, and aliquots (10 μl) from each fraction were used to determine the protein concentration. Fractions containing more than 0.1 mg/ml protein were analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing pure Hint protein were pooled and concentrated to 2.6 mg/ml. Rabbit Hint1 and E. coli hinT-H101A were purified by AMP-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (3Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J.

J. 1997; 326: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the exception that expression was carried out in the E. coli hinT disruption mutant (BB1) described in this study.Substrate Specificity—AMP-NH2, AMP-Mor, and GMP-Mor (10 mm) were incubated with human Hint1-DHFR, E. coli hinT-DHFR, human Hint1, rabbit Hint1, and E. coli hinT (2.5 or 10 μg) in the reaction buffer (500 μl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) at 22 °C for intervals of 36 and 66 min. To determine the residual phosphoramidase activity in E. coli hinT-H101A, AMP-NH2 (10 mm) was incubated with E. coli hinT-H101A (1200 and 2700 μg) in the reaction buffer at 22 °C for 14 h. Reactions were quenched by adding 5 m NaOH (20 μl) followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice/acetone slush bath and then lyophilized. AMP-lysine and GMP-lysine (2.5 mm) were incubated with E. coli hinT (0.25 μg) and human Hint1 (0.625 μg) for 20 and 40 min. Reactions were stopped by snap-freezing in a dry ice/acetone slush bath and then lyophilized. Sample preparation for 31P NMR measurement was as described for the cell-lysate experiment except that the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 12 μl 6 m HCl before NMR spectra were collected.Synthesis of AMP-Lysine and GMP-Lysine—AMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-acetyl lysine methyl ester) and GMP-N-ϵ-(N-α-acetyl lysine methyl ester) 5′-phosphoramidates were prepared in a single-step condensation reaction employing the carbodiimide-mediated coupling method of monophosphate to amine with minor modification (34Moffatt J.G. a.K.H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 649-658Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To synthesize AMP-lysine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl (0.24 g, 1.25 mmol) was added to the flask containing AMP (0.15 g, 0.42 mmol), N-α-acetyl-l-lysine methyl ester (0.2 g, 0.84 mmol), and H2O (15 ml, pH ∼7.0, adjusted with triethylamine). The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 60 °C for 7 h. After cooling to room temperature, water was then removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (5:3:0.5, v/v) with 0.5% ammonium hydroxide and subjected to chromatography on a silica gel column. The column was eluted first with the same solvent mixture and followed by increasing the polarity to a solvent mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (5:4:0.5, v/v) with 0.5% ammonium hydroxide. The product was isolated as a white solid (90 mg, yield 39%). 1H NMR (D2O): δ 8.33 (1H, s), 8.05 (1H, s), 5.95 (1H, d), 4.36 (1H, m), 4.20 (1H, m), 3.94 (1H, m), 3.84 (2H, m), 3.51 (3H, s), 2.45 (2H, m), 1.82 (3H, s), 1.40–0.80 (6H, m). 31P NMR (D2O): δ 10.37.

ESI-MS m/z [M+Na]+ 570.17 and [M-H]- 546.2.RESULTSE. coli Cell Lysates Possess Adenosine Phosphoramidase Activity—AMP-NH2 hydrolysis by E. coli cell lysates (pH 7.2, 37 °C) was observable by 31P NMR with a rate of 76.3 (± 20.9) nmol mg-1 min-1 over the course of 30 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Partial conversion of the hydrolysis product, AMP, to Pi, presumably by E. coli phosphatases, could be detected after incubation at 22 °C for 12 h (Fig. 1C). To verify that the formation of AMP was due to an enzymatic process and not chemical hydrolysis, AMP-NH2 was incubated for 12 h under acidic conditions (pH 2.0, 37 °C) for 12 h (Fig. 1D). The pH 2.0 test conditions were chosen due to the reported acid lability of the phosphorous-nitrogen bond (35Song H. Johns R. Griesgraber G.W. Wagner C.R. Zimmerman C.L. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). AMP-NH2 and TMP signals were visible by 31P NMR, with no detectable AMP or Pi, confirming that AMP-NH2 is stable at pH 2.0 for at least 12 h.hinT Is the Only Bacterial Source of Adenosine Phosphoramidase Activity—To determine whether hinT is solely responsible for the observed cellular phosphoramidase activity, a mutant strain, BB1, in which the hinT gene was replaced with the chloramphenicol resistance marker, was constructed. The phosphoramidase activities of the wild-type E. coli BL21 Star strain and the mutant strain lysates were determined (supplemental data, Fig. 3). When using AMP-NH2 as a substrate, the specific activity of BL21 Star wild-type cell lysates was found to be 20.1 (± 7.7) nmol mg-1 min-1 (pH 7.2, 22 °C). However, no AMP formation could be observed with lysates derived from the hinT disruption strain, BB1 (supplemental data, Fig. 3 and Table II). Therefore, we conclude that hinT is fully responsible for the soluble adenosine phosphoramidase activity of E. coli.Nucleoside and Leaving Group Specificity of Bacterial and Mammalian Hint Phosphoramidases—Both E. coli hinT and human Hint1 were purified to homogeneity as DHFR fusion proteins by methotrexate affinity chromatography (see supplemental data, Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2, and 6). Removal of the DHFR affinity handle by thrombin digestion (supplemental data, Fig. 4, lane 7) and AMP affinity chromatography afforded the purified recombinant enzymes (supplemental data, Fig. 4, lanes 3–5). The apparent molecular sizes of recombinant purified E. coli hinT and E. coli hinT-DHFR fusion protein were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex G-75 size exclusion column and strongly indicated, as has been observed for rabbit and human Hint1, the formation of a stable homodimer in solution (supplemental data, Fig. 5) (2Brenner C.

https://openalex.org/W2022339423,"Disturbances of blood flow play an important role in promoting platelet activation and arterial thrombus formation in stenosed, injured, atherosclerotic arteries. To date, glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) has been considered the primary platelet mechanosensory receptor, responding to increased shear with enhanced adhesive and signaling function. We demonstrate here that von Willebrand factor-GPIb interaction is inefficient at inducing platelet activation even when platelets are exposed to very high wall shear stresses (60 dyn/cm2). Rapid platelet activation under flow was only observed under experimental conditions in which transiently adherent platelets were exposed to sudden accelerations in blood flow. Platelet responsiveness to temporal shear gradients was integrin αIIbβ3-dependent and occurred only on a von Willebrand factor substrate, as platelets forming integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive contacts with immobilized fibrinogen were unresponsive to sudden increases in shear. The calcium response induced by temporal shear gradients was distinct from previously identified integrin αIIbβ3 calcium responses in terms of its transient nature, its requirement for platelet co-stimulation by the P2Y1 purinergic ADP receptor, and its dependence on the influx of extracellular calcium. Our studies demonstrate a key role for temporal shear gradients in promoting platelet activation.

Our studies demonstrate a key role for temporal shear gradients in promoting platelet activation. Moreover, they define for the first time the involvement of P2Y receptors in integrin mechanotransduction. The transduction of biomechanical stimuli into biochemical signals is fundamental to the regulation of a broad range of physiological processes, including sensory perception, blood pressure regulation, bone remodeling, and maintenance of muscle mass (1Gillespie P.G. Walker R.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 2Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar, 3Lehoux S. Tedgui A. J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mechanotransduction mechanisms are particularly relevant to the vasculature, where hemodynamic forces generated as a result of blood flow modulate the phenotypic characteristics of vascular (endothelial and smooth muscle cells) and circulating blood cells (platelets and leukocytes). Shear effects on vascular cells are mediated in part by transmembrane extracellular matrix receptors, principally involving integrins. Various members of the β1, β2, and β3 families of integrin receptors have been demonstrated to transduce mechanical signals that are critically linked to the development of atherosclerotic lesions (4Katsumi A. Orr A.W. Tzima E. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12001-12004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).The importance of integrin mechanotransduction in regulating the adhesive function of circulating blood cells has been less clearly defined, although it is important given the key role played by platelets and leukocytes in the atherothrombotic process. In general, rapid transduction of biomechanical stimuli is typically mediated through mechanically gated ion channels (1Gillespie P.G. Walker R.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and, in the case of platelets, such membrane channels may be linked to the shear-regulated binding of von Willebrand factor (vWf) 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; IP3, 1,4,5-trisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; IP3, 1,4,5-trisphosphate. to its surface receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX. Mechanotransduction mechanisms operating downstream of integrins are typically linked to slower adaptive responses such as cytoskeletal remodeling and gene transcription (1Gillespie P.G. Walker R.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar); however, the role of integrin mechanotransduction in regulating functional processes in rapidly responding cells such as platelets remains largely unknown.Insight into the mechanisms by which shear forces regulate platelet function requires consideration of the hemodynamic conditions operating at sites of atherothrombosis. For example, shear forces change significantly at sites of arterial stenosis, increasing dramatically at the apex of the stenosis and decreasing rapidly in the post-stenotic recirculation region (6Mailhac A. Badimon J.J. Fallon J.T. Fernandez-Ortiz A. Meyer B. Chesebro J.H. Fuster V. Badimon L. Circulation. 1994; 90: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Flow patterns in the post-stenotic region can change from unidirectional laminar flow to disturbed flow patterns involving eddy formation, flow reversal, and shear gradients. Significantly, a major role for rapid accelerations of blood flow in promoting platelet deposition and thrombus formation has been demonstrated in vivo (7Strony J. Beaudoin A. Brands D. Adelman B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1787-H1796PubMed Google Scholar); furthermore, propagation of thrombi has also been established to occur downstream of the initial shear flux in the post-stenotic region (7Strony J. Beaudoin A. Brands D. Adelman B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1787-H1796PubMed Google Scholar). Although such disturbances of blood flow patterns have long been identified as powerful atherogenic stimuli and have been demonstrated to be important in regulating endothelial cell function (8Zarins C.K. Giddens D.P. Bharadvaj B.K. Sottiurai V.S. Mabon R.F. Glagov S. Circ. Res. 1983; 53: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 9Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of such flow changes in regulating platelet function remains ill-defined.In this study we demonstrate a key role for shear gradients in inducing platelet activation. Temporal shear gradients stimulate platelet activation through a signaling mechanism involving the platelet P2Y1 purinergic receptor and integrin αIIbβ3. We demonstrate that cooperative signaling by these receptors is necessary for efficient shear activation of platelets. Moreover, we demonstrate that this mechanosensory signaling mechanism is operational over a narrow temporal shear range. Overall, our studies define for the first time an important role for P2Y receptors in integrin mechanotransduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human vWf was purified to homogeneity from a plasma cryoprecipitate according to the method of Montgomery and Zimmerman (33Montgomery R.R.

Whole blood was collected into acid citrate dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant at a ratio of 6:1 (blood/ACD), to which mixture 20 units/ml Clexane was added before being allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Separation of platelet-rich plasma and red blood cells was achieved by centrifugation at 300 × g for 16 min. In all of the subsequent steps involving centrifugation, platelets were allowed to rest at 37 °C for 10 min prior to continuation of the next step in the washing procedure. Platelets were isolated from plasma components by centrifugation at 1,700 × g for 7 min, followed by resuspension in an equal volume of platelet washing buffer (4.3 mm K2HPO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 24.3 mm NaH2PO4, 113 mm NaCl, 5.5 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm theophylline, pH 6.5). Platelets were washed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 7 min, followed by a final resuspension at a concentration of 3 × 108/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.3) containing bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml), calcium (1 mm), and apyrase (0.02 units/ml) (ADPase activity).In Vitro Flow Studies—Flow assays were performed as described previously (10Yap C.L.

Briefly, glass microcapillary slides (Lomb Scientific, New South Wales, Australia) were coated with vWf (100 μg/ml) or fibrinogen (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature and then blocked with 10% heat-inactivated human serum. Washed platelets (5 × 107/ml) in Tyrode's buffer with 1 mm Ca2+ were reconstituted with washed red blood cells (50% v/v) (containing 0.02 units/ml apyrase and 1 units/ml hirudin) and perfused through the matrix-coated microcapillary tubes at wall shear rates of 3.6, 10.8, or 60 dyn/cm2 for 2 min at 37 °C. Platelet-matrix interactions were monitored for 100 frames (0.586 frames/sec) using confocal fluorescence microscopy (TCS-SP, Leica). Stationary adhesion was defined as platelet movement of less than a single cell diameter over a 30-s observation period.For temporal shear gradient experiments, washed platelets (1.5 × 108/ml) were allowed to transiently engage the vWf surface prior to the application of a shear gradient (0.9, 3.6, 10.8, or 60 dyn/cm2·s). A pre-shear time period fixed at 5 min was employed to allow platelet-vWf matrix interactions to occur. During this period, platelets in suspension settle under gravity onto the vWf surface. Although the pre-shear time window was fixed, the platelet interaction times were variable and depended on the time of initial engagement of the surface over the 5-min period. Platelet contact on the matrix was defined when platelets remained in focus on the surface of the microcapillary tube. The mean platelet interaction time reflects the amount of time that has elapsed following initial contact of a single platelet with the matrix up until the point of shear application. The mean interaction time of platelets with the vWf surface prior to the application of shear was 15 ± 13 s. These findings highlight the fact that although a 5-min pre-adhesion step was utilized in all studies, the vast majority of platelets only interacted with the matrix for a short period of time before the application of shear. Shear accelerations were generated according to published methods (15Bao X. Lu C. Frangos J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

With this assay, changes in cytosolic calcium flux correlate closely with platelet activation and the development of stationary adhesion contacts (12Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I.

Consistent with previous findings (18Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L. Hellums J.D. Blood. 1988; 71: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exposure of platelets in suspension to progressive increases in shear resulted in a corresponding increase in platelet aggregation (data not shown). Similarly, increasing shear induced a corresponding increase in the number of platelets tethering to von Willebrand factor (20Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, there was no positive relationship between increasing shear and the subsequent cytosolic calcium flux and concomitant stationary adhesion formation (Fig. 1, A and B). In fact, increases in steady-state shear reduced the proportion of platelets forming firm adhesion contacts, resulting in an increased number of rolling cells (Fig. 1B).It is generally assumed that GPIb is the principal mechano-receptor on the surface of platelets, responding to increases in shear with enhanced adhesive and signaling function (21Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

However, analysis of the effects of steady-state increases in blood flow on GPIb-dependent calcium flux revealed no significant shear-dependent increase in GPIb signaling (data not shown). Even when platelets were artificially anchored to the matrix through vWf-GPIb adhesive bonds by perfusing platelets in the presence of ristocetin (1 mg/ml), no shear-dependent increase in cytosolic calcium flux was observed (Fig. 1C). In control studies we confirmed that this lack of increase in calcium was not due to saturation of the calcium indicator dyes, as thrombin stimulation of these platelets resulted in a further 2-fold increase in calcium flux (data not shown). These studies suggest that high shear forces per se do not lead to a corresponding increase in GPIb-dependent calcium flux.Analysis of thrombus development in vivo has demonstrated a major role for rapid accelerations of blood flow in promoting platelet deposition and thrombus growth (7Strony J. Beaudoin A. Brands D. Adelman B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1787-H1796PubMed Google Scholar). Shear forces in converging inflow segments of stenosed arteries can transiently increase up to 100-fold at the apex of stenosed arteries (6Mailhac A. Badimon J.J. Fallon J.T. Fernandez-Ortiz A. Meyer B. Chesebro J.H. Fuster V. Badimon L. Circulation. 1994; 90: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Significantly, the only experimental conditions in which platelets were rapidly activated by shear forces were when transiently adherent platelets were exposed to rapid increases in shear (Fig. 2A). In these experiments, a pre-shear adhesion period of 5 min was employed to enable the development of platelet-vWf adhesion contacts, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Notably, platelet activation and calcium signaling were not observed during this pre-shear adhesion time, with the majority of platelet activation occurring only after ∼15 min of static adhesion. Following 5 min of pre-shear adhesion, accelerations in blood flow induced three distinct platelet responses (Fig. 2B), allowing us to divide the platelets into three groups. The first group included platelets that displayed a transient Δ[Ca2+]c spike (mean peak, 412 ± 23 nm) followed by sustained base line-to-peak oscillations ranging from 50 to 800 nm (see i. Trans-Sustained in Fig. 2B). These cells formed stable adhesion contacts with the matrix and expressed active integrin αIIbβ3 on the cell surface (Fig. 2B, PAC-1 immunofluorescence). The second group exhibited a single Δ[Ca2+]c spike (mean peak, 440 ± 45 nm) that coincided with the formation of transient stationary adhesion contacts (see ii. Transient in Fig. 2B). The third subclass of platelets displayed minimal Δ[Ca2+]c in response to rapid accelerations in blood flow and exhibited rapid translocation on the vWf surface (see iii. No Response in Fig. 2B). It should be noted that a small subset of platelets (∼5%) became activated post-induction of the shear gradients. These platelets translocated on the vWf matrix and formed firm adhesion contacts after a variable time period (From 20–40 s) (see Fig. 7). The development of stationary adhesion contacts in these platelets always coincided with the development of a sustained integrin αIIbβ3-dependent oscillatory calcium response. Of the ∼55% of platelets responding instantaneously to shear gradients, the transient and sustained calcium responses were not mutually dependent, with ∼35% of platelets exhibiti"

In this study, four GlcNH3+-containing disaccharides were obtained from partially de-N-sulfated forms of heparin and the N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide by digestion with combined heparinases I, II, and III. These were identified as ΔHexA-GlcNH3+,ΔHexA-GlcNH3+(6S),ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S). Digestions with individual enzymes revealed that heparinase I did not cleave at GlcNH3+ residues; however, heparinases II and III showed selective and distinct activities. Heparinase II generated ΔHexA-GlcNH3+(6S),ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) disaccharides, whereas heparinase III yielded only the ΔHexA-GlcNH3+ unit. Thus, the action of heparinase II requires O-sulfation, whereas heparinase III acts only on the corresponding non-sulfated unit.

HS and heparin are initially synthesized as a common non-sulfated precursor structure composed of repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (Glc-NAc) (8Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 10Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This precursor is first modified by coordinated N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues forming N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS). The N-sulfated polymer then undergoes a further series of modifications, i.e. C5-epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA), O-sulfation at C2 of hexuronic acid (primarily IdoA), and O-sulfation at C6 of GlcNS or GlcNAc. Additionally, a rare but functionally important step, 3-O-sulfation of the GlcN residue, can also occur late in the modification process. These modifications create a complex sulfated domain structure in HS, whereas heparin is extensively and uniformly sulfated. Because of the varied structure of mature HS chains and their extensive repertoire of interactions with different proteins, the rare structural components presumably contribute to selective protein binding. Recently, the N-unsubstituted GlcN ( GlcNH3+) unit was found in native HS structures (15Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem.

Moreover, two monoclonal antibodies that recognize GlcNH3+ units in HS were reported, and they highlighted distinctive localizations of their respective epitopes in tissues. One monoclonal antibody bound to extracellular tissue components in rat kidney (21Van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J.

Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been proposed that GlcNH3+ residues provide cleavage sites in HS chains for endogenous NO-derived nitroxyl anion and thus contribute to recycling of glypican-1 (24Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The content of GlcNH3+ residues is low but variable between HS species. Values from 1.2 to 7.5 wt% of total GlcN were calculated for a range of porcine and bovine HS species based on reaction with o-phthaldialdehyde (15Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, GlcNH3+ residues are mostly analyzed by treatment with high pH (pH 3.9) nitrous acid, leading to chain cleavage at the GlcNH3+-hexosaminidic linkage. By this method the content in human aortic and kidney HS was shown to be 2–4% (16Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Quantitation of GlcNH3+ by this approach requires either the analysis of metabolically radiolabeled HS, or post-cleavage, reducing end chemical radiolabeling of the cleavage products. So far there has been no identification and characterization of GlcNH3+ residues in HS by the use of degradative enzymes that could obviate the need for radiolabeling. Moreover, a better understanding of the substrate specificities of heparin/HS-degrading enzymes could be of value in sequencing GlcNH3+-containing oligosaccharides and in the isolation of fragments with either intact internal or reducing end GlcNH3+ residues. Glycosaminoglycan-degrading bacterial enzymes are useful analytical tools for investigating the composition and sequence of various glycosaminoglycans (25Lyon M. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 61-76Crossref Google Scholar). Three heparinases (I, II, and III) have been isolated from Flavobacterium heparinum that differ from one another in terms of their substrate specificities (26Linhardt R.J. Rice K.G. Kim Y.S. Lohse D.L. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These have been fairly well defined. Heparinase I has high specificity for highly sulfated disaccharides containing iduronate 2-O-sulfate and thus cleaves at →4GlcNS(±6S)1→4IdoA(2S)1→ linkages (27Linker A. Sampson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 43: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Hovingh P. Linker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6170-6175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Perlin A.S. Mackie D.M. Dietrich C.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1971; 18: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Heparinase III has highest activity toward non-sulfated or N-sulfated disaccharides (GlcNAc/GlcNS-HexA) with a preference for GlcA over IdoA. It will tolerate 6-O-sulfation of the amino sugar but is inhibited by 2-O-sulfation of IdoA (30Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L.S. Pinhal M.A.S. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.T. Dietrich C.P. J.

Heparinase II has a broad substrate specificity, being able to cleave a wide range of disaccharide repeat units (30Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L.S. Pinhal M.A.S. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It was reported that heparinase II has two distinct active sites, one of which is heparinase I-like, whereas the other is heparinase III-like (34Rhomberg A.J. Shriver Z. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12232-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moffat et al. reported that heparinase II has activity on N-unsubstituted disaccharides in chemically modified heparin (32Moffat C.F. McLean M.W. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Moffat C.F. McLean M.W. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J.

However, we are not aware of any detailed reports about the comparative substrate specificities of heparinase I, II, and III toward sulfated and non-sulfated disaccharides containing GlcNH3+ residues. Because the GlcNH3+ content is generally very low in HS, we have, in this study, used the partially de-N-sulfated forms of both heparin and the N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide (NS-K5) to test the susceptibility of N-unsubstituted disaccharides to the various heparinases. We have then demonstrated their use for the analysis of GlcNH3+ residues in HS. Materials—An enzymatically depolymerized low molecular weight heparin (Innohep) was obtained from Leo Laboratories Limited (Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, UK). Bovine kidney HS was purchased from Sigma, and porcine intestinal mucosal HS was obtained from Celsus (Cincinnati, OH). Heparinase I (F. heparinum; heparin lyase EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (F. heparinum; heparitin-sulfate lyase EC 4.2.2.8) were all purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Bio-Gel P2 (fine grade) was from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). ProPac PA-1 analytical columns were obtained from Dionex (Camberley, Surrey, UK). All HPLC solutions were prepared using MilliQ (Millipore; Watford, Hertfordshire, UK) ultrapure water. Amberlite IR-120 (H+ form) and all reagents used for de-N-sulfation and re-N-acetylation were from Sigma. N-Sulfated K5 polysaccharide (NS-K5) was kindly supplied by Dr. P. Oreste at Glycores (Milan, Italy). De-N-sulfation of Heparin and N-Sulfated K5 Polysaccharide—Partially and fully de-N-sulfated heparin were both prepared using Innohep as the starting material, essentially as described by Nagasawa et al. (36Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydrate Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The pyridinium salt of heparin was obtained by passage through an Amberlite IR-120 (H+ form) column and titration of the resulting protonated form with pyridine. The pyridinium salt (10 mg) was then treated with 1 ml of 95% Me2SO, 5% water at 20 °C for 60 min (partial de-N-sulfation) or 95% Me2SO, 5% methanol at 50 °C for 90 min (complete de-N-sulfation). The samples were then dialyzed extensively and freeze-dried. Partial de-N-sulfation of NS-K5 was similarly performed. The degrees of de-N-sulfation were calculated from the increases in N-acetylated disaccharides obtained after re-N-acetylation (see below). Determination of Enzymatic Activities—Fifty micrograms of substrates in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm calcium acetate and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, were digested at 37 °C with 1 mIU of each heparinase. Digestion was measured continuously by the change in absorbance at 232 nm on a spectrophotometer. Analysis of Enzymatic Digestion Products—Two hundred micrograms of partially or fully de-N-sulfated heparin, or partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5, in 200 μl of digestion buffer (as above) was treated with 6 mIU of each heparinase at 37 °C. Digestion was taken to completion over 24 h and stopped by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. After centrifuging the reaction mixture at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was applied to a Bio-Gel P2 column (1.7 × 115 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Elution of oligosaccharides was determined by measuring absorbance at 232 nm. The NH4HCO3 was removed from appropriate fractions by incubation at 55 °C for 24 h followed by three cycles of freeze-drying. Strong Anion-exchange-HPLC Analysis of Disaccharides—SAX-HPLC separation of disaccharides was performed on a HP-1100 system with a ProPac PA-1 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The disaccharides from the Bio-Gel P2 column were applied in 1 ml of water pH3.5 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After a 2-ml wash with pH 3.5 H2O, a biphasic linear gradient of NaCl was applied from 0 to 0.5 m (2.1–35.1 min) and then 0.5 to 1.0 m (35.1–57.1 min). The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 232 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Preparation of Disaccharides from De-N-sulfated Heparin and De-N-sulfated NS-K5—Two hundred micrograms of de-N-sulfated heparin or de-N-sulfated NS-K5 were digested with a mixture of heparinase I, II, and III (24 milliunits of each enzyme) at 37 °C for 48 h, and then applied to a Bio-Gel P2 column (1.7 × 115 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected, and their absorbance was measured at 232 nm. The disaccharide peak was collected, and the NH4HCO3 removed, as described above. Re-N-acetylation of De-N-sulfated Heparin and Purified N-Unsubstituted Disaccharides—De-N-sulfated heparin was dissolved in 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. A 10-fold excess of acetic anhydride was gradually added with continuous stirring for 1 h at 0 °C. The re-N-acetylated heparin was then desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). N-Unsubstituted disaccharides were similarly re-N-acetylated, but in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and the reaction mixture was then dried. Preparation of De-N-sulfated Heparins—In this study, two de-N-sulfated heparin preparations, partial and complete, were prepared. The degrees of de-N-sulfation, calculated from the increase in N-acetylated disaccharides obtained after re-N-acetylation and digestion with heparinases, were 50 and 98% for the two preparations, respectively. Digestion of Partially De-N-sulfated Heparin with Heparinases—Partially de-N-sulfated (50%) heparin was digested with a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III, and separated by Bio-Gel P2 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). Only two major peaks were obtained, which were identified as dp4 (minor peak) and dp2 by comparing their elution positions with those of standard oligosaccharides. From the peak areas it could be calculated that 86% of the linkages in partially de-N-sulfated heparin were cleaved by the heparinases. The excess of degradation (86%) over the content of N-unsubstituted residues (50%) indicated that (i) heparinase I, II, or III must have activity toward N-unsubstituted disaccharides and (ii) N-unsubstituted oligosaccharides (probably disaccharides) can be obtained by this procedure. Characterization of Disaccharides from Partially De-N-sulfated Heparin—The pooled disaccharide fraction from Bio-Gel P2 chromatography (Fig. 1) of enzyme-digested, partially de-N-sulfated heparin was analyzed by SAX-HPLC, and compared with that from unmodified heparin and the elution positions of eight known disaccharides (Fig. 2). In contrast to the unmodified heparin (Fig. 2A), twelve disaccharides were generated from the partially de-N-sulfated heparin (Fig. 2B). In addition to the eight common disaccharides present in the unmodified heparin, four new peaks designated as a, b, c, and d were detected, these being eluted at 3.0, 7.6–7.8, 9.6, and 26.8–27.4 min, respectively. These four extra peaks were therefore thought to be GlcNH3+-containing disaccharides. To confirm this expectation, partially de-N-sulfated heparin was re-N-acetylated then digested with heparinases, and the disaccharides were recovered and analyzed by SAX-HPLC (Fig. 2C). After re-N-acetylation, all four extra peaks (a–d) disappeared, but the amounts of four known, N-acetylated disaccharides, i.e. ΔHexA-GlcNAc, ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S), ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S) (peaks 1, 3, 4, and 7 in Fig. 2C) increased, confirming that disaccharides a–d were indeed N-unsubstituted ones. Structural Analysis of N-unsubstituted Disaccharides Derived from Partially De-N-sulfated Heparin—To positively identify each of the three later-eluting unknown disaccharides (b, c, and d), they were collected individually from SAX-HPLC, re-N-acetylated, and then re-analyzed by SAX-HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3A, after re-N-acetylation, disaccharide b shifted its retention time to a later position corresponding to that of the standard disaccharide ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S), indicating that the original structure of b must have been ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S). In the same way, disaccharide c shifted its retention time to that of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (Fig. 3B), and disaccharide d shifted its to that of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S) (Fig. 3C). These results similarly identified disaccharides c and d as originally being ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S), respectively. Structural Analysis of N-Unsubstituted Disaccharides from Partially De-N-sulfated NS-K5—As the content of disaccharide a is low in partially de-N-sulfated heparin, and it was eluted from the SAX-HPLC column very early at low salt concentration, it was difficult to identify its structure conclusively using heparin. According to its elution position, and the known identities of the three other species (b–d), we might expect disaccharide a to be a non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharide. To possibly prepare a larger amount of this disaccharide, we chose de-N-sulfated NS-K5 as a potential substrate. The K5 polysaccharide has the same sequence as completely unmodified HS. NS-K5 is thus comprised mainly of GlcA-GlcNS disaccharides (37Murphy K.J. Merry C.L.R. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NS-K5 was partially de-N-sulfated to generate a significant proportion of GlcA-GlcNH3+ disaccharide units. The degree of de-N-sulfation achieved was 45%. This material was then digested with a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III and separated by Bio-Gel P2 gel filtration chromatography. The dp2 fraction obtained was analyzed by SAX-HPLC. Compared with control NS-K5, which yielded almost entirely ΔHexA-GlcNS (Fig. 4A), one additional peak was obtained from the partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5, which eluted very early at 3.1 min (Fig. 4B). Its elution position is the same as that of disaccharide a from partially de-N-sulfated heparin (Fig. 2B). This suggests that this disaccharide is likely to be ΔHexA-GlcNH3+. To confirm this, disaccharide a was collected, re-N-acetylated, desalted on Bio-Gel P2, and then re-analyzed by SAX-HPLC. As shown in Fig. 4C, after re-N-acetylation, disaccharide a shifted its retention time to a later position corresponding to the known elution position of ΔHexA-GlcNAc, unequivocally confirming that the original structure of disaccharide a is ΔHexA-GlcNH3+. Specificity of Individual Heparinases toward N-Unsubstituted Glucosamine Residues—To identify the specific heparinase(s) responsible for the activity toward GlcNH3+-containing residues, de-N-sulfated heparins and partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5 were digested with heparinases I, II, or III individually. Enzymatic activities were monitored by following the increase in UV absorbance at 232 nm with time (Fig. 5A). Heparinase I showed no activity toward the fully de-N-sulfated heparin, and heparinase III acted only to a small extent. In contrast, heparinase II demonstrated significant activity against this substrate. A comparison of the kinetics of heparinase II degradation of heparin to those of both partially and fully de-N-sulfated heparins showed that the presence of increasing levels of GlcNH3+ did slow the rate of degradation (Fig. 5B), although an extensive, but incomplete, level of degradation can be achieved with time with both de-N-sulfated substrates. Heparinase II also showed activity toward partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5 (45% de-N-sulfated) (Fig. 5C). However, this polysaccharide was a much better substrate for heparinase III (Fig. 5C). This demonstrates the likely activity of heparinase III against non-sulfated GlcNH3+ residues. To further analyze the differential activities of individual heparinases toward N-unsubstituted disaccharides, the digestion products from fully de-N-sulfated heparin incubated for 48 h with either heparinase I, II, or III were separated by Bio-Gel P2 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 6A). The disaccharide fractions were then analyzed by SAX-HPLC (Fig. 6, B and C). No disaccharides were released by treatment with heparinase I (data not shown). After heparinase III digestion, only a small amount of disaccharides and longer oligosaccharides were detected (Fig. 6A). However, heparinase II digestion generated a large amount of disaccharides, a small amount of tetra- and hexasaccharides, and nothing larger (Fig. 6A), suggesting almost quantitative breakdown of this substrate. These results confirmed that heparinase II displays much more activity toward O-sulfated, N-unsubstituted sequences than does heparinase III, and heparinase I has no activity. Also, both heparinases II and III can liberate disaccharides containing GlcNH3+. The SAX-HPLC analyses of the dp2 fractions released by heparinase II or III were very different. Heparinase II (Fig. 6B) released mainly three N-unsubstituted disaccharides, i.e. ΔHexA-GlcNH3+(6S),ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S), together with small amounts of four N-acetylated disaccharides, i.e. ΔHexA-GlcNAc, ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S), ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S). This suggests that heparinase II cleaves all the mono- or di-O-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharide units. The presence of small amounts of N-acetylated disaccharides reflects their low presence (13% of total) in the original heparin preparation. In contrast, the main disaccharide released by heparinase III (Fig. 6C) was ΔHexA-GlcNAc, together with minor amounts of ΔHexA-GlcNH3+(6S) and ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S). This shows that with the de-N-sulfated heparin as substrate heparinase III is cleaving mostly at native N-acetylated residues, although it does appear to be capable of generating some N-unsubstituted disaccharide units of low overall sulfation, but with low yield. To confirm the differential activities of heparinases II and III toward sulfated and non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted units, the digestion products from partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5, after incubation with heparinase II or III, were also separated by Bio-Gel P2 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 7A). Heparinase II yielded a very small amount of disaccharides and longer fragments. However, heparinase III generated a large amount of disaccharides and some tetrasaccharides, but nothing larger, implying almost quantitative cleavage of this substrate. These results suggested that heparinase III might display preferential activity toward non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted sequences. The disaccharide fractions from Bio-Gel P2 column chromatography (Fig. 7A) were then analyzed by SAX-HPLC. Three species, i.e. ΔHexA-GlcNH3+, ΔHexA-GlcNAc, and ΔHexA-GlcNS, were identified in the heparinase III digest (Fig. 7C). This clearly demonstrates that heparinase III cleaves at non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharides. However, in the heparinase II digest (Fig. 7B), only ΔHexA-GlcNS and a very small amount of ΔHexA-GlcNAc were detected, with no presence of GlcNH3+-containing disaccharides, suggesting that heparinase II is not capable of cleaving at non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharide units. Identification of N-Unsubstituted Disaccharides in HS Species—To assay for the presence of natural GlcNH3+ residues in HS using heparinases, bovine kidney and porcine intestinal mucosal HS were chosen. The GlcNH3+ content of these two HS species had previously been shown to be very different (15Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Bovine kidney HS was exhaustively digested with a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III, and the disaccharide fraction was recovered by Bio-Gel P2 chromatography and analyzed by SAX-HPLC (Fig. 8A). Eight components were identified that correspond to known N-substituted disaccharide standards (labeled 1–8). Four additional peaks were also present (comprising 12% of total disaccharides), corresponding to the known N-unsubstituted units (labeled a–d). To confirm these latter structural assignments, bovine kidney HS was first N-acetylated before enzymatic digestion and disaccharide analysis. The four N-unsubstituted disaccharides (a–d) now disappeared, but the corresponding N-acetylated derivatives (peaks 1, 3, 4, and 7) increased by 10% in total (including the significant appearance of disaccharide 7 (HexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S), which was barely present in the native HS) (Fig. 8B). These results show that HexA-GlcNH3+,HexA-GlcNH3+(6S),HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) disaccharides are present in bovine kidney HS at levels of 5.1%, 3.4%, 2.2%, and 1.9% of total disaccharides, respectively (calculated as an average of two analyses). In the same way, three N-unsubstituted disaccharides, HexA-GlcNH3+,HexA-GlcNH3+(6S), and HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, were detected in porcine intestinal mucosal HS at 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.3% of total disaccharides, respectively, i.e. a total of 1.1% (data not shown). The more highly sulfated HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) disaccharide was not detected in this HS. This compares with a total GlcNH3+ content of 0.7% determined by pH 3.9 nitrous acid treatment and chromatographic analysis (16Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The content of GlcNH3+ residues is low and variable between HS species, ranging from 1.2% to 7.5 wt%, as determined using o-phthaldialdehyde (15Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because of this apparently low (15Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) natural content in HS, we have used chemical modification of heparin and the K5 polysaccharide to increase the content of GlcNH3+ residues to test the susceptibilities of N-unsubstituted disaccharides to the heparinases, which are widely used for analysis of HS and heparin. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of hexosaminidic linkages in a partially (50%) de-N-sulfated heparin were cleaved to disaccharides by a combination of heparinases I, II, and III (Fig. 1). This led us to surmise that (i) the heparinases could be used as alternative tools for the quantitation and analysis of GlcNH3+ residues in HS, and (ii) that N-unsubstituted disaccharides could be obtained by this procedure. SAX-HPLC analyses of the disaccharides obtained from de-N-sulfated heparin revealed four additional disaccharide peaks (a–d) (Fig. 2B), that were not present in digests of the parent heparin (Fig. 2A), and did not correspond to any of the known N-substituted disaccharide standards. Re-N-acetylation of the partially de-N-sulfated heparin, prior to enzymatic digestion, did not give these four disaccharide peaks (Fig. 2C), but the content of the four N-acetylated disaccharides increased, suggesting that the four novel disaccharides (a–d) are indeed N-unsubstituted ones. Individual recovery of three of these disaccharides (b–d), followed by their N-acetylation, allowed their structures to be unequivocally determined (Fig. 3). These were variously O-sulfated, N-unsubstituted species, namely ΔHexA-GlcNH3+(6S),ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S). The content of one further putative N-unsubstituted disaccharide a in partially de-N-sulfated heparin was low (Fig. 2B), but from its elution position on SAX-HPLC we surmised that it might be the non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharide. To confirm this, we prepared a disaccharide with identical elution position, but in greater abundance, from a similar enzyme digest of partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5 (Fig. 4B). Collection and N-acetylation of this disaccharide yielded the structure ΔHexA-GlcNAc (Fig. 4C), confirming that disaccharide a was indeed the non-sulfated disaccharide ΔHexA-GlcNH3+. N-unsubstituted disaccharides are normally identified and quantified in HS by chemical assay or by specific pH 3.9 nitrous acid degradation and chromatographic separation of the cleavage products. However, both methods destroy the GlcNH3+ residues. In this study we describe the generation of intact, unsaturated N-unsubstituted disaccharides by digestion with a combination of heparinases followed by SAX-HPLC. By their identification, and the characterization of their SAX-HPLC elution positions, it is now possible for heparinases to be conveniently used for analyzing the content of N-unsubstituted disaccharides in HS as part of a standard disaccharide analysis (Fig. 8A). Heparinases are very important tools in studying the composition and role of biologically relevant HS/heparin sequences. It was reported that heparinase I has specificity for relatively highly sulfated disaccharides containing both N- and 2-O-sulfation, whereas heparinase III cleaves at non- and low sulfated disaccharides predominantly containing GlcA. Heparinase II has a broader specificity, cleaving at both high sulfation and low sulfation sites, but not at all linkages. Which heparinases are responsible for cleaving at GlcNH3+ residues? We have investigated the individual activities of heparinases I, II, and III toward substrates with either a high content of O-sulfate groups (i.e. partially or fully de-N-sulfated heparin) or deficient in O-sulfation (i.e. partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5) (Fig. 5). This revealed that heparinase II was primarily responsible for the specificity of cleavage at GlcNH3+ in the de-N-sulfated heparins, although the rate and extent of depolymerization was reduced by the presence of the primary amine (Fig. 5A). Heparinase II excises N-unsubstituted disaccharides that are O-sulfated at C-2 of uronic acid, or C-6 of GlcNH3+, or both (Fig. 6B); it is inactive against the non-sulfated counterpart (Fig. 7B). This is consistent with the broad sulfation specificity of heparinase II. However, with the same substrates, heparinase III specifically excises non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharides (Fig. 7C), but has almost no activity toward mono- or di-O-sulfated ones in either fully de-N-sulfated heparin (Fig. 6C) or native HS (date not shown). By contrast, heparinase I showed no propensity to cleave at any sites of N-unsubstitution. The differences in activity of heparinase enzymes on GlcNH3+ residues in HS are illustrated in Fig. 9. Chai et al. (38Chai W.G. Leteux C. Westling C. Lindahl U. Feizi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8590-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that, using controlled conditions for partial heparinase III digestion of partially de-N-acetylated K5 polysaccharide, the enzyme was not able to cleave the GlcNH3+-GlcA linkage within a ΔHexA-GlcNH3+-GlcA-GlcNAc sequence; even under forced conditions for exhaustive digestion, the GlcNH3+-GlcA linkages were still only partly cleaved. In our study, using the partially de-N-sulfated NS-K5 as a substrate, we reached a different conclusion, because this alternative substrate was highly degraded into disaccharides by heparinase III (Fig. 7A). This suggests that heparinase III has higher activity toward the GlcNH3+-GlcA linkage within ΔHexA-GlcNH3+-GlcA-GlcNS sequences. It is unlikely that this could be due to contaminating enzyme activities, because neither heparinase I nor II are individually able to excise this non-sulfated unit. Because heparinase II shows specificity to O-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharides, and heparinase III to the non-sulfated, N-unsubstituted disaccharide, they might be useful tools to selectively generate HS oligosaccharides containing either highly sulfated or non-sulfated N-unsubstituted disaccharides, as an aid to understanding their location in the HS chain. For the first time, we have analyzed the N-unsubstituted disaccharide content of natural HS species using bacterial heparinases. In the first instance we chose bovine kidney HS, because (i) it has been used as a substrate for assaying HS 3-OST-3A activity, which is believed to require GlcNH3+ residues (18Liu J. Shriver Z.

Duncan M.B. Copeland R.J. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33456-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and (ii) GlcNH3+ units were identified as a component of the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 10E4 in rat kidney HS (21Van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31303-31309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We found bovine kidney HS to contain all four N-unsubstituted disaccharides, HexA-GlcNH3+,HexA-GlcNH3+(6S),HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+, and HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S), with abundances of 5.1, 3.4, 2.2, and 1.9% of total disaccharides, respectively. Secondly we analyzed porcine intestinal mucosal HS, which proved to be very different in that it contained only 1.1% GlcNH3+ residues in total, and only the three least-sulfated disaccharides were detected. Previous studies have identified the occurrence of HexA-GlcNH3+ and IdoA(2S)-GlcNH3+ in HS. HexA-GlcNH3+ is present in scrapie lesions in murine brain (22Leteux C. Chai W. Ngai K. Herbert C.G. Lawson A.M. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12539-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23McBride P.A. Wilson M.I. Eikelenboom P. Tunstall A. Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that this disaccharide occurs mostly toward the polysaccharide-protein linkage region in the HS chain (24Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IdoA(2S)-GlcNH3+ has been identified as a target for the HS 3-OST-3A enzyme, and this disaccharide would be primarily located in the highly sulfated domains (S-domains) of HS chains. ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) (presumably mostly IdoA(2S)-GlcNH3+ in the intact HS) was present at 3.4% of total disaccharides in bovine kidney HS, confirming that such HS would potentially be a good substrate for testing HS 3-OST activity and for generating oligosaccharides with 3-O-sulfation. In addition to the above two GlcNH3+-containing disaccharides, we have also demonstrated the presence of HexA-GlcNH3+(6S) in both HS species analyzed, and HexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) in bovine kidney HS only. Interestingly, 1.9% of the highly sulfated N-unsubstituted disaccharide ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNH3+(6S) was detected in bovine kidney HS. The presence of 7.5% in total of N-unsubstituted, O-sulfated disaccharides raises interesting questions about their appearance in the HS chain. It has been shown that 3-OST-3A can act on IdoA(2S)-GlcNH3+ units, but it is presently unclear whether HS 2-O- or 6-O-sulfotransferases also recognize the GlcNH3+ residue, allowing the synthesis of these O-sulfated species from non- or lesser-sulfated ones. Instead, could there be an endo-sulfamidase that removes selected N-sulfate groups in the later stages of polysaccharide modification? Alternatively, an extracellular sulfamidase may act on cell surface HS; there is a precedent for this with the recently identified endo-6-sulfatases (Qsulf and Hsulf) that act on the cell surface and modify the signaling functions of HS (39Wang S. Ai X. Freeman S.D. Pownall M.E. Lu Q. Kessler D.S. Emerson Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4833-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 40Lai J. Chien J. Staub J.K.

As mentioned above, one important property of GlcNH3+ residues in HS is that they were identified as potential substrates for the HS 3-OST-3A enzyme. This generates a binding site in HS recognized by the herpes simplex virus gD protein (20Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The minimal size of the binding site within HS for gD protein binding has been reported to be an octasaccharide with a GlcNH3+ residue at the reducing end. Our new knowledge of the specificity of the three heparinases toward N-unsubstituted disaccharides gives some ideas for generating oligosaccharides containing GlcNH3+ residues in different positions, which may contribute to the future analysis of gD protein binding to HS, and for identifying other proteins that require the unsubstituted primary amine. For example, by using a partially de-N-sulfated heparin as substrate, heparinase I would be a useful enzyme for generating oligosaccharides with purely internal GlcNH3+, whereas an incomplete heparinase II digest would yield oligosaccharides with internal and reducing terminal GlcNH3+ residues (Fig. 9). Such oligosaccharides would also be valuable substrates for testing the activities of HS polymer-modifying enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2155455809,"Host cell factor (HCF) was initially discovered as a cellular co-factor required for the activation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene expression by the virion associated transactivator VP16. HCF also participates in a variety of cellular processes, although the mechanism of its action is not known. VP16 binds to HCF through a 4-amino acid motif (EHAY), which closely resembles the HCF binding domain of two cellular basic leucine-zipper proteins, Luman and Zhangfei. Luman is a powerful transcription factor that, in transient expression assays, activates promoters containing cAMP or unfolded protein response elements (UPRE). In contrast, Zhangfei neither binds consensus recognition elements for basic leucine-zipper proteins nor does it activate promoters containing them. Here we show that Zhangfei suppresses the ability of Luman to activate transcription. HCF appeared to be required for efficient suppression. A mutant of Zhangfei, which was unable to bind HCF, was impaired in its ability to suppress Luman. Zhangfei did not suppress ATF6, a transcription factor closely related to Luman but that does not bind HCF, unless the HCF binding motif of Luman was grafted onto it. Zhangfei inhibited the HCF-dependent activation of a UPRE-containing promoter by a Gal4-Luman fusion protein but was unable to inhibit the HCF-independent activation by Gal4-Luman of a promoter that contained Gal4 binding motifs. Binding of HCF by Zhangfei was required for the co-localization of Luman and Zhangfei to nuclear domains, suggesting that HCF might target the proteins to a common location.

It was initially discovered as a component of a multiprotein complex assembled with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) transactivator VP16 (reviewed in Ref. 1Wysocka J. Herr W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 294-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This complex, composed of VP16, HCF, and the POU domain protein Oct-1, recognizes response elements in promoters of HSV immediate early genes and initiates the viral replicative process. The exact role of HCF in VP16-mediated gene expression is not clear, although evidence suggests that HCF may serve as a co-activator for VP16 (2Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13403-13408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as providing a nuclear localization domain (3LaBoissiere S. Hughes T. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HCF has been implicated in many cellular processes, including: progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (4Goto H.

Suppression of the nuclear accumulation of HCF influences the expression of almost 400 cellular genes (9Khurana B. Kristie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33673-33683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HCF is expressed as a large 2035-amino acid precursor, which is processed by proteolytic cleavage into amino and carboxyl portions held together by noncovalent interactions. The amino-terminal segment of the protein is believed to fold into a six-bladed propeller-like structure called the Kelch domain, because of its similarity to the Drosophila Kelch protein (reviewed in Ref. 1Wysocka J. Herr W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 294-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This domain has features needed for interaction with VP16 as well as the cellular proteins Luman/L-ZIP/CREB3 (10Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J.

These proteins share a 4-amino acid motif (D/E)HXY (where X can be any of several amino acids) through which they interact with HCF. Several other proteins involved in diverse functions also possess the HCF binding motif (HBM), although it is not known whether they actually bind HCF (14Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. J. Biol.

We and others identified two human proteins, Luman/LZIP/CREB3 (16Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V.

Luman is a basic leucine-zipper (B-Zip) transcription factor that, in vitro, can bind cAMP and unfolded protein response elements (CRE and UPRE). Both proteins appear to be selectively expressed in neurons (18Lu R. Misra V. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2O. Akhova and V. Misra, in preparation. When Luman is ectopically synthesized in cultured cells, it can enhance the expression of reporter genes linked to promoters that contain CREs and UPREs in an HCF-dependent manner (10Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6291-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Luman belongs to a class of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated transcription factors, which must be released by proteolysis from the ER to activate transcription (20Raggo C. Rapin N. Stirling J. Gobeil P. Smith-Windsor E. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The transcription factors, sterol response element-binding protein, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) also belong to this category (reviewed in Ref. 21Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Zhangfei has structural features that suggest it is a B-Zip protein and it has the capacity to activate gene transcription when coupled to a heterologous DNA binding domain (12Lu R. Misra V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative DNA binding domain of Zhangfei, however, lacks an asparagine residue that is conserved in almost all B-Zip proteins and appears to be critical to the ability of these proteins to bind DNA (22Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 23Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Perhaps, because of this, Zhangfei does not bind any of the consensus B-Zip response elements examined and cannot activate transcription from promoters that contain these sequences (12Lu R. Misra V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in cells infected with HSV, Zhangfei appears to suppress the expression of Immediate Early and Late classes of genes (12Lu R. Misra V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent theoretical (24Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and experimental (25Newman J.R. Keating A.E. Science. 2003; 300: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) studies that have examined the ability of various B-Zip domains to dimerize, suggest that, although Luman and Zhangfei are inefficient at forming heterodimers, Zhangfei can associate with XBP-1 and ATF4. These factors are known to mediate stress responses in the cell. In this article we describe our studies of interactions between Zhangfei and Luman. We show that Zhangfei suppresses the ability of Luman to activate transcription. Efficient suppression of transcriptional activation by Zhangfei correlated with its ability to bind HCF. Suppression by Zhangfei was specific to HCF-dependent transcriptional activation by Luman. Zhangfei had no effect on the HCF-independent transcriptional activation of a Gal4 binding site-containing promoter by a Gal4-Luman fusion protein. In addition, Zhangfei did not affect the activity of ATF6, a transcription factor that is closely related to Luman, but that does not bind HCF, unless the HCF-binding domain of Luman was grafted on to it. Although Luman and Zhangfei did not appear to form heterodimers, even in the presence of HCF, binding of HCF by Zhangfei was required for the co-localization of Luman and Zhangfei with the promyelocytic leukemia protein, a component of nuclear domain 10, suggesting that HCF might target the proteins to a common location. The inhibitory effects of Zhangfei were underscored by the observation that, in a human epithelial cell line expressing Zhangfei, the transcripts for 89 of 1700 genes examined decreased while those of only one gene increased. Plasmids—The construction of the plasmids pcFL-Lu and pcLu (S221Op), which express full-length and truncated forms of Luman, and pcZF, which expresses Zhangfei, have been described (12Lu R. Misra V.

Plasmid CGNATF6-(1–373), which expresses the constitutively active truncated form of ATF6, and p5XATF6GL3, which contains five copies of the UPRE-containing oligonucleotide, CTCGAGACAGGTGCTGACGTGGCATTC, were obtained from Ron Prywes, Columbia University, New York, NY (26Wang Y.

A plasmid expressing the functionally active, spliced form of XBP1 cDNA was obtained from K. Mori, Kyoto University, Japan (27Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). The plasmid G5EC, a CAT reporter plasmid with five copies of the yeast Gal4-UAS, and the pM series of plasmids for constructing Gal4 fusion proteins were obtained from I. Sadowski, University of British Columbia, Canada (28Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSL7, which expresses the fused amino and carboxyl termini of HCF, was obtained from P. O'Hare, Marie Curie Institute, UK. The coding sequences for ATF6 were transferred to the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by recovering the sequences by PCR using primers that added 5′ terminal BamHI and 3′ terminal XhoI sites. The PCR product, digested with BamHI and XhoI was then transferred to pcDNA3 cut with the same enzymes. The ATF6 sequences were similarly transferred to pGEX-KG generating pGEX-ATF6, a plasmid expressing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) ATF6 fusion protein. The CAT reporter plasmid pCAT3BATF6 was constructed by transferring the UPRE-containing repeats from p5XATF6GL3 to pCAT3Basic (Promega). Plasmids expressing mutant proteins, pcZF (Y224A), pcLu (DHTY78AGTA), pcLu S221Op (DHTY78AGTA), pcLu (N160G), and pcLu S221Op (N160G) were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as modified by Wang and Malcolm (29Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To construct pcLu-ATF6 (EELA:EDKP), a plasmid that expresses a fusion protein comprising the amino-terminal 112 amino acids of Luman and amino acids 149–373 of ATF6, a unique NheI site was added to pcLu (S221Op) by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences coding for the carboxyl terminus of ATF6 were then recovered by PCR using primers that added 5′ terminal NheI and 3′ terminal XhoI sites. The PCR product cut with NheI and XhoI was then used to replace the NheI-XhoI fragment from the modified pcLu (S221Op). The Luman-ATF6 sequences were transferred to pGEX-KG to make pGEXLu-ATF6. In the plasmid names the mutations are designated in parentheses with the original amino acid (or amino acid sequence) and its location in the protein followed by the altered amino acid. For plasmids expressing fusion proteins, the junction between the two sequences is indicated by a colon separating the amino acids from the two proteins. Antibodies, Immunoblots, Immunofluorescence, and Immunoprecipitation—Antisera against Luman and Zhangfei were raised in rabbits or mice using recombinant GST fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli (12Lu R. Misra V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lu R. Misra V. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against VP16 (LP1) as well as rabbit antisera against PML and HCF were obtained from Peter O'Hare, Marie Curie Institute, UK. The procedure for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using the antibodies has been described previously (18Lu R. Misra V. J.

For co-immunoprecipitation experiments described in Fig. 4, proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were synthesized using the TnT kit (Promega) as suggested by the manufacturer. The TnT lysates were charged with pcLu, pcZF, and pSL7, either alone or in combination. Following synthesis, the lysates were diluted to 200 μl in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.01 m Tris, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), sonicated, and centrifuged for 15 min in a Beckman Airfuge to remove particulate matter. After removing an aliquot, 5 μl of antiserum was added and the cleared lysate was kept at 4 °C for 20 min. Incubation was continued after adding 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and suspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. Procedures for immunofluorescence microscopy have been described before (20Raggo C. Rapin N.

Transfection and CAT Assays—Vero and Hep2 cells were transfected with plasmids, purified through CsCl gradients, using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (30Misra V. Walker S. Hayes S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5209-5216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Misra V. Walter S. Yang P. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 5 μg of DNA was used for 2.5 × 105 cells for immunofluorescence or 1 × 106 cells for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays. For CAT assays, 250 ng of pCMVBGal, a plasmid specifying β-galactosidase, were added to each transfection. Lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.97Google Scholar) and for CAT using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). CAT values were adjusted for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase values. In figures for CAT assays, each datum point is the average of duplicate transfections with the bar representing the range. The data are representative of several (at least two) independent experiments that gave the same results. For extracting RNA, 4 × 106 cells in 100-mm diameter tissue culture plates were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Where indicated, transfected cells were treated with 5 μm MG132 for 24 h before harvesting for immunoblotting. MG132 was not used when cells were transfected for CAT assays. Real-time PCR—RNA from transfected cells was purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. To detect and quantitate Luman and other transcripts, we used a LUX (FAM) oligonucleotide sets. β-Actin transcripts were measured with a JOE-labeled human β-actin primer set (Invitrogen). Transcripts were amplified with Taq polymerase from the Platinum quantitative RT-PCR thermoscript one-step system (Invitrogen). To quantitate Luman transcripts a series of samples containing 4 pg to 0.4 μg of pcLu were included to derive a standard curve. To determine the relative amounts of other transcripts RNA samples diluted serially were analyzed to construct relative standard curves. The concentration of transcripts in each sample was normalized to a relative amount of β-actin transcripts expressed as cycle threshold (Ct). Samples were amplified in an MJ thermocycler using the following thermocycle: -55 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 5 min, 45 cycles of -95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus Vectors—The adenovirus expression system was purchased from BD Biosciences. Coding sequences of Zhangfei and Zhangfei Y224A were used to construct recombinant adenovirus vectors according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following exception: The order of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites in the multiple cloning site of pShuttle (supplied with the kit) were changed from NheI, ApaI, XbaI, Nat I, BstX I, KpnI, and AflII to NheI, ApaI, BamH I, XbaI, KpnI, AflII to facilitate the transfer of coding sequences from pcZF and pcZF (Y224A). These sequences were recovered and cloned between the BamHI/XbaI restriction sites of the modified pShuttle. pShuttle-lacZ plasmid was supplied by BD Biosciences. All recombinant adenovirus vectors were propagated in HEK 293 cells and were purified by CsCl gradient (33Hitt M. Bett A.J. Addison C.L. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 7: 13-30Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by end-point dilution assay on HEK 293 cells as suggested by BD Biosciences. Infection by Adenovirus Vectors—Hep2 cells were seeded into 100-mm diameter plates to a density of 4 × 106 cells per plate 12–24 h before infection. A multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque forming units/cell was used, because this was found to result in the expression of the delivered gene in all cells with no apparent toxicity. Adenovirus vectors, diluted in 4 ml of maintenance media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), were added to the cells. 4 h later 6 ml of the same media was added to each well. Cells were harvested 24 h after infection. To confirm expression of Zhangfei and Zhangfei (Y224A) in adenovirus infected Hep2 cells, anti-Zhangfei polyclonal antibodies were used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis as described above. β-Galactosidase expression was assayed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidoman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 9.11.9Google Scholar). RNA Isolation—Total RNA was extracted from Hep2 cells treated with adenoviruses expressing Zhangfei, Zhangfei (Y224A), or β-galactosidase 24 h after adenovirus infection using 2 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per 100-mm diameter dish according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and integrity of the RNA was evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cDNA Microarray—Microarrays (1700 human expressed sequence tag clones) were purchased from the Microarray Center (Ontario Cancer Institute, Canada). More information about the microarray layout can be found on the website www.microarrays.com. For each array 10 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription was performed using AncT primers (T20VN, Sigma Genosys), dATP, dGTP, dTTP (final concentration 0.5 mm), and dCTP (final concentration 0.05 mm). The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature. SuperScript II (300 units), Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (final concentration 0.025 mm), and 20 units of Superase-in (Ambion) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h in a light protected incubator. Two hundred units of SuperScript II were added for the next hr. Reverse transcription was stopped with EDTA (final concentration, 4.5 mm) and RNA hydrolyzed with 1 n NaOH and heating at 70 °C for 10 min. The NaOH was neutralized with 1 n HCl. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA were mixed together followed by purification and concentration using Montage PCR Centrifuge Filter Devices (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Five microliters of cDNA probe was added to 60 μl of DIG Easy hybridization buffer (Roche Applied Science) to which was added 0.5 mg/ml COT-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Invitrogen). The mixture was incubated for 2 min at 100 °C and cooled down at room temperature. The hybridization solution was pipetted onto a 24-× 50-mm coverslip, and a cDNA array slide was placed on the solution. Hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 14–16 h in a humid chamber. After incubation arrays were washed three times in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min each time and rinsed 4 times in 1× SSC at room temperature. Array Scanning and Data Analysis—Arrays were scanned immediately after washing using a GenePix 4000B scanner. Images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 4.1 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). LOWESS normalization and statistical analysis was preformed using Acuity 3.2 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) software package from Stanford University (35Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9795) Google Scholar). Gene ontology analysis was preformed using Onto-tools (available from vortex.cs.wayne.edu/projects.htm). Onto-Express was used to generate functional profiles of genes down-regulated by Zhangfei (36Draghici S. Khatri P. Bhavsar P. Shah A. Krawetz S.A.

Genomics. 2003; 81: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Zhangfei Suppresses the Ability of Luman to Activate Transcription—Luman is a potent activator of the reporter gene, CAT, linked to a promoter containing multiple copies of the UPRE. 3M. Sackville and V. Misra, unpublished data. To determine the effect of Zhangfei on Luman, we transfected cells with the reporter plasmid pCAT3BATF6, which contains five copies of UPRE, a plasmid expressing Luman, and varying amounts of a plasmid expressing Zhangfei (pcZF). For our experiments we used a truncated mutant of Luman that lacks its ER-anchoring trans-membrane domain and portions of the protein that lie distal to it (20Raggo C. Rapin N. Stirling J. Gobeil P. Smith-Windsor E. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This mutant, Luman S221Op (serine at position 221 is replaced by an Opal termination codon), is constitutively active and does not require release from intracellular membranes for its activity. Luman S221Op is a powerful activator of transcription. However, in contrast to ER-associated full-length Luman, it is extremely unstable, and we are unable to detect Luman S221Op using anti-Luman serum unless cells expressing the protein are treated with a proteasomal inhibitor such as MG132. In MG132-treated cells Luman S221Op is detected as a 36,000 molecular weight protein. For convenience, for the remainder of this report we will refer to Luman S221Op as Luman. Full-length, ER-anchored Luman will be referred to as FL-Luman. In the absence of Zhangfei, Luman activated CAT almost 100-fold (Fig. 1A, 0 μg of pcZF) over cells transfected with the empty vector. Zhangfei inhibited activation by Luman in a dose-dependent manner (see also Figs. 2A, 2C, 3A, and 3D). To determine the relative levels of Luman and Zhangfei in transfected cells, we examined them by immunoblotting using antisera against either Luman or Zhangfei (Fig. 1B). Cells were either treated with MG132 (+) to allow for the detection of Luman or left untreated (-). As expected, the amount of detectable Zhangfei increased with increasing concentrations of pcZF and MG132 had relatively little effect on the amount of Zhangfei detected. Luman could only be detected in cells that had been treated with MG132. Zhangfei had a profound effect on Luman retained in MG132-treated cells; at 1.25 and 2.5 μg of pcZF, Luman was barely detectable. These results suggested that not only could Zhangfei inhibit the ability of Luman to activate transcription, it also drastically reduced the amount of Luman in the cell by a process that was not affected by MG132. Other inhibitors of proteasomal degradation such as N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were also unable to suppress Zhangfei-induced reduction of Luman in cells (not shown).Fig. 2Zhangfei does not deprive Luman of HCF.A, cells were transfected with 100 ng of pCAT3BATF6 (CAT reporter with five copies of UPRE), 2.5 μg of pcLuS221Op, and 0–2.5 μg of pcZF (squares). Another set of cells (circles), in addition, were also transfected with 1 μg of pSL7, a plasmid expressing functional HCF. CAT activity for each sample is depicted as percent inhibition of activity in samples with no pcZF. B, cells were transfected with of pCAT3BATF6 and an empty vector (pcDNA3)or plasmids expressing either Luman S221Op (Luman), Luman S221Op (N160G), or HSV-VP16. C, cells were transfected with 100 ng of pCAT3BATF6, 2.5 μg of pcLuS221Op, and 0–2.5 μg of vectors expressing Zhangfei (squares), HSV-VP16 (filled circles), HSV-VP16 Y364A, a mutant impaired in its ability"
https://openalex.org/W1973975827,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by brain deposition of toxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), generated from the Abeta precursor protein (APP). APP gene expression is regulated via the proximal promoter region (PPR; -46/-1 in the human sequence; +1 transcription start) and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR; +1/+147). We have recently identified a unique CAGA sequence, ""amyloid"" (+83/+86) present only in the APP gene from amyloid plaque-forming species, absent in all APP-like-proteins' (APLP1 and APLP2) genes. To assay functional activity of PPR + UTR and 5'-UTR regions that either contain or lack the ""amyloid"" box, we tested nine constructs in transient transfection studies. We observed significantly high reporter gene activity with -46/144, -46/100, -46/54, and 54/144 constructs. The 54/100 fragment, which contains a transforming growth factor-beta/ ""amyloid""/interleukin-1 acute box cassette, showed different activity depending on cell type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed distinct DNA-nuclear protein interaction in all fragments, differing among both cell types and specific fragment. Reporter gene expression corroborates with the DNA-protein binding pattern. To directly examine the ""amyloid"" box, we generated oligomers for CAGA mutants or mutated adjacent nucleotides. EMSA results showed that altering ""amyloid"" or adjacent sequence alters specific DNA-nuclear protein interaction in both mutation- and cell-type-specific manners. Reporter gene assay reveals mutant-specific expression effects. Therefore, the -46/54 region appears to be essential for basal expression of the APP gene, the 54/100 and 100/144 regions may have tissue-specific activity, and the ""amyloid"" CAGA box plays a role in APP gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2092741216,"We have examined the dynamics of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding to chromatin in live cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). CREB was found to bind to target sites with a residence time of 100 s, and exposure to a cAMP agonist had no effect on these kinetics. In addition to the basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, a glutamine-rich <i>trans</i>-activation domain in CREB called Q2 also appeared to be critical for promoter occupancy. Indeed, mutations in Q2 that reduced residence time by FRAP assay disrupted target gene activation via CREB in cells exposed to a cAMP agonist. Notably, insertion of the glutamine-rich B <i>trans</i>-activation domain of SP1 into a mutant CREB polypeptide lacking Q2 stabilized CREB occupancy and rescued target gene activation. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which the family of glutamine-rich activators promotes cellular gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1979701600,"Cellular functions of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), a major eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatase, are defined by the association of PP1 catalytic subunits with endogenous protein inhibitors and regulatory subunits. Many PP1 regulators share a consensus RVXF motif, which docks within a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the PP1 catalytic subunit. Although these regulatory proteins also possess additional PP1-binding sites, mutations of the RVXF sequence established a key role of this PP1-binding sequence in the function of PP1 regulators. WT PP1α, the C-terminal truncated PP1α-(1–306), a chimeric PP1α containing C-terminal sequences from PP2A, another phosphatase, PP1α-(1–306) with the RVXF-binding pocket substitutions L289R, M290K, and C291R, and PP2A were analyzed for their regulation by several mammalian proteins. These studies established that modifications of the RVXF-binding pocket had modest effects on the catalytic activity of PP1, as judged by recognition of substrates and sensitivity to toxins. However, the selected modifications impaired the sensitivity of PP1 to the inhibitor proteins, inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2. In addition, they impaired the ability of PP1 to bind neurabin-I, the neuronal regulatory subunit, and GM, the skeletal muscle glycogen-targeting subunit. These data suggested that differences in RVXF interactions with the hydrophobic pocket dictate the affinity of PP1 for cellular regulators. Substitution of a distinct RVXF sequence in inhibitor-1 that enhanced its binding and potency as a PP1 inhibitor emphasized the importance of the RVXF sequence in defining the function of this and other PP1 regulators.

Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) classified mammalian protein serine/threonine phosphatases into two major groups, type-1 and type-2, based in large part on their sensitivity to two endogenous protein inhibitors, inhibitor-1 (I-1) 1The abbreviations used are: I-1, inhibitor-1; I-2, inhibitor-2; PP1, protein phosphatase-1; PP2A, protein phosphatase-2A; WT, wild-type; MYPT1, myosin phosphatase targeting subunit; DARPP-32, dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein; CHRM2, a chimera of PP11–273 and PP2A267–309; GM, skeletal muscle glycogen-targeting subunit; MCLR, microcystin-LR; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Nrb, neurabin-I; GADD34, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein; PKA, protein kinase A; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and inhibitor-2 (I-2). Type-I protein serine/threonine phosphatase or protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), displays unique and potent inhibition by nanomolar concentrations of I-1 and I-2. In contrast, PP2A and other type-2 protein phosphatases are essentially resistant to these inhibitor proteins. To date, more than 50 PP1-interacting proteins have been identified (3Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Some, like I-1 and I-2, function as PP1 inhibitors, whereas others represent targeting subunits that direct subcellular localization and substrate recognition by multiprotein complexes containing PP1 catalytic subunits. Remarkably, PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits share nearly 50% primary sequence identity, which may account for their overlapping substrate specificity in vitro (1Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, all PP1 regulators thus far analyzed demonstrate the unique ability displayed by I-1 and I-2 to selectively associate with PP1 and modify its catalytic function. Detailed structure-function analyses of I-1 (4Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and its neuronal homologue, DARPP-32 (5Desdouits F. Cheetham J.J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Denefle P. Ehrlich M.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), first highlighted the tetrapeptide sequence KIQF, which acts in conjunction with PKA phosphorylation at a conserved threonine to inhibit PP1 activity. Subsequent studies noted a homologous sequence, RVSF, in the skeletal muscle glycogen targeting subunit, GM, that was also required for PP1 binding (6Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cocrystallization of PP1 with a synthetic dodecapeptide encompassing the RVSF sequence from GM established the RVXF motif as a conserved PP1-binding sequence that associates with a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the PP1 catalytic subunit (7Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). There are extensive surface interactions between PP1 and regulatory subunits, as demonstrated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of yeast PP1 (8Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the recently resolved structure of PP1 catalytic subunit complexed with the myosin-targeting subunit, MYPT1 (9Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the ability of RVXF-containing peptides derived from several PP1 regulatory subunits to displace GM from the glycogen-bound PP1 complex suggested a critical role for the RVXF sequence in PP1 binding (7Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions (e.g. Phe to Ala) in the RVXF motif severely impaired or abolished the ability of PP1 regulatory subunits (10Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and inhibitors (4Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to bind and regulate PP1. This emphasized the pivotal role played by the RVXF motif in PP1 binding and regulation. Several studies have identified RVXF-containing PP1-binding proteins using an overlay or far-Western with an isolated PP1 catalytic subunit (11Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Inoue M. Connor J.H. Haystead T.A.

Although this technique successfully identified many regulators, the prototypic PP1 regulators I-1 and I-2 were either weakly or not detected using this technique. This suggested that not all RVXF sequences were equivalent in PP1 binding. Direct binding studies also indicated that the unphosphorylated forms of I-1 (4Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and DARPP-32 (5Desdouits F. Cheetham J.J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Denefle P. Ehrlich M.E.

Although PKA phosphorylation activates these proteins as nanomolar inhibitors of PP1, the covalent modification only modestly increased their affinity for the PP1 catalytic subunit. Comparison of RVXF-containing synthetic peptides modeled on I-1 and GM in their ability to disrupt neuronal PP1 complexes (13Morishita W. Connor J.H. Xia H. Quinlan E.M. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1133-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) also highlighted their differing affinities for PP1. Substituting the PP1-binding motif from nuclear inhibitor of PP1, RVTF, in place of the KIQF sequence normally found in I-1 enhanced its potency as a PP1 inhibitor, and emphasized the key role played by the RVXF sequence in defining the function of PP1 regulators (12Wakula P. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18817-18823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the differences in the association of this conserved sequence with the common binding site on the PP1 catalytic subunit defined its physiological regulation of cellular PP1 regulators. Our earlier studies (14Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that substituted C-terminal sequences from PP2A in PP1α highlighted the diminished ability of the chimeric phosphatase, CHRM2, to bind I-1, I-2, nuclear inhibitor of PP1, and GM. Later studies (15Watanabe T. Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. da Cruze Silva E.F. Hsieh-Wilson L. Allen P.B. Shenolikar S. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3080-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed similar deficits in CHRM2 binding to two other PP1 regulators, PP1 nuclear targeting subunit and spinophilin. Together, these studies suggested that the C-terminal sequences unique to PP1α played a key role in PP1 binding and regulation by cellular proteins. Attempts to reverse these regulatory defects in CHRM2 by systematic substitution of PP1-specific sequences in the PP2A-derived C terminus highlighted a PP1-specific sequence, 290MC291, that enhanced the potency of DARPP-32 as an inhibitor of the modified CHRM2 (15Watanabe T. Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. da Cruze Silva E.F. Hsieh-Wilson L. Allen P.B. Shenolikar S. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3080-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These and other data suggested that Met290 and Cys291, which line the hydrophobic RVXF-binding pocket and interact with the RVXF sequences in GM (7Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and MYPT1 (9Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), played a key role in PP1 regulation by cellular regulators. However, substitution of 290MC291 in CHRM2 had little effect on its decreased inhibition by I-2. This suggested that the hydrophobic pocket on the PP1 catalytic subunit could distinguish RVXF motifs present in different regulators and thereby differentiate the ability of these proteins to regulate PP1 activity. Current studies deleted or substituted C-terminal sequences in PP1α as well as specifically modifying selected amino acids in the hydrophobic pocket of PP1α to define the role of the surface hydrophobic pocket in the recognition of RVXF-containing proteins. Our studies provided the first direct experimental evidence that the affinity of cellular regulators for the PP1 catalytic subunit is dictated by the RVXF sequence present in these proteins, and that the docking of this RVXF sequence in the surface hydrophobic pocket is conserved in all PP1 isoforms. Implications of these findings for the physiological regulation of PP1 in eukaryotic cells will be discussed.

Mutation of the PP1306 Catalytic Subunit—Point mutations L289R, M290K, and C291R were created in human PP1306 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For L289R, the following primers, 5′-GAGTGTGGACGAGACCAGAATGTGCTCTTTCCAGATCCTC and 5′-GAGGATCTGGAAAGAGCACATTCTGGTCTCGTCCACACTC, for M290K, 5′-GTGGACGAGACCCTCAAGTGCTCTTTCCAGATCC and 5′-GGATCTGGAAAGAGCACTTGAGGGTCTCGTCCAC and for C291R, 5′-GTGGACGAGACCCTCATGAGATCTTTCCAGATCC and 5′-GGATCTGGAAAGATCTCATGAGGGTCTCGTCCAC were utilized. All mutations were verified by sequence analysis. Purification of Recombinant PP1α Catalytic Subunits—All PP1α catalytic subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 grown overnight in Luria Broth containing 1 mm MnCl2 and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). Protein expression was induced by addition of 50 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Gold Technologies), with continued growth of the bacteria at 18 °C until A600 of culture was 0.6–0.8. Bacteria were sedimented at 4,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MnCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (Buffer A) containing the protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Bacteria were lysed using French press (∼19,000 p.s.i.), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared lysates were subjected to chromatography on either heparin-agarose or MCLR-Sepharose to isolate PP1 catalytic subunits. For purification on heparin-agarose, bacterial extract was applied to the matrix in Buffer A and washed extensively with Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. PP1 catalytic subunits were eluted with Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions were collected and assayed for PP1 activity. Fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against Buffer A, concentrated using Centricon-10 (Pall Life Sciences), and dialyzed extensively against Buffer A containing 55% (v/v) glycerol prior to storage at –20 °C. Purification of PP1 catalytic subunits on MCLR-Sepharose was undertaken essentially as described by Moorhead et al. (16Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and stored as described above. Preparation of Recombinant PP1 Regulators—GST-I-1 fusion proteins were expressed, and phosphorylated as described (22Connor J.H. Quan H. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 41-58PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: bacteria were lysed by two passages through French press at ∼19,000 p.s.i. The fusion proteins were purified via glutathione-Sepharose according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). GST-neurabin-I-(374–516) and GST-GM-(1–240) were expressed and purified as described (21Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Carmody L.C. Voltz J.W. Connor J.H. Li S. Smith F.D. Milgram S.L. Colbran R.J. Shenolikar S.

At 30-min intervals, aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixture were removed and added to 200 μl of 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). The sample was placed on ice for 2 min, then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was repeatedly washed with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid prior to Cerenkov counting. Once the 32P incorporation reached a plateau (∼90 min), the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 90% saturated ammonium sulfate and placed on ice for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the sedimented protein was washed twice with ice-cold 45% saturated ammonium sulfate. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. For myelin basic protein (MBP), 200 μg of MBP was added to a solution of 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10–20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Then, 10–20 μl of purified PKA was added to the reaction and incubated at 37 °C. 32P incorporation was examined in the same manner as phosphorylase a, and as the 32P incorporation reached a plateau, the reaction was placed in dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), with frequent changes until background 32P diminished. Protein Phosphatase Assays—PP1 catalytic subunits diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were incubated with [32P]phosphorylase a (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min (total reaction volume of 60 μl). Reaction was terminated by addition of 200 μl of 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), and the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. [32P]Phosphate released into the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Assays using MBP as substrate were performed in the same manner, using 10 μm MBP per reaction. To assay PP1 inhibition by I-1, recombinant I-1 was first incubated with 0.3 mg/ml PKA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATPγS, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 72 h. The thiophosphorylated I-1 was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Brij-35, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Thiophosphorylated I-1 was briefly incubated with PP1 before the addition of phosphorylase a. In assays for PP1 inhibition by I-2, the I-2 protein was preincubated with PP1 for 20 min at 37 °C, and targeting subunits were preincubated with PP1 for 5 min at 37 °C prior the initiation of the phosphatase assay. PP1 Sedimentation—GST fusions of PP1 inhibitors and/or targeting subunits were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (25-μl bed volume) equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with TBS, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). They were then washed twice with TBS, and recombinant PP1 was added for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with NETN-250 (250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were stained with Ponceau S to visualize the proteins. Membranes were blocked in 4% milk (w/v) in TBS plus 0.05% Tween, and PP1 detected by immunoblotting with an anti-PP1 antibody. The protein bands were quantified by scanning using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). PP1 Far-Western Blots—PP1 overlays were performed as described (11Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Inoue M. Connor J.H. Haystead T.A. Armbruster B.N. Gupta R.P. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2439-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Protein staining using Ponceau S verified equivalent protein loading. The bound digoxigenin-labeled PP1 was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked) and ECL reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To ensure linearity of the overlay assays in each case, the ECL reaction was exposed to film for 2, 15, and 30 s. For these assays, GST-I-1 was phosphorylated using PKA (0.2 μg/ml), 100 μm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, at 37 °C for 90 min. Phospho-GST-I-1 was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Brij-35, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. GST was similarly phosphorylated using PKA for control pull-down assays. PP1 binding to GST alone was defined as nonspecific and subtracted from that bound to GST fusion proteins containing known PP1 regulators. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA (Pierce) as the standard. Analysis of PP1 Structure—The program Rasmol 2.6 (24Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J.

Prior studies (30Ansai T. Dupuy L.C. Barik S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24401-24407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z. Zhao S. Bai G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13766-13770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that extensive deletions of C-terminal sequences impaired or destabilized PP1α activity. Although recombinant PP1α-(1–297) demonstrated phosphorylase phosphatase activity equivalent to that of full-length PP1α, PP1α-(1–276) was not expressed in bacteria. To focus on the role of the RVXF-binding site conserved in all PP1 isoforms, we expressed PP1α-(1–306) (PP1306), which eliminated the majority of C-terminal residues unique to this PP1 isoform. We also analyzed PP1α and CHRM2, which contains PP1α-(1–273) fused to the C-terminal 43 amino acids from bovine PP2Aα catalytic subunit, previously shown to generate an active phosphorylase phosphatase that was resistant to many PP1 regulators (14Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, we expressed PP1306 with the single amino acid substitutions L289R, M290K, and C291R to modify the RVXF-binding pocket, which introduced residues more commonly found in type-2 phosphatases. Previous studies utilized heparin-agarose to separate PP1 from type-2 protein serine/threonine phosphatases (32DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and purify recombinant PP1 catalytic subunit expressed in E. coli (18Zhang A.J. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete purification of PP1, however, required multiple chromatographic steps and reduced the yields of this protein (18Zhang A.J. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of a recombinant PP1 catalytic subunit, such as CHRM2 (Fig. 1B), purified from bacterial extracts using either heparin-agarose or affinity chromatography with MCLR immobilized on Sepharose (16Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), demonstrated that MCLR-Sepharose yielded an essentially single polypeptide (>95% purity) as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, lane 3). By comparison, chromatography on heparin-agarose (Fig. 1B, lane 2), although eliminating >90% of bacterial proteins, yielded a preparation of CHRM2 that still contained other proteins. MCLR (IC50 < 1 nm) bound PP1 tightly, requiring strong chaotropic agents (e.g. 3 m NaSCN) to elute the phosphatase. However, following dialysis, PP1 preparations purified by either MCLR-Sepharose or heparin-agarose displayed similar phosphorylase phosphatase activity; their specific activities reflected the relative content of the 37-kDa polypeptide representing PP1 catalytic subunit identified by anti-PP1 immunoblots (data not shown). This was consistent"
https://openalex.org/W2057699517,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) influences numerous cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and caspase-independent cell death, by utilizing NAD(+) to synthesize long chains of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) on target proteins, including itself. During the apoptotic response, caspases-3 and -7 cleave PARP-1, thereby inhibiting its activity. Here, we have examined the role of PARP-1 activation and cleavage in the latter stages of apoptosis in response to DNA fragmentation. PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation correlated directly with induction of apoptosis by the lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. A significant decrease in PAR accumulation was observed upon caspase or DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) inhibition. Because DNA fragmentation mediated by DFF40 augmented PARP-1 modification status in apoptotic cells, we hypothesized that PARP-1 alters DFF40 function following PAR accumulation. Indeed, PARP-1, in the presence of NAD(+), significantly decreased DFF40 activity on plasmid substrates. Conversely, PARP-1 enhanced the DNase activity of DFF40 in the absence of NAD(+). The inhibition of DFF40 activity in the presence of NAD(+) was reduced by co-incubation with poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase and a PARP inhibitor. Additionally, caspase-cleaved PARP-1, in the presence of NAD(+), did not inhibit DFF40 activity significantly. Our results suggest that PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a terminal event in the apoptotic response that occurs in response to DNA fragmentation and directly influences DFF40 activity."

Arginine is an energy-rich amino acid that can supply nitrogen, carbon, and energy to various bacteria in a variety of environments. Arginine can be catabolized by a surprisingly large number of routes including the arginase pathway, the arginine deaminase (ADI) 1The abbreviations used are: ADI, arginine deiminase; AST, arginine succinyltransferase; AT, amidinotransferase. pathway, the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway, the arginine transaminase, oxidase, and oxygenase pathways, the arginine decarboxylase pathway, as well as others (1Cunin R.

Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2487-2495PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudomonas aeruginosa has four of these pathways (1Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These pathways often have distinctive functions. For example, the arginine deiminase pathway generates carbamoyl phosphate for substrate level phosphorylation when oxygen is limiting (1Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a particular arginine catabolic pathway may increase the ability of an organism to inhabit a much broader ecological niche. Escherichia coli and related bacteria have two such metabolic routes (EcoCyc; ecocyc.org/ (3Karp P.D. Riley M. Saier M. Paulsen I.T. Collado-Vides J. Paley S.M. Pellegrini-Toole A. Bonavides C. Gama-Castro S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)): the arginine decarboxylase and AST pathways (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AST pathway accounts for 97% of arginine catabolism, whereas the arginine decarboxylase pathway accounts for only 3% (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AST pathway converts the carbon skeleton of arginine into glutamate, with the concomitant production of ammonia and conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and CoA (Fig. 1). The AST pathway consists of five enzymes: arginine succinyltransferase (AstA, EC 2.3.1.109), succinylarginine dihydrolase (AstB, EC 3.-.-.-), succinylornithine transaminase (AstC, EC 2.6.1.-), succinylglutamic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AstD, EC 1.2.1.-), and succinylglutamate desuccinylase (AstE, EC 3.5.1.-), all contained within the astCADBE operon (aruCFGDBE operon in P. aeruginosa (5Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7280-7290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Nitrogen limitation induces transcription of the operon; ast mutants cannot utilize arginine as a nitrogen source and are impaired in ornithine utilization (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one function of the AST pathway is to provide nitrogen during nitrogen restriction. The ammonia produced is assimilated into glutamate and glutamine, which in turn provides nitrogen for the synthesis of virtually all nitrogen-containing compounds. Entry into stationary phase also induces the ast operon, and an ast mutant strain survives only poorly under conditions of carbon starvation (6Fraley C.D. Kim J.H. McCann M.P. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4287-4290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The observed phenotype may result from diminished generation of citric acid cycle intermediates. Slow growth lowers polyamine pools, and nitrogen limitation induces a variety of polyamine catabolic operons (8Reitzer L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The AST pathway has also been proposed to contribute to polyamine homeostasis by controlling levels of intracellular arginine and ornithine, the substrates for putrescine synthesis (8Reitzer L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Because arginine catabolism and the AST pathway perform several important physiological functions in E. coli, analogs of AST intermediates have been suggested as potential antimicrobial agents against pathogenic E. coli (9Shirai H. Mizuguchi K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

N-succinylarginine dihydrolase (AstB), the second enzyme in the AST pathway, converts N-succinylarginine into N-succinylornithine with the release of ammonia and carbon dioxide (Scheme 1). The residues involved in catalysis were proposed to be Asp173, His248, and Cys365, with the cysteine playing the role of a nucleophile (9Shirai H. Mizuguchi K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of AstB from E. coli, its C365S mutant, and their complexes with substrate and product. The protein does indeed have the β/α-propeller fold and contains a Cys–His-Asp catalytic triad with similarity to other amidinotransferases, suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism. The astB gene was cloned into a derivative of the pET-15b vector (Amersham Biosciences). The C365S point mutation was introduced using QuikChange™ mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. The BL21(DE3) strain was transformed by the plasmid DNA, and the cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8 in Circle Grow medium (Bio101 Inc.). Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm in a 1-liter culture that was maintained at room temperature for an additional 15 h. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared by transforming the E. coli methionine auxotroph DL41(DE3) with the plasmid DNA, and the cells were grown in LeMaster medium supplemented with 25 mg/liter of l-selenomethionine for selenomethionine labeling (13Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 4 °C, 25 min) and were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing one dissolved tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice for a total of five 30-s pulses with 45 s between each pulse for cooling. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The protein supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with lysis buffer, and the flow-through fraction was collected and applied to a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed extensively with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm imidazole, 0.4 m NaCl), and bound protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. The protein was subsequently concentrated for crystallization with a concomitant buffer exchange by ultrafiltration to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out at 22 °C on a DynaPro Plate Reader (Protein Solutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superose-12 column equilibrated in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl) connected to an Akta Express fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). A sample of purified AstB was loaded at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and the elution volume, Ve, was determined. The apparent molecular weight was calculated using a standard curve of protein markers from a gel filtration calibration kit (Sigma). The initial crystallization conditions were identified by sparse matrix screening using Screen I and II (Hampton Research, Liguna Niguel, CA). A triclinic crystal form was obtained from the His-tagged, selenomethionine-labeled protein after 5 days at 20 °C in hanging drops containing 2 μl of protein (7.3 mg/ml) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm glutamate) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5). These P1 crystals diffract to 2.3 Å resolution and have unit cell dimensions a = 55.6 Å, b = 93.8 Å, c = 139.4 Å, α = 104.7°, β = 101.5°, and γ = 90.0° with six monomers/asymmetric unit. Three Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction data sets (peak, inflection, and remote) about the selenium K absorption edge were collected at Beamline X8C (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory) using a Quantum-4 CCD area detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation, San Diego, CA) (Table I). An additional data set was collected on a Micromax 007 rotating anode equipped with Osmic mirrors and an HTC image plate detector (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) (Table I).Table IX-ray crystallographic dataCompoundSelenomethionineNativeaCo-crystallized with N-succinylarginine.C365SaCo-crystallized with N-succinylarginine.Space groupP1P1P21P212121P212121Data collectionCell dimensionsa (Å)55.855.6108.654.854.8b (Å)94.293.8106.7167.1167.0c (Å)139.7139.4173.5186.2186.0α (°)75.4104.790.090.090.0β (°)78.4101.599.990.090.0γ (°)89.790.090.090.090.0Z66844Resolution (Å)30-2.25bOverall completeness of data is 92% to 2.25 Å resolution, but all of the data to 1.9 Å resolution were used in the refinement.

Open table in a new tab A monoclinic crystal form diffracting to ∼3 Å resolution was obtained from the same starting protein preparation after 15 days at 20 °C in hanging drops containing 2 μl of protein (4.8 mg/ml) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.6, 0.1 m KCl, 0.25 m MgCl2). These crystals belong to the space group P21 with a = 108.6 Å, b = 106.7 Å, c = 175.5 Å, β = 99.9° and contain eight monomers/asymmetric unit. Sparse matrix screening of AstB in the presence of 5 mm N-succinylarginine resulted in an orthorhombic crystal form of the complex. The best crystals grew in hanging drops containing 2 μl of protein (6 mg/ml) in buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm N-succinylarginine) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.4, 0.2 m calcium acetate). They belong to the space group P212121 with a = 54.9 Å, b = 166.9 Å, c = 186.0 Å and contain four monomers/asymmetric unit. Isomorphous crystals were obtained for the AstB C365S mutant complexed with the substrate. Complete data sets for the wild type enzyme and the C365S mutant co-crystallized with N-succinylarginine were collected to resolutions of 1.95 and 1.7 Å, respectively, at Beamline X25 (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory on a Quantum-315 CCD area detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation)). When native AstB was co-crystallized with the substrate, we observed only the product in the crystal structure. All of the crystal forms were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of mother liquor supplemented with 20% (w/v) glycerol, picked up in a nylon loop, and flash cooled at 100 K in the N2 (gas) cold stream (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The data sets were integrated and scaled using either HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar) or d*trek (15Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). N-Succinylarginine was synthesized as described previously (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the method described by Schneider et al. (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the N-succinylarginine dihydrolase activity was measured in a coupled assay with glutamate dehydrogenase. Purified AstB (32 μg of native or 122 μg of AstB C365S mutant) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 10 mmN-succinylarginine in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 1 ml. Following incubation, 200 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 800 μl of 1 mm ADP (Fluka), 1.7 mm α-ketoglutarate (Sigma), and 2.9 mm NADH. Oxidation of NADH to NAD+ occurs in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. NADH+α-ketoglutarate+NH4+→glutamate+H2O+NAD+Reaction 1 This reaction was followed by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm after addition of 4.9 units (100 μg) of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Control incubations without enzyme or substrate were performed in parallel. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of product/min at 30 °C P1 Crystal Form—This crystal form has six monomers/asymmetric unit. These crystals showed a 2-fold noncrystallographic axis slightly off the crystallographic axis, generating pseudo C2 symmetry that initially confused the structure solution. The Rsym in space group C2 (∼0.08) was very similar to that for data processed in space group P1 (0.06). Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction phasing was initially performed in space group C2 where three independent monomers were expected per asymmetric unit based on the Matthews coefficient of 2.7 Å3/Da (16Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7926) Google Scholar). A total of 26 selenium sites were located from a three-wavelength Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction experiment calculation using the program SOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and were used to calculate an electron density map. Density modification with the program RESOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) resulted in a figure of merit of 0.73. This electron density map was sufficiently clear to build a partial model that was ∼60% complete. However, the quality of the electron density map varied significantly from one molecule in the asymmetric unit to the other and subsequent refinement using CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) stalled at an R factor of 0.48. To eliminate the possibility of systematic errors in the diffraction data as the source of the difficulty, a second data set was collected on this crystal form using a rotating anode source. The diffraction limit for this data set was similar to that of the synchrotron data set, suggesting that this crystal was of better quality. The self-rotation function calculated using this data set merged in space group P1 suggested the presence of noncrystallographic rather than crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The partial model of an AstB molecule built previously from the C2 electron density map was used as a search model for molecular replacement in the second, P21 crystal form described below. Despite the lower resolution of this crystal form, we were able to extend the model to encompass residues 2–440. This improved model was subsequently used to locate six independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the P1 crystal form using the program MOLREP (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). From this point the refinement using CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) decreased the R factor rapidly, confirming the choice of the P1 space group. These data are 92% complete to 2.25 Å resolution, with partial data extending to 1.9 Å resolution. The refinement using all available data converged to an R factor of 0.213 and Rfree of 0.251 (Table I). The final model includes six independent monomers, each containing residues Asn2–Ala19 and His31–Arg441. Residues Gly20–Arg30 are disordered and were not modeled. Difference electron density maps showed a strong peak in each molecule with clear octahedral coordination by oxygen atoms from the surface loop Ala340–Ser346, suggesting a bound metal ion. The ion-oxygen distances were in the range 2.6–3.1 Å with the majority between 2.7 and 2.9 Å. Based on these distances the site is most likely occupied by a sodium or potassium ion. This density was modeled as a potassium ion and yielded reasonable B factors during subsequent refinement. This ion likely plays a structural role because it is far from the active site region. P21 Crystal Form—This crystal form diffracts only to 3 Å resolution and has eight molecules in the asymmetric unit. Initially, molecular replacement using a partial model (see above) located seven monomers in the asymmetric unit. The electron density was sufficient to extend and partially refine the model. Upon completion of the refinement of the model in the P1 crystal form, this refined model was used to locate all eight monomers in the asymmetric unit by molecular replacement (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). This structure was refined using CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) to an Rfree factor of 0.26 and an R of 0.28. The loop Ala19–Arg32 was disordered in seven of the eight molecules. The eighth molecule showed this loop in a closed conformation. Because the resolution of these data is low and there are no substantial difference between these models and the higher resolution P1 form, these coordinates were not deposited. P212121 Crystal Form—The structures of the AstB-substrate complexes were solved by molecular replacement and refined using the program CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Each of the four independent molecules contained residues 2–445. The loop Gly20–Arg30, poorly ordered in other structures, is well ordered in every molecule. A ligand molecule is bound to each monomer of AstB. In addition, ∼600 solvent molecules were positioned in the electron density. The final R factor is 0.217, and Rfree is 0.245 for the complex of AstB with the N-succinylornithine reaction product and for the C365S mutant co-crystallized with the substrate the R factor is 0.202 and Rfree is 0.225 (Table I). Coordinates of wild type AstB in space group P1, AstB-succinylornithine complex, and the C365S mutant of AstB with bound succinylarginine (both in space group P212121) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (21Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27906) Google Scholar) with codes 1YNF, 1YNH, and 1YNI, respectively. Purification, Mutagenesis, and Characterization—Wild type E. coli AstB protein and the C365S mutant were purified to apparent homogeneity as assessed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. The protein forms dimers in solution as determined by dynamic light scattering and gel filtration chromatography. Purified wild type AstB was highly active and had a specific activity of 5.3 units/mg as determined by measuring the release of ammonia upon conversion of N-succinylarginine to N-succinylornithine. A crude extract of nitrogen-limited (i.e. fully induced) wild type E. coli contained 0.025 units/mg total protein activity (4Schneider B.L. Kiupakis A.K. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the purified C365S mutant had a specific activity of only 0.065 units/mg, indicating a crucial role for this cysteine residue in catalysis. Overall Structure of the Monomer—The AstB molecule consists of a single globular domain of 447 amino acids with an α/β topology. The domain forms a propeller composed of five repeats (modules) of a ↓β↑βα↑β motif arranged circularly around 5-fold pseudo symmetry axis (Fig. 2). This fold has been observed previously and is called the α/β five-stranded propeller in the CATH database classification (version 2.5.1) (22Pearl F.M. Lee D. Bray J.E. Sillitoe I. Todd A.E. Harrison A.P. Thornton J.M. Orengo C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the pentein β/α-propeller in the SCOP database classification (24Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three strands of each module form a mixed β-sheet with the first, N-terminal strand of the repeat lying near the central axis of the propeller. The two innermost strands of the module are anti-parallel, with the α-helix forming a cross-over connection to the third β-strand, which is parallel to the second. The α-helix is parallel to this last β-strand and is out of the plane of the β-sheet on the outside of the propeller (Fig. 2). The connections between the modules vary in length and contain either a short 310-helix or α-helix. The first module, which begins with the N terminus of the protein, differs somewhat from the other modules. It starts at the middle β-strand, followed by an α-helix and a third β-strand, whereas the innermost β-strand comes from a C-terminal segment, which follows the fifth module. This organization results in the first (Ala2) and the last (Thr373) residue of the propeller being adjacent to one another. The last ∼75 residues (Glu374–Arg441) fold into a two-helix hairpin stacked against the edges of the first and second modules of the propeller. The loops connecting the secondary structure elements within each module on one end of the sheet are short, whereas the loops on the opposite end are much longer. The connections between the modules are on the latter side and are also comparatively long. Thus one side of the propeller is relatively flat, whereas the opposite side has a more complex topography. The independent molecules within the asymmetric unit of each crystal form and across the different crystal forms are very similar overall. The root mean square deviation between the Cα atoms of molecules across different crystal forms is 0.2–0.4 Å. The only significant difference between the molecules is the conformation of a loop, Ala19–Gln34, which is largely disordered in the apo protein but becomes well ordered in the presence of bound substrate or product. Dimer Formation—Gel filtration and dynamic light scattering studies both indicate that AstB forms homodimers in solution. This is consistent with the presence of homodimers in each of the three crystal forms (Fig. 2c). Each dimer has approximate dimensions of 92 × 62 × 54 Å, with the two monomers being related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. The dimer interface is formed by a bundle of three short helices. The residues contributing to dimerization are from the second module (residues Asn133–Ser139 and Ala164–Leu171), the helix of the third module (residues Glu216–Leu224), and the long loop that connects the first and second modules (residues Arg74–Phe78 and Trp96). These residues include several isoleucines, phenylalanines, alanines, and a proline, giving this surface a partially hydrophobic character. In addition to numerous van der Waals' interactions, the dimer is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds, some of which are bridged by water molecules. The surface area buried upon dimer formation calcu"

Because the early signal transduction events regulating CTGF expression are unclear, we investigated the role of Ca2+ homeostasis in CTGF mRNA expression in TGF-β1- and des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated human lung myofibroblasts. Activation of the kinin B1 receptor with des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that was extracellular Na+-dependent and extracellular Ca2+-dependent. The des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ was blocked by KB-R7943, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+ entry mode operation of the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. TGF-β1 similarly stimulated a KB-R7943-sensitive increase of cytosolic Ca2+ with kinetics distinct from the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated Ca2+ response. We also found that KB-R7943 or 2′,4′-dichlorobenzamil, an amiloride analog that inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity, blocked the TGF-β1- and des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increases of CTGF mRNA. Pretreatment with KB-R7943 also reduced the basal and TGF-β1-stimulated levels of α1(I) collagen and α smooth muscle actin mRNAs. These data suggest that, in addition to regulating ion homeostasis, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger acts as a signal transducer regulating CTGF, α1(I) collagen, and α smooth muscle actin expression. Consistent with a more widespread role for Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in fibrogenesis, we also observed that KB-R7943 likewise blocked TGF-β1-stimulated levels of CTGF mRNA in human microvascular endothelial and human osteoblast-like cells. We conclude that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is required for des-Arg10-kallidin- and TGF-β1-stimulated fibrogenesis and participates in the maintenance of the myofibroblast phenotype.

The CCN family of matricellular proteins is distinguished by a high degree of amino acid homology (50–90%) and conservation of 38 cysteine residues. Like other CCN family members, CTGF is comprised of a secretory signal and four distinct protein modules: an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a von Willebrand factor type C repeat, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal module (1Bork P.

In contrast, activation of the kinin B2 receptor by bradykinin or kallidin does not alter CTGF mRNA levels. The B1 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed following injury or exposure to pro-inflammatory agents such as interleukin-1β (13Phagoo S.B. Reddi K. Anderson K.D.

Des-Arg10-kallidin, the carboxypeptidase metabolite of kallidin, is the only known natural ligand for the human kinin B1 receptor (KD = 0.2 nm), whereas des-arg9-bradykinin activates the B1 receptor in rodents, cows, sheep, guinea pigs, dogs, and cats (18Regoli D.

B1 receptor activation induces a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ with kinetics distinct from those following B2 receptor activation (6Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Grotendorst G.R.

Cytosolic Ca2+ levels are maintained by various transporters in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles. Among the different Ca2+ transporters, the electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is unique because it moves Ca2+ across the membrane bidirectionally depending upon the Na+, Ca2+, and K+ gradients and the membrane potential (19Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Kasir J. Ambudkar S.V. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2505-2510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In most cells, the stoichiometry for this transporter is three Na+ for one Ca2+, although this point is controversial (20Crespo L.M. Grantham C.J. Cannell M.B.

Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform 1 is ubiquitously expressed and has recently been shown to exist in a macromolecular complex that includes PKC, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein, and protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, suggesting that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity may be rapidly regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events (22Schulze D.H.

Fibrotic disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are characterized by excess deposition of extracellular matrix, a chronic process that can lead to organ dysfunction or death. Currently, there is no efficacious intervention that targets fibrogenesis. The foci of myofibroblasts, which are responsible for the synthesis and remodeling of extracellular matrix, represent a hallmark of the histopathology of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (2Kuhn C.

Cells from the human embryonic lung cell line IMR-90 are classified as myofibroblasts and express metavinculin, sm22, α smooth muscle actin, and calponin as well as extracellular matrix proteins including CTGF and type I collagen (27Ehler E.

In this report, we examine the role of Ca2+ homeostasis in the regulation of expression of CTGF, α1(I) collagen, and α smooth muscle actin in IMR-90 myofibroblasts. We report that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is required for des-Arg10-kallidin and TGF-β1 to stimulate increases of CTGF mRNA. In addition, we demonstrate that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is required for basal expression of α1(I) collagen and α smooth muscle actin, genes characteristically expressed in myofibroblasts. Tissue Culture—Human embryonic lung myofibroblasts (IMR-90; Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (0.37 g/100 ml), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm). The experiments were performed on myofibroblasts with population doubling less than 34. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), a kind gift from Dr. Edwin Ades and Francisco J. Candal (Center for Disease Control) and Dr. Thomas Lawley (Emory University), were maintained on MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mm glutamine. The human osteoblast-like cell line MG-63 was maintained on DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cytosolic Ca2+Measurements—Steady-state levels of cytosolic Ca2+ were determined with the fluorescent probe, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Myofibroblasts were grown on coverslips to confluence and placed in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 16 h. The cultures were preincubated for 15 min in physiologic saline solution containing 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/liter NaHPO4, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter MgSO4, and 5 mmol/liter glucose, followed by the addition of 5 μm fura-2 AM for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with physiologic saline solution and immediately placed in a cuvette containing physiologic saline solution at 37 °C. Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored at 510-nm emission wavelength during alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm with a dual wavelength excitation light source spectrofluorometer (DeltaScan; Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ) equipped with a magnetic stirrer and temperature control. Cell fluorescence was corrected for autofluorescence and fura-2 leakage with Mn2+. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from confluent cultures by the single-step method employing guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). RNA purity and quantity were determined spectrophotometrically. RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences). RNA loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal bands and by cohybridization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The membranes were exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography at several different times to ensure that the bands could be quantified by densitometry. The α1(I) collagen probe came from a rat α1(I) collagen cDNA that specifically binds human α1(I) collagen mRNA (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The CTGF probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR as described (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated with RNAwiz (Ambion). RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and purity was determined by absorbance at 280 and 310 nm. RNA (2 μg) was converted to cDNA in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP mix, 500 ng of oligodeoxythymidine, 10 units of RNAsin (Promega), and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C for 60 min followed by 93 °C for 5 min. An aliquot (0.2 μl) of the cDNA was then amplified in an ABI Prism 7000 real time PCR unit, using SYBR green dye and primers for human α smooth muscle actin (GenBank™ accession number X13839): forward primer, 5′-gcaccactatgtaccctggca-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ccgtgatctccttctgcattc-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 959–979 and 988–1008, respectively, and for CTGF (GenBank™ accession number BC087839): forward primer, 5′-atggtcaggccttgcgaag-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-cggatgcactttttgccct-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 994–912 and 937–955, respectively. The results were normalized to real time PCR of human GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number NM_002046), using the forward primer (5′-cacaagaggaagagagagaccctc-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-tgagtgtggcagggactcc-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 1113–1136 and 1145–1163, respectively. Luciferase Assay—IMR-90 myofibroblasts were plated in 6-well plates (350,000 cells/well) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the 3TP-LUX reporter (1 μg/well) mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 4 h, DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics (3 ml/well) was added to the transfection medium, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 20 h. Before experimentation, the cultures were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS without antibiotics for 16 h. Role of Plasma Membrane Na+/Ca2+Exchanger in B1 Receptor-mediated Ca2+Transients—We have previously reported that kinin B1 receptor activation increases cytosolic Ca2+ in a manner that is kinetically distinct from the Ca2+ increase following B2 receptor activation (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that mediate the kinin-induced Ca2+ responses remain uncharacterized. To determine the contribution of extracellular Ca2+ to the kinin-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+, myofibroblasts were assayed for changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in medium prepared without Ca2+ (nominally Ca2+-free). As we previously reported, B1 receptor activation with des-Arg10-kallidin induced a rise in cytosolic Ca2+. In nominally Ca2+-free medium, activation of the B1 receptor did not increase cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 1A). These data strongly suggest that the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is dependent on entry of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, B2 receptor activation with kallidin stimulates an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Many mechanisms may mediate entry of extracellular Ca2+ such as Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. We initially examined the activity of L-type channels and found that the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ was not sensitive to inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels with verapamil (data not shown). The Na+ dependence of the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated Ca2+ response was examined in myofibroblasts incubated in nominally Na+-free medium in which the Na+ content was iso-osmotically replaced with N-methyl d-glucamine and immediately assayed for changes in cytosolic Ca2+. The rise in cytosolic Ca2+ following B1 receptor activation by des-Arg10-kallidin was abrogated in myofibroblasts incubated in nominally Na+-free medium (Fig. 2A). In contrast, B2 receptor activation in nominally Na+-free medium induces a rapid and sustained rise in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these observations indicate that des-Arg10-kallidin stimulates a Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx, suggesting that des-Arg10-kallidin activates Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms 1 and 2 in IMR-90 myofibroblasts was determined by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). We investigated the role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the kinin-stimulated Ca2+ transients using KB-R7943, a novel isothiourea derivative that inhibits Ca2+ entry mode operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by interacting with an extracellular region of the exchanger (30Garcia M.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In KB-R7943-treated myofibroblasts, basal Ca2+ levels are unchanged; however, des-Arg10-kallidin does not induce an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 3). In contrast, B2 receptor activation with kallidin in the presence of KB-R7943 induces a rapid and sustained cytosolic Ca2+ transient (data not shown). These results suggest that the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ observed in des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated myofibroblasts is mediated by Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-Acetate (TPA) Attenuates B1 Receptor-mediated Ca2+Transients—We previously reported that agonist-stimulated levels of CTGF mRNA are reduced in TPA-treated IMR-90 myofibroblasts (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) presumably through modulation of PKC activity. Direct phosphorylation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform 1 by PKC has recently been reported in rat myocytes (22Schulze D.H. Muqhal M. Lederer W.J. Ruknudin A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28849-28855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We now report that basal Ca2+ levels are not changed, and B1 receptor activation with des-Arg10-kallidin does not induce an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in TPA-treated myofibroblasts (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the B2 receptor-mediated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is only slightly diminished in TPA-treated myofibroblasts (Fig. 4B). We also examined the effects of the PKC inhibitors calphostin C and chelerythrine on the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+. Fifteen-minute preincubation with either 500 nm calphostin C or 1 μm chelerythrine does not alter basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels and does not affect the B1 receptor-mediated increases of cytosolic Ca2+ (data not shown). These findings suggest that PKC modulates Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity and are consistent with other observations demonstrating down-regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity by PKC (34Condrescu M. Opuni K. Hantash B.M. Reeves J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Mashburn N.A. Unlap M.T. Runquist J. Alderman A. Johnson G.V. Bell P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F574-F580PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that PKC regulates the exchanger, which in turn regulates CTGF production. However, at the moment we do not know which PKC isoform(s) regulate the exchanger nor which Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform(s) mediate the observed Ca2+ fluxes. Regulation of CTGF and α1(I) Collagen mRNAs by Extracellular Ca2+—The involvement of Ca2+ influx pathways in TGF-β1 signaling pathways has been proposed. Nesti et al. (36Nesti L.J. Caterson E.J.

Sci. 2002; 961: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) described TGF-β1-stimulated, nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ influx in human osteoblasts. McGowan et al. (37McGowan T.A. Madesh M. Zhu Y. Wang L. Russo M. Deelman L. Henning R. Joseph S. Hajnoczky G. Sharma K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F910-F920Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that TGF-β1 stimulated a Ca2+ influx in SV40-transformed murine mesangial cells via cell membrane-associated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. We hypothesized that Ca2+ metabolism modulates TGF-β1 signaling in human lung myofibroblasts. In Fig. 5, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 induces a gradual rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that continues to increase for as long as 40 min after stimulation (filled triangles), at which time the data accumulation was terminated. In contrast, there is no increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in untreated myofibroblasts (filled diamonds). The rise in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by TGF-β1 is abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). Although the kinetics of the TGF-β1-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ are distinct from those observed following B1 receptor activation, we examined the effects of KB-R7943 treatment on TGF-β1-induced increase of cytosolic Ca2+. KB-R7943 blocked the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in response to TGF-β1 (open circles). These data strongly suggest that the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is also mediated by Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. We then examined the role of extracellular Ca2+ in the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA. Myofibroblasts were incubated in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM and stimulated with TGF-β1. Basal expression of CTGF is not altered in Ca2+-free DMEM; however, both the des-Arg10-kallidin- and the TGF-β1-stimulated increases of CTGF mRNA are attenuated (Fig. 6). These findings are consistent with a role for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mediating CTGF mRNA stimulation by both des-Arg10-kallidin and TGF-β1. We also examined the role of extracellular Ca2+ in α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by incubating the myofibroblasts in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM. As observed with CTGF mRNA, the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of α1(I) collagen mRNA is attenuated in myofibroblasts incubated in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of nominally Ca2+-free medium on α1(I) collagen mRNA levels. Confluent human myofibroblasts were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 24 h and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 16 h in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM (–Ca2+) or complete DMEM as indicated. Total RNA was harvested and Northern blotted (10 μg/lane) with probes for α1(I) collagen and GAPDH as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of removal of extracellular Ca2+ on TGF-β-stimulated responses, we transfected IMR-90 myofibroblasts with the TGF-β-responsive, Smad-mediated luciferase reporter 3TP-LUX (38Vivien D. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7134-7141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The myofibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1 in DMEM or in nominally Ca2+-free DMEM. TGF-β1 stimulated an increase of luciferase expression in both DMEM and Ca2+-free DMEM (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that removal of extracellular Ca2+ does not alter Smad-mediated TGF-β1 signaling. We conclude that the attenuation of the TGF-β-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA by the absence of extracellular Ca2+ is not Smad-mediated. Effect of Na+/Ca2+Exchanger Inhibitors on CTGF mRNA in Human Myofibroblasts—To demonstrate that the B1 receptor-induced stabilization of CTGF mRNA is mediated through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, myofibroblasts were treated with dichlorobenzamil (DCB) or KB-R7943. DCB did not change basal expression of CTGF mRNA. However, DCB blocked the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA and attenuated the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA (Fig. 9). Because DCB is an amiloride analog, albeit with low activity for blocking the Na+/H+ exchanger, the effects of more specific Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitors were also assessed. Basal or TGF-β1-stimulated levels of CTGF mRNA were not altered in myofibroblasts treated with amiloride or the more specific Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (data not shown). In KB-R7943-treated myofibroblasts, basal expression of CTGF mRNA did not change. However, activation of the B1 receptor with des-Arg10-kallidin failed to increase CTGF mRNA, and the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA was attenuated. Effect of KB-R7943 on CTGF mRNA in Human Osteoblasts and Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Recent findings reported by Stains and Gay (39Stains J.P. Gay C.V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrate a role for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in osteoblast collagen deposition. We hypothesized that CTGF would be produced in the human osteoblast-like cell line MG-63 in response to TGF-β1. To demonstrate that TGF-β1-induced stabilization of CTGF mRNA is mediated through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, we treated MG-63 cells with KB-R7943. In KB-R7943-treated osteoblasts, basal expression of CTGF mRNA did not change. However, the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA was attenuated in KB-R7943-treated cells (Fig. 10). Because CTGF was originally described in endothelial cells, we examined changes in CTGF mRNA in TGF-β1-stimulated human microvascular endothelial cells that were treated with KB-R7943. As with the osteoblasts, treatment with KB-R7943 did not alter basal expression of CTGF mRNA, but the TGF-β-stimulated increase of CTGF was attenuated (data not shown). Effect of Na+/Ca2+Exchanger Inhibitors on α1(I) Collagen and α Smooth Muscle Actin Expression—We also examined the effect of inhibiting Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger on α1(I) collagen mRNA. Northern blot analyses indicate that, in KB-R7943-treated myofibroblasts, basal expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA and the TGF-β1-stimulated increase of α1(I) collagen mRNA were strongly down-regulated (Fig. 11). To further characterize this modulation of the myofibroblast phenotype, we examined the expression of α smooth muscle actin mRNA in the presence of KB-R7943. IMR-90 myofibroblasts preincubated with KB-R7943 were stimulated with TGF-β1, and changes in α smooth muscle actin mRNA were monitored by real time PCR (Fig. 12) and confirmed by Northern blot analyses (data not shown). In untreated myofibroblasts, TGF-β1 stimulated an increase of expression of α smooth muscle actin mRNA. In KB-R7943-treated myofibroblasts, basal levels and TGF-β-stimulated levels of α smooth muscle actin mRNA were strongly down-regulated. These results strongly suggest that inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity down-regulates the myofibroblast phenotype.Fig. 12Effect of KB-R7943 on α smooth muscle actin mRNA. Confluent human myofibroblasts were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 24 h and pretreated with 20 μm KB-R7943 for 5 min. The cultures were stimulated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 16 h as indicated. The results are the relative fold change of α smooth muscle actin (SMA) mRNA transcripts obtained by real time PCR analysis of three independent experiments normalized with GAPDH as described. The values are the averages of relative fold changes plus standard error. *, p < 0.001 compared with untreated control levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mechanisms by which Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity regulates CTGF, α1(I) collagen, and α smooth muscle actin mRNA levels are unclear. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, has been shown to participate in TGF-β-stimulated extracellular matrix accumulation (42Gooch J.L. Gorin Y. Zhang B.X. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15561-15570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In turn, calcineurin has been shown to regulate transcription of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms (43Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe changes in CTGF, α1(I) collagen, and α smooth muscle actin mRNA levels in quiescent and TGF-β-stimulated myofibroblasts that were treated for 4 or 16 h with the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (data not shown). Further experimentation is required to definitively conclude that calcineurin does not participate in these responses. In this report, we characterize the role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in fibrogenesis. Using des-Arg10-kallidin- and TGF-β1-stimulated human myofibroblasts, we investigated the role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in early agonist-stimulated signal transduction events. Our results demonstrate that activation of the kinin B1 receptor induces an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ that is mediated through Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. We previously reported that activation of the B1 receptor (but not the B2 receptor) increases the stability of CTGF mRNA (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that the B1 receptor-induced increase of CTGF mRNA is blocked by KB-R7943. From these results, we conclude that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is required for the B1 receptor-mediated increase in CTGF mRNA stability. These results suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is functionally coupled to B1 receptor activation and that CTGF mRNA stability is modulated by cation homeostasis. It is important to note that a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ per se is not sufficient to induce an increase in CTGF mRNA. Although increased cytosolic Ca2+ is required for the TGF-β1- and the B1 receptor-stimulated increases of CTGF mRNA, kallidin, which also mobilizes intracellular Ca2+, does not induce an increase in CTGF mRNA (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 also induces KB-R7943-sensitive increases in cytosolic Ca2+ and CTGF mRNA, suggesting that TGF-β1 induces an increase of CTGF mRNA stability in addition to the previously reported increase in CTGF transcription. However, regulation of TGF-β1-stimulated CTGF transcription by Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger cannot be ruled out at this moment. Furthermore, basal expression of CTGF mRNA is not sensitive to inhibition of Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Taken together, these results suggest that in quiescent human lung myofibroblasts expression of CTGF may be mediated through both TGF-β-dependent and TGF-β-independent mechanisms. These results are important because they show that two divergent agonists modulate CTGF mRNA levels via convergence on Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, suggesting a commonality for this mechanism in CTGF mRNA stability. Furthermore Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity appears to play a central role in the TGF-β-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA in human lung myofibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells, and osteoblast-like cells. We previously reported that TGF-β1 stimulates CTGF transcription (12Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and others have shown this process to be mediated via Smad signaling (40Chen Y. Blom I.E. Sa S. Goldschmeding R. Abraham D.J. Leask A. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Herrick D.J. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Rosenbloom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The luciferase experiments demonstrate that, in TGF-β1-stimulated myofibroblasts, Smad-mediated responses are not significantly affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that Smad-mediated signaling is not affected by changes in Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity. In addition, these experiments demonstrate that the myofibroblasts are responsive to TGF-β1 stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Thus, it appears that both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms modulate the TGF-β-stimulated increase of CTGF mRNA. Quiescent IMR-90 myofibroblasts express α1(I) collagen and α smooth muscle actin, genes characteristically expressed in myofibroblasts. We show that inhibition of Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger attenuates basal and TGF-β1-stimulated levels of α1(I) collagen and α smooth muscle actin mRNAs, suggesting that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is required for maintenance of the myofibroblasts phenotype. Together, these findings suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, functioning as a Ca2+ influx pathway, plays an important and novel role in fibrogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, Stains and Gay (39Stains J.P. Gay C.V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have recently shown by immunocytochemistry that the secretion of type (I) collagen and bone sialoproteins is reduced in KB-R7943-treated osteoblasts. A relationship among TGF-β, fibrogenesis, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has been suggested by prior studies reporting an increase in Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mRNA expression in the setting of fibrosis or pro-fibrotic agents. Nakamura et al. (44Nakamura T. Arii S. Monden K. Furutani M. Takeda Y. Imamura M. Tominaga M. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5389-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that fibrosis is associated with increased expression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in hepatic stellate cells. Carrillo et al. (45Carrillo C. Cafferata E.G. Genovese J. O'Reilly M. Roberts A.B. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TGF-β increases Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mRNA levels via a PKC-sensitive pathway. In vivo induction of fibrosis in rats with CCl4 was also associated with an increase in liver Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mRNA. Our studies extend these observations, highlighting the necessity of the Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger for CTGF mRNA expression and fibrogenesis in human lung myofibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger expression is a biomarker for fibrosis and a potential target for intervention. In conclusion, our data suggest that Ca2+ entry mode operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plays an integral role in the expression of CTGF, α1(I) collagen, and α smooth muscle actin, implicating an important role for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the maintenance of the myofibroblast phenotype. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that regulation of CTGF expression by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a mechanism shared by various cell types and that calcium metabolism plays an important role in the expression of genes associated with fibrosis. Based on these findings we speculate that targeting Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity may be an efficacious intervention for the treatment of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2025179624,"During mitosis, transcription is silenced and most transcription factors are displaced from their recognition sequences. By in vivo footprinting analysis, we have confirmed and extended previous studies showing loss of transcription factors from an RNA polymerase II promoter (c-FOS) and, for the first time, an RNA polymerase III promoter (U6) in HeLa cells. Because little was known about nucleosomal organization in mitotic chromosomes, we performed footprinting analysis for nucleosomes on these promoters in interphase and mitotic cells. During interphase, each of the promoters had a positioned nucleosome in the region intervening between proximal promoter elements and distal enhancer elements, but the strong nucleosome positioning disappeared during mitosis. Thus, the nucleosomal organization that appears to facilitate transcription in interphase cells may be lost in mitotic cells, and nucleosome positioning during mitosis does not seem to be a major component of the epigenetic mechanisms to mark genes for rapid reactivation after this phase.

On condensed chromosomes of higher eukaryotic cells during mitosis, transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases is silenced (1Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Most transcription factors are displaced from their recognition sequences in promoter regions during mitosis (2Hershkovitz M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) although the proteins are still present in the cells, and many of them retain normal DNA binding activities in extracts from mitotic cells. Upon exit from mitosis, previously active genes resume transcription, whereas previously inactive genes remain silent. This “cell memory” suggests that some kind of epigenetic information in chromatin survives mitosis and guides correct reestablishment of transcription complexes in previously active promoters (2Hershkovitz M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Michelotti E.F. Sanford S. Levens D. Nature. 1997; 388: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To better understand the structure and roles of mitotic chromatin, we have performed high resolution in vivo footprinting analysis of the promoter regions of the human c-FOS and U6 small nuclear RNA genes during mitosis, especially focusing on nucleosomal organization. We chose these genes because each of them has a nucleosome strongly positioned in the middle of the promoter region (5Herrera R.E. Nordheim A. Stewart A.F. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Zhao X. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15084-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) between proximal promoter elements and distal enhancer elements (Fig. 1), at least during interphase, which seemed to simplify our analysis of mitotic nucleosomal organization. Such nucleosomes have been observed in several genes of higher eukaryotes (8Thomas G.H. Elgin S.C.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Schild C. Claret F-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the positioning of these nucleosomes potentiates transcription by locating the cisacting elements in the adjacent linker regions, where the access of transcription factors to DNA is not prevented and by winding the intervening DNA sequences around the histone cores to bring into juxtaposition the widely separated elements and the factors bound to them. In this study, we found that the complex nucleoprotein structures of the c-FOS and U6 promoters were dissociated during mitosis; not only were the transcription factors displaced, but the nucleosome positioning disappeared. Cell Culture—The HeLa S3 cell line was provided by the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). The cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Asynchronously growing cells were harvested by trypsinization. We collected mitotic cells by shaking them off the surfaces of the flasks after treatment with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h (3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C.

For preparation of cells released from mitotic arrest, the mitotic cells collected as described above were allowed to proceed through the cell cycle and to adhere to the surfaces in nocodazole-free medium for 5 h and then were harvested by trypsinization. The mitotic indexes of these cell preparations were determined by microscopy after hypotonic treatment, fixation, and Giemsa staining. Treatment with Dimethyl Sulfate—DNA extracted from untreated cells (0.3 μg/μl) was treated in vitro with 0.05% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) 1The abbreviations used are: DMS, dimethyl sulfate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; TD-PCR, terminal transferase-dependent PCR; pol, RNA polymerase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; CRE, cAMP response element; DR, direct repeat; SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor. at 20 °C for 5 min as described previously (11Pfeifer G.P.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 548-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. Irradiation with UV Light—In vitro treatment of DNA with UV light was performed by exposure of 100-μl ice-cold droplets containing 0.1 μg/μl DNA, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EDTA to 1500 J/m2 short wavelength UV light from germicidal lamps. The dose rate of UV light was 23–25 J/m2/s. The cells suspended in ice-cold PBS in plastic dishes were irradiated with 1500 J/m2 UV light, recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in TBS, and lysed. Treatment with 4,5′,8-Trimethylpsoralen—Treatment with psoralen plus long wavelength UV light was done essentially as described previously (13Komura J. Ikehata H. Hosoi Y. Riggs A.D. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DNA (0.1 μg/μl) was treated in vitro with 2.5 μm psoralen and 20 kJ/m2 UV light. The dose rate of UV light was 43–46 J/m2/s. The cells suspended in ice-cold PBS containing 2.5 μm psoralen in plastic dishes were irradiated with 40 kJ/m2 UV light, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in TBS, and lysed. Treatment with DNase I—DNA (0.1 μg/μl) was digested in vitro with 0.1 unit/ml DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at 23 °C for 5 min as described previously (7Komura J. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15084-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with DNase I was performed essentially as described (11Pfeifer G.P. Chen H.H. Komura J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 548-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in ice-cold solution I containing lysolecithin (0.0025% for mitotic cells and 0.01% for asynchronous and released cells), immediately collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in solution II containing 3 units/ml DNase I. After incubation at 23 °C for 3 min, they were lysed by the addition of 4 volumes of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 12.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.625% SDS, and 0.375 mg/ml proteinase K. Analysis by Ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) and Terminal Transferase-dependent PCR (TD-PCR)—LM-PCR and TD-PCR were carried out by use of the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche) in the PCR step as described previously (13Komura J. Ikehata H. Hosoi Y. Riggs A.D. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DMS-treated DNA (1 μg/sample) and UV light-irradiated DNA (2 μg/sample) were subjected to LM-PCR after piperidine cleavage, whereas DNase I-digested DNA (1 μg/sample) was directly subjected to LM-PCR. Psoralen-treated DNA (2 μg/sample) was subjected to TD-PCR following restriction digestion (PvuII for c-FOS analysis, SacI for U6 analysis, and PstI for c-MYC analysis) and alkaline reversal. Two sets of primers specific for the human U6 gene were used: the primer set U6A (primer U6A1, 5′-CCAAGGTCGGGCAGGAAGAG, nucleotides –266 to –247 relative to the transcription start site; U6A2, 5′-GCAGGAAGAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT, –256 to –229; U6A3, 5′-GGCCTATTTCCCATGATTCCTTCATA, –246 to –221) and the primer set U6H (U6H1, 5′-CGAAGCGAGCACGGTGTT, +12 to –6; U6H2, 5′-GCACGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATA, +4 to –25; U6H3, 5′-GTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGA, –9 to –38). We used DNA fragments from –743 to –123 and from –152 to +372 as templates when synthesizing radioactive U6 probes with primers U6A3 and U6H3, respectively. The c-MYC P2 promoter was analyzed by use of the primer set MYCA (MYCA1, 5′-AGGGTCTGGACGGCTGAGGA, –180 to –161; MYCA2, 5′-CTGAGGACCCCCGAGCTGTGCTG, –167 to –145; MYCA3, 5′-CCCCCGAGCTGTGCTGC, –160 to –144) and the DNA fragment from –296 to +320. The primer sets and the DNA fragment for c-FOS analysis have been described previously (13Komura J. Ikehata H. Hosoi Y. Riggs A.D. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Displacement of Transcription Factors from Recognition Sequences during Mitosis—Using four footprinting agents, DMS, UV light, 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen, and DNase I, we analyzed the local chromatin structure of the c-FOS and U6 promoters in three populations of HeLa cells: “asynchronous cells” (mainly interphase, mitotic index = 4%), “mitotic cells” (arrested with nocodazole and collected by shake-off, mitotic index = 98%), and “released cells” (incubated for 5 h after the release from mitotic arrest, mitotic index = 3%). The cells were treated with one of the footprinting agents, and then the genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to LM-PCR or TD-PCR. As a control, naked DNA was treated in vitro with the agent. We discerned footprints by comparing the resultant pattern of in vivo formation of DNA damage along a specific sequence with the pattern of in vitro formation. The results of the analysis of the proximal and distal regions of the c-FOS promoter are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Those of the U6 promoter are shown in Figs. 4 and 5.Fig. 3In vivo footprinting analysis of the upper strand of the distal region of the c-FOS promoter. The primer set FOSE was used.

Chen H.H. Komura J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 548-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although it is insensitive to histone-DNA interactions. Treatment of asynchronous cells with this agent produced footprints (usually the sites of G residues protected from alkylation but sometimes the sites of hyper-reactive G residues) at or near various cis-acting elements in these promoters (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, the upper parts of lanes 3 and 4). For example, clear protection was found at the cAMP response element (CRE) and at the direct repeat (DR) in the promoter of the c-FOS gene (Fig. 2), which is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II), and at the proximal sequence element in the promoter of the U6 gene (Fig. 4), which is transcribed by pol III. We observed that in contrast to asynchronous cells, mitotic cells had no DMS footprints in these promoters (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, lanes 5 and 6). The displacement of transcription factors from their recognition sequences during mitosis had been reported previously for three human pol II promoters (2Hershkovitz M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C.

We confirmed this phenomenon in another pol II promoter and, for the first time, in a pol III promoter. In the cells released from mitotic arrest, the footprints reappeared (lanes 7 and 8). Transcription factors can modulate the induction of (6-4) photoproducts as well as cyclobutane dimers by UV light at the sites of dipyrimidines (15Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Piperidine cleavage of UV light-irradiated DNA enables the detection of (6-4) photoproducts by LM-PCR. In most parts of the c-FOS and U6 promoters in UV light-irradiated asynchronous cells, the modulation of (6-4) photoproduct induction was rather weak (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, lanes 11 and 12). The strongest enhancement was seen at the 5′-TTTT sequence at position –25 to –28 on the lower strand of the c-FOS promoter (Fig. 2). These nucleotides are in the TATA box (5′-TATAAAAG on the upper strand). The unusual formation of (6-4) photoproducts at the 5′-TT dinucleotides in vivo should be due to the severe bending of DNA caused by the interaction of TATA-binding protein (TBP) with the TATA box (12Komura J. Sheardown S.A. Brockdorff N. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10975-10980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol.

Previous cytochemical and immunological studies have revealed that during mitosis at least a fraction of TBP remains associated with condensed chromosomes, especially with previously active genes on them, in contrast to most of the other sequence-specific transcription factors (10Christova R. Oelgeschläger T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Segil N. Guermah M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Heintz N.

Based on these observations, it has been proposed that TBP (or TFIID) marks the genes that should be reactivated after mitosis. Therefore, we expected the persistence of the UV light footprint at the TATA box during mitosis. Contrary to our expectation, mitotic cells failed to show the footprint at the TATA box of the c-FOS promoter (Fig. 2, lanes 13 and 14), suggesting the loss of the DNA bending and hence the loss of the direct binding of TBP to the TATA box. In addition to the c-FOS promoter, another pol II promoter exhibited the disappearance of the UV light footprint at the TATA box during mitosis; as shown in Fig. 6, enhancement of (6-4) photoproduct induction at the 5′-TTTT sequence at position –23 to –26 on the lower strand of the P2 promoter of the c-MYC gene was observed in asynchronous cells but not in mitotic cells. These results do not support the idea that the direct binding of TBP to the TATA boxes is maintained during mitosis. We speculate that the association of TBP with DNA in mitotic chromatin may be indirect; TBP should be in a large complex, and some members of the complex may remain associated with DNA or structural proteins of chromosomes even during mitosis. For example, some of TBP-associated factors (TAF) can form a histone octamer-like structure that interacts with DNA, and TAFII250 has bromodomains that may recognize acetylated histone (19Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The situation may be similar to that of TATA-less promoters. In fact, it has been reported that TBP remains associated with a TATA-less gene (ets-2) as well as genes with TATA boxes during mitosis (10Christova R. Oelgeschläger T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As to the U6 promoter, we could not analyze the occupancy of its TATA box by using the UV light footprinting assay (Fig. 4, lanes 9–16), because this TATA box (5′-TATATAT at position –29 to –23) did not contain dipyrimidines, the targets of UV light. Thus, the protein binding status of the TATA box of this pol III-transcribed gene is formally unknown, although DNase I footprinting (Fig. 4, lanes 25–32) revealed that a large footprint (at nucleotides –71 to –20) over the proximal sequence element and the TATA box disappeared during mitosis, implying the dissociation of a large protein complex from this region. We presume that the association of some other sequence-specific transcription factors with DNA in mitotic chromatin may also be indirect. Immunocytochemical studies, which have limited resolution, have revealed a few exceptional transcription factors that remain associated with chromosomes during mitosis (3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Gauthier-Rouvière C. Cavadore J-C. Blanchard J.-M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, serum response factor (SRF) has been found to be retained on mitotic chromosomes, but our analysis of the c-FOS promoter showed that the DMS footprint at the serum response element (SRE), which is recognized by SRF, did not persist during mitosis (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 3). This might be due to the interactions of SRF with other DNA-binding proteins such as high mobility group proteins (21Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Spencer J.A. Baron M.H. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15686-15693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The transcription factors that remain associated with chromatin during mitosis, such as TBP and SRF, are potential candidates for epigenetic marks of gene activity (4Michelotti E.F. Sanford S. Levens D. Nature. 1997; 388: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Christova R. Oelgeschläger T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Chen D. Hinkley C.S. Henry R.W. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but our results mentioned above suggest that even these proteins may lose direct contact with their target DNA sequences. Disappearance of Nucleosome Positioning during Mitosis— 4,5′,8-Trimethylpsoralen is an agent suitable for mapping translational positions of nucleosomes (23Lucchini R. Wellinger R.E. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7294-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), because formation of DNA interstrand cross-links by this agent is inhibited by histone octamers as well as transcription factors. Our high resolution method for detecting psoralen cross-links (7Komura J. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15084-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 13Komura J. Ikehata H. Hosoi Y. Riggs A.D. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) clearly showed large areas of protection from cross-linking, which corresponded to the positioned nucleosomes in the c-FOS and U6 promoters in asynchronous cells (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, the lower parts of lanes 19 and 20). We should point out the difficulty in determining nucleosome boundaries with single-nucleotide resolution caused by the strong sequence specificity of psoralen and the possibility that the nucleosome may have a set of overlapping positions rather than a single fixed position in each promoter (24Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, psoralen footprinting revealed that the nucleosome positioning in these promoters was quite strong. For example, the reduction of the signal at the 5′-TA sequence at nucleotides –177 and –178 in the c-FOS promoter (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 2) in asynchronous cells was more than 10-fold as compared with naked DNA, and the probability that this sequence was in the linker region appeared very low in this cell population. In contrast to asynchronous cells, mitotic cells did not have the large footprints; the distribution patterns of psoralen cross-links in mitotic cells (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, lanes 21 and 22) were similar to those of naked DNA (lanes 17 and 18). Because it has been demonstrated that core histones remain associated with mitotic chromosomes (3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 18Chen D. Hinkley C.S. Henry R.W. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we suppose that our result indicates the disappearance of nucleosome positioning, i.e. the random or near random distribution of nucleosomes in these promoters during mitosis, although the possibility of the detachment or modification of the positioned nucleosomes is not formally excluded. In the case of the U6 promoter, we noticed a slight difference between the pattern of cross-linking in mitotic cells and that of naked DNA (Fig. 4); the region around the transcription start site was somewhat more reactive in mitotic cells than in naked DNA, suggesting that there might remain some kind of irregularity during mitosis. DNase I treatment of asynchronous cells produced a cleavage pattern with a periodicity of ∼10 nucleotides in the region of the positioned nucleosome in the c-FOS promoter (Figs. 2 and 3, lanes 27 and 28). Because DNase I attacks nucleosomal DNA preferentially at the sites furthest from the surface of the histone octamer, the periodicity suggests that the DNA helix of this region assumed highly preferred rotational orientation on the histone surface within the population of cells (25Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mitotic cells did not show clear periodicity (lanes 29 and 30), and the cleavage patterns were similar to those of naked DNA (lanes 25 and 26). Thus, not only the translational positioning but the rotational phasing of the nucleosome in the c-FOS promoter seemed to disappear during mitosis. We also noticed similar periodicity in the U6 promoter of asynchronous cells (Figs. 4 and 5), but the cleavage patterns were somewhat irregular, and in addition, resembled those of naked DNA, making the interpretation of rotational orientation in this promoter ambiguous. The footprinting data described above can be summarized as in Fig. 7. Most aspects of the nucleoprotein complexes in the c-FOS and U6 promoters were lost during mitosis; all of the sequence-specific binding of transcription factors that was detectable in interphase cells was not found in mitotic cells. The nucleosome positioning that appeared to facilitate the communication between proximal promoter elements and distal enhancer elements through looping out of the intervening DNA in interphase cells was not observed during mitosis. The association of the unique organization with mitotic chromatin, where transcription is repressed, argues that the disappearance of nucleosome positioning, as well as the displacement of transcription factors, may be among the various mechanisms contributory to the repression (1Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), at least of these genes. We presume that the disappearance of nucleosome positioning and the displacement of transcription factors may also contribute to the formation of highly condensed mitotic chromosomes of higher eukaryotes. A possibility has been pointed out that uniformity of internucleosomal distances, which is brought about by adjustment or sliding of nucleosomes, may improve the folding of chromatin into higher order structures (27Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The absence of large transcription complexes might also improve the regular stacking of nucleosomes in higher order structures. Because positioned nucleosomes are observed usually in the vicinity of regulatory sequences, it will be important to determine whether the disappearance of nucleosome positioning during mitosis is unique to the c-FOS and U6 genes or occurs in many genes. As far as we are aware, nucleosome positioning in mitotic cells has not been analyzed except for our study, but low resolution DNase I analysis of a few genes during mitosis has been performed: in the human heat shock protein 70 gene, DNase I-hypersensitive sites appear to be retained on mitotic chromosomes, leading to a speculation that the chromatin organization of the promoter is maintained during mitosis (3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In the chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, however, the locations of some of the hypersensitive sites seem to differ between interphase and mitotic chromatin (28Kuo M.T. Iyer B. Schwarz R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4565-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results do not appear to be consistent with the preservation of the local chromatin organization during mitosis. These discrepancies remain to be resolved. The concurrence of the disappearance of nucleosome positioning and the displacement of transcription factors suggests a possibility of a causal relationship between the two phenomena. Assuming that there are similar levels of DNA-histone interactions during interphase and during mitosis, our results seem to imply that the transcription factors bound to the cisacting elements can function very effectively as boundaries restricting the location of nucleosomes, supporting the notion that in vivo nucleosome positions are determined predominantly by transcription factors (25Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29McPherson C.E. Shim E-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, we feel that this assumption may require validation, because it has been reported that the human SNF/SWI complexes are inactivated, degraded, or excluded from chromatin during mitosis (30Muchardt C. Reyes J-C. Bourachot B. Legouy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this case, the loss of the chromatin remodeling activity probably leads to the loss of the ability to activate target genes by modifying the local nucleosomal organization. It will be interesting to see whether other chromatin remodeling complexes are active in mitotic chromatin and increase the mobility of nucleosomes and the fluidity of chromatin when chromatin is being remodeled into condensed chromosomes. Cells should inherit their characteristic patterns of gene expression and silencing through successive cycles of cell division. In mitotic cells, we observed the loss of all of the detectable sequence-specific binding of transcription factors in the c-FOS and U6 promoters, confirming previous reports on the phosphoglycerate kinase 1, heat shock protein 70, and U2 genes (2Hershkovitz M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Martínez-Balbás M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Boyd D.C. Pombo A. Murphy S. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The dissociation of transcription complexes during mitosis and their reassembly after this phase in previously active genes suggest that the reassembly is directed by the information that somehow survives mitosis. Various mechanisms of the transfer of the epigenetic information through mitosis have been proposed, including chemical modifications of DNA and histones, and proteins that recognize these modifications (32Jeppesen P. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Dey A. Chitsaz F. Abbasi A. Misteli T. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8758-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and it has been argued that perhaps only several mechanisms acting together can provide the required fidelity of the information transfer (2Hershkovitz M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An attractive scenario is that some protein molecule that remains attached to chromatin during mitosis (e.g. TBP) can exclude nucleosomes from the binding sites of other transcription factors in its vicinity and facilitate the reoccupancy of the sites by the transcription factors and the reassembly of the transcription complex after mitosis (4Michelotti E.F. Sanford S. Levens D. Nature. 1997; 388: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Christova R. Oelgeschläger T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The absence of the footprints of transcription factors from mitotic chromosomes in this and previous studies does not exclude the possibility of the protein binding that has not been detected yet, especially the indirect binding. However, we observed the loss of nucleosome positioning during mitosis, and this is not consistent with the exclusion of nucleosomes from the recognition sequences of transcription factors. Thus, at least in the c-FOS and U6 promoters, the physical location of nucleosomes does not seem to be a major component of the mechanisms of the transfer of epigenetic information through mitosis.

https://openalex.org/W2034058171,"Sidekick-1, a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is up-regulated in glomerular podocytes in the collapsing glomerulopathy of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Sidekick-1 and its ortholog sidekick-2 have also been shown to function as neuronal targeting molecules, guiding developing neurons to specific synapses. In the current work, we overexpress mouse sidekick-1 and -2 in HEK 293 T cells in order to characterize their binding specificities. Cells transiently transfected with either sidekick-1 or -2 cDNA formed separate aggregates when mixed together, demonstrating that sidekicks are homophilic adhesion molecules. The transfection of the short splice variant (lacking the first two Ig domains) or a construct encoding sidekick-1 with the second Ig domain deleted both resulted in nearly abolished adhesion. A beta-sheet strand peptide containing the sequence QLVILA corresponding to an amino acid sequence in the second Ig domain of sidekick-1 showed specific interaction with the recombinant first Ig domain-His protein of sidekick-1. Cells expressing a mutant sidekick-1 where the binding sequence QLVILA is deleted failed to mediate significant adhesion. Furthermore, cells transfected with a chimeric sidekick, where the first two Ig domains of sidekick-2 are replaced with the corresponding two Ig domains of sidekick-1, form aggregates with sidekick-1-transfected cells. The reverse chimera, where the first two Ig domains of sidekick-2 are substituted onto sidekick-1, was similarly able to form aggregates with sidekick-2-transfected cells. These results establish that the first and second Ig domains of sidekick-1 and -2 are necessary and sufficient to mediate and target homophilic adhesion, and the QLVILA sequence is critical to the interaction. Understanding these functional domains has widespread implications in normal development and HIVAN pathogenesis."

We previously showed that Vac8 acylation occurs early in the fusion reaction, is blocked by antibodies against Sec18 (yeast N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)), and is mediated by the R-SNARE Ykt6. Here we analyzed the regulation of this reaction on purified vacuoles. We show that Vac8 acylation is restricted to a narrow time window, is independent of ATP hydrolysis by Sec18, and is stimulated by the ion chelator EDTA. Analysis of vacuole protein complexes indicated that Ykt6 is part of a complex distinct from the second R-SNARE, Nyv1. We speculate that during vacuole fusion, Nyv1 is the classical R-SNARE, whereas the Ykt6-containing complex has a novel function in Vac8 palmitoylation.

The post-translational modification of a protein can change its conformation, subcellular localization, and function. Thus, such highly consequent alterations must be tightly controlled in time and space.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On yeast vacuoles, Ykt6 was found in association with the glutamine (Q)-SNAREs Vam3, Vam7, and Vti1, the R-SNARE Nyv1, and the AAA-ATPase Sec18 and its co-factor Sec17 (yeast NSF/α-SNAP), indicating that that all these proteins form one complex, the cis-SNARE complex (16Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is the putative result of a previous round of fusion (21Wang C.W. Stromhaug P.E. Kauffman E.J. Weisman L.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Vac8 is also found in this complex (8Veit M. Laage R. Dietrich L. Wang L. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), proximal to Ykt6 (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fusion of isolated vacuoles is initiated when Sec18/17 disassemble the cis-SNARE complex in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (22Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 23Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This priming reaction allows the vacuolar SNAREs to interact in trans (docking), which leads to lipid mixing. We previously observed that priming and Vac8 palmitoylation occur simultaneously. Since both reactions were also sensitive to antibodies against Sec18, we speculated that Vac8 acylation might be dependent on the priming reaction (8Veit M. Laage R. Dietrich L. Wang L. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the situation turned out to be more complicated, since antibodies to Sec17, which also inhibit priming, do not affect Vac8 acylation (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We therefore proposed that, at the onset of in vitro vacuole fusion, two Sec18-dependent reactions are triggered: (a) together with Sec17, Sec18 mediates priming; and (b) in a reaction independent (or upstream) of Sec17, Sec18 regulates Vac8 acylation (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that all proteins involved in these two reactions are part of, or associated to, the cis-SNARE complex suggested to us that Vac8 acylation is a regulated event dependent on specific components of a SNARE subcomplex. With this study we have characterized the regulation of Vac8 palmitoylation during in vitro vacuole fusion and the composition of vacuolar SNARE complexes in more detail. Biochemical Reagents and Antibodies—[9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). [3H]Pal-CoA was synthesized with [3H]palmitate and acyl-CoA synthetase as described (24Veit M. Dietrich L.E. Ungermann C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma or Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), unless indicated. All reagents added to vacuoles were prepared in, or dialyzed into, PS buffer (10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) unless indicated otherwise. Antibodies used were anti-hemagglutinin epitope (HA) monoclonal antibody (BabCO) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Vam3, Nyv1, Vti1, Vam7, Ykt6, Sec17 (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and His-tagged GFP (this study). Unless indicated, Nyv1-HA was detected with anti-HA antibody. Antibodies to GFP were raised in New Zealand White rabbits and affinity-purified as described (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) immobilized pure protein. Preparations of IgGs and affinity-purified antibodies were as described (26Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Yeast Strains and Molecular Biology—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are listed in Table I. Yeast were cultured in yeast extractpeptone-glucose. Nyv1 was C-terminally tagged with 6xHA by transformation of a PCR fragment containing the tag and a TRP1 marker into BJ3505 (CUY001) (27Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Construction of the yeast strain CUY1250 containing internally GFP-tagged Ykt6 was as follows. DKY6281 (CUY002) was transformed with pRS416-YKT6pr-YKT6WT (47Dietrich L.E.P. Peplowska K. LaGrassa T.J. Hou H. Rohde J. Ungermann C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and endogenous YKT6 was deleted by replacement of the open reading frame with the KANMX4 selection marker (28Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar); the resulting strain was unable to grow on synthetic medium containing 5′-fluoroorotic acid, confirming the ykt6 deletion. This strain was then transformed with the plasmid pRS423-YKT6pr-GFPintYKT6 (47Dietrich L.E.P. Peplowska K. LaGrassa T.J. Hou H. Rohde J. Ungermann C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and loss of pRS416-YKT6pr-YKT6WT was induced by growth on 5′-fluoroorotic acid. For N-terminal tagging of Vam3 with glutathione S-transferase (GST), the genomic VAM3 open reading frame without start codon was PCR-amplified and inserted into the GST-containing vector pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The new GST-VAM3 open reading frame was then amplified by PCR and inserted into the yeast integrative vector pRS406 (29Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) containing the NOP1 promoter. The plasmid pRS406-NOP1pr-GST-VAM3 was linearized in the URA3 marker and transformed into BJ3505 vam3Δ (CUY010) and DKY6281 vam3Δ (CUY012) (25Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Subsequent sequencing revealed that the Vam3 sequence has the point mutation K96E, affecting a non-conserved residue in helix C of the N-terminal extension. This does not affect the functionality of the protein, as detailed under “Results.”Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceCUY001BJ3505: MATa pep4Δ::HIS3 prb1-Δ1.6R HIS3 lys 2-208 trp1-Δ101 ura3-52 gal2 can31Haas A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). His-tagged GFP, used for antibody production and affinity purification, was expressed from the plasmid pET15b-eGFP (kindly provided by W. Nickel, Biochemie-Zentrum der Universität Heidelberg) and purified from E. coli. In Vitro Palmitoylation—BJ3505 vacuoles were incubated under fusion conditions at 26 °C. Incubation times and time of [3H]Pal-CoA or [3H]palmitate addition varied between experiments, as indicated in the figure legends (Fig. 1 and 2). Where indicated Vac8-GST (15 μg) was added. Vacuoles were pelleted (10 min, 12,000 × g), resuspended in PK buffer (20 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 120 mm KCl) containing 0.5× protease inhibitor mixture (1× protease inhibitor mixture = 7.5 μm Pefabloc SC, 7.5 ng/ml leupeptin, 3.75 μmo-phenanthroline, and 37.5 ng/ml pepstatin (31Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar)), and pelleted again. Vacuoles were resuspended in SDS sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.Fig. 2Different functions of Sec18 in palmitoylation and priming.A, EDTA blocks ATP-dependent release of Sec17 from vacuoles. BJ3505 vacuoles were incubated for 10 min at 26 °C in a 150-μl reaction containing cytosol, CoA, and His6-Sec18 in the presence or absence of ATP-regenerating system and EDTA (1 mm). Vacuoles were re-isolated, washed twice with 500 μl of PSK buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Sec17 antibodies. B, EDTA enhances Vac8 palmitoylation. The experiment was identical to that described in A, except that it was twice as large and contained [3H]palmitate (150 μCi), and if present, ATP was without the regenerating system. Palmitoylated Vac8 was identified by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and fluorography. C, ATPase-deficient Sec18 E350Q blocks fusion but not palmitoylation. The indicated concentrations of Sec18 E350Q were added to fusion reactions, and fusion was determined after 90 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). The corresponding concentrations (as in B) of Sec18 E350Q were included in palmitoylation reactions. Quantification of the relative incorporation of radioactivity by laser densitometry shows no significant difference in lanes 2–5. D, Sec18 E350Q inhibits ATP-dependent Sec17 release. Reactions were performed as described in A. Where indicated, 2 μm Sec18 E350Q or wild type was added to the reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For extract preparation, membranes from a 200-μl reaction (as described above but without the addition of radioactive palmitate) were solubilized in 100 μl of Triton buffer (0.25% Triton X-100, 120 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES/KOH pH 6.8, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant (10 μl, about 5 μg of vacuoles) was incubated with [3H]Pal-CoA in a total volume of 100 μl (adjusted with PK buffer) at 26 °C. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (13% v/v) and acetone and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion—Vacuoles were isolated from the yeast strains BJ3505 (pep4Δ prb1Δ) and DKY6281 (pho8Δ) by DEAE-dextran lysis and Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Fusion between these vacuoles was measured by a biochemical complementation assay as described (31Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–3 μg each of pep4Δ and pho8Δ vacuoles were incubated together at 26 °C in 30 μl of PS buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (0.02×/30 μl), reaction salts (0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 125 mm KCl), and CoA (10 μm) in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase). A colorimetric substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, for alkaline phosphatase was added to detergent-solubilized reactions, and the absorbance at 400 nm was measured. One unit of fusion activity is defined as the production of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol/min/μg pep4Δ vacuoles. Where indicated, reactions also contained cytosol (0.5 mg/ml (30Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)), His6-Sec18 (200 ng/ml (30Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)), microcystin-LR (MCLR; 10 μm; Alexis Biochemicals), or the recombinant Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor, Gdi1 (10 μm (31Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). Large scale fusion reactions contained the same proportions of all reagents as above. Affinity Purification—All experiments were with protease-deficient vacuoles (BJ3505 background) unless written otherwise. After incubation in a large scale fusion reaction (where indicated in the figures), vacuoles were diluted to 1.5 ml with PSK buffer (10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KCl), pelleted (5 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C), washed once with 500 μl of PSK buffer, and pelleted again. Membranes were detergent-solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer composed of 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, and 150 mm KCl (see below for exceptions). The following protease inhibitors were used: 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin (Roche Applied Science). Lysis was for 10 min on a nutator at 4 °C. A fraction of the cleared extracts (10 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) was removed and trichloroacetic acid/acetone-precipitated. The remaining detergent extract was incubated with the appropriate affinity matrix overnight on a nutator at 4 °C, and beads were washed in lysis buffer containing decreasing amounts of detergent (0.5%, 0.1%, 0.025% Triton X-100) before elution. For Fig. 3B, vacuoles were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, and 150 mm KCl; in Fig. 3C, solubilization buffer was 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. Anti-GFP, anti-Sec17 or anti-Vti1 antibodies (0.1–1 μl) were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were eluted with 0.1 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and 0.025% Triton X-100 and trichloroacetic acid/acetone-precipitated. Vacuolar trans-SNARE complexes were analyzed (Fig. 4D) by immunoprecipitation of Nyv1-HA with anti-HA antibodies (0.1–1 μl) bound to protein G-Sepharose (10 μl; Amersham Biosciences); elution was by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. For tandem isolation of trans-SNARE complexes (Fig. 4E), fusion reactions were diluted into 5 ml of PSK buffer, and vacuoles were collected, resuspended in 1 ml of PSK buffer, and isolated again prior to detergent lysis. Vacuole extracts were incubated for 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (15–40 μl; Amersham Biosciences), and bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 ml of elution buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm reduced GSH). Eluates were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose/anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice for 10 min with lysis buffer containing 0.5% and then 0.1% Triton X-100 and then for 10 min with lysis buffer containing 300 mm KCl and 0.025% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer.Fig. 4Analysis of the Nyv1-containing trans-SNARE complexes.A, vacuole localization of Nyv1-HA (N-HA) and GST-Vam3 (G-V3). Vacuoles (6 μg) from the respective strains were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and SNAREs were identified by Western blotting with antibodies to Nyv1, Vam3, and Vti1; v3Δ, vam3Δ; wt, wild type (parent strain). B, in vivo analysis. Vacuoles in the indicated BJ3505 strains (see Table I) were analyzed by pulse chase with FM4-64 (46Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) and fluorescence or phase contrast microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope. C, functionality of tagged SNAREs in vacuole fusion. Vacuoles from the indicated strains were fused in standard fusion reactions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 60–90 min with ATP, with the addition of cytosol or recombinant Sec18p (ratio of tag to wild-type fusion was invariant). In each experiment, fusion from a reaction without ATP was subtracted and fusion was compared with wild type (set to 100%; average wild-type units = 2.6). The graph represents values averaged from multiple experiments. Error bars are standard deviations among several independent experiments; nΔ = nyv1Δ. D, specificity of trans-complex formation confirmed by inhibitors. Vacuoles were incubated in the presence of cytosol with either no ATP, ATP alone, or ATP with the late-stage fusion inhibitor MCLR or the tethering inhibitor Gdi1, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graph shows in vitro fusion between BJ Nyv1-HA/DKY GST-Vam3 vacuoles (3 μg each). Control reactions with ATP/no inhibitor were set to 100%. Error bars are standard deviations among n experiments: -ATP = 10; +ATP (no inhibitor control) = 10; MCLR (10 μm) = 7; recombinant Gdi1 (9 μm) = 2. In the Western, large scale fusion reactions containing 40 μg each of Nyv1-HA and GST-Vam3 (both BJ3505) and the reaction components described above were incubated for 30 min at 26 °C. Vacuoles were re-isolated and detergent-solubilized, and 2% of them were removed and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (the +ATP sample is shown), and protein complexes were analyzed by anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Lanes are from a single representative gel but are arranged in the figure as indicated by white spaces. Blots were decorated with anti-Vam3 followed by anti-HA antibodies. E, affinity isolation of the trans-SNARE complex. A schematic diagram of the assay is shown. Fusion reactions (2.25 ml) containing 225 μg each of GST-Vam3 and Nyv1-HA vacuoles were incubated with 10 μm MCLR -/+ ATP for 30 min. Lysis of vacuoles and sequential isolation of complexes by GSH pull-down, and anti-HA immunoprecipitation was as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. F, sizing of wild-type cis- and trans-SNARE complexes. Vacuoles were treated as described in E through the solubilization step, and extracts were fractionated by ultracentrifugation on 10–30% continuous glycerol density gradients (18 h, 250,000 × g, 4 °C, SW40 rotor; 1 = top of gradient) and then subjected to GSH pull-downs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Sizes were determined by a parallel marker-mixture gradient (Amersham Biosciences). The sizes (in kDa) of marker proteins and their corresponding gradient fractions are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For size analysis of SNARE complexes (Fig. 4F), vacuole detergent extracts were centrifuged on continuous glycerol density gradients (10–30%, 18 h, 250,000 × g, 4 °C, SW40 rotor). 1-ml fractions were collected, incubated with GSH-Sepharose overnight on a nutator at 4 °C, and washed and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (see figure legends for methods not discussed under “Experimental Procedures”). Vac8 Palmitoylation on Isolated Vacuoles Does Not Require Exogenous ATP and Is Restricted to a Narrow Time Window during Vacuole Fusion—On isolated yeast vacuoles, Vac8 becomes palmitoylated in a reaction parallel to the Sec18/17- and ATP-dependent priming reaction (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Vac8 palmitoylation is sensitive to antibodies against Sec18 but is insensitive to Sec17 antibodies (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since Sec17 is required for Sec18 to hydrolyze ATP (32Morgan A. Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether Vac8 acylation needs ATP. In previous experiments, we used [3H]palmitate for Vac8 labeling and thus had to add ATP for its activation to [3H]Pal-CoA (8Veit M. Laage R. Dietrich L. Wang L. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we directly added [3H]Pal-CoA to vacuoles and analyzed the kinetics and ATP dependence of Vac8 labeling by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Surprisingly, Vac8 acylation was more efficient in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1A), even though ATP-dependent priming and fusion were inhibited (Fig. 2A, C). This shows that ATP addition is not necessary for Vac8 acylation and, together with the Sec17 antibody data, indicates that palmitoylation is independent of the Sec18 ATPase activity. In addition, our results show that the palmitoylation reaction is regulated, as it occurs within a narrow time frame; with or without ATP, maximal palmitoylation was achieved early in the reaction (Fig. 1A) and was restricted to this interval (Fig. 1B). The temporal restriction of palmitoylation could be due to either a decreasing availability of substrate (Vac8, Pal-CoA) or inactivation of the palmitoylating activity. To distinguish between these possibilities, we incubated vacuoles with or without ATP and, at defined time points, added recombinant Vac8-GST and [3H]Pal-CoA for an additional incubation of 10 min. When Vac8-GST and [3H]Pal-CoA were added after 10 min, the labeling of both endogenous and exogenous Vac8 was significantly decreased (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the palmitoylating activity becomes down-regulated during the incubation. We previously showed that this activity can be recovered from detergent-solubilized vacuoles (14Dietrich L.E. Gurezka R. Veit M. Ungermann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Veit M. Dietrich L.E. Ungermann C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast to our observations using intact vacuoles (Fig. 1A, B), these extracts do not lose their ability to mediate Vac8 acylation over time (24Veit M. Dietrich L.E. Ungermann C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether we could use detergent extraction to rescue the ability of Vac8 to be palmitoylated at a later time point. For this, we incubated vacuoles"
https://openalex.org/W2085696669,"The interaction of thrombin (IIa) with thrombomodulin (TM) is essential for the efficient activation of protein C (PC). Interactions between PC and extended surfaces, likely contributed by TM within the IIa·TM complex, have been proposed to play a key role in PC activation. Initial velocities of PC activation at different concentrations of PC and TM could be accounted for by a model that did not require consideration of direct binding interactions between PC and TM. Reversible inhibitors directed toward the active site of IIa within the IIa·TM complex behaved as classic competitive inhibitors of both peptidyl substrate cleavage as well as PC activation. The ability of these small molecule inhibitors to block PC binding to the enzyme points to a principal role for active site-dependent substrate recognition in determining the affinity of IIa·TM for its protein substrate. Selective abrogation of active site docking by mutation of the P1 Arg in PC to Gln yielded an uncleavable derivative (PCR15Q). PCR15Q was a poor inhibitor (Ki ≥ 30 μm) of PC activation as well as peptidyl substrate cleavage by IIa·TM. Thus, inhibition by PCR15Q most likely results from its ability to weakly interfere with active site function rather than by blocking extended interactions with the enzyme complex. The data suggest a primary role for active site-dependent substrate recognition in driving the affinity of the IIa·TM complex for its protein substrate. Interactions between PC and extended surfaces contributed by IIa and/or TM within the IIa·TM complex likely contribute in a secondary or minor way to protein substrate affinity.

In contrast, IIa function in the anticoagulant pathway requires the endothelial cell protein, thrombomodulin (TM) (2Esmon C.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The binding of IIa to TM greatly enhances the ability of IIa to catalyze the activation of protein C (PC) while inhibiting the action of IIa on its procoagulant substrates (6Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 7Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol.

Therefore, TM plays an essential role in modulating IIa function and maintaining the hemostatic balance.Structure-function studies and a series of x-ray structures have established a principal role for anion binding exosite I of IIa in interactions with its procoagulant substrates (4Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the action of IIa on these substrates can be explained by the intimate and occlusive contacts between TM and anion binding exosite I of IIa within the IIa·TM complex (5Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This explanation also points to the utilization of different strategies in the recognition of the procoagulant substrates by IIa relative to the recognition of PC by the IIa·TM complex (6Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which TM greatly enhances PC activation remain incompletely understood. The increased Vmax of PC activation following the interaction of IIa with TM has been attributed to a cofactor-mediated allosteric change in the active site of the proteinase (9Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Musci G. Berliner L.J. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A variety of lines of evidence, including mutagenesis studies, point to a significant contribution from TM-dependent changes in the active site of IIa to the Ca2+ dependence of PC activation and also potentially the enhanced function of the enzyme complex (11Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, a principal role for such allosteric phenomena in stabilizing the transition state is questioned by the finding that TM yields only minor effects on the hydrolysis of peptidyl substrates by IIa (12Hofsteenge J. Taguchi H. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Ye J. Liu L.W. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the x-ray structure of IIa bound to a TM fragment has not yielded obvious evidence for an altered active site in comparison to free IIa (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Important contributions from binding interactions between PC and the fourth epidermal growth factor-like domain of TM have been proposed on the basis of the x-ray structure of IIa complexed with a TM fragment (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by mutagenesis studies and the structural requirements for TM to bind IIa versus its ability to also enhance PC activation (6Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this interaction has also been documented by charge reversal mutagenesis studies on putatively complementary interacting surfaces in TM and PC (16Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that interactions between PC and extended surfaces within the enzyme complex represent a principal determinant of substrate affinity and IIa·TM function (15Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the low affinity (Kd ∼ 10-4 m) measured for the binding of PC to a TM fragment questions the functional role of such an interaction (17Olsen P.H. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).We have studied PC activation by thrombin complexed with the soluble extracellular domain of TM to investigate the mechanisms underlying substrate recognition by the IIa·TM complex. We have applied established kinetic approaches to distinguish the relative contributions of active site docking versus binding of the protein substrate to extended surfaces within the enzyme complex in the kinetic pathway for PC activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The peptidyl substrates H-d-isoleucyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide (S2288) and l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide (S2366) and inhibitor Nα-dansyl-(p-guanidino)-l-phenylalaninepiperidide (I2581) were from Chromogenix (West Chester, OH). Stock solutions were prepared in water, and concentrations were determined using E342 = 8,270 m-1·cm-1 for the substrates and 4,105 m-1·cm-1 for I2581 (18Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 4-aminobenzamidine (PAB, Aldrich) were prepared in water, and concentrations were determined using E295 = 15,000 m-1·cm-1 (20Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pefabloc SP (4-amino-phenylpyruvic acid) was from Centerchem (Norwalk, CT), and d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethylketone (FPR-CH2Cl) was from Calbiochem. Fresh solutions of Pefabloc SP (41 mm) were prepared in Me2SO and diluted into buffer to yield working stock solutions. Unless otherwise noted, all kinetic measurements were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4 (Assay Buffer).Proteins—The recombinant extracellular domain of human thrombomodulin (residues 1–497, sTM) and lacking chondroitin sulfate (21Parkinson J.F. Grinnell B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Bruce Gerlitz, Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Human prothrombin and PC were isolated using plasmapheresis plasma from the Plasmapheresis Unit of the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania as described (22Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thrombin was produced by proteolysis of prothrombin and purified as described (23Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Protein C isolated from plasma (PCPL) was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 (24Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein C activator was prepared from the venom of Agkistrodon Contortrix as described (25Klein J.D. Walker F.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4175-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Activated protein C (APC) was prepared by incubating PC (5 μm, 18 ml) in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000, pH 7.4 with the venom activator (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The volume of the mixture was reduced to ∼ 2 ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration and applied to a column (1.5 × 110 cm) of Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions containing APC were pooled and precipitated with 80% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (53,000 × g, 20 min), dissolved in Assay Buffer lacking BSA and reapplied to a HPC4 column equilibrated in the same buffer to remove traces of remaining zymogen. The unbound fraction was fractionated with (NH4)2SO4 as before, dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -20 °C.Protein concentrations were determined using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E280, mg-1·cm-2): APC: 56,200, 1.45; hirudin: 7,000, 0.37; IIa: 38,500, 1.83; PC: 62,000, 1.45; and sTM: 75,000, 0.64.Recombinant Protein C—The cDNA for human protein C in pUC19 was obtained as a gift from Dr. George Long, University of Vermont. Digestion with EcoRI yielded a fragment encoding the secretion signal, the propeptide, and mature human protein C. For the expression of wild type human protein C (PCWT), this fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) previously digested with EcoRI. An expression cassette encoding the uncleavable protein C derivative (PCR15Q) was obtained by converting the codon for Arg at residue 169 of the mature protein to Gln. Residue 169 corresponds to residue 15 in the numbering system based on homology with chymotrypsinogen (26Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers 5′-CCAAGTAGATCCGCAGCTCATTGATGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCCATCAATGAGCTGCGGATTACTTGG-3′. The integrity of each expression cassette was established by sequencing both strands. Vectors encoding PCWT or PCR15Q were transfected into HEK293 cells using methods previously described for the expression of recombinant prothrombin derivatives (27Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stable clones secreting the highest levels of either derivative were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and expanded into cell factories (Nunculon, NUNC). Protein production was conducted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 without phenol red, containing 200 μm glutamine, 5 mg/ml insulin-transferrin-selenite supplement (Roche Applied Science), 0.11 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 10 μg/ml reduced Vitamin K1 (Abbott). Conditioned media, harvested daily, was clarified by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 30 min), supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine and stored at -20 °C.PCWT and PCR15Q were isolated from conditioned media (12–16 liters) using minor modifications to procedures published for the isolation of fully carboxylated recombinant prothrombin variants (27Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PC variants were captured by initial chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by barium citrate adsorption and elution as previously described (27Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting sample, dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was applied to a 10- × 100-mm Poros HQ/M column (PE Biosystems) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4, bound protein was eluted (10 ml/min), with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0–1 M, 160 ml), prepared in the same buffer. Fractions containing the PC variant were pooled, dialyzed into 1 mm NaPi, pH 6.8, and applied to a CHT5-I hydroxyapatite column (10 × 64 mm, Bio-Rad). Bound protein was eluted (2 ml/min) with a gradient of increasing NaPi (1–500 mm, 20 ml) to separate fully carboxylated protein from incompletely carboxylated species. Fractions were pooled to maximize selection of the fully carboxylated material, precipitated with 80% (NH4)2SO4, collected by centrifugation (53,000 × g, 20 min), dissolved 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -20 °C.Quantitative analysis of 4-carboxyglutamic acid content following base hydrolysis was performed as described (27Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by Dr. Jan Pohl at the Emory University Microchemical Facility. The recombinant proteins were also quality-controlled by time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a surface-enhanced laser desorption instrument (SELDI, Ciphergen, Fremont, CA).Initial Velocities of PC Activation—Substrate solutions (65 μl), prepared in wells of a 96-well plate, contained increasing concentrations of PC in Assay Buffer. Reactions were maintained at 25 °C and initiated by addition of an equal volume of enzyme solution prepared in the same buffer to achieve the indicated concentrations of PC, IIa, and sTM. Aliquots (5 μl) were withdrawn at various times following initiation and mixed with 145 μl of Quench Buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 80 nm hirudin, pH 7.4). Quenched samples were used to initiate reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 100 μm S2288 in Quench Buffer. Peptidyl substrate cleavage was measured by continuously monitoring absorbance at 405 nm in a kinetic plate reader (Gemini, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Concentrations of APC in the quenched samples were inferred by interpolation from the linear dependence of the initial rate of S2288 hydrolysis on known concentrations of APC determined with each experiment. Initial, steady-state rates were determined from the linear appearance of APC with time following quenching.The effect of sTM on PC activation was assessed using increasing concentrations of PC, a fixed concentration of IIa and different fixed concentrations of sTM. Inhibition studies were performed using a fixed concentration of IIa, a saturating concentration of sTM, and either increasing concentrations of PC in the presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitor or increasing concentrations of inhibitor at one fixed concentration of PC. Control experiments established that I2581 or Pefabloc SP present in the initial reaction mixture had no detectable effect in the secondary measurements of S2288 hydrolysis. Inhibition by residual PAB in measurements of S2288 hydrolysis was accounted for by interpolation from the dependence of S2288 cleavage on known concentrations of APC in the presence of appropriate concentrations of PAB.Progress Curves for the Activation of PC Derivatives—Full progress curves for the activation of PCPL, PCWT, or PCR15Q were determined at 37 °C in Assay Buffer. Reaction mixtures in Minisorp tubes (Nunc) were initiated by mixing 200 μl of a solution containing the PC variant with 200 μl of a solution containing IIa and sTM to yield final concentrations of 400 nm PC variant, 10 nm IIa, and 100 nm sTM. Aliquots (25 μl) were withdrawn at various times (0–90 min) from reaction mixtures maintained at 37 °C and quenched with 145 μl of Quench Buffer containing 80 nm hirudin. Concentrations of APC formed were determined from discontinuous measurements of S2288 hydrolysis as described above.SDS-PAGE analysis of reaction progress was performed as above except that reaction mixtures contained 10 μm PC variant in Assay Buffer lacking BSA. Aliquots (15 μl) were withdrawn at various times and quenched by mixing with 10 μl of 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) either without or with 50 mm dithiothreitol. Protein bands were resolved with 10% NOVEX Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Peptidyl Substrate Cleavage—Reactions were initiated by mixing 100 μl of S2366 prepared in Assay Buffer with 100 μl of enzyme solution containing IIa or IIa plus sTM in Assay Buffer to achieve the indicated final concentrations. Initial rates of peptidyl substrate hydrolysis were determined by continuously monitoring A405 at 25 °C in a kinetic plate reader. When necessary, initial rates were expressed in concentration terms using E405 = 9887 m-1·cm-1 (18Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and an effective path length of 0.59 cm for a 200-μl reaction volume.For inhibition studies, the substrate solution contained increasing concentrations of S2366 in the presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitor. These solutions were supplemented with appropriate volumes of 10× Assay Buffer to compensate for pH and ionic strength changes arising from the use of S2366 and inhibitor stock solutions prepared in H2O. For studies with inhibitor stock solutions prepared in Me2SO, control experiments established that the solvent carried over into the assay had a negligible effect on the rate of peptidyl substrate hydrolysis.Inhibitory effects of PCR15Q on S2366 hydrolysis by IIa or IIa plus sTM were measured with a fixed concentration of S2366 and increasing concentrations of PC variant. Control experiments established that any possible contribution of cleavage products of PCR15Q to the rate of S2366 hydrolysis was below detectable limits.Binding of Active Site-directed Inhibitors to IIa or IIa·sTM—Measurements of the binding of I2581 to either IIa or IIa saturated with sTM were performed at 25 °C in a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Oakville, Canada). Two reaction mixtures in 1 × 1 cm stirred quartz cuvettes were used for each titration. For binding studies with IIa, sample A (2.5 ml) contained 50 nm IIa in Assay Buffer lacking BSA and sample B (2.5 ml) contained 50 nm IIa treated with 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl to irreversibly occlude the active site of the proteinase. Following incremental additions of I2581 to each sample, fluorescence intensity was determined by integrating ratiometric emission spectra collected between 470 and 650 nm using λEX = 330 nm and a long pass filter (KV-450, Schott, Duryea, PA) in the emission beam. Following minor corrections for dilution, the fluorescence change arising from the active site-dependent interaction of I2581 with IIa was inferred from the difference in integrated intensity between samples A and B. For binding studies with IIa saturated with sTM, an equivalent approach was used except that the reaction mixtures contained 50 nm IIa plus 100 nm sTM.Equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of Pefabloc SP to IIa and IIa saturated with sTM were inferred from competitive binding measurements with I2581. Fluorescence intensity was measured using the same experimental design described above except that initial reaction mixtures contained either 50 or 100 nm I2581. The active site-dependent component of the fluorescence signal was determined as described above following incremental additions of Pefabloc SP.Data Analysis—The initial rate of APC formation at increasing concentrations of PC at different fixed concentrations of sTM was globally analyzed according to the ordinary differential equations accounting for the reaction steps illustrated in Scheme I. Numerical solution of the differential equations with error minimization of the indicated constants was conducted by applying the rapid equilibrium assumption using the program Dynafit (29Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar), generously provided as a gift by Petr Kuzmic (Biokin, Pullman, WA). Reported errors in the fitted parameters correspond to linear approximations of the 95% confidence limits.All remaining kinetic and binding studies were conducted either in the absence of sTM or in the presence of sTM in excess of the concentration of IIa and well above the equilibrium dissociation constant for IIa binding. Thus, in either configuration, the concentration of enzyme was considered to approximate the total concentration of IIa present.Steady-state kinetic constants were extracted by fitting initial velocity data to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation or to the rate expression for classic competitive inhibition by weighted nonlinear least squares regression analysis, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (30Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences, 2 Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1992: 141-167Google Scholar, 31Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alternate models for reversible inhibition were tested for and eliminated on the basis of established criteria (32Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some data are illustrated in double reciprocal form solely to provide visual confirmation of the conclusions derived from nonlinear regression analyses. Fitted steady-state constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.Measurements of fluorescence intensity as a function of increasing concentrations of I2581 were analyzed according to equations previously described (33Wilkens M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9366-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed assuming a stoichiometry of 1 mol of I2581 bound per mol of enzyme at saturation to yield fitted values of Kd, signal in the absence of ligand (Offset), and signal at saturating ligand (ΔFmax). Competitive binding measurements were analyzed as previously described (34Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), assuming stoichiometries of 1 mol of I2581 or 1 mol of Pefabloc SP bound per mol of enzyme at saturation. This approach yielded fitted values for Kd and KdComp, reflecting the equilibrium dissociation constants for I2581 and Pefabloc SP, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONKinetic Pathway for PC Activation—The possible interactions between IIa (E), sTM (C), and PC (S) that lead to APC (P) formation are presented in Scheme I. Abundant evidence developed from kinetic and physical approaches has established the ability of IIa to bind reversibly to sTM and catalyze PC activation with greatly increased catalytic efficiency (36Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, Steps 1, 2, and 7 (Scheme I) are expected to contribute in a primary way to APC formation in the presence of sTM. The rate of APC formation catalyzed by IIa in the absence of sTM is extremely slow (36Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Steps 3 and 8 are expected to contribute in a minor but detectable way to pr"
https://openalex.org/W2081996981,"Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho shows a 30-fold faster rate of ATP hydrolysis when all three catalytic sites are filled with ATP than when only a single site is filled (Stitt, B. L. and Xu, Y. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 26477–26486). To study the structural requirements of the substrate for this catalytic cooperativity, rapid mix/chemical quench experiments using various ATP analogs were performed. The results indicate that it is the configuration of the β- and γ-phosphoryl groups of ATP that is of primary importance for the rate enhancement. Our results also show that there are kinetically slow branches of the enzyme mechanism that are not seen when the chemistry step of the catalytic cycle is fast. These branches become prominent, however, when two of the three Rho active sites are empty or bear non-hydrolyzable compounds. A first-order step that is slow compared with Vmax catalysis enables a single ATP molecule bound in any one of the three Rho active sites to be hydrolyzed and defines the kinetically slow branches. This first-order step could be a protein conformation change or a rearrangement of bound RNA. The results reinforce the importance of catalytic cooperativity in normal Rho function and suggest that several protein conformations exist along the catalytic pathway. Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho shows a 30-fold faster rate of ATP hydrolysis when all three catalytic sites are filled with ATP than when only a single site is filled (Stitt, B.

The results reinforce the importance of catalytic cooperativity in normal Rho function and suggest that several protein conformations exist along the catalytic pathway. Catalytic cooperativity occurs in multisubunit enzymes when a catalytic step in one active site affects the catalytic cycle in another active site. It is best documented in F1-type ATPases of mitochondria. When ATP is bound in only one of the three active sites, it is reversibly hydrolyzed by the enzyme without release of products until ATP binds in at least one additional catalytic site. The binding of the additional ATP molecule(s) increases the rate of product release from the first active site, completing the catalytic cycle there (1.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3728-3734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic cooperativity has been reported for Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1577: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The homohexameric Rho protein binds nascent RNA and, with the RNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP, travels 5′ → 3′ along the RNA to disrupt the ternary transcription complex, releasing product RNA and allowing RNA polymerase to recycle. RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by Rho can be studied in a simplified system, requiring only Rho, RNA, and MgATP. During the course of pre-steady-state rapid mix/chemical quench experiments carried out with such a simplified system, Stitt and Xu (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) found that Rho exhibits catalytic cooperativity. The steady-state rate of RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis is 30-fold slower when a single ATP molecule is bound to the Rho hexamer than when all of the ATPase sites are filled. Here, the molecular features that are required of a nucleotide for it to enhance or “promote” the hydrolysis rate of a single Rho-bound ATP molecule are explored. Results from experiments using various ATP analogs and related compounds are considered in relationship to the present model for ATP hydrolysis by Rho. Enzymes, Buffers, and Substrates—Wild type Rho from E. coli was purified as described previously (5.Mott J.E. Grant R.A. Ho Y.-S. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) from strain AR120/A6 containing plasmid p39ASE (6.Nehrke K.W. Seifried S.E. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of Rho was spectrophotometrically determined using ∊280nm1%=3.25cm−1 (7.Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparations used had specific activities with poly(C) at 37 °C of 10–20 units mg–1. A unit of activity is defined as that amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP in 1 min. Buffers were TKME (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 at 25 °C, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and TAGME (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3 at 25 °C, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm Mg acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA). Buffers were supplemented with MgCl2 or Mg acetate at a concentration equimolar with that of any added nucleotide or phosphate ester. Poly(C) RNA with an average length of 400 bases was from Amersham Biosciences and was dissolved in water at 5 mg/ml. [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 1–10 Ci mmol–1 was synthesized from [32Pi] and ATP according to the exchange method of Glynn and Chappell (8.Glynn J.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) as modified by Grubmeyer and Penefsky (9.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following purification, these preparations typically had <3% of their radioactivity in compounds other than ATP. [γ-32P]CTP was prepared similarly, although the reaction was slow (∼3 h rather than 30 min) and only ∼50% exchange was achieved rather than >90%. [32P]Sodium pyrophosphate (PPi) 1The abbreviations used are: PPi, [32P]sodium pyrophosphate; PPPi, tripolyphosphate; ATPγS adenosine, 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; ATPP, adenosine tetraphosphate; PNP, imidodiphosphate; ddATP, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; 2′-dATP, 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; 3′-dATP, 3′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate. was NEX019 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and was purified by ion-exchange chromatography to remove 32Pi. PPi, ACS grade, was from Fisher Scientific. ADP (disodium salt, Roche Applied Science) was found to contain sufficient ATP to affect results. The contaminating ATP was decreased by conversion to ADP + glucose 6-phosphate as follows. To 1.5 ml of 85 mm ADP adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris base was added equimolar Mg acetate, glucose to 11 mm, and 5 units of hexokinase (H-4502, Sigma). Following incubation at 30 °C for 5 h, hexokinase was removed by filtration using Amicon Centricon-30 concentrators at 6000 rpm in an SS34 rotor for 20 min. The removal of hexokinase was confirmed by the stability of a trace amount of [γ-32P]ATP that was added to a portion of the filtrate. ATPγS from Sigma (A1388) was also treated with hexokinase. To avoid consumption of the ATPγS during this treatment, the incubation period with hexokinase was minimized as determined by trials in which the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP added at 8 μm final concentration to a sample of the ATPγS stock solution was monitored. Depletion of the labeled ATP was measured (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by quenching reactions with trichloroacetic acid, adding charcoal to precipitate adenine nucleotides, centrifuging, and measuring radioactivity in [32P]glucose 6-phosphate in the supernatant by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The treatment thus determined for 1.8 ml of a 14 mm solution of ATPγS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 14 mm Mg acetate, 14 mm glucose was incubation for 20 min at 32 °C with 50 units of hexokinase followed by ultrafiltration as described above to remove the enzyme. Following thin-layer chromatography, the resulting ATPγS appeared visually to contain ∼10% ADP. For AMP-PNP (A-2647 from Sigma), 2.4 ml of 33 mm AMP-PNP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 42 mm Mg acetate, 12.5 mm glucose was treated for 16 h at 25 °C with 10 units of hexokinase. For ddATP (lithium salt, D5413, Sigma), 130 μl of an 8 mm solution in TAGME buffer with additional Mg acetate to 12 mm and glucose to 15 mm was treated with 2.5 units of hexokinase at 30 °C for 10 min. CTP, (tripotassium salt) was from Calbiochem. The disodium salt from Sigma was also used. UTP was from P-L Biochemicals. GTP, CDP, 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2′-dATP, D6500), 3′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (3′-dATP, cordycepin 5′-triphosphate, C9137), adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate) (AMP-PCP, M7510), adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-CPP, lithium salt, M6517), imidodiphosphate (PNP, I0631), and tripolyphosphate (PPPi, 98%, T5633) were from Sigma. Adenosine tetraphosphate (ATPP) was from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). Adenine arabinoside-5′-triphosphate was the kind gift of R. J. Suhadolnik (Temple University). Rapid mix/chemical quench experiments (11.Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were carried out at 23 °C as described (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Typically, one syringe of the Update Instruments System 1010 apparatus contained 6.6 μm Rho hexamer (1.76 mg/ml) in TAGME buffer with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 100–600 cpm/pmol (0.3 ATP/hexamer). The background of 32PO4 in this syringe increased during the course of an experiment as Rho slowly hydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of RNA. This rate was measured in each experiment (values were 1–3 × 10–6 hexamer–1 s–1), and the RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis data were corrected by subtracting the appropriate background. The second syringe of the rapid mix apparatus contained 400 μg/ml poly(C) and 2–20 mm Mg2+ nucleotide in TAGME buffer. Following reagent mixing, after aging times from 5 ms to 30 s, the ∼100-μl reaction was quenched by injection into 400 μl of 5% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid. A sample (50 μl) was taken for measurement of total radioactivity, and unreacted [γ-32P]ATP substrate was removed from 350 μl of the quenched reaction by absorption to charcoal followed by centrifugation (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32Pi product was measured in the supernatant by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For some experiments, such as those using ddATP, the rapid mix instrument was used slightly differently. Its syringes were filled with TAGME buffer, and one reagent was loaded into each of the 25-μl tubings that connect the syringes to the mixer. The tubings were removed, rinsed, dried, and reloaded after each time point. This protocol resulted in minimal consumption of reagents and also permitted mixing of Rho with [γ-32P]ATP immediately before loading the tubing. Because in this procedure the execution of a time point occurred ∼2 min after Rho was combined with [γ-32P]ATP, the significant RNA-independent hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP described above was avoided. KD determinations by competition were carried out for PPi, PPPi, AMP-CPP, ATPP, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and 2′-dATP. Equilibrium binding mixtures (200 μl) containing 0.35 μm Rho hexamer, 0.1 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm Mg acetate, and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand (5 μm–2 mm) in TAGME buffer were prepared and sampled to measure total radioactivity. A centrifugal ultrafiltration method was then employed to separate free ligand (12.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the amount of free [γ-32P]ATP was measured by liquid scintillation counting. KD values were obtained by fitting the data using a linear least-squares analysis, the program Ultrafit (Biosoft), and Equation 1, (n[ATPfree][Etotal])/[E·ATP]−[ATPfree]=KDATP(1+([ligandtotal]/KDligand)) (Eq. 1) where n = number of ATP binding sites per hexamer. KD determinations through direct binding measurements were carried out for [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]CTP by centrifugal ultrafiltration (12.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 32PPi Hydrolysis Experiments—10 μl of reaction mixtures contained, in TAGME buffer, 2 μm Rho hexamer, 5 μg of poly(C), and 10 μm PPi including 5000 cpm of [32P]PPi with or without 10 μm ATP. Mixtures were pre-warmed at 37 °C, and Rho was added last to start the reactions. Samples (1 μl) of the reaction mixture were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC sheets on top of previously applied 0.5-μl carrier spots of a mixture of 1 mm Pi + 1 mm PPi and chromatographed in 2 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. Radioactivity on the dried sheets was visualized by phosphorimaging using a Packard Cyclone instrument and quantitated using Packard OptiQuant software. Hydrolysis tests for PPPi, ddATP, ATPP, ATPγS, and AMP-CPP were set up and chromatographed similarly to those for 32PPi except that the final concentration of test substrates was 1–2 mm. PPPi and its hydrolysis products were visualized using a molybdate spray reagent (13.Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1986: 485Google Scholar). For adenine nucleotides, visualization on Polygram Cel 300 polyethyleneimine/UV254 TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel) was under UV light. Data Simulations Using KINSIM (14.Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar)—Previous results indicate that the three ATP binding sites of Rho are equivalent (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that RNA binding to Rho·ATP3 complexes leads to sequential hydrolysis of the bound ATP molecules (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A preexisting asymmetry in the Rho hexamer and/or asymmetry conferred by the binding of RNA must permit discrimination among the three Rho active sites and results in their ordered firing. Thus, we can designate them as site 1, site 2, and site 3. We modeled the results from experiments in which there was at most one molecule of bound [γ-32P]ATP per hexamer as follows. One-third of the initially bound [γ-32P]ATP was assumed to be in the Rho active site where the first of the sequential hydrolyses occurs, one-third was in the site of the second hydrolysis, and one-third was in the third active site. Poly(C) RNA was assumed to bind randomly with respect to bound ATP. Because chase compounds were used at final concentrations of 1–10 mm, their on-rates were presumed not to be rate-limiting (a test confirming this assumption was done using PPi; see “Results”). [γ-32P]ATP bound to Rho can dissociate at any stage. At longer times (1–30 s) after components were mixed, slow hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP was sometimes seen in experiments because the concentration of the chase compound was insufficient. These portions of the data were not included during modeling. In most cases, only the first 350 ms of data were used. We note that, when a numerical integration program like KINSIM is used, multiple-step mechanisms are written and rates are assigned to each step so that, among sequential catalytic cycles of a three-cycle mechanism, the same steps can have the same rates. The arrangement of steps and the flow of substrates and products among them create sequentiality. In contrast, when a curve-fitting program such as Ultrafit (Biosoft) is used as in Stitt and Xu (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), because a single equation composed of multiple first-order steps generates the fit, sequential hydrolyses can only be modeled by using different rates for repeated occurrences of the same processes. The basic experiment to determine the features of the ATP molecule that are needed for promotion employed rapid mix/chemical quench techniques. Rho·[γ-32P]ATP1 complexes were pre-formed by combining [γ-32P]ATP with excess Rho so that on average there was 0.3 [γ-32P]ATP molecule per Rho hexamer. The Rho·[γ-32P]ATP1 complexes were mixed in a chemical quench apparatus with a solution of poly(C) RNA (required for catalysis) plus a large excess (final concentration, 1–10 mm) of Mg2+ complex of unlabeled nucleotide or other compound of interest (“chase”). The extent and rate of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis were determined by quenching the reaction after various times (5 ms–30 s) and measuring the amount of product 32Pi (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rates of the chemistry step for [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis and of other events in the catalytic cycle were obtained from simulations of the data using KINSIM (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I) (14.Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), employing a model that is described below.Table IHydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP in Rho·[γ-32P]ATP1 complexes with various chase compoundsChase compoundRate of chemistry stepBurst magnitudes−1Promoting compounds ATP≥3000.25 CTP≥3000.25 UTP100-3000.25 GTP3000.25 Adenine arabinoside-5′-triphosphate150-3000.30 2′-deoxy-ATP150-3000.33 3′-deoxy-ATP150-3000.25 ddATP3000.15Non-promoting compounds NoneaA [γ-32P]ATP-rebinding rate of 0.02 s−1 was included in the simulation.3.2-3.60.03 CDP2.80.03 AMP-PNP3.50.05 AMP-PCP4-50.05 ADP + Pi1.60.04Slowly promoting compounds ATPγS1000.12 PPPi60-800.18 PPi70-1000.14 PNP90-1200.20 ATPP450.13 AMP-CPP1000.25a A [γ-32P]ATP-rebinding rate of 0.02 s−1 was included in the simulation. Open table in a new tab Promotion by an ATP Chase—When a high concentration of ATP (2–20 mm) is included with the RNA that is mixed with Rho·[γ-32P]ATP1 complexes, the conditions are closest to the normal in vivo functioning of Rho. All of the vacant catalytic sites rapidly fill with ATP, and RNA binding permits Vmax hydrolysis. 20–30% of the total [γ-32P]ATP is hydrolyzed in a burst by 10 ms after mixing, and more than two-thirds is turned over by 200 ms (Fig. 1A). A model that successfully simulates the data is presented in Scheme 1 (also see “Experimental Procedures”). According to this model, the substoichiometric [γ-32P]ATP that is initially bound to Rho is hydrolyzed when, as previously concluded (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the three active sites fire sequentially. A preexisting asymmetry in the Rho hexamer and/or asymmetry conferred by RNA binding differentiates among the three Rho active sites, defining sites 1, 2, and 3 and resulting in their ordered firing. [γ-32P]ATP and initial RNA binding are at random with respect to one another; hence, one-third of the [γ-32P]ATP is in each of the three sites. The chemistry step of the catalytic cycle is fast (≥300 s–1), so up to one-third of the total [γ-32P]ATP (which is in site 1) is hydrolyzed rapidly (burst) and is found as product 32Pi at the earliest experimental time points (5–10 ms) (Fig. 1 and Table I). For [γ-32P]ATP molecules initially bound in Rho active site 2 or 3, one and two complete catalytic cycles, respectively, precede the hydrolysis of the labeled substrate molecule. In the simulations, the same steps in each of the three catalytic cycles have the same rates. [γ-32P]ATP can dissociate at any time from Rho (at 3 s–1). Its rebinding is prevented by the high concentration of non-radioactive chase ATP. The steady-state hydrolysis rate usually found for Rho is 30 s–1; however, rates of ∼10 s–1 were obtained from modeling.Scheme 1ATP chase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No Chase—As previously reported (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), when only one of the three ATP binding sites of Rho is occupied and RNA is added in the absence of chase nucleotide, hydrolysis of the bound [γ-32P]ATP differs in two ways from the results with the ATP chase. 1) The rate of catalysis is slow, and 2) there is essentially no burst (Fig. 1A). This result was general for NTPs as demonstrated by experiments in which [γ-32P]CTP was the substrate (Fig. 1, filled triangles). Although the data when there is no chase appear to be fit by a first-order equation (as in Ref. 3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), greater complexity is probably involved. First, some degree of dissociation and rebinding of [γ-32P]ATP during the experiment is expected to occur and must be modeled. Second, hydrolysis of most of the [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1B and data not shown) requires that [γ-32P]ATP initially bound in any Rho site eventually can undergo catalysis. With the goal of a single kinetic model that with appropriate rate choices successfully simulates all of the experimental results, the ordered sequential model described above for an ATP chase was applied to this situation with no chase. Two inconsistencies were found. (i) Because there is no substrate or other molecule in two of the active sites, hydrolysis of the [γ-32P]ATP molecules bound in enzyme sites 2 and 3 cannot be preceded by any catalytic cycles. Although it could reasonably be thought that this situation precludes hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP initially bound in sites 2 and 3, simulations show that hydrolysis by site 1 alone, including hydrolyses following dissociation and random rebinding of [γ-32P]ATP from other sites, would produce far less product 32Pi than was observed (Fig. 1B, dashed line). Therefore, it is clear that the enzyme must be able to hydrolyze [γ-32P]ATP initially bound in site 2 or 3 without catalysis in the preceding site(s). Stated another way, enzyme with site 2 or 3 occupied must become like enzyme with [γ-32P]ATP in site 1 where RNA binding is followed by slow (because two active sites are empty) catalysis. Branches are necessary in the kinetic pathway for these proposed additional first-order events involving enzyme with [γ-32P]ATP site 2 or 3 (see Scheme 2). Simulations indicate that the rates of such first-order steps are in the range of 2.2–2.4 s–1. (ii) The second inconsistency when the model for an ATP chase is used for the no-chase situation is that, without energy input from previous catalytic cycles, ordered sequential active site firing must become random. In enzyme molecules with [γ-32P]ATP bound in site 1, site 1 fires first but enzyme molecules with [γ-32P]ATP in site 2 or 3 must now behave similarly to one another with a first-order step followed by slow catalysis. When the ATP chase model is modified to accommodate these two inconsistencies (Schemes 2 and 3), the data are closely fit (Fig. 1B). As previously found (3.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the rate of the chemistry step of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis is slow (3.2–3.6 s–1) (Table I). [γ-32P]ATP dissociation was at 3 s–1, and its rebinding was at 0.02 s–1.Scheme 3. Boldface arrows are ordered sequential Vmax catalysis. A, ATP; D, ADP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the absence of a chase compound, no burst was found. Only 3–4% of the radioactivity initially in [γ-32P]ATP was detected as 32Pi. This quantity is of the same magnitude as the background 32Pi in the [γ-32P]ATP and is not considered significant. A burst of product formation is expected from those Rho hexamers that have all three catalytic sites filled with [γ-32P]ATP; however, under the experimental conditions of 0.1 [γ-32P]ATP per active site, only 0.1% of the total Rho will have 3 molecules of [γ-32P]ATP bound and only one of those three bound [γ-32P]ATP molecules will be hydrolyzed in the burst. To summarize, in the absence of a chase nucleotide, the kinetics of hydrolysis of a single [γ-32P]ATP molecule bound to Rho are not only slower than when ATP is saturating but the three Rho active sites no longer necessarily act sequentially. An additional first-order step is required in the enzyme mechanism to permit hydrolysis by enzyme molecules with [γ-32P]ATP in site 2 or 3. Other Promoters—ATP analogs and the related compounds that we tested to determine the features of a molecule that are important for promotion fell into three classes: 1) those that behaved like ATP; 2) those that enhanced the rate of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP but not as well as ATP and with a smaller extent of initial hydrolysis; and 3) those that did not promote the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP or show significant initial 32Pi product formation. Nucleoside monophosphates were not tried since previous work established that AMP binds poorly (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-like Promotion—Chase nucleotides CTP, GTP (Fig. 2A, filled circles), and UTP, all known Rho substrates (15.Richardson J.P. Conaway R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4293-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), behaved like ATP in promoting the hydrolysis rate of [γ-32P]ATP in Rho·[γ-32P]ATP1 complexes in the presence of poly(C) and showed an elevated initial product level (burst) (Table I). Among known NTP substrates, the features of the base portion of the nucleotide thus are not critical to promotion. ATP analogs variant in the sugar, 2′- and 3′-dATP, ddATP (Fig. 2B, filled circles), and adenine arabinoside-5′-triphosphate, which are good Rho substrates, also behaved like ATP (Table I). Although Richardson and Conaway (15.Richardson J.P. Conaway R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4293-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that ddATP does not support the release of RNA from ternary transcription complexes, we found from steady-state time course experiments monitored by TLC (see “Experimental Procedures”) that it is hydrolyzed at approximately half of the rate of ATP. Thus, the hydroxylation state of the ribose 2′- and 3′-carbons of the nucleotide substrate is also not of great importance in promotion. In the KINSIM model, off-rates of 3 s–1 and catalytic cycle rates of 5–11 s–1 (for the catalytic cycle in site 1 preceding chemistry in site 2 and the cycles in sites 1 and 2 preceding chemistry in site 3) accommodated the data with the exception of 3′-deoxy-ATP where the catalytic cycle was 3 s–1. Non-promoting Nucleotides—Hydrolysis products ADP and CDP used as chase agents at ∼30× KD were ineffective. The results resembled those obtained in the absence of chase with no rate enhancement or burst (Table I), indicating the importance of the γ-phosphoryl group to promotion. The inclusion of 1mm Pi with a 1 mm ADP chase did not change the results (Fig. 2A, triangles). This finding is not surprising because the KD for Pi is ∼30 mm (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so at 1 mm there would be little Pi bound. The use of significantly higher concentrations of Pi and accompanying Mg2+ led to the formation of a precipitate, so the effect of the simultaneous presence in Rho active sites of both ATP hydrolysis products is not known. Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs AMP-PNP (Fig. 2B, triangles) and AMP-PCP (Fig. 2B, open circles) also failed both to promote hydrolysis and to show a significant burst (Fig. 2B and Table I). In KINSIM models, the rates of catalytic cycles preceding chemistry in sites 2 and 3 were set to zero as was done above in the absence of chase but other parameters were close to those for promoting nucleotides. Ligand off-rates were 1.5 s–1, and the added first-order step for enzyme molecules with [γ-32P]ATP in site 2 or 3 was 0.5–1.3 s–1. The chemistry step of the catalytic cycle was again slow (1.6–5.0 s–1) (Table I). Slower Promotion—Several ATP analogs and related compounds used as chase molecules produced appreciable but lower"
https://openalex.org/W2010026720,"Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho exhibits the phenomenon of catalytic cooperativity. The catalytic rate per site is 30-fold faster when all three sites are filled with substrate ATP than when only a single site is occupied (Stitt, B. L., and Xu, Y. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 26477–26486). Experiments presented here investigate whether all three active sites must be filled or whether only two occupied sites are required for catalytic cooperativity. The results indicate that all three Rho catalytic sites must be filled with substrate to achieve the enhanced catalytic rate, both in pre-steady-state and in steady-state hydrolysis. They further suggest that, once the enzyme is saturated with ATP, a Vmax enzyme conformation is achieved that is stable for at least three catalytic cycles."
