https://openalex.org/W4310092560,"Despite current advancement in the field of biomedical image processing, propelled by the deep learning revolution, multimodal image registration, due to its several challenges, is still often performed manually by specialists. The recent success of image-to-image (I2I) translation in computer vision applications and its growing use in biomedical areas provide a tempting possibility of transforming the multimodal registration problem into a, potentially easier, monomodal one. We conduct an empirical study of the applicability of modern I2I translation methods for the task of rigid registration of multimodal biomedical and medical 2D and 3D images. We compare the performance of four Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based I2I translation methods and one contrastive representation learning method, subsequently combined with two representative monomodal registration methods, to judge the effectiveness of modality translation for multimodal image registration. We evaluate these method combinations on four publicly available multimodal (2D and 3D) datasets and compare with the performance of registration achieved by several well-known approaches acting directly on multimodal image data. Our results suggest that, although I2I translation may be helpful when the modalities to register are clearly correlated, registration of modalities which express distinctly different properties of the sample are not well handled by the I2I translation approach. The evaluated representation learning method, which aims to find abstract image-like representations of the information shared between the modalities, manages better, and so does the Mutual Information maximisation approach, acting directly on the original multimodal images. We share our complete experimental setup as open-source ( https://github.com/MIDA-group/MultiRegEval ), including method implementations, evaluation code, and all datasets, for further reproducing and benchmarking."
https://openalex.org/W4310089685,"This paper reports the results of a public engagement study on heritable human genome editing (HHGE) carried out in South Africa, which was conducted in accordance with a study protocol that was published in this journal in 2021. This study is novel as it is the first public engagement study on HHGE in Africa. It used a deliberative public engagement (DPE) methodology, entailing inter alia that measures were put in place to ensure that potential participants became informed about HHGE, and that deliberations between the participants were facilitated with the aim of seeking consensus. A diverse group of 30 persons was selected to participate in the DPE study, which took place via Zoom over three consecutive weekday evenings. The main results are: Provided that HHGE is safe and effective, an overwhelming majority of participants supported allowing the use of HHGE to prevent genetic health conditions and for immunity against TB and HIV/Aids, while significant majorities opposed allowing HHGE for enhancement. The dominant paradigm during the deliberations was balancing health benefits (and associated improvements in quality of life) with unforeseen health risks (such as loss of natural immunity). The seriousness of a health condition emerged as the determining factor for the policy choice of whether to allow an application of HHGE. More generally, equal access to HHGE qua healthcare service featured as an important value, and it was uncontested that the South African government should allocate resources to promote scientific research into HHGE. These results are aligned with the policy principles for regulating HHGE in South Africa suggested by Thaldar et al. They call for urgent revision of South African ethics guidelines that currently prohibit research on HHGE, and for dedicated HHGE legal regulations that provide a clear and comprehensive legal pathway for researchers who intend to conduct HHGE research and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4310089737,"Background Recent estimates of hypertension in Panama remain unknown. We aim to describe the variation in prevalence and unawareness of hypertension in two Panamanian provinces using two different cross-sectional population-based studies and to investigate risk factors associated with hypertension unawareness. Methods Data were derived from a sub-national study conducted in the provinces of Panama and Colon (PREFREC-2010 [2,733 participants]) and from a nationally representative study (ENSPA-2019), in which we restricted our analyses to the same provinces (4,653 participants). Individuals aged 30–75 years who had (a) self-reported history of hypertension or (b) blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90mmHg or (c) a combination or both were classified as hypertensive. Participants with BP≥140/90mmHg who denied a history of hypertension were considered unaware of the condition. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between risk factors and unawareness, expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Findings In 2010, the prevalence and unawareness of hypertension in men were 51.6% (95% CI: 45.7–57.5) and 32.3% (25.4–40.1), respectively, and in women 46.0% (42.1–49.9) and 16.1% (12.6–20.4), respectively. In 2019, the prevalence and unawareness of hypertension in men were 46.5% (42.1–51.0) and 52.3% (45.9–58.6), and in women 42.1% (39.6–44.7) and 33.3% (29.8–37.0). Men (2010 and 2019), age &lt;50 years (2010 and 2019), having no/primary education (2010), and living in a non-urban region (2019) were positively associated with hypertension unawareness, whereas obesity (2010), physical inactivity (2010), family history of hypertension (2019), and BP assessment in the year before study enrollment (2010 and 2019) were inversely associated with hypertension unawareness. Interpretation Benefits of a decrease in the prevalence of hypertension are being undermined by an increase in hypertension unawareness. Actions should be encouraged to strengthen the implementation of the existing healthcare program for cardiovascular risk factor control."
https://openalex.org/W4310150098,"Trans masculine, two-spirit, and non-binary people who are gay, bisexual or otherwise have sex with men (TGBM) are under-tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and may face complex, intersectional barriers that prevent them from accessing STI testing. As part of a study on gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men’s (GBM) experiences of current STI testing systems in Ontario, Canada, this paper reports on the findings from TGBM participants’ experiences with in-person STI testing in a range of venues (i.e. Family doctors, walk-in clinics, and community-based organizations) to explore testing barriers specific to TGBM. Using a community-based research approach, between June 2020 and December 2021 peer researchers who identified as GBM conducted focus groups and interviews with 38 cis and trans GBM, 13 of whom identified as TGBM. Data were analyzed following grounded theory. When questioned about past experiences with testing, TGBM participants reported several barriers to STI testing within current testing models in Ontario due to cisnormativity and heteronormativity. Cisnormativity is the assumption that everyone identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth, and those who do not are considered “abnormal”, while heteronormativity is when it is assumed that everyone is heterosexual. From our research we identified three overarching themes concerning testing barriers among TGBM participants: (1) non-inclusive clinic environments, (2) lack of provider knowledge and competency, and (3) legal documentation. Inherent cis and heteronormativity in healthcare institutions appear to be factors shaping the historical under-testing for STI in the TGBM population. These findings suggest the relevance of implementing trans-specific clinical practices that reduce the stigma and barriers faced by TGBM in STI testing contexts, including: hosting all-gender testing hours, opening more LGBTQ+ clinics, offering training in transgender health to testing providers, and conducting a review of how gender markers on health documents can be more inclusive of trans, two-spirit, and non-binary communities."
https://openalex.org/W4310089676,"Introduction Previous observational studies assessing β2-agonist/-antagonist use on PD risk have yielded conflicting results. We evaluated the relationship between β2-agonist use and the incidence of Parkinson’s disease in patients with chronic lung disease. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on a 20% random sample abstracted from a traditional (fee-for-service) Medicare program in the United States. Inclusion criteria were individuals over 65 years old diagnosed with asthma, COPD, and/or bronchiectasis who were enrolled in a prescription drug (standalone Part D) plan over 2007–2010 and alive through 2014. The main outcome measure was a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease over the period 2011–2014, in relation to the number of 30-day-equivalent drug claims over 2007–2010. Logistic regression analysis was performed on a sample including 236,201 Medicare beneficiaries. Results The sample was 68% female, 80% white, and on average 77 years old as of 2010. Compared to non-users, β2-agonist users were more likely to be younger (76.3y versus 78.0y), smokers (40.4% versus 31.1%) and asthmatic (62.4% versus 28.3%). The odds ratio for a β2-agonist claim on PD development was 0.986 (95% CI 0.977–0.995) after adjusting for demographics, smoking history, respiratory exacerbations, comorbidities, and other drug use. Risk reductions were larger for males than females (0.974 versus 0.994, P = 0.032), and for individuals with COPD compared to those with asthma (0.968 versus 0.998, P = 0.049). Reverse causality was addressed with a Cox analysis that allowed β2-agonist use to vary from medication initiation to disease onset. By the end of the follow-up period, β2-agonist use was shown to be associated with a true protective effect against PD onset. Discussion β2-agonist use is associated with decreased risk of PD incidence. Further investigation, possibly including clinical trials, is warranted to strengthen the evidence base supporting clinical decision-makers looking to repurpose pharmaceuticals to prevent neurodegenerative disease onset."
https://openalex.org/W4310089691,"In this paper, we propose an improved ratio-in-regression type estimator for the finite population mean under stratified random sampling, by using the ancillary varaible as well as rank of the ancillary varaible. Expressions of the bias and mean square error of the estimators are derived up to the first order of approximation. The present work focused on proper use of the ancillary variable, and it was discussed how ancillary variable can improve the precision of the estimates. Two real data sets as well as simulation study are carried out to observe the performances of the estimators. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that proposed estimator performs well as compared to all existing estimators."
https://openalex.org/W4310089701,"Background Desire thinking, impulsivity and suppression are psychological variables that are intricately related to behavioral addictions. Bearing in mind the scarcity of data on desire thinking, impulsivity, thought suppression and pathological social media use in developing countries such as Lebanon, with the existing literature suggesting a heightened mental health burden associated with this problematic social media use, it becomes all the more important to elucidate their relationship. Our study aims at investigating the association between desire thinking and problematic social media use specifically, and to further test the effect of impulsivity and thought suppression in mediating the relation between the two distinct facets of desire thinking and problematic social media use. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out between November 2021 and March 2022 using a sample of 414 community-dwelling participants aged above 18 years from all Lebanese districts. The data was collected through an online questionnaire including a section about sociodemographic information, the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (DTQ), Impulsive Behavior Scale (S-UPPS-P), White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) and Social Media Disorder Short Form (SMD). The tests used in the bivariate analysis to assess correlates of SMD were the Student t test to compare two means and the Pearson test to correlate two continuous scores. The PROCESS SPSS Macro version 3.4, model four was used to conduct the mediation analysis. Results Desire thinking was shown to correlate with increased social media use. Moreover, we found that suppression and lack of premeditation mediated the association between verbal perseveration and social media use disorder whereas suppression and urgency mediated the association between imaginal prefiguration and social media use disorder. Conclusion This study provides new insight on a topic of increasing public health concern. Although understudied to date, suppression and impulsivity differentially mediate the influence of both facets of desire thinking on problematic social media use disorder. The current findings point to the highly pervasive issue of social media use disorder and the need to investigate underlying psychological factors that aggravate it to better profile and support individuals struggling with it."
https://openalex.org/W4310090073,"Purpose Concerns gradually arose about misuse of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), especially when used in combination with opioids. Because it can be a driver of usage, trends in prescribing habits may be interesting to analyse. The aim of this study is to examine the evolution of prescriptions of opioids and gabapentinoids in England from 2015 to 2020 at a regional level. Methods This study included data from April 2015 to February 2020, focusing on prescribing data, extracted the OpenPrescribing database. We described the evolution of the prescriptions of opioids and gabapentinoids and calculated their ratios for each month. We used Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) to compare data between and within regions (over time). Results During this period, opioid prescriptions remained stable (from -3.3% to +2.2%/year) and increased for gabapentinoids generally (from +1.5% to +2.2%). The ratio between gabapentinoid to opioid prescriptions increased by more than 20% in 2020 compared to 2015, variably between regions (F(6,406) = [120.2]; P&lt;0.001; LSD Test: P&lt;0.001; ANOVA for repeated measures: P&lt;0.05). In 2019, a decline in the ratio occurred in all regions, but only persisting in the London commissioning region in 2020 (-14.4% in comparison with 2018, 95%CI: -12.8 to -16.3). Conclusions Gabapentinoids are increasingly prescribed in England. The ratio of gabapentinoid to opioid prescriptions in England increased from 2015 to 2020. The reclassification of gabapentinoids as controlled drugs, in 2019, may have been associated with a significant reduction, although larger prescribers may have been less influenced."
https://openalex.org/W4310092686,"Multifunctional drugs have shown great promise in biomedicine. Organisms with antimicrobial and anticancer activity in combination with antioxidant activity need further research. The Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf coasts were randomly sampled to find fungi with multifunctional activity. One hundred strains (98 fungi and 2 lichenized forms) were isolated from 15 locations. One-third of the isolates inhibited clinical bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi) and fungal pathogens (Talaromycets marneffei, Malassezia globose, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus) and four cancer cell lines (Hep G2 liver, A-549 lung, A-431skin, MCF 7 breast cancer). Bacterial and cancer inhibition was often accompanied by a high antioxidant activity, as indicated by the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA also indicated that fungal and bacterial pathogens appeared to be inhibited mostly by different marine fungal isolates. Strains with multifunctional activity were found more from the Rea Sea than from the Arabian Gulf coasts. The highest potential for multifunctional drugs were observed for Acremonium sp., Acrocalymma sp., Acrocalymma africana, Acrocalymma medicaginis (activity reported for the first time), Aspergillus sp. Cladosporium oxysporum, Emericellopsis alkaline, Microdochium sp., and Phomopsis glabrae. Lung, skin, and breast cancers were inhibited 85%-97% by Acremonium sp, while most of the isolates showed low inhibition (ca 20%). The highest antifungal activity was observed for Acremonium sp., Diaporthe hubeiensis, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Nannizia gypsea. One Acremonium sp. is of particular interest to offer a multifunctional drug; it displayed both antifungal and antibacterial activity combined with high antioxidant activity (DPPH scavenging 97%). A. medicaginis displayed combined antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant activity being of high interest. Several genera and some species included strains with both high and low biological activities pointing out the need to study several isolates to find the most efficient strains for biomedical applications."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between the iodine status of pregnant women and their knowledge, and practices regarding iodized salt. All participants were enrolled in the Butajira nutrition, mental health and pregnancy (BUNMAP) cohort, Butajira, Ethiopia in February-May, 2019.In this cross-sectional study, 152 pregnant women without hypertension or known thyroid disease before or during pregnancy were randomly selected from the BUNMAP mother to child cohort (n = 832). Spot urine samples were collected to estimate the level of urinary iodine concentration (UIC). Salt samples were also collected from their homes. The Sandall-Kolthoff (S-K) method was used to measure the level of iodine in the urine samples, and iodometric titration was used to measure the level of iodine in the salt. Data was entered and cleaned using Epi-info version 3.5.3 and then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associations in the collected data.The WHO recommended level of iodine for populations of pregnant women is 150-249 F06Dg/L. The median UIC among pregnant women in this study was 151.2 μg/L [interquartile range (IQR) = 85.5-236.2 F06Dg/L], at the low end of this range. About half (49.65%) of the participants were likely to be iodine deficient. There was a significant association between having a formal job (AOR = 2.56; CI = 1.11-5.96) and iodine sufficiency. Based on a cutoff of >15 ppm (mg/kg), 91.7% (95% CI: 87.2-96.2) of the salts collected from the household had adequate iodine content. The median iodine level of the collected salt samples was 34.9 mg/kg (ppm) (IQR = 24.2-44.6 mg/kg).The UNICEF 2018 guidelines for adequate iodine nutrition in pregnant women include both a recommended median range of 150-249 μg/L, and an upper limit of 20% on the fraction of the population with UIC below 50 μg/L. Because our study population's median level is 151.2 μg/L and the percentage of pregnant women with urinary iodine concentration of less than 50 μg/L is 9.7% (14/145), the women received adequate iodine nutrition. The availability of adequately iodized salt in households is more than 90%, as recommended by WHO. In light of previous iodine deficiency in this region of Ethiopia, the salt iodization program promotes the health of babies and mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4310092709,"Bayesian stable isotope mixing models are widely used in geochemical and ecological studies for partitioning sources that contribute to various mixtures. However, none of the existing tools allows accounting for the influence of processes other than mixing, especially stable isotope fractionation. Bridging this gap, new software for the stable isotope Fractionation And Mixing Evaluation (FRAME) has been developed with a user-friendly graphical interface (malewick.github.io/frame). This calculation tool allows simultaneous sources partitioning and fractionation progress determination based on the stable isotope composition of sources/substrates and mixture/products. The mathematical algorithm applies the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo model to estimate the contribution of individual sources and processes, as well as the probability distributions of the calculated results. The performance of FRAME was comprehensively tested and practical applications of this modelling tool are presented with simple theoretical examples and stable isotope case studies for nitrates, nitrites, water and nitrous oxide. The open mathematical design, featuring custom distributions of source isotope signatures, allows for the implementation of additional processes that alternate the characteristics of the final mixture and its application for various range of studies."
https://openalex.org/W4310092719,"Insects are model systems for swarming robotic agents, yet engineered descriptions do not fully explain the mechanisms by which they provide onboard sensing and feedback to support such motions; in particular, the exact value and population distribution of visuomotor processing delays are not yet quantified, nor the effect of such delays on a visually-interconnected swarm. This study measures untethered insects performing a solo in-flight visual tracking task and applies system identification techniques to build an experimentally-consistent model of the visual tracking behaviors, and then integrates the measured experimental delay and its variation into a visually interconnected swarm model to develop theoretical and simulated solutions and stability limits. The experimental techniques include the development of a moving visual stimulus and real-time multi camera based tracking system called VISIONS (Visual Input System Identification from Outputs of Naturalistic Swarms) providing the capability to recognize and simultaneously track both a visual stimulus (input) and an insect at a frame rate of 60-120 Hz. A frequency domain analysis of honeybee tracking trajectories is conducted via fast Fourier and Chirp Z transforms, identifying a coherent linear region and its model structure. The model output is compared in time and frequency domain simulations. The experimentally measured delays are then related to probability density functions, and both the measured delays and their distribution are incorporated as inter-agent interaction delays in a second order swarming dynamics model. Linear stability and bifurcation analysis on the long range asymptotic behavior is used to identify delay distributions leading to a family of solutions with stable and unstable swarm center of mass (barycenter) locations. Numerical simulations are used to verify these results with both continuous and measured distributions. The results of this experiment quantify a model structure and temporal lag (transport delay) in the closed loop dynamics, and show that this delay varies across 50 individuals from 5-110ms, with an average delay of 22ms and a standard deviation of 40ms. When analyzed within the swarm model, the measured delays support a diversity of solutions and indicate an unstable barycenter."
https://openalex.org/W4310092745,"Voluntary isolation is one of the most effective methods for individuals to help prevent the transmission of diseases such as COVID-19. Understanding why people leave their homes when advised not to do so and identifying what contextual factors predict this non-compliant behavior is essential for policymakers and public health officials. To provide insight on these factors, we collected data from 42,169 individuals across 16 countries. Participants responded to items inquiring about their socio-cultural environment, such as the adherence of fellow citizens, as well as their mental states, such as their level of loneliness and boredom. We trained random forest models to predict whether someone had left their home during a one week period during which they were asked to voluntarily isolate themselves. The analyses indicated that overall, an increase in the feeling of being caged leads to an increased probability of leaving home. In addition, an increased feeling of responsibility and an increased fear of getting infected decreased the probability of leaving home. The models predicted compliance behavior with between 54% and 91% accuracy within each country’s sample. In addition, we modeled factors leading to risky behavior in the pandemic context. We observed an increased probability of visiting risky places as both the anticipated number of people and the importance of the activity increased. Conversely, the probability of visiting risky places increased as the perceived putative effectiveness of social distancing decreased . The variance explained in our models predicting risk ranged from &lt; .01 to .54 by country. Together, our findings can inform behavioral interventions to increase adherence to lockdown recommendations in pandemic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4310092971,"Administration of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is the first-line therapy for diabetic macular oedema (DME). However, some patients show no or insufficient response to repeated anti-VEGF injections. Therefore, it is necessary to identify factors that can predict this resistance against anti-VEGF treatment. Presence of microaneurysms (MAs) is a predictor of the development and progression of DME, but its relationship with the treatment response to the anti-VEGF agents is not well known. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between the distribution of MAs and the response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with DME. The number of MAs was measured before anti-VEGF therapy in each region using fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography (IA), and optical coherence tomography angiography. Patients with DME were divided into the responder and non-responder groups after three loading phases. Differences in the distribution of MAs between the groups were investigated. Pre-treatment IA revealed more MAs in the nasal area in the non-responder group than in the responder group (10.7 ± 10.7 and 5.7 ± 5.7, respectively, in the nasal macula) (1.4 ± 2.1 and 0.4 ± 0.7, respectively, in the nasal fovea). Whereas, pre-treatment FA and OCTA could not reveal significantly difference between the groups. Detection of MAs in the nasal macula using pre-treatment IA may indicate resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. We recommend the clinicians confirm the presence of MAs in the nasal macula, as shown by IA, as a predictor of therapeutic response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with treatment naive DME."
https://openalex.org/W4310149755,"An evaluation index system for the coupled and coordinated development of China’s digital economy and rural revitalization, including a total of 46 indicators for the digital economy and rural revitalization subsystems, was constructed and combined with the entropy weight method, the coupling coordination degree model, Zhou’s constraint identification index, the Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition method, and the panel spatial econometric model to analyze the level of coupled and coordinated development of China’s digital economy and rural revitalization. The results found that: (1) the coupling and coordination between the two have gradually improved. The constraints of the digital economy on rural revitalization were gradually alleviated from 2011 to 2015, but after the 19th Party Congress, the development trend of rural revitalization has significantly outstripped the digital economy. (2) the spatial differences in the degree of coupling and coordination between the two are dominated by inter-regional differences and show significant spatial convergence and spatial correlation. Differentiated digital economy development strategies and more radiation in polarized areas are important for reducing regional differences in the level of coupling and coordination between the digital economy and rural revitalization. This will help China’s digital countryside grow more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W4310150086,"A newly developed extended-depth-of-focus AcrySof® Vivity™ intraocular lens (IOL), which has a wavefront-shaped anterior surface, has shown a promising outcome in minimizing dysphotopsia, the biggest issue after diffractive type IOL implantation. On the contrary, relatively low uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) has been raised as a demerit of this IOL. However, there is only limited information about the UNVA after Vivity implantation. In the present study, we compared the uncorrected distant and intermediate visual acuity (UDVA and UIVA) and UNVA according to the range of refractive error (RE) from 91 eyes from 91 patients implanted with Vivity IOL. Then we assessed the biometric factors for their association with UNVA from 66 eyes with a RE within ± 0.25 D. The UDVA was worst in eyes with RE < -0.50 D (0.17 ± 0.21), which was significantly worse than in any other group (P < 0.001 for every analysis). The UIVA was worst in eyes with RE of 0.25 to 0.50 D (0.35 ± 0.07 D), which was significantly worse than in eyes with RE of -0.50 to -0.26 D (P = 0.020) and in eyes with RE of -0.25 to -0.01 D (P = 0.028). The UNVA was worst in eyes with RE of 0.25 to 0.50 D (0.40 ± 0.14 D), which was significantly worse than in eyes with RE of -0.50 to -0.26 D (P = 0.022), which suggests that the extent of monovision should be limited up to -0.50 diopter. On univariate analysis for UNVA in eyes with a RE within ± 0.25 D, the anterior chamber depth (R = 0.257; P = 0.037) and pupil size (R = 0.451; P < 0.001) had a statistically significant relation to UNVA, while multivariate analysis showed the pupil size (β = 0.451; P < 0.001) as the sole indicator, suggesting eyes with a small pupil size might receive a UNVA benefit."
https://openalex.org/W4310150272,"Women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) employees are underrepresented in science and natural resource management institutions. Student and recent graduate trainee and internship programs have been used to try to address this in United States federal agencies over the last few decades. Our study evaluates how effective such programs are at improving U.S. federal workforce diversity. We used a comprehensive employee dataset from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service–which has the largest natural resource management workforce in the country–to analyze the demographic characteristics and career paths of paid interns from 1996–2017. We found that a majority of employees who started as interns later converted to permanent employment with the USDA Forest Service. In addition, Black and Hispanic interns were, respectively, 5 and 3 times more likely than White interns to work for the agency in permanent positions after their internships. However, people who started as interns had significantly shorter USDA Forest Service careers than those who started in permanent positions. White women entering directly into permanent positions typically advanced to higher pay grades through promotion faster than White women who entered as interns. Finally, male BIPOC interns involuntarily separated ( i . e ., were fired) at significantly higher rates than all other employees. Our study suggests that while internship employment programs can be an effective tool for hiring a diverse workforce, they are not sufficient to close the overall workforce diversity gap. In addition, only a small percentage of new hires every year are interns. To achieve a level of representation that mirrors the civilian labor force, our study suggests that internship programs need to focus on long-term employee retention and be of significantly larger scale."
https://openalex.org/W4310089658,"Veterans with disabilities can experience poor quality of life following military service due to the associated negative physical and psychological ramifications. However, participation in physical activities has shown to induce both physical and mental benefits and improve the quality of life of this population. Adaptive sports, an innovative approach to address the unique physical and psychosocial needs of veterans with disabilities, are becoming more widely used as a rehabilitation tool to improve the quality of life for these veterans. This study aimed to determine the acute influence of participation in a single-day, veteran-based, adaptive kayaking and sailing event on the perceived overall health, quality of life, and quality of social life of veterans with varying disabilities. It was hypothesized that all three categories and the sum score of quality of life would reflect a positive acute response after participation in the community-based physical activity event. Veterans responded to three quality of life-related questions using a 5-point Likert scale before and directly after participating in the event. Findings indicated that an adaptive sporting event can have an acute positive influence on the quality of life of veteran participants, with improvements observed in all three categories of perceived quality of life. Therefore, it is advantageous for the whole-health rehabilitation of veterans with disabilities for the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue to provide opportunities for veterans to participate in non-traditional, community-based activities."
https://openalex.org/W4310092550,"Antipsychotics (APs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia (SCZ) but are unfortunately associated with serious metabolic adverse effects including weight gain and type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of AP-induced metabolic dysfunction is largely undetermined. Brain insulin resistance has been posited to be at the cross-roads of many cognitive and metabolic disorders, and disruption of central insulin action has emerged as a possible explanatory mechanism underlying AP induced metabolic dysfunction. Previous studies suggest that change in neuroimaging-based parameters with intranasal insulin administration can be leveraged to investigate brain insulin resistance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will utilize neural signatures of insulin action in the brain to examine if APs disrupt brain insulin signaling. It is hypothesized that: 1) intranasal insulin (INI), but not intranasal placebo (INP), will change cerebral blood flow and resting state connectivity, as well as increase glutamate levels in the striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 2) oral olanzapine (OLA), but not oral placebo (PL), will inhibit the effect of INI on these parameters. Thirty-two healthy volunteers will undergo a single blind, cross-over design, wherein all participants receive the following four treatment combinations, 2–6 weeks apart, in a random sequence: INP + PL, INP + OLA, INI + PL, and INI + OLA. Participants will undergo an MRI-based assay of brain insulin resistance 15 minutes after administering 160 IU INI or INP. The scanning protocol includes resting and task-based functional MRI, arterial spin labelling, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Demonstrating that OLA can acutely induce brain insulin resistance is clinically relevant to metabolic health in SCZ. Evidence of brain insulin resistance induced by acute AP dosing can inform the early use of adjunctive insulin sensitizers for the treatment of metabolic comorbidities associated with AP treatment in severe mental illness.

https://openalex.org/W4310092565,"Background The Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS2) is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates problematic internet use (PIU) from a multidimensional perspective. We analysed the psychometric properties and adequacy of the theoretical model of Japanese version of the GPIUS2. Methods This study included 291 healthy Japanese adults (median age = 25 years; interquartile range 22–43 years; 128 women) who completed the GPIUS2 and several other questionnaires evaluating the degree of PIU, self-esteem, depression, and impulsivity. Results Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed a similar factor structure between the original and Japanese versions of the GPIUS2, with only minor differences in item composition. Higher-order confirmatory factor analyses revealed a good overall fit for the factorial model suggested by EFA, indicating adequate construct validity. The model showed acceptable internal consistency. Partial correlation analyses between GPIUS2 and other measures, with age as a control variable, revealed good convergent validity. Finally, structural equation modelling showed a good fit to the data, supporting the cognitive-behavioural model of Caplan (2010). Conclusions The Japanese version of the GPIUS2 has good psychometric properties and the theoretical model of the original GPIUS2 is applicable to Japanese adults."
https://openalex.org/W4310092602,"Background Schistosoma ( S .) mansoni infection is endemic in all regions around Lake Victoria and affects all age groups to different degrees. In most endemic areas, less attention has been paid to determining the prevalence of infection, sanitation status, and knowledge about intestinal schistosomiasis (KIS) in fishermen. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of S . mansoni infection and associated factors among fishermen in the Busega district. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among fishermen in July, 2020 in five fishing villages in the Busega district located along Lake Victoria. A total of 352 fishermen were interviewed with regard to their sanitation status and level of KIS. A single stool sample from fishermen was examined for S . mansoni eggs by using the Formalin-Ether Concentration technique. The potential factors associated with S . mansoni infection were explored using multivariable logistic regression. Results The prevalence of S . mansoni infection was high (65.0%) among fishermen and varied with age, whereby fishermen aged ≤36 years had the highest prevalence. Fishermen had a low level of KIS and the majority of them reported practicing open defecation during fishing (81%). These fishermen with a low level of KIS and who reported defecating in open areas during fishing had 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.0–7.2) and 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.1–3.9) higher odds of being infected with S . mansoni than those with a high level of KIS and those who did not report defecating in open areas during fishing, respectively. Conclusion S . mansoni infection was high among fishermen in the Busega district. Furthermore, fishermen had a low level of KIS and were reported to have defecated in open areas during fishing. Infection with S . mansoni was associated with age, a low level of KIS and open defecation behaviour during fishing. Therefore, mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel, health education, and sanitation behaviour change interventions were needed."

The role of fathers in the proper child feeding of young children has not been a frequent topic of study. Past research has found low rates and little is known about fathers' involvement in child feeding for children 6-23 months in Ethiopia. The aim of this study is to assess fathers' involvement in child feeding children aged 6-24 Months.To assess fathers' involvement in child feeding and associated factors among fathers having children aged 6 to 24 months.A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from Jan 23/2022 to April 07/2022. A systematic random sampling technique was applied to select study participants. A total of 408 respondents participated in the study. Data was entered into EPI data version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis.Father's involvement in child feeding was 43.1%. Factors that were significantly associated with good fathers involvement in child feeding include urban residence(AOR = 3.878, 95% CI = (1.408-10.678), male sex of the youngest child(AOR = 3.681, 95% CI = (1.678-8.075)), first birth order of the youngest child(AOR = 3.970, 95% CI = (1.212-13.005)), Better(secondary and higher) educational status (AOR = 4.945,95% CI = (1.043-23.454)) and AOR = 5.151, 95% CI = (1.122-23.651)), having ever heard information(AOR = 8.593, 95% CI = (3.044-24.261)), good knowledge (AOR = 3.843,95% CI = (1.318-11.210)), positive attitude (AOR = 8.565, 95% CI = (3.521-20.837)) and good culture (AOR = 10.582,95% CI = (2.818-39.734)).Father involvement in child feeding was poor in Antsokia Gemza Woreda. Urban residences, male sex of the youngest child, first birth order of the youngest child, better (secondary and higher) educational status, having ever heard information, good knowledge, positive attitude, and good culture were significantly associated with fathers' involvement in child feeding. Health information dissemination on father involvement in child feeding should be strengthened."

Health and safety are jeopardized during a flood. As a result, proactive flood mitigation measures are required. This study aimed to increase flood disaster preparedness among Selangor communities in Malaysia by implementing a Health Belief Model-Based Intervention (HEBI). Selangor’s six districts were involved in a single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial Community-wide implementation of a Health Belief Model-Based Intervention (HEBI). A self-administered questionnaire was used. The intervention group received a HEBI module, while the control group received a health talk on non-communicable disease. The baseline variables were compared. Immediate and six-month post-intervention impacts on outcome indicators were assessed. 284 responses with a 100% response rate. At the baseline, there were no significant differences in ethnicity, monthly household income, or past disaster experience between groups (p&gt;0.05). There were significant differences between-group for intervention on knowledge, skills, preparedness (p&lt;0.001), Perceived Benefit Score (p = 0.02), Perceived Barrier Score (p = 0.03), and Cues to Action (p = 0.04). GEE analysis showed receiving the HEBI module had effectively improved knowledge, skills, preparedness, Perceived Benefit Score, Perceived Barrier Score, and Cues to Action in the intervention group after controlling the covariate. Finally, community flood preparedness ensured that every crisis decision had the least impact on humans. The HEBI module improved community flood preparedness by increasing knowledge, skill, preparedness, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, and action cues. As a result, the community should be aware of this module. Clinical trial registration: The trial registry name is Thai Clinical Trials Registry, trial number TCTR20200202002 ."
https://openalex.org/W4310092748,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a method of answering questions in natural language based on the content of images and has been widely concerned by researchers. The existing research on the visual question answering model mainly focuses on the point of view of attention mechanism and multi-modal fusion. It only pays attention to the visual semantic features of the image in the process of image modeling, ignoring the importance of modeling the spatial relationship of visual objects. We are aiming at the existing problems of the existing VQA model research. An effective spatial relationship reasoning network model is proposed, which can combine visual object semantic reasoning and spatial relationship reasoning at the same time to realize fine-grained multi-modal reasoning and fusion. A sparse attention encoder is designed to capture contextual information effectively in the semantic reasoning module. In the spatial relationship reasoning module, the graph neural network attention mechanism is used to model the spatial relationship of visual objects, which can correctly answer complex spatial relationship reasoning questions. Finally, a practical compact self-attention (CSA) mechanism is designed to reduce the redundancy of self-attention in linear transformation and the number of model parameters and effectively improve the model's overall performance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of VQA 2.0 and GQA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. Our best single model has an overall accuracy of 71.18% on the VQA 2.0 dataset and 57.59% on the GQA dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4310150251,"Somatic mutations have a central role in cancer, but there are also a few rare autoimmune diseases in which somatic mutations play a major role. We have recently shown that nonsynonymous somatic mutations with low allele fractions are preferentially detectable in CD8+ cells and that the STAT3 gene is a promising target for screening. Here, we analyzed somatic mutations in the STAT3 SH2 domain in peripheral blood CD8+ cells in a set of 94 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 99 matched controls. PCR amplicons targeting the exons 20 and 21 of STAT3 were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq instrument with 2x300bp reads. We designed a novel variant calling method, optimized for large number of samples, high sequencing depth (>25,000x) and small target genomic area. Overall, we discovered 64 STAT3 somatic mutations in the 193 donors, of which 63 were non-synonymous and 77% have been previously reported in cancer or lymphoproliferative disease. The overall median variant allele fraction was 0.065% (range 0.007-1.2%), without significant difference between MS and controls (p = 0.82). There were 26 (28%) MS patients vs. 24 (24%) controls with mutations (p = 0.62). Two or more mutations were found in 9 MS patients vs. 2 controls (p = 0.03, pcorr = 0.12). Carriership of mutations associated with older age and lower neutrophil counts. These results demonstrate that STAT3 SH2 domain is a hotspot for somatic mutations in CD8+ cells with a prevalence of 26% among the participants. There were no significant differences in the mutation prevalences between MS patients and controls. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of antigenic stimuli in the expansion of the mutant clones. Furthermore, the high discovered prevalence of STAT3 somatic mutations makes it feasible to analyze these mutations directly in tissue-infiltrating CD8+ cells in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4310150259,"We previously demonstrated that exposing mice to heat causes functional and ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations and apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Emerging evidence indicates that glutamine (Gln) deprivation may increase cell susceptibility to apoptosis whereas Gln supplementation may protect cells against heat stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of short-term Gln treatment on heat-induced changes in mouse skeletal muscle. Male mice received vehicle, low-dose Gln (100 mg/kg/d) or high-dose Gln (300 mg/kg/d) through daily gavage for 10 days before a heat exposure test. During heat exposure, mice displayed a hyperthermic response and no significant differences in peak core body temperature were noted across the three groups. Neither heat exposure nor pretreatment with low-dose or high-dose Gln significantly affected Gln concentrations in plasma and gastrocnemius muscles. Heat-exposed mice had significantly higher caspase 3/7 levels in gastrocnemius muscle compared to unexposed controls. Heat exposure significantly increased ROS production and mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in flexor digitorum brevis muscle. These changes were not affected by low- or high-dose Gln pretreatment. Together, acute heat stress did not disrupt Gln homeostasis in mouse skeletal muscle and Gln supplementation did not protect mouse skeletal muscle against heat-induced injury. The results of this study do not support a role of Gln in heat-induced skeletal muscle apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4310150515,"The antifungal activity of the 70% ethanol stem bark extract of Erythrina senegalensis (ESB) against different strains and drug resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were evaluated in the study. The effect of ESB on biofilms as well as its activity in combination with fluconazole, nystatin or caspofungin against the Candida strains were also evaluated. We then evaluated the antifungal activity of a microemulsion formulation of ESB against planktonic and biofilms of the Candida species. UPLC-QTOF-MS2 analysis was then undertaken to identify the phytoconstituents of the extract and UPLC fingerprints developed for the routine authentication as part of quality control measures. ESB exerted strong antifungal activities against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and SC5314 strains, and C. glabrata ATCC 2001 strain with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from 3.91 to 31.25 μg/mL and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) that ranged from 62.5 to 250 μg/mL. It also exhibited potent antifungal activities (MIC = 4-64 μg/mL) against a collection of C. albicans and C. glabrata clinical isolates that were resistant to either nystatin or azole antifungals. The formulated ESB demonstrated higher antifungal potency against the C. albicans and C. glabrata strains with MIC values of 3.91-31.25 μg/mL which was the same as the MFC values. The extract and its microemulsion formulation were active against biofilms of the strains of the Candida species inhibiting their biofilm formations (SMIC50 = 16-64 μg/mL) and their preformed biofilms (SMIC50 = 128 ->512 μg/mL). ESB also exhibited synergistic antifungal action with fluconazole and nystatin against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. glabrata ATCC 2001 strains in the checkerboard assay. Chemical characterization of the extract revealed the presence of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and their prenylated derivatives, anthracene glycosides and alkaloids. UPLC Fingerprints of the extract was also developed and validated for routine identification and authentication of the stem bark of E. senegalensis. The study findings have demonstrated that the stem bark of E. senegalensis is as a potential source of bioactive compounds that could be developed as novel antifungal agents."

Methods A large sample of adults aged 45–85 (n = 12,875) completed a one-minute animal fluency task in English. Participants were English-speaking monolinguals (n = 9,759), bilinguals who spoke English as their first language (L1 bilinguals, n = 1,836), and bilinguals who spoke English as their second language (L2 bilinguals, n = 1,280). Using a distributional modeling approach to quantify the semantic similarity of words, we examined the impact of word frequency and pairwise semantic similarity on performance on this task. Results Overall, L1 bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on the verbal fluency task: they produced more items, and these items were of lower average frequency and semantic similarity. Monolinguals in turn outperformed L2 bilinguals on these measures. The results held across different age groups, educational, and income levels. Discussion These results demonstrate an advantage for bilinguals compared to monolinguals on a category fluency task, when performed in the first language, indicating that, at least in the CLSA sample, bilinguals have superior semantic search capabilities in their first language compared to monolingual speakers of that language."
https://openalex.org/W4310089682,"The Brief COPE Inventory has been proven as acceptable psychometric properties to examine coping strategies among cancer patients. However, most psychometric testing studies have been carried out in Western countries, raising concerns about the properties’ relevance and applicability in other cultural contexts. This study aimed to present psychometric properties of the Brief COPE in a sample of patients with advanced cancer in Indonesia. Specifically, we intended to examine the factorial structure and the measure’s validity and reliability. This study included 440 patients from the original study who completed the Indonesian version of Brief COPE. We used exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to assess factor structure and evaluate the structural model fit, respectively. Reliability was demonstrated by internal consistency represented by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The factor analysis identified a 21-items scale with 5-factors (avoidance, religion and acceptance, social support coping, problem solving and distraction). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good model fit. For the whole scale and its subscales Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were acceptable signifying good reliability. Convergent, divergent validity and contrast group comparison were evidenced by significant correlations among subscales and the other instruments used. This study shows that the Indonesian version of Brief COPE is a reliable and valid instrument to measure coping in advanced cancer patients and is ready for use amongst this population in the Indonesian cultural context."
https://openalex.org/W4310089689,"Gambling is an international phenomenon, posing a serious threat to adolescents who begin gambling at a young age. This study aims, to explore gambling behavior in adolescents and interpret its risk factors. We conducted a three-waves cohort longitudinal study assessing gambling and associated risk factors in south-eastern Spain. Data were analyzed using the Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations, Behavior (COM-B) model and the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) technique. Gambling was measured by frequency and money spent; associated factors were knowledge about gambling, parental attitude towards gambling, risk perception, normative perception, and intention to gamble. These items were assigned as indicators of each construct of the COM-B model-capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior-using the theoretical domains framework. Once the behavior was performed, feedback on future capability, opportunity, and motivation was observed. Results show that capability, determined by past experience, and opportunity, determined by parental attitudes, motivates adolescents to seek gambling experiences in the future. Identifying such factors that affect gambling behavior in adolescents and establishing relationships between them through a robust theoretical model is essential for designing effective interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4310089693,"To evaluate the precision of objective refraction measurements with six different autorefractors that have different designs and measurement principles and to compare the objective refraction values with the subjective refraction.Objective refraction of 55 participants was measured using six autorefractors with different designs. The instrument features mainly varied in terms of measurement principles, inbuilt fogging, open or closed view, and handheld or stationary designs. Two repeated measurements of objective refraction were performed with each autorefractor. The objective refractions from the six autorefractors were compared with the standard subjective refraction. The repeatability limit and Bland-Altman were used to describe the precision and accuracy of each autorefractor, respectively. The analysis was done using the spherical component of the refraction and the power-vector components, spherical equivalent (M), and cylindrical vectors.The repeatability of all autorefractors was within 1.00 and 0.35D for measuring the M and both cylindrical components, respectively. Inbuilt fogging was the common feature of the instruments that showed better repeatability. Compared to subjective refraction, the mean difference for sphere and M was below +0.50D, and it was close to zero for the cylindrical components. The instruments that had inbuilt fogging showed narrower limit of agreement. When combined with fogging, the open field refractors showed better precision and accuracy.The inbuilt fogging is the most important feature followed by the open view in determining the precision and accuracy of the autorefractor values."

The current treatments are associated with a number of adverse effects and availability problem of drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need of easily available and cost effective treatments of CL- in Pakistan. The bioassay-guided fractionation and purification of crude extract of Physalis minima has led to the isolation of a new aminophysalin B (1), and eight known physalins, physalin B (2), 5ß,6ß-epoxyphysalin B (3), 5α-ethoxy-6ß-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysalin B (4), physalin H (5), 5ß,6ß-epoxyphysalin C (6), and physalin G (7), K (8), and D (9). It is worth noting that compound 1 is the second member of aminophysalin series, whereas compound 6 was fully characterized for the first time. The structures of compounds 1-9 were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques Whereas, the structural assignments of compounds 1 and 8 were also supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The anti-leishmanial activity of isolated physlains 1-9 was evaluated against Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica promastigotes. Compounds 2, 3, and 5-7 (IC50 = 9.59 ± 0.27-23.76 ± 1.10 μM) showed several-fold more potent activity against L. tropca than tested drug miltefosine (IC50 = 42.75 ± 1.03 μm) and pentamidine (IC50 = 27.20 ± 0.01 μM).

https://openalex.org/W4310092552,"Background Women experiencing greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) report high levels of pain and reduced quality of life. Exploring how they manage GTPS in a daily life context can provide important knowledge about individual coping strategies. Education, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and exercise have good group level evidence for efficacy in clinical trials and are increasingly used in routine care for patients with GTPS. Exploring women’s experiences of such treatment may help understand the mechanisms underpinning these positive results and inform treatment strategies. We therefore aimed to explore how women with GTPS experience and manage their daily life, and their experience of the combined treatment of education, ESWT and exercises. Methods This qualitative study was nested within a cohort study based in a hospital outpatient clinic and a physiotherapy clinic in Denmark assessing the combined treatment of education, ESWT and exercises. Data was collected from eleven women using in-person, individual, semi-structured interviews which were audio recorded. Transcripts were coded and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Findings Five themes were identified: (1) Daily life was controlled and structured by pain; (2) The condition was acknowledged and taken seriously by treating professionals; (3) The participants´ experiences of the intervention – information is key; (4) Improved capability and autonomy in pain management and (5) The women´s perspectives on improving and expanding the intervention . Learning how to manage pain was experienced as the most important element of the program to the women to be able to minimize pain and manage daily life. Conclusion Exploration of how women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome experienced and managed daily hip pain, and how they experienced and adapted to treatment are important novel findings that will inform clinical practice. This new knowledge may be used to inform an individualized patient education, treatment and evaluation strategy for women with the painful and debilitating condition of GTPS."
https://openalex.org/W4310092555,"The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, has the most segmented genome among known bacteria. In addition to a linear chromosome, the B. burgdorferi genome contains over 20 linear and circular endogenous plasmids. While many of these plasmids are dispensable under in vitro culture conditions, they are maintained during the natural life cycle of the pathogen. Plasmid-encoded functions are required for colonization of the tick vector, transmission to the vertebrate host, and evasion of host immune defenses. Different Borrelia strains can vary substantially in the type of plasmids they carry. The gene composition within the same type of plasmid can also differ from strain to strain, impeding the inference of plasmid function from one strain to another. To facilitate the investigation of the role of specific B. burgdorferi plasmids, we developed a Cas9-based approach that targets a plasmid for removal. As a proof-of-principle, we showed that targeting wild-type Cas9 to several loci on the endogenous plasmids lp25 or lp28-1 of the B. burgdorferi type strain B31 results in sgRNA-specific plasmid loss even when homologous sequences (i.e., potential sequence donors for DNA recombination) are present nearby. Cas9 nickase versions, Cas9D10A or Cas9H840A, also cause plasmid loss, though not as robustly. Thus, sgRNA-directed Cas9 DNA cleavage provides a highly efficient way to eliminate B. burgdorferi endogenous plasmids that are non-essential in axenic culture."

The design is quantitative, the TAM model is used with the variables: risk of misuse of information, risk of not obtaining the benefits of the product and risk of inefficiency of the functionality. The results show that the three risks examined do not affect the acceptance of electronic commerce, and that the variables perceived usefulness and ease of use have a positive effect on the acceptance of electronic commerce. The theoretical implications of this study provide empirical evidence from Bolivia, which shows strong variables of perceived usefulness and ease of use, which mitigates the effect of risk´s perception by the consumer, the results are explained in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that accelerated the rapid acceptance of electronic commerce, increasing the perception of usefulness and ease of use of online shopping. As practical implications, this research provides managers and administrators of online businesses with knowledge about the effect of risk variables perceived by consumers."
https://openalex.org/W4310092594,"The question of whether appropriate decentralization can solve Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) misplacement caused by Entrepreneurial Characteristics (EC) is an interesting ethical puzzle. Because corporate behavior depends on the decision-making choices of executives whose personality characteristics affect the choice tendency, power distribution undoubtedly becomes a big boost for most businesses to work out the adverse externality problems. Based on Upper Echelons Theory, this study developed a comparative impact model linking the effects of entrepreneurial intrinsic nature and experience characteristics on CSR performance. We tested the effective mechanism with the mediator role of the Corporate Power Distribution Index (CPDI) through a sample of listed Chinese companies from 2009 to 2017. The results provide that EC, such as female Gender, Degree, and Salary, have positive effects on CSR; CPDI plays a mediator role in the relationship between EC and CSR; and is moderated by Age, Academy, and Shares. The conclusion shows that EC can improve CSR performance to optimize CPDI to reduce corporate misplacement behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4310092687,"Early booking or registration into Antenatal Care (ANC) can be defined as initiation of ANC before 12 weeks of gestation and is important for the best health outcome of the mother and the baby. Delayed initiation of ANC has been linked to increased rate of maternal and fetal mortality. There is international consensus that ANC should begin within first trimester yet pregnant women delay initiation of ANC. Health Care Workers (HCWs) understanding of reasons for this can improve patient provider relationship.This study aims to explore the perception of the HCWs in Fiji towards early antenatal booking.A qualitative study was employed using four Focus-Group Discussions (FGDs)with the HCWs who provide health care service for pregnant women in Ba Mission Hospital (BMH) in 2020. Each group comprised of medical officers, mid-wives and registered nurse who were chosen purposively. A semi-structured open ended questionnaire was used to guide the discussion. Data was transcribed and analyzed manually using thematic content analysis using the following process: familiarization, coding, identifying themes, reviewing and refining, integration and interpretation.There was a total of 18 HCWs for the FGDs. The mean age of the participants was 37.4±11.8years. The three themes identified were: knowledge of HCWs on early booking, their perceived barriers and perceived enabling factors to early antenatal booking. The FGDs identified that the HCWs had adequate knowledge on early initiation of ANC and that there were a range of barriers to early initiation of ANC. The HCWs also suggested factors that could enable women to book early.Based on the study it can be concluded that the HCWs have a positive perception of early antenatal booking, however, there are various factors that contribute to delayed antenatal booking. The barriers to early ANC are both an opportunity and a challenge to strengthen and review the maternal services offered. The enabling factors should be reinforced from an individual level to the health system and the general context. The implications of the barriers and enabling factors identified in this study is to implement evidence-based policies to improve early antenatal booking in Ba, Fiji."
https://openalex.org/W4310092739,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a first-line prodrug for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that is completely metabolized to monomethyl fumarate (MMF), the active metabolite, before reaching the systemic circulation. Its metabolism has been proposed to be due to ubiquitous esterases in the intestines and other tissues, but the specific enzymes involved are unknown. We hypothesized based on its structure and extensive presystemic metabolism that DMF would be a carboxylesterase substrate subject to interaction with alcohol. We sought to determine the enzymes(s) responsible for the extensive presystemic metabolism of DMF to MMF and the effect of alcohol on its disposition by conducting metabolic incubation studies in human recombinant carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), carboxylesterase-2 (CES2) and human intestinal microsomes (HIM), and by performing a follow-up study in an in vivo mouse model. The in vitro incubation studies demonstrated that DMF was only metabolized to MMF by CES1. Consistent with the incubation studies, the mouse pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that alcohol decreased the maximum concentration and area-under-the-curve of MMF in the plasma and the brain after dosing with DMF. We conclude that alcohol may markedly decrease exposure to the active MMF metabolite in the plasma and brain potentially decreasing the effectiveness of DMF in the treatment of RRMS."

Actually, when the head tilts, which generates cervico-ocular reflex, not only the neck muscle is activated, but also the jaw muscle is stretched by gravity dragged mandible and/or tissue-muscle connection between the mandible and clavicle. We have previously identified a projection from the jaw muscle afferent mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Vme) neurons to oculomotor nuclei (III/IV) and their premotor neurons in interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC)–a well-known pre-oculomotor center manipulating vertical-torsional eye movements. We hypothesized that these projections may interact with vestibulo-ocular signals during vertical-torsional VOR, because effects of gravity on jaw muscles and bones has been reported. Thus, we injected different anterograde tracers into the Vme and medial vestibular nucleus (MVN)—the subnuclear area particularly harboring excitatory vestibulo-ocular neurons, and immunostained III/IV motoneurons. Retrograde tracer was injected into the III in the same animals after dual anterograde tracers’ injections. Under confocal microscope, we observed the Vme and MVN neuronal endings simultaneously terminated onto the same III/IV motoneurons and the same INC pre-oculomotor neurons. We consider that jaw muscle proprioceptive Vme neurons projecting to the III/IV and INC would sense spindle activity if the jaw muscle is stretched by gravity dragged mandible or connection between mandible and clavicle during head rolling. Therefore, the convergent innervation of the Vme and MVN neurons onto the oculomotor and pre-oculomotor nuclei would be a neuroanatomic substrate for interaction of masticatory proprioception with the vestibulo-ocular signals upon the oculomotor system during vertical-torsional VOR."

Our novel measure of anti-White bias-which we called the AWB scale-was based upon the Johnson-Lecci scale (JLS; 2003) a questionnaire designed to measure anti-White attitudes among Black Americans. Studies 1 and 2 provided converging evidence for the AWB's four-factor dimensionality, its structural characteristics, its temporal stability and its external validity in Black UK samples, attesting to the consistency of minorities' experience of anti-majority bias in two very different societal contexts. Moreover, Study 3 evidenced our measure's utility for understanding reactions to various relevant contemporary societal events. Theoretical contributions to the literature on intergroup bias are delineated and compared with majority-to-minority prejudice."
https://openalex.org/W4310149742,"Background Elevated blood lactate levels were reported as effective predictors of clinical outcome and mortality in ICU. However, there have been no studies simply comparing the timing of measuring lactates before vs. after ICU admission. Methods A total of 19,226 patients with transfer time ≤ 24 hr were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV). After 1:1 propensity score matching, the patients were divided into two groups: measuring lactates within 3 hr before (BICU group, n = 4,755) and measuring lactate within 3 hr after ICU admission(AICU group, n = 4,755). The primary and secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, hospital 28-day mortality, ICU mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and restricted mean survival time (RMST). Results Hospital, hospital 28-day, and ICU mortality were significantly higher in AICU group (7.0% vs.9.8%, 6.7% vs. 9.4%, and 4.6% vs.6.7%, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for all) Hospital LOS and ICU LOS were significantly longer in AICU group (8.4 days vs. 9.0 days and 3.0 days vs. 3.5 days, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for both). After adjustment for predefined covariates, a significant association between the timing of measuring lactate and hospital mortality was observed in inverse probability treatment weight (IPTW) multivariate regression, doubly robust multivariate regression, and multivariate regression models (OR, 0.96 [95%CI, 0.95-0.97], OR 0.52 [95%CI, 0.46-0.60], OR 0.66 [95%CI, 0.56-0.78], respectively, p&lt;0.001 for all), indicating the timing as a significant risk-adjusted factor for lower hospital mortality. The difference (BICU-AICU) of RMST at 28- days after ICU admission was 0.531 days (95%CI, 0.002-1.059, p&lt;0.05). Placement of A-line and PA-catheter, administration of intravenous antibiotics, and bolus fluid infusion during the first 24-hr in ICU were significantly more frequent and faster in the BICU vs AICU group (67.6% vs. 51.3% and 126min vs.197min for A-line, 19.6% vs.13.2% and 182min vs. 274min for PA-catheter, 77.5% vs.67.6% and 109min vs.168min for antibiotics, and 57.6% vs.51.6% and 224min vs.278min for bolus fluid infusion, respectively, p&lt;0.001 for all). Additionally, a significant indirect effect was observed in frequency (0.19879 [95% CI, 0.14061-0.25697] p&lt;0.001) and time (0.07714 [95% CI, 0.22600-0.13168], p&lt;0.01) of A-line replacement, frequency of placement of PA-catheter (0.05614 [95% CI, 0.04088-0.07140], p&lt;0.001) and frequency of bolus fluid infusion (0.02193 [95%CI, 0.00303-0.04083], p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Measuring lactates within 3 hr prior to ICU might be associated with lower hospital mortality in unselected heterogeneous critically ill patients with transfer time to ICU ≤ 24hr, presumably due to more frequent and faster therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4310150089,"The coastal intertidal ecosystem of the Bijagós Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, one of the largest and most important in West Africa, sustains a considerable proportion of the migratory shorebird populations of the East Atlantic Flyway and operates as a nursery area for benthic fish in the region. The macrozoobenthos in these mudflats constitute the main food source for both groups so that spatial and temporal variation in their abundance and community composition is likely to influence the abundance and distribution of fish and birds. In this study we described the spatial and temporal dynamics in the density, biomass, and community composition of macrozoobenthos across six intertidal flats in three islands of the Bijagós Archipelago. Overall, the Bijagós Archipelago was characterised by a highly species-rich macrozoobenthic community, with ca. 88 taxa identified across all sites, reaching a mean density of 1871 ± 58.3 ind.m -2 (mean ± SE) and mean biomass of 5.65 ± 0.41 g of AFDM.m -2 (ash-free dry mass per m 2 ), values much lower than what was described for nearby intertidal areas, namely the Band d’Arguin, Mauritania. Density and biomass of major macrozoobenthos classes (Bivalvia, Polychaeta, Malacostraca and Gastropoda) differed across sites and months, displaying an overall increase in density towards the final months of the dry season (March and April). Similarly, community composition also differed significantly between sites and throughout the season. The site with most distinct community composition (Adonga) supported low diversity and high abundance of a few bivalve species, whilst other two sites that hosted the most diverse communities, were also the most similar between them (Anrumai and Abu). These spatial and temporal patterns constitute an important baseline to improve knowledge of this intertidal ecosystem and will contribute towards a better understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of their consumers."
https://openalex.org/W4310150107,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The determinants of RSV seasonality are of importance in designing interventions. They are poorly understood in tropical and sub-tropical regions in low- and middle-income countries. Our study utilized long-term surveillance data on cases of RSV associated with severe or very severe pneumonia in children aged 1 day to 59 months admitted to the Kilifi County Hospital. A generalized additive model was used to investigate the association between RSV admissions and meteorological variables (maximum temperature, rainfall, absolute humidity); weekly number of births within the catchment population; and school term dates. Furthermore, a time-series-susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) model was used to reconstruct an empirical transmission rate which was used as a dependent variable in linear regression and generalized additive models with meteorological variables and school term dates. Maximum temperature, absolute humidity, and weekly number of births were significantly associated with RSV activity in the generalized additive model. Results from the TSIR model indicated that maximum temperature and absolute humidity were significant factors. Rainfall and school term did not yield significant relationships. Our study indicates that meteorological parameters and weekly number of births potentially play a role in the RSV seasonality in this region. More research is required to explore the underlying mechanisms underpinning the observed relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4310150248,"Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system are a prominent feature of von Hippel-Lindau-disease (vHL). Hemangioblastomas are known to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a potential role of VEGF as a biomarker for tumor growth.Plasma VEGF samples from 24 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease were analyzed by solid-phase proximity ligation assay (PLA). Levels were monitored over time together with numeric and volumetric CNS tumor burden, and compared to plasma VEGF levels in healthy controls.The mean yearly progression in tumor volume was 65.5%. Yearly risk of developing one or several new CNS tumor(s) was 50%. No significant correlation between tumor burden and levels of VEGF was seen. VEGF levels in patients (31.55-92.04; mean 55.83, median 56.41) as measured by immunodetection in a solid-phase PLA did not differ significantly from controls (37.38-104.56; mean 58.89, median 54.12) (p = 0,266).The increase in total CNS tumor volume in vHL occurred in a saltatory manner. The risk of developing a new lesion was 50% per year. We found no evidence for VEGF secretion from CNS hemangioblastomas in vHL in circulating blood. Other potential biomarkers should be explored to assess progression of tumor burden in vHL."
https://openalex.org/W4310150256,"A large family of prototoxin-like molecules endogenous to mammals, Ly6 proteins have been implicated in the regulation of cell signaling processes across multiple species. Previous work has shown that certain members of the Ly6 family are expressed in the brain and target nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and potassium channel function. Structural similarities between Ly6 proteins and alpha-neurotoxins suggest the possibility of additional ionotropic receptor targets. Here, we investigated the possibility of lypd2 as a novel regulator of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function. In particular, we focused on potential interactions with the Q/R isoforms of the GluR2 subunit, which have profound impacts on AMPAR permeability to calcium during neuronal stimulation. We find that although lypd2 and GluR2 share overlapping expression patterns in the mouse hippocampus, there was no interaction between lypd2 and either GluR2 Q or GluR2 R isoform. These results underscore the importance of continuing to investigate novel targets for Ly6 interaction and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4310150281,"The prevention and control of hypertension should be an effective way to reduce deaths and it has been a high priority in China. In 2013, the Chinese government increased the subsidy standard for the National Essential Public Health Services Package (NEPHSP) from RMB 15 to RMB 30 per person, which was expected to cover 70 million hypertensions. This study explored the influence of increasing NEPHSP subsidy on outpatient and inpatient expenditure among patients with hypertension.Data were mined from the 2011-2015 Harmonized China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. The study sample included 3192 hypertensive patients who were not lost to follow-up from 2011 to 2015. Hypertensive patients who covered by NEPHSP from 2011 to 2015 were defined as the treatment group, otherwise defined as the comparison group. The policy intervention was the increase of NEPHSP subsidy in 2013, and the years before and after 2013 were respectively considered as pre- (2011) and post-intervention (2015). The primary outcomes variables were the outpatient and inpatient expenditure of patients with hypertension, based on direct spending of outpatients and inpatients separately reported by patients with hypertension. Using propensity score matching (PSM) to match the individual characteristics of hypertension in the treatment group and the comparison group, difference-in-differences (DID) were used to analyze the outcomes.The patients with hypertension' outpatient and inpatient expenditure patterns in the treatment and control group show an increasing trend from 2011 to 2015. After PSM, of the 1 956 hypertensive participants, 369 covered by the NEPHSP before and after 2013. A DID estimate of the increased NEPHSP subsidy was associated with a significant decrease of 1 251.35 RMB (t = 2.13, P = 0.034) in hypertension related inpatient expenditure, no significant change (t = 0.61, P = 0.544) among outpatient expenditure.The NEPHSP may reduce inpatient expenditure among hypertension. Further strengthening of the NEPHSP may reduce their burden."
https://openalex.org/W4310150282,"The ongoing COVID-19 has led to an increase in negative emotions and health awareness among consumers. This paper discusses the emotion bias of Chinese consumers during the three periods: the pre-COVID-19 period, the COVID-19 lockdown period, and the COVID-19 normalization period. This study takes health products as the research object and crawls relevant reviews on the JD platform to classify products. The data were classified into emotion, the intensity of emotion was calculated, and the logistic regression model and variance analysis were used to analyze the difference in emotion expression. The study reveals that consumers are willing to express fear and sadness during the COVID-19 lockdown era and are willing to express like emotions before the pandemic compared to the three periods. There are also differences in the emotional intensity of different product reviews. The intensity of emotional expression is more vigorous for consumers who purchase nutritional products, while for those who purchase healthcare equipment, the intensity of emotional expression is lower. This study offers the emotion bias of consumers in response to COVID-19 to provide a theoretical basis and reference solution for implementing marketing strategies for health product companies."
https://openalex.org/W4310150454,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented significant challenges and created concerns worldwide. Besides, patients who have experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection could present post-viral complications that can ultimately lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Serum levels of Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6), high molecular weight human MUC1 mucin, are increased in the most patients with various interstitial lung damage. Since its production is raised during epithelial damages, KL-6 could be a helpful non-invasive marker to monitor COVID-19 infection and predict post-infection sequelae.We retrospectively evaluated KL-6 levels of 222 COVID-19 infected patients and 70 healthy control. Serum KL-6, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), platelet-lymphocytes ratio (PLR) levels and other biological parameters were analyzed. This retrospective study also characterized the relationships between serum KL-6 levels and pulmonary function variables.Our results showed that serum KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were increased compared to healthy subjects (470 U/ml vs 254 U/ml, P <0.00001). ROC curve analysis enabled us to identify that KL-6 > 453.5 U/ml was associated with COVID-19 (AUC = 0.8415, P < 0.0001). KL-6 level was positively correlated with other indicators of disease severity such as fibrinogen level (r = 0.1475, P = 0.0287), LDH level (r = 0,31, P = 0,004) and PLR level (r = 0.23, P = 0.0005). However, KL-6 levels were not correlated with pulmonary function tests (r = 0.04, P = 0.69).KL-6 expression was correlated with several disease severity indicators. However, the association between mortality and long-term follow-up outcomes needs further investigation. More extensive trials are required to prove that KL-6 could be a marker of disease severity in COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4310150478,"Purpose Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of retinal fibrosis, which is one of the leading causes of impaired vision. Current approaches to treating retinal fibrosis focus, among other things, on inhibiting the TGFB signaling pathway. Transient expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is one way to inhibit the TGFB pathway post-transcriptionally. Our previous study identified the miRNA miR-302d as a regulator of multiple TGFB-related genes in ARPE-19 cells. To further explore its effect on primary cells, the effect of miR-302d on TGFB-induced EMT in primary human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) was investigated in vitro . Methods hRPE cells were extracted from patients receiving enucleation. Transfection of hRPE cells with miR-302d was performed before or after TGFB1 stimulation. Live-cell imaging, immunocytochemistry staining, Western blot, and ELISA assays were utilized to identify the alterations of cellular morphology and EMT-related factors expressions in hRPE cells. Results hRPE cells underwent EMT by TGFB1 exposure. The transfection of miR-302d inhibited the transition with decreased production of mesenchymal markers and increased epithelial factors. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of SMAD2 activated by TGFB1 was suppressed. Moreover, miR-302d expression promoted TGFB1-induced fibroblast-like hRPE cells to revert towards an epithelial stage. As confirmed by ELISA, miR-302d reduced TGFB receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) levels 48 hours after transfection. Conclusions The protective effect of miR-302d might be a promising approach for ameliorating retinal fibrosis and neovascularization. MiR-302d suppresses TGFB-induced EMT in hRPE cells via downregulation of TGFBR2, even reversing the process. Furthermore, miR-302d reduces the constitutive secretion of VEGFA from hRPE cells."
