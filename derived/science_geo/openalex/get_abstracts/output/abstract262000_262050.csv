Here we characterize the transcriptional landscape of the four human HOX loci at five base pair resolution in 11 anatomic sites and identify 231 HOX ncRNAs that extend known transcribed regions by more than 30 kilobases. HOX ncRNAs are spatially expressed along developmental axes and possess unique sequence motifs, and their expression demarcates broad chromosomal domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. We identified a 2.2 kilobase ncRNA residing in the HOXC locus, termed HOTAIR, which represses transcription in trans across 40 kilobases of the HOXD locus. HOTAIR interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is required for PRC2 occupancy and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation of HOXD locus. Thus, transcription of ncRNA may demarcate chromosomal domains of gene silencing at a distance; these results have broad implications for gene regulation in development and disease states.

A distinguishing feature of metazoan genomes is the abundance of noncoding RNA (ncRNAs), which function by means other than directing the production of proteins. In addition to small regulatory RNAs such as miRNAs, recent studies have predicted the existence of long ncRNAs—ranging from 300 nucleotides (nt) to over 10 kb—that are spliced, polyadenylated, and roughly as diverse in a given cell type as protein-coding mRNAs (Bertone et al., 2004Bertone P.

Long ncRNAs may have diverse roles in gene regulation, especially in epigenetic control of chromatin (Bernstein and Allis, 2005Bernstein E. Allis C.D. RNA meets chromatin.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1635-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most prominent example is silencing of the inactive X chromosome by the ncRNA XIST. To normalize the copy number of X chromosomes between male and female cells, transcription of XIST RNA from one of the two female X chromosome is involved in recruiting Polycomb group proteins (PcG) to trimethylate histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), rendering the chromosome transcriptionally silent (Plath et al., 2003Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. de la Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y. Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in X inactivation.Science. 2003; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). It is believed that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), comprised of H3K27 histone methyl transferase (HMTase) EZH2 and core components Suz12 and EED, initiates this histone modification and that, subsequently, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) maintains this modification and promotes chromatin compaction (reviewed by Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Polycomb silencers control cell fate, development and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Presently, the mechanism by which XIST ncRNA guides Polycomb activity is unclear. Several PcG proteins possess RNA-binding activity, and RNA is required for PcG binding to DNA, suggesting that specific ncRNAs may be critical interfaces between chromatin-remodeling complexes and the genome (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell.

In addition to dosage compensation, long ncRNAs may also play critical roles in pattern formation and differentiation. In mammals, 39 HOX transcription factors clustered on four chromosomal loci, termed HOXA through HOXD, are essential for specifying the positional identities of cells. The temporal and spatial pattern of HOX gene expression is often correlated to their genomic location within each loci, a property termed colinearity (Kmita and Duboule, 2003Kmita M. Duboule D.

Genomic evolution of Hox gene clusters.Science. 2006; 313: 1918-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Maintenance of HOX expression patterns is under complex epigenetic regulation. Two opposing groups of histone-modifying complexes, the trithorax group (TrxG) of H3K4 HMTase and the PcG H3K27 HMTase, maintain open and closed chromatin domains in the HOX loci, respectively, over successive cell divisions (Ringrose and Paro, 2007Ringrose L. Paro R. Polycomb/Trithorax response elements and epigenetic memory of cell identity.Development. 2007; 134: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Transcription of many ncRNAs has been observed in fly, mouse, and human HOX loci (Bae et al., 2002Bae E. Calhoun V.C. Levine M. Lewis E.B. Drewell R.A.

Noncoding RNA synthesis and loss of Polycomb group repression accompanies the colinear activation of the human HOXA cluster.RNA. 2006; 13: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and three models have been proposed to account for their action based on experiments in Drosophila. First, elegant genetic studies suggested that transcription of ncRNAs altered the accessibility of DNA sequences important for TrxG and PcG binding; the act of intergenic transcription enabled TrxG activation of downstream HOX genes and prevented PcG-mediated silencing (Ringrose and Paro, 2007Ringrose L. Paro R. Polycomb/Trithorax response elements and epigenetic memory of cell identity.Development. 2007; 134: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 2005Schmitt S. Prestel M. Paro R. Intergenic transcription through a polycomb group response element counteracts silencing.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Second, the above model has been extended by a recent report that several ncRNAs transcribed 5′ of the Drosophila HOX gene Ubx bind to and recruit the TrxG protein Ash1 to the Ubx promoter, thereby inducing Ubx transcription (Sanchez-Elsner et al., 2006Sanchez-Elsner T. Gou D. Kremmer E. Sauer F. Noncoding RNAs of trithorax response elements recruit Drosophila Ash1 to Ultrabithorax.Science. 2006; 311: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, these results have been challenged by the third model of “transcriptional interference,” where transcription of 5′ ncRNAs into the promoters of downstream HOX genes prevents HOX gene expression, leading to transcriptional silencing in cis (Petruk et al., 2006Petruk S. Sedkov Y. Riley K.M. Hodgson J. Schweisguth F. Hirose S. Jaynes J.B. Brock H.W. Mazo A. Transcription of bxd noncoding RNAs promoted by trithorax represses Ubx in cis by transcriptional interference.Cell. 2006; 127: 1209-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The extent to which any of these models and alternative mechanisms explain the copious amount of transcription in mammalian HOX loci remains to be discovered. Nonetheless, the large number of HOX ncRNAs, their complex clustering on the chromosomes, and their potentially diverse modes of action suggest ncRNAs play a significant role in HOX regulation. By profiling the entire transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of ∼500 kilobase HOX loci at near nucleotide resolution, we will begin to discern competing models of ncRNA action in humans and reveal potentially new mechanisms of ncRNA function. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the HOX loci require pure cell populations with distinct positional identities. Rather than study whole animals where cells of many histologic types and positional identities are intermixed, we and others have observed that primary adult human fibroblasts retain many features of the embryonic pattern of HOX gene expression both in vitro and in vivo (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E.

Differential and colinear expression of HOX genes in adult fibroblasts faithfully reflects their position along the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal axes of the developing body (Rinn et al., 2006Rinn J.L. Bondre C. Gladstone H.B. Brown P.O. Chang H.Y.

Homeobox genes, fetal wound healing, and skin regional specificity.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The remarkable persistence—over decades—of the embryonic patterns of HOX gene expression in these human cells suggests the action of a powerful epigenetic machinery operative over the HOX loci. In this study, we create an ultrahigh-resolution tiling microarray to interrogate the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the HOX loci in a unique collection of primary human fibroblasts with 11 distinct positional identities. Our results identify numerous novel human HOX ncRNAs, clarify potential mechanisms of their regulation, and reveal a novel mechanism of ncRNA-assisted transcriptional silencing via the PcG proteins in trans. To systematically investigate the transcriptional activity of the human HOX loci, we designed a DNA microarray for all four human HOX loci at five base pair (bp) resolution along with two megabases of control regions (Table S1). Computational and experimental analysis confirmed the specificity of the tiling array to distinguish highly related HOX sequences (Figures S1 and S2). Because adult primary fibroblasts are differentiated based on their anatomic site of origin and retain canonical features of the embryonic HOX code (Chang et al., 2002Chang H.Y. Chi J.T. Dudoit S. Bondre C. van de Rijn M. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Diversity, topographic differentiation, and positional memory in human fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previously, analytic methods for tiling arrays have allowed present/absent calls of transcripts and binding events but were less successful in quantification of signal intensity (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S. Karlsson E.K. Kulbokas 3rd, E.J.

Stolc V. Royce T.E. Rozowsky J.S. Urban A.E. Zhu X. Rinn J.L. Tongprasit W. Samanta M. Weissman S. et al.Global identification of human transcribed sequences with genome tiling arrays.Science. 2004; 306: 2242-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We addressed this challenge by adapting a signal processing algorithm used in computer vision termed Otsu's method (Otsu, 1979Otsu N. A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms.IEEE Trans. Sys. Man. Cybern. 1979; 9: 62-66Crossref Google Scholar). The method dynamically searches for statistically significant cutoffs between signal and background and detects contiguous regions of at least 100 bp (20 probes) with signal intensity significantly above background. Averaging the signal intensity over all probes in the called region thus produces a quantitative measure of transcript abundance. Using this algorithm, we identified a total of 407 discrete transcribed regions in the four HOX loci (Table S2). We used current genome annotations to partition them into known HOX gene exons, introns, and intergenic transcripts (Figure 1B). As expected, we detected many transcribed regions that corresponded to known HOX exons and introns (101 and 75, respectively), including exonic transcription for 34 of the 39 HOX genes, thus indicating that these 11 samples encompass the majority of HOX transcriptional activity. In all cases examined, the expression of HOX genes as determined by the tiling array matched that previously determined by cDNA microarray and RT-PCR for these same samples (Chang et al., 2002Chang H.Y. Chi J.T. Dudoit S. Bondre C. van de Rijn M. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Diversity, topographic differentiation, and positional memory in human fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12877-12882Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, Rinn et al., 2006Rinn J.L. Bondre C. Gladstone H.B. Brown P.O. Chang H.Y. Anatomic demarcation by positional variation in fibroblast gene expression programs.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e119https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020119Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of the transcribed regions (231 of 407) arise from intergenic regions (Figure 1C). By comparison to databases of all known amino acid sequences, we found that only 13% (29 of 231) of these intergenic transcripts showed any coding potential in all six possible translational frames (Experimental Procedures; Table S3). In contrast, 88% (84 of 96) of the HOX exon transcripts had coding potential, where the 12% noncoding exonic transcripts corresponded to untranslated exonic regions. While these results do not completely rule out the possibility of new protein-coding genes interspersed throughout the HOX loci, these intergenic transcripts are more likely candidate noncoding RNAs. We therefore refer to these intergenic transcripts as HOX ncRNAs. We named each ncRNA by its genomic location, affixing the name of the HOX gene located 3′ to the ncRNA on the HOX-coding strand (Figure 1C). As previously suggested (Sessa et al., 2006Sessa L. Breiling A. Lavorgna G. Silvestri L. Casari G. Orlando V. Noncoding RNA synthesis and loss of Polycomb group repression accompanies the colinear activation of the human HOXA cluster.RNA. 2006; 13: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the majority of ncRNAs (74%) demonstrate evidence for opposite-strand transcription from the HOX genes (Table S4). Fifteen percent of the ncRNAs we identified are novel, while the majority of ncRNAs (85%) have been independently observed by EST sequencing or other means (Experimental Procedures). Even for the known ncRNAs, our data suggest that almost all ncRNAs are longer than previously believed (Table S4). The average extension for previously observed ncRNAs is 202 bases; in total we discovered over 30 kilobases of new transcribed bases in the human HOX loci. Thus, in just 11 hybridizations, we have substantially expanded the number and length of known transcribed regions in the human HOX loci as well as defined their expression patterns throughout the human body. We found several lines of evidence that confirm the biological importance of the HOX ncRNAs. First, comparative analysis with seven vertebrate genomes revealed that some ncRNAs are preferentially conserved in evolution over nontranscribed or intronic HOX sequences. For instance, more than one-third of the top 100 conserved transcribed regions in the HOX loci are ncRNAs (Figure S3A). Second, RT-PCR analysis of 40 predictions of ncRNA expression levels from the tiling array confirmed a high level of agreement (85%) between array signal intensity and transcript abundance as measured by RT-PCR (Figure S3B). Third, we found that, like canonical HOX genes, ncRNAs also systematically vary their expression along developmental axes of the body in a manner coordinated with their physical location on the chromosome (Figure 2; Table S5). One hundred forty-seven of 231 HOX ncRNAs (64%) are differentially expressed along a developmental axis of the body (p < 0.05). For instance, 48 HOX ncRNAs are differentially expressed with their neighboring HOX genes along the proximal-distal axis (close or far from the trunk of the body; p < 0.05, Figure 2A). Strikingly, all 41 transcribed regions (both HOX genes and ncRNAs) that are induced in distal sites belonged to HOX paralogous groups 9–13, and all 30 transcribed regions that are repressed in distal sites belonged to paralogous groups 1–6, precisely recapitulating the evolutionary origin of the two domains from Drosophila ultrabithorax and antennapedia complexes, respectively (p < 10−19, two-way chi-square test; Carroll, 1995Carroll S.B. Homeotic genes and the evolution of arthropods and chordates.Nature. 1995; 376: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Similarly, 87 HOX ncRNAs are differentially expressed along the anterior-posterior axis (top to bottom of the body), this time with ncRNAs from HOXC9–13 preferentially induced in posterior sites (p < 0.05, Figure 2B). Additionally, we observed 7 HOX genes and 12 ncRNAs that are either expressed in dermal (outside the body) or nondermal (inside the body) fibroblasts (Figure S4; Table S5). Systematic comparison of the expression pattern of every ncRNA with its immediate 5′ and 3′ HOX gene neighbor showed that the vast majority of ncRNAs (90%) are coordinately induced with their 3′ HOX genes, while only 10% of instances are ncRNA expression anticorrelated with 3′ HOX gene expression (Figure S5). Fourth, in addition to their distinctive expression patterns, we found that the ncRNAs also possess specific sequence motifs. Using a discriminative motif finder that we previously developed (Segal et al., 2003Segal E. Yelensky R. Koller D. Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA sequence and gene expression.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: i273-i282Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we found that ncRNAs are enriched for specific DNA sequence motifs based on their site-specific expression patterns (p < 10−9, Figure 3C). We identified a sequence motif enriched in ncRNAs over exonic, intronic, or nontranscribed sequences, and we further identified sequence motifs for ncRNAs that are expressed in distal, proximal, or posterior sites. These sequence motifs may represent DNA- or RNA-binding sites for regulatory factors to regulate gene expression in cis. Together, these results establish that the majority of site-specific transcriptional output of the HOX loci consists of ncRNAs. Their evolutionary conservation, differential expression along developmental axes, and distinct primary sequence motifs suggest important and possibly widespread roles for these ncRNA transcripts in HOX gene regulation. The coordinate expression of HOX genes and neighboring ncRNAs raised the possibility that their expression may be regulated by chromatin domains, large contiguous regions of differential chromatin modifications that enable transcriptional accessibility or cause silencing. Such domains, first observed by Bernstein and colleagues for histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2; Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S. Karlsson E.K. Kulbokas 3rd, E.J.

Suz12 binds to silenced regions of the genome in a cell-type-specific manner.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We tested this idea by loci-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip). We found that both HOX and ncRNA transcription fell within broad domains occupied by RNA polymerase II, whereas the transcriptionally silent regions were broadly occupied by the PRC2 component Suz12 and its cognate histone mark, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3; p < 10−15, chi-square test, Experimental Procedures; Figure 3). Comparison of cells from different anatomic origins showed that the primary DNA sequence can be programmed with precisely the same boundary but in the opposite configuration. For example, in lung fibroblasts the 5′ HOXA locus is occupied by Suz12 but not PolII, whereas in foreskin fibroblasts this exact same chromatin domain is occupied by PolII but not Suz12. Thus, positional identity in differentiated cells may be marked by diametric or mutually exclusive domains of chromatin modifications, which switch their configurations around a center of inversion in a site-specific manner. Interestingly, the boundary of the diametric chromatin domains defined by ChIP-chip is precisely the same as that suggested by our transcriptional analysis. In the HOXA locus, the chromatin boundary and switch between proximal versus distal expression patterns occurs between HOXA7 and HOXA9. Additional ChIP-chip analysis showed the domain of PolII occupancy precisely overlaps the domain of H3K4 dimethylation, but H3K9 trimethylation, a histone modification characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin, is not present on any HOX loci in these cells (Figure S6). These results suggest that HOX loci transcription in adult fibroblasts is governed by opposing epigenetic modifications over large chromosomal regions and further define the locations of specific boundary elements that delimit chromatin domains. We next asked whether the coordinate transcription of HOX ncRNAs is merely a consequence of the broad chromatin domains or whether the ncRNAs are actively involved in establishing such domains. To address this question, we analyzed in depth the function of a long ncRNA situated at the boundary of two diametrical chromatin domains in the HOXC locus (Figure 4A). This ncRNA is transcribed in an antisense manner with respect to the canonical HOXC genes; we therefore named it HOTAIR for HOX Antisense Intergenic RNA. Molecular cloning and northern blot analysis confirmed that HOTAIR is a 2158 nucleotide, spliced, and polyadenylated transcript; strand-specific RT-PCR analysis confirmed that only one strand of HOTAIR that is antisense to HOXC genes is transcribed (Figures 4B and 4C). Computational analysis of HOTAIR secondary structure did not reveal obvious stem loops suggestive of pre-miRNAs. Northern blot analysis of size-fractionated RNA showed no evidence of small RNA products suggestive of micro- or siRNA production, while we readily detected the ubiquitous miRNA let7 in parallel experiments (Figure 4D). Our tiling array data suggested that HOTAIR is preferentially expressed in posterior and distal sites, and indeed this expression pattern is confirmed by additional RT-PCR experiments (Figure 4E). In situ hybridization of developing mouse embryos confirmed that HOTAIR is expressed in posterior and distal sites, indicating the conservation of anatomic expression pattern from development to adulthood (Figure 4F). Interestingly, this transcript has very high nucleotide conservation in vertebrates (99.5%, 95%, 90%, and 85% sequence identity in chimp, macaque, mouse, and dog genomes, respectively), yet is riddled with stop codons with little amino acid sequence conservation amongst vertebrates (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These results suggest that HOTAIR may function as a long ncRNA. HOTAIR ncRNA may regulate gene expression in HOX loci in cis or trans; alternatively, it may be the act of antisense transcription in the HOXC locus rather than the ncRNA itself that has a functional role in gene regulation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we depleted HOTAIR ncRNA by RNA interference in primary human fibroblasts and determined the consequences on the transcriptional landscape of the HOX loci. Strikingly, while siRNA-mediated depletion of HOTAIR had little effect on transcription of the HOXC locus on chromosome 12 compared to wild-type and control siRNA targeting GFP, depletion of HOTAIR led to dramatic transcriptional activation of the HOXD locus on chromosome 2 spanning over 40 kb, including HOXD8, HOXD9, HOXD10, HOXD11, and multiple ncRNAs (Figures 5A, 5B, and S7). To ensure that this was not an off-target effect of RNA interference, we employed four independent siRNA sequences targeting HOTAIR. Each siRNA depleted HOTAIR ncRNA and led to concomitant HOXD10 activation as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Figures 5C and 5D). These observations indicate that HOTAIR ncRNA is required to maintain a transcrip"

Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses.

The analysis of miRNA function in animals is either performed genetically or by delivery of synthetic miRNA precursors or antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs; reviewed recently in Krützfeldt et al., 2006Krützfeldt J.

The increasing number of studies addressing the role of miRNAs in development and in various diseases including cancer emphasizes the need for a comprehensive catalog of accurate sequence, expression, and conservation information for the large number of recently proposed miRNAs. Here we present a database and analysis of over 250 small RNA cDNA libraries obtained by cloning and sequencing. We have developed interactive analysis tools and illustrate their utility in discovering miRNA expression changes associated with hematopoietic and nervous system differentiation and malignant transformation. We cloned and sequenced more than 330,000 independent small RNA sequences from 256 small RNA libraries prepared from 26 distinct organ systems and cell types of human and/or rodents (Table S1) and also reanalyzed some previously described small RNA libraries (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002Lagos-Quintana M.

Each library was covered by about 1,300 clones and contained on average 65% miRNA sequences representing 70 to 75 distinct mature miRNAs (Tables S2–S4). Our small RNA annotation procedure and miRNA profile analysis (Figure S1) kept track of small RNA clones that mapped equally well to more than one miRNA precursor (Tables S5–S8). About one-third of all miRNA clones mapped to multicopy miRNA genes with indistinguishable mature sequences, while another 1% mapped to two or more paralogs with related, but not identical, mature miRNA sequences. Clone counts of miRNAs were collected in two distinct table formats either distributing the clones between miRNA genes or precursors (Tables S9–S11) or collecting them as unique mature sequences (Tables S12–S14). In the annotation process, we identified 33 new miRNAs (Table 1), and we confirmed the expression of many evolutionarily conserved miRNAs previously only cloned in other species.Table 1miRNAs Identified in This Study and Not Listed in miRBase (Release 9.1)Human miRNASequenceClone #Mouse miRNASequenceClone #Rat miRNASequenceClone #miR-872__FMAAGGUUACUUGUUAGUUCAGG11miR-872AAGGUUACUUGUUAGUUCAGG394miR-872AAGGUUACUUGUUAGUUCAGG373miR-879AGAGGCUUAUAGCUCUAAGCC33miR-879AGAGGCUUAUAGCUCUAAGCC5miR-8822Part of the cluster-mmu-mir-134(33), enriched in embryonic tissue.AGGAGAGAGUUAGCGCAUUAGU1miR-882a6Part of the cluster-rno-mir-134(41).AUGGGAAUGUUAGAGCAUUAGC0miR-882bAUGGCAAUGUUAGAGCAUUAGC0miR-874CUGCCCUGGCCCGAGGGACCGA17miR-874CUGCCCUGGCCCGAGGGACCGA2miR-874CUGCCCUGGCCCGAGGGACCGA0miR-877GUAGAGGAGAUGGCGCAGGG40miR-877GUAGAGGAGAUGGCGCAGGG6miR-877GUAGAGGAGAUGGCGCAGGG2miR-297c3Part of the cluster-mmu-mir-297a-1(46).AUGUAUGUGUGCAUGUACAUGU16|miR-743b4Part of the cluster-mmu-mir-463(19), epididymis (testis) enriched expression.GAAAGACAUCAUGCUGAAUAGA8|miR-743b7Part of the cluster-rno-mir-463(12).GAAAGACACCAUACUGAAUAGA0|miR-883aUAACUGCAACAGCUCUCAGUAU6|miR-883bUAACUGCAACAUCUCUCAGUAU1|miR-883UAACUGCAACAUCUCUCAGUAU0|miR-880UACUCCAUCCUCUCUGAGUAGA119|miR-880UACUCCAUUCAUUCUGAGUAGA3|miR-878GCAUGACACCACACUGGGUAGA22|miR-878GCAUGACACCAUACUGGGUAGA1|miR-874AACUGUGUCUUUUCUGAAUAGA60|miR-881AACUGUGGCAUUUCUGAAUAGA0miR-871__FMUAUUCAGAUUAGUGCCAGUCAUG2|miR-871UAUUCAGAUUAGUGCCAGUCAUG11|miR-871UAUUCAGAUUGGUGCCGGUCACA0|miR-8901Part of the cluster-hsa-mir-888(6), epididymis-specific expression.UACUUGGAAAGGCAUCAGUUG10|miR-888UACUCAAAAAGCUGUCAGUCA16|miR-465dUAUUUAGAAUGGUACUGAUGUG0|miR-892bCACUGGCUCCUUUCUGGGUAGA14|miR-465cUAUUUAGAAUGGCGCUGAUCUG42|miR-891bUGCAACUUACCUGAGUCAUUGA4|miR-891aUGCAACGAACCUGAGCCACUGA24|miR-466f5Part of the cluster-mmu-mir-297a-3(43).UACGUGUGUGUGCAUGUGCAUG7|miR-466eGAUGUGUGUGUACAUGUACAUA1.5|miR-466bGAUGUGUGUGUACAUGUACAUG7|miR-466b8Part of the cluster-rno-mir-297c(4); Abbreviations are as follows: FM: “from mouse”; the same miRNA sequence as in mouse was cloned but could not be found in the current human assembly.UAUGUGUGUGUGUAUGUCCAUG1|miR-466cGAUGUGUGUGUGCAUGUACAUA11|miR-466cUGUGAUGUGUGCAUGUACAUG2|miR-467eAUAAGUGUGAGCAUGUAUAUGU125|miR-466dUGUGUGUGCGUACAUGUACAUG4|miR-466gAUACAGACACAUGCACACACA2|miR-466hUGUGUGCAUGUGCUUGUGUGUA4miR-885UCCAUUACACUACCCUGCCUCU5miR-887GUGAACGGGCGCCAUCCCGAGG3miR-886CGCGGGUGCUUACUGACCCUU16The predominantly cloned sequence and orthologs are indicated.

Open table in a new tab The predominantly cloned sequence and orthologs are indicated. Bars beside the name indicate clustered miRNAs. We provide evidence for expression of 340, 303, and 205 distinct mature miRNAs from human, mouse, and rat; these are encoded by 395, 363, and 231 different miRNA genes, respectively. When including orthology relationships for cloned miRNAs (Table S15), we obtained a final list of 416, 386, and 325 miRNA genes present in human, mouse, and rat contained in 214, 190, and 168 transcription units, respectively. The 8.2 release of miRBase includes 84, 7, and 13 additional miRNA gene candidates for human, mouse, and rat, respectively, for which we have not found supporting evidence in this study. About 80% of these miRNA candidates were initially identified at very low or single clone counts in single libraries or after sequence-based enrichment procedures (discussed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The relative cloning frequencies of miRNAs represent a measure of miRNA expression. We implemented three distinct ways of visualizing miRNA expression patterns. (1) We represent each mature miRNA sequence independently. (2) Assuming that similar miRNAs regulate similar targets, we defined “sequence groups” of mature miRNAs based on sequence similarity (Table S16; Figure S3). (3) We grouped miRNA precursors that either share a mature form (multicopy miRNAs) or are clustered in the genome in “precursor clusters” (Tables S17–S19). Available cDNA and EST expression evidence supports most of our spatially linked precursor clusters, and pairwise comparison of the relative expression of clustered mature miRNAs across tissues yielded higher correlation coefficients than for nonclustered miRNAs (r = 0.49 for mouse and human versus r = 0.11 and 0.15 for mouse and human, respectively; Tables S20–S22). We named precursor clusters according to the name of the lowest numbered cluster member and added in brackets the number of members in the cluster (e.g., expression from the hsa-mir-15a/mir-16-1 genes and hsa-mir-15b/mir-16-2 genes was summarized in the precursor cluster-hsa-mir-15a(4)); miRNA sequence families were named with similar convention. For the comparison of miRNA profiles and clustering of samples, we used a Bayesian probability framework that takes into account the sampling noise affecting the relative frequencies of miRNAs. A web-accessible database (http://www.mirz.unibas.ch/smiRNAdb) allows users to perform sequence searches and to visualize and analyze the miRNA expression profiles across individual samples or groups of samples. Technical and biological replicates indicated that miRNA cloning frequencies are reproducible (Figure S3). We then compared the cloning frequencies of five of our samples with signal intensities from miRNA microarrays using the same input total RNA (Figures S4 and S5) and observed a strong and significant correlation of expression ranks within each sample. Furthermore, our cloning profiles correlated with most liver and brain profiles reported by many other laboratories (Figure S6). In order to evaluate how miRNA cloning frequencies correlate with the actual miRNA concentration across samples, we determined the absolute amount of several miRNAs in a subset of our samples by quantitative northern blotting. We found a significant correlation between miRNA clone frequencies and concentrations measured by northern blotting (Figures S7–S11). To assess how well cloning frequencies reflect relative concentrations within a sample and to identify potential systematic biases in our library preparation protocol, we prepared a pool of 816 synthetic 5′ phosphorylated oligoribonucleotides with known relative concentrations containing the predominantly cloned miRNA sequences. We sequenced a total of 7498 miRNA clones from two independently prepared libraries (Table S23). Although the miRNA clone counts correlated significantly with their concentrations in the pool, the correlation coefficient was rather low. To a large extent, this is expected for the relatively small sample sizes, as shown by resampling tests (Figure S12; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). However, because the clone counts of the two libraries correlated better with each other than two resampled samples did, we conjectured that a systematic bias must also be present in the cloning protocol. The most likely source of this bias is the secondary structure of the different small RNAs that affect the adaptor ligation efficiency. Such a RNA self-structure-dependent bias would also explain the robust correlation of miRNA profiles across samples and to miRNA array platforms. Approximately 20% of miRNA clone sequences in human, mouse, and rat contained mismatches with respect to their genomic locus that were caused by posttranscriptional modification and/or PCR and sequencing errors. We identified sequence variations for 143 different human and 109 mouse miRNA genes above the sequencing error background (Figure 1; Tables S24 and S25). The frequency of sequence alteration (Table S26) was dependent on the specific nucleotide and its position within the miRNA and was sometimes also tissue dependent (Tables S27 and S28). The prevailing modifications were caused by A-to-I editing (identified as A-to-G changes) and 3′ terminal A and U additions. The A-to-G transitions (Figure 1C) occurred at 4-fold lower frequency in mouse than in human (0.5% in mouse and 2.2% overall in human), in agreement with recent reports of substantially higher A-to-I editing in primates (Kim et al., 2004Kim D.D. Kim T.T. Walsh T. Kobayashi Y. Matise T.C. Buyske S. Gabriel A.

The most important criteria for annotating a cloned sequence as a miRNA are their characteristic length (∼22 nucleotides) and a compact pre-miRNA fold-back structure (Ambros et al., 2003Ambros V. Bartel B. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Carrington J.C. Chen X. Dreyfuss G. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Marshall M. et al.A uniform system for microRNA annotation.RNA. 2003; 9: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, miRNAs generally adhere to additional properties including precise 5′ end processing, asymmetric strand accumulation, and sequence conservation. Surprisingly, not all miRNA sequences complied with these criteria when we examined the large number of miRNA clones obtained in our study. Therefore we subdivided miRNAs into four categories (Tables S29–S31, for details see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We termed the miRNAs in those categories “prototypical,” “repeat-clustered,” “repeat-derived,” and “unclassified” miRNAs. miRNAs were considered prototypical if they met defined criteria regarding their 5′ end processing, lack of repetitiveness, and cross-species conservation. More than 97% of our miRNA clones originated from prototypical miRNA genes. Overall, 59% of all miRNA genes were classified as prototypical. Repeat-clustered and repeat-derived miRNAs originate from highly repetitive genomic sequences, either clustered or dispersed (Smalheiser and Torvik, 2005Smalheiser N.R. Torvik V.I. Mammalian microRNAs derived from genomic repeats.Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 322-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In human and mouse, we identified only a single repeat-cluster. The human cluster contains 40 sequence-related precursors that are coexpressed in placenta (see also Bentwich et al., 2005Bentwich I. Avniel A. Karov Y. Aharonov R. Gilad S. Barad O. Barzilai A. Einat P. Einav U. Meiri E. et al.Identification of hundreds of conserved and nonconserved human microRNAs.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse cluster consists of 43 precursors preferentially expressed in neuronal tissues. In contrast to the human repeat-clustered miRNAs, the mouse repeat-clustered miRNAs had additional matches to nearly 2000 dispersed regions in the mouse genome, and we therefore called them also repeat-derived. In contrast to prototypical miRNAs, precursors of repeat-clustered miRNAs did not preserve the strand asymmetry between sequence-related precursors. Finally, from the dispersed repeat miRNA category, we identified 75 and 74 miRNA genes in human and mouse, respectively. The overall cloning frequency of all repeat-associated miRNA sequences was 2.6%, though the number of genes in this category represented more than 23% of all miRNA genes. The remaining 28% of miRNA genes were termed unclassified, and their clone counts only amounted to 0.4% of all miRNA clones in our study. We found evidence of expression for 42.3% of these genes, and their products showed irregularities in processing and/or unusual sequence variations including deletions and variation in the seed sequence between human and rodent orthologs. In order to assess if our classification scheme of miRNAs has functional implications, we computed the number of conserved 3′ UTR sequence segments complementary to position 1 to 8 (seed) of conserved miRNAs (the “signal”) and of shuffled sequences (the “noise”; Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9265) Google Scholar). Prototypical miRNAs showed an enrichment for putative target sites (average signal-to-noise ratio = 3.2:1), consistent with previous analyses of smaller sets of predominantly prototypical miRNAs (Lewis et al., 2003Lewis B.P.

Animal MicroRNAs confer robustness to gene expression and have a significant impact on 3′UTR evolution.Cell. 2005; 123: 1133-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Repeat-derived miRNAs showed an average ratio of 1.2:1, while unclassified miRNAs had an average ratio of 1.0:1, suggesting that nonprototypical miRNAs either have fewer conserved mRNA targets and/or different requirements for mRNA targeting. Understanding cell-type specificity of miRNA expression is an important step in elucidating miRNA function. We defined this in terms of information content of the distribution of the relative cloning frequencies in each individual tissue type (see Experimental Procedures and Tables S32–S34). The miRNA expression varied from highly specific to ubiquitous and, for conserved miRNAs, was comparable between rodents and human. Surprisingly, very few miRNAs were exclusively found in individual tissues or cell types, and only a third of the analyzed miRNAs were expressed with a higher degree of tissue specificity (Figure 2A). When we examined the overall miRNA cloning frequency, we noticed that several abundant miRNAs were ubiquitously expressed, even in embryonic derived cell lines and tissues (Figure 2B). Most notably, miR-16, which is encoded by the mir-15a/mir16-1 and the mir-15b/mir16-2 polycistrons, was always among the most abundantly cloned miRNAs in each of the over 250 samples analyzed. miR-21 was detected in the majority of samples, but, in contrast to miR-16, its relative cloning frequency varied greatly and was higher in tumor samples and cell lines compared to normal tissues. The expression patterns of miRNAs were recently examined by in situ hybridization analysis during development of zebrafish and mouse, and in human brain samples (Wienholds et al., 2005Wienholds E.

Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family is required for initiation of apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation or certain stress stimuli. Its proapoptotic activity can be regulated by several transcriptional or posttranslational mechanisms, such as ERK-mediated phosphorylation, promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We found that Bim is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis in a diverse range of cell types both in culture and within the whole animal. ER stress activates Bim through two novel pathways, involving protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and CHOP-C/EBPα-mediated direct transcriptional induction. These results define the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-induced apoptosis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention in ER stress-related diseases.

These results define the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-induced apoptosis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention in ER stress-related diseases. Eukaryotic cells have specific signaling pathways and effecter mechanisms to deal with the temporal and developmental variations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) load (Ron, 2002Ron D. Translational control in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The upstream signal that activates these pathways is referred to as ER stress and is defined as an imbalance between the load of resident and transit proteins in the ER and the organelle's ability to process that load. ER stress can be provoked by a variety of patho-physiological conditions, such as ischemia, viral infection, or mutations that impair resident/secretory protein folding (Ron, 2002Ron D. Translational control in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and has been implicated as an initiator or contributing factor in a range of diseases, including liver cirrhosis or type 2 diabetes (Rutishauser and Spiess, 2002Rutishauser J. Spiess M. Endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases.Swiss Med. Wkly. 2002; 132: 211-222PubMed Google Scholar). The ER stress response can promote cellular repair and sustained survival by reducing the load of unfolded proteins through global attenuation of protein synthesis and/or upregulation of chaperones, enzymes, and structural components of the ER (Kaufman, 2002Kaufman R.J. Orchestrating the unfolded protein response in health and disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). When ER stress is overwhelming, cells undergo apoptosis, and although this was initially reported to be mediated by caspase-12 (Nakagawa et al., 2000Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Caspase-12 mediates endoplasmic-reticulum-specific apoptosis and cytotoxicity by amyloid-β.Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar), this has been challenged (Saleh et al., 2006Saleh M. Mathison J.C. Wolinski M.K. Bensinger S.J. Fitzgerald P. Droin N. Ulevitch R.J. Green D.R. Nicholson D.W. Enhanced bacterial clearance and sepsis resistance in caspase-12-deficient mice.Nature. 2006; 440: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and the mechanism is therefore still unclear. BH3-only proteins constitute a subgroup of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family that are essential for initiation of programmed cell death and stress-induced apoptosis in species as distantly related as C. elegans and mice (Huang and Strasser, 2000Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. BH3-only proteins – essential initiators of apoptotic cell death.Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins share with each other and the Bcl-2 family at large only the short (9-16 aa) BH3 (Bcl-2 Homology) region, which is essential for their ability to kill cells and bind to prosurvival Bcl-2-like proteins (Huang and Strasser, 2000Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. BH3-only proteins – essential initiators of apoptotic cell death.Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by BH3-only proteins requires a second proapoptotic subgroup of the Bcl-2 protein family, the Bax/Bak-like proteins, which in healthy cells are kept in check by the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members (Wei et al., 2001Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins can be regulated by a variety of transcriptional as well as posttranslational control mechanisms (Puthalakath and Strasser, 2002Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Keeping killers on a tight leash: transcriptional and post-translational control of the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins.Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For example, noxa and puma/bbc3 were discovered as p53-inducible genes (Vousden and Lu, 2002Vousden K.H. Lu X. Live or let die: the cell's response to p53.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) and are now known to be essential for DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Jeffers et al., 2003Jeffers J.R. Parganas E. Lee Y. Yang C. Wang J. Brennan J. MacLean K.H. Han J. Chittenden T. Ihle J.N. et al.Puma is an essential mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, Villunger et al., 2003Villunger A.

Strasser A. p53- and drug-induced apoptotic responses mediated by BH3-only proteins Puma and Noxa.Science. 2003; 302: 1036-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Moreover, upon cytokine withdrawal bim is transcriptionally upregulated in hemopoietic cells by FOXO3A, which in healthy cells is kept in check by PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation (Dijkers et al., 2000Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.J. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim is regulated by the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Bim and Bmf can be regulated by their interaction with DLC1 or DLC2 dynein light chains, which causes their sequestration to the microtubular dynein motor complex or the actin-bound myosin V motor complex, respectively (Puthalakath et al., 1999Puthalakath H. Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. The pro-apoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family member Bim is regulated by interaction with the dynein motor complex.Mol.

In addition, in growth factor-stimulated cells, Bim levels are kept low by ERK-mediated phosphorylation, which targets it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Ley et al., 2005Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Cook S.J. Regulatory phosphorylation of Bim: sorting out the ERK from the JNK.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies in mice have shown that Bim is a critical regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis, serves as a barrier against autoimmune disease (Bouillet et al., 1999Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C.S. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W.H. Köntgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 relative Bim required for certain apoptotic responses, leukocyte homeostasis, and to preclude autoimmunity.Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), and is required for deletion of autoreactive T (Bouillet et al., 2002Bouillet P. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Zhang L.-C. Coultas L. Puthalakath H. Pellegrini M. Cory S. Adams J.M. Strasser A. BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bim is required for apoptosis of autoreactive thymocytes.Nature. 2002; 415: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and B cells (Enders et al., 2003Enders A. Bouillet P. Puthalakath H. Xu Y. Tarlinton D.M. Strasser A. Loss of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bim inhibits BCR stimulation-induced apoptosis and deletion of autoreative B cells.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and shutdown of T cell immune responses (Hildeman et al., 2002Hildeman D.A. Zhu Y. Mitchell T.C. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Kappler J. Marrack P. Activated T cell death in vivo mediated by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bim.Immunity. 2002; 16: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Experiments with cultured cells have shown that Bim is essential for apoptosis induced by certain Bcl-2-inhibitable stress stimuli, including cytokine deprivation or treatment with ionomycin or taxol, but not others, such as stimulation with phorbol ester (Bouillet et al., 1999Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C.S. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W.H. Köntgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 relative Bim required for certain apoptotic responses, leukocyte homeostasis, and to preclude autoimmunity.Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Here, we report that ER stress, induced by a broad range of cytotoxic stimuli, requires Bim for initiating apoptosis in diverse cell types, both in vitro and even in a pathological setting within the whole animal. ER stress increases Bim levels through CHOP-C/EBPα-dependent transcriptional activation and posttranslationally by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. This definition of the ER stress-induced apoptosis signaling pathways identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with ER stress. ER stress-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2 or one of its homologs (Hitomi et al., 2004Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. et al.Involvement of caspase-4 in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and Abeta-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), indicating that this process is initiated by proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. We therefore treated MCF-7 breast carcinoma-derived cells with thapsigargin (TG), a selective inhibitor of SERCA (seroplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) (Lewis, 2001Lewis R.S. Calcium signaling mechanisms in T lymphocytes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) or, as a control, with taxol, a microtubule polymerizing agent that induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and analyzed the levels of BH3-only proteins by Western blotting. Interestingly, treatment with thapsigargin but not exposure to taxol caused an increase in Bim protein levels (Figure 1A). Increased levels of bim mRNA were also seen in thapsigargin-treated MCF-7 cells (Figure 1B), but the magnitude of this increase (∼2-fold) was less than the increase seen at the protein level (∼5-fold) (compare Figures 1A and 1B). Thapsigargin-induced upregulation of Bim was also observed in mouse FDC-P1 myeloid cells (Figure 1C), embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Figure 1D) and thymocytes (Figure 1E). Moreover, treatment with other drugs that induce ER stress, such as tunicamycin, DTT or ionomycin, also caused a substantial increase in Bim in MCF-7 cells (Figure 1F). Induction of Bim appeared to be specific, because ER stress caused only a minor or no increase in the expression of the related BH3-only proteins Bid or Puma in FDC-P1 (Figure 1C) or MCF-7 cells (Figure 1G). Viral infection constitutes a patho-physiological stimulus that causes ER stress (Rutishauser and Spiess, 2002Rutishauser J. Spiess M. Endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases.Swiss Med. Wkly. 2002; 132: 211-222PubMed Google Scholar) and, remarkably, Bim levels rose in measles infected Vero monkey kidney epithelial cells (Figure 1H), coinciding with induction of the ER stress-induced transcription factor CHOP (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ER stress induced by diverse cytotoxic drugs or a patho-physiological stimulus causes an increase in bim mRNA and Bim protein levels in diverse cell types. We next used cells from Bim-deficient mice to examine whether this BH3-only protein is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis. Upon treatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, bim−/− thymocytes survived significantly better than their WT counterparts (Figure 2A). Puma has been reported to be critical for ER stress-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells (Reimertz et al., 2003Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. Gene expression during ER stress-induced apoptosis in neurons: induction of the BH3-only protein Bbc3/PUMA and activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We therefore also examined puma−/− thymocytes but found only minor resistance to tunicamycin and normal sensitivity to thapsigargin (Figure 2A) or ionomycin (E.M. and A.S., unpublished data). Because we performed many of our biochemical analyses with MCF-7 cells, we wanted to verify that ER stress-induced apoptosis was also Bim-dependent in these cells. Stable transfection with an RNA interference (RNAi) construct (Bouillet et al., 2005Bouillet P. Robati M. Bath M.L. Strasser A. Polycystic kidney disease prevented by transgenic RNA interference.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 831-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) allowed us to generate MCF-7 cells with reduced Bim expression. These Bim-deficient MCF-7 cells were significantly resistant to thapsigargin-induced killing compared to parental cells or cells expressing a control RNAi construct (Figure 2B). However, after 72 hr, a substantial fraction of the Bim-deficient cells had died, although still significantly fewer compared to control cells (Figure 2B). This is likely a consequence of the fact that although the RNAi technique efficiently reduced bim mRNA and Bim protein levels in untreated MCF-7 cells, thapsigargin treatment was still able to increase Bim levels over time (Figures 2C and 2D). Knockdown of Bim expression using stable expression of an RNAi vector also protected Vero cells from apoptosis caused by measles infection (Figures 2E and 2F). These results demonstrate that diverse cell types require Bim for ER stress-induced apoptosis elicited by a broad range of cytotoxic or patho-physiological stimuli. Because Bim is critical for ER stress-induced apoptosis, we examined the mechanisms that stimulate its proapoptotic activity. First, by using an intracellular calcium antagonist and cell surface calcium release activated channel (CRAC) blockers, we showed that calcium is not required for the ER stress-induced Bim upregulation (Figure S2). Second, in MCF-7 cells, ER stress augmented bim mRNA levels by only ∼2-fold, whereas Bim protein levels increased by ∼5-fold (compare Figures 1A and 1B), indicating that only a component of Bim protein induction is due to increased bim transcription. We therefore investigated whether ER stress can regulate Bim levels through a posttranslational mechanism. In contrast to treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug taxol (Puthalakath et al., 1999Puthalakath H. Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. The pro-apoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family member Bim is regulated by interaction with the dynein motor complex.Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), ER stress did not result in substantial release of Bim from the dynein motor complex (Figure S3). Bim can also be regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation and this has been associated with protection from apoptosis in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoclasts (Ley et al., 2005Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Cook S.J. Regulatory phosphorylation of Bim: sorting out the ERK from the JNK.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In five different cell types (MCF-7, thymocytes, FDC-P1, MEF, and Vero), Bim (particularly the BimEL isoform but also BimL) underwent a mobility shift (faster migration on SDS-PAGE) during ER stress (see Figures 1A, 1C–1F, and 3A), but this change did not occur after exposure to taxol (Figure 1A). This prompted us to examine whether ER stress causes a change in Bim phosphorylation. Treatment of protein extracts from healthy MCF-7 cells with λ phosphatase, a Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatase, but not exposure to the tyrosine phosphatase LAR resulted in mobility shifts of BimEL and BimL that were similar to those observed in Bim from extracts of MCF-7 cells exposed to thapsigargin (Figure 3B). This indicated that ER stress causes a change in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of Bim. This was investigated in detail by separating proteins from extracts of healthy or thapsigargin-treated MCF-7 cells by 2D gel electrophoresis. BimEL and BimL from healthy MCF-7 cells each migrated on 2D gels as at least 5 spots (Figure 3C), indicating the presence of multiple differentially phosphorylated forms of these proteins. Bim immunopurified from MCF-7 cells exposed to thapsigargin or Bim immunopurified from healthy cells and then treated in vitro with λ phosphatase migrated as five spots with different mobility, with the major spot being the least phosphorylated form (migrating toward the cathode; see arrowheads in Figure 3C). Loss of Bim phosphorylation did not appear to be due to a reduction in ERK activity, because Western blot analysis of extracts from MCF-7 cells undergoing ER stress-induced apoptosis found no decrease in ERK phosphorylation (Figure S4). Upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with thapsigargin, Bad, another BH3-only protein that can be regulated by phosphorylation (Puthalakath and Strasser, 2002Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Keeping killers on a tight leash: transcriptional and post-translational control of the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins.Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), did not undergo a noticeable change in phosphorylation or migration on SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A). These results demonstrate that Bim is dephosphorylated specifically in response to ER stress. Having established that Bim undergoes dephosphorylation during ER stress induced apoptosis, we wanted to identify the phosphatase responsible. Thapsigargin is known to activate calcineurin (PP2B), a phosphatase that has been implicated in cell killing and dephosphorylation of Bad during calcium flux-induced apoptosis of rat hippocampal neurons (Wang et al., 1999Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Ca2+-induced apoptosis through calcineurin dephosphorylation of BAD.Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). However, treatment with FK506 (600 nM; sufficient for blocking calcineurin) had no effect on thapsigargin-induced Bim dephosphorylation or apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (Figure S5 and data not shown). In contrast, in extracts from MCF-7 cells treated with thapsigargin plus okadaic acid (OA) or with OA alone, hyperphosphorylated forms of both BimEL and BimL could be seen (indicated by arrowheads in Figure 4A). Although OA can inhibit both protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), it is much less effective against PP1 (Ki of 147 nM versus 0.032 nM, respectively). In MCF-7 cells, specific inhibition of PP2A has previously been achieved with 1 μM OA (Favre et al., 1997Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Differential inhibition and posttranslational modification of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A in MCF7 cells treated with calyculin-A, okadaic acid, and tautomycin.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and we found that as little as 50 nM OA could inhibit thapsigargin-induced Bim dephosphorylation (Figure 4A). PP2A immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells undergoing ER stress, but not PP2A isolated from healthy cells, could dephosphorylate immunopurified Bim in vitro (Figure 4B), demonstrating that PP2A acts directly on Bim. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells treated with OA, we observed not only hyperphosphorylation of Bim but also a dramatic reduction in the levels of BimEL and BimL. This was particularly striking in cells treated with 100 nM OA and appeared to be specific to Bim, because the levels of Bcl-2 and HSP70 did not change (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained with another PP2A inhibitor, calyculin A, even at concentrations as low as 1 nM (Figure S6). As a control, we performed Northern blot analysis to confirm that OA (100 nM) had no effect on thapsigargin-induced upregulation of bim mRNA in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4C). Collectively, these observations indicate that PP2A dephosphorylates Bim during ER stress-induced apoptosis and thereby increases its levels. Since phosphorylation controls ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Bim (Ley et al., 2005Ley R. Ewings K.E. Hadfield K. Cook S.J. Regulatory phosphorylation of Bim: sorting out the ERK from the JNK.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ER stress-induced dephosphorylation affects Bim turnover. Addition of the proteosome inhibitor PS 341 restored Bim protein levels in MCF-7 (Figure 4D) and FDC-P1 cells (data not shown) treated with thapsigargin plus OA. Moreover, protein half-life analysis demonstrated that Bim turnover was more rapid in healthy MCF-7 cells compared to cells undergoing ER stress (Figure 4E). This indicates that dephosphorylation may inhibit ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation thereby causing Bim accumulation during ER stress. Indeed, immunoprecipitation with anti-Bim antibodies followed by Western blotting using antibodies to Bim or ubiquitin demonstrated that a significant fraction of Bim was ubiquitinated in healthy MCF-7 cells but no ubiquitinated Bim was seen in immunoprecipitates from thapsigargin-treated cells (Figure 4F). The relationship between phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Bim was further examined by exposing immunopurified Bim to a reaction system that supports ubiquitination in vitro. In this assay, only phosphorylated Bim immunopurified from healthy MCF-7 cells could be ubiquitinated, whereas no such modification was observed with Bim purified from cells exposed to thapsigargin (which is mostly dephosphorylated; Figure 4G, bottom left panel) or with λ phosphatase-treated Bim immunopurified from healthy MCF-7 cells (Figure 4G, bottom right panel). These results demonstrate that during ER stress, Bim protein levels rise because PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation renders it refractory to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. An ∼2-fold increase in bim transcript levels was observed during ER stress induced apoptosis (see Figures 1B and 4C). This could be attributed to a transcriptional increase rather than a change in mRNA stability, because treatment of MCF-7 cells with actinomycin D blocked thapsigargin-induced accumulation of bim mRNA levels (Figure S7). It has previously been shown that bim is transcriptionally induced by FOXO3A in response to IL-3 withdrawal in a pro-B cell line (Dijkers et al., 2000Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.J. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim is regulated by the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In thapsigargin-treated MCF-7 cells, FOXO3A and FOXO1 did, however, not undergo dephosphorylation prior to the time of Bim induction (in fact, FOXO3A appeared to be degraded; see Figure S8), indicating that these transcription factors are not critical for ER stress-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this notion, FOXO3A-deficient thymocytes were normally sensitive to thapsigargin and tunicamycin (Figure 5A). Involvement of the known ER stress-induced transcription factor ATF6 could also be ruled out because Pefabloc, a serine protease inhibitor, which blocks ATF6 activation (Okada et al., 2003Okada T. Haze K. Nadanaka S. Yoshida H. Seidah N.G. Hirano Y. Sato R. Negishi M. Mori K. A serine protease inhibitor prevents endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cleavage but not transport of the membrane-bound transcription factor ATF6.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31024-31032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), had no effect on thapsigargin-induced transcriptional induction of bim (data not shown). The transcription factor CHOP is activated by ER stress and a range of other cytotoxic stimuli, including amino acid starvation, γ-irradiation or treatment with DNA damaging drugs (Marciniak et al., 2004Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. CHOP induces death by promoting protein synthesis and oxidation in the stressed endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar [and references therein]). Since many of these stimuli also upregulate Bim expression (HP, LO'R, and AS, manuscript in preparation) and since we observed concomitant induction of CHOP (plus its heterodimeric partner C/EBPα) and Bim in several cell types undergoing ER stress (see Figures 5B, S9, and S10), we investigated whether the ER stress-induced increase in Bim is mediated by CHOP. Remarkably, although thapsigargin treatment caused a readily detectable increase in bim mRNA levels in thymocytes from WT mice, this was not observed in chop−/− thymocytes (Figure 5C). We therefore investigated whether CHOP can directly upregulate bim transcription. Sequence analysis failed to detect a CHOP binding site within the conventional bim promoter (Bouillet et al., 2001Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Gene structure alternative splicing, and chromosomal localization of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 relative Bim.Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but a perfect CHOP-C/EBPα heterodimer binding site (TGCAAT) was found within the first intron of the mouse and human bim genes (at 447–452 nt from the translation initiation site within the second exon of mouse bim; Figure 5D). This indicated that there might be an alternate promoter within the first intron of the bim gene. Indeed, database searches revealed that many entries of bim transcripts start within the first intron (see legend to Figure S11). Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Q-PCR analysis using primers specific to noncoding exon 1, the internal transcription initiation site and a common 3′ primer binding to coding exon II revealed that both promoters are active in cells undergoing ER stress (Figure S11). To test whether CHOP-C/EBPα can activate this site within the bim gene, we generated a luciferase reporter construct containing 0.8 kb from the conventional promoter, the first noncoding exon and the first intron. Cotransfection of this reporter in combination with CHOP, C/EBPα, or both demonstrated that CHOP together with C/EBPα could activate transcription from this site (Figure 5D). Mutating this putative binding site abolished the induction by CHOP plus C/EBPα (Figure 5D). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that although CHOP or C/EBPα by themselves failed to interact with a radiolabeled probe containing the putative binding site, together these two proteins produced a marked mobility shift, which could be super-shifted with antibodies specific to CHOP or C/EBPα (Figure 5E). No binding was seen using a probe in which the critical residues had been mutated (Figure 5E) and the mobility shift of the radiolabeled WT probe could be prevented by adding a 5-fold molar excess of the cold WT probe, whereas addition of the mutant cold probe had no effect (Figure S12). These results demonstrate that during ER stress CHOP and C/"

In contrast, we show that lysosomes rapidly fuse with the virulent M. tuberculosis- and M. leprae-containing phagosomes of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. After 2 days, M. tuberculosis progressively translocates from phagolysosomes into the cytosol in nonapoptotic cells. Cytosolic entry is also observed for M. leprae but not for vaccine strains such as M. bovis BCG or in heat-killed mycobacteria and is dependent upon secretion of the mycobacterial gene products CFP-10 and ESAT-6. The cytosolic bacterial localization and replication are pathogenic features of virulent mycobacteria, causing significant cell death within a week. This may also reveal a mechanism for MHC-based antigen presentation that is lacking in current vaccine strains."

Numerous developmental disorders and pathological conditions have been shown to arise from defects in cilia-associated signaling proteins. Despite mounting evidence that cilia are essential sites for coordination of cell signaling, little is known about the cellular mechanisms controlling their formation and disassembly. Here, we show that interactions between the prometastatic scaffolding protein HEF1/Cas-L/NEDD9 and the oncogenic Aurora A (AurA) kinase at the basal body of cilia causes phosphorylation and activation of HDAC6, a tubulin deacetylase, promoting ciliary disassembly. We show that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for ciliary resorption and that it constitutes an unexpected nonmitotic activity of AurA in vertebrates. Moreover, we demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors of AurA and HDAC6 selectively stabilize cilia from regulated resorption cues, suggesting a novel mode of action for these clinical agents."
https://openalex.org/W2145504425,"Many biological functions depend critically upon fine details of tissue molecular architecture that have resisted exploration by existing imaging techniques. This is particularly true for nervous system tissues, where information processing function depends on intricate circuit and synaptic architectures. Here, we describe a new imaging method, called array tomography, which combines and extends superlative features of modern optical fluorescence and electron microscopy methods. Based on methods for constructing and repeatedly staining and imaging ordered arrays of ultrathin (50-200 nm), resin-embedded serial sections on glass microscope slides, array tomography allows for quantitative, high-resolution, large-field volumetric imaging of large numbers of antigens, fluorescent proteins, and ultrastructure in individual tissue specimens. Compared to confocal microscopy, array tomography offers the advantage of better spatial resolution, in particular along the z axis, as well as depth-independent immunofluorescent staining. The application of array tomography can reveal important but previously unseen features of brain molecular architecture."

Although MSCs are already used in regenerative medicine little is known about their in vivo behavior and developmental derivation. Here, we show that the earliest wave of MSC in the embryonic trunk is generated from Sox1+ neuroepithelium but not from mesoderm. Using lineage marking by direct gfp knock-in and Cre-recombinase mediated lineage tracing, we provide evidence that Sox1+ neuroepithelium gives rise to MSCs in part through a neural crest intermediate stage. This pathway can be distinguished from the pathway through which Sox1+ cells give rise to oligodendrocytes by expression of PDGFRβ and A2B5. MSC recruitment from this pathway, however, is transient and is replaced by MSCs from unknown sources.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been defined by two features: the ability to undergo sustained proliferation in vitro and the potential to give rise to multiple mesenchymal cell lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes (Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F.

Marrow stromal cells as stem cells for nonhematopoietic tissues.Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). In recent years, MSCs have attracted attention as a source of cells for use in therapeutic applications for a number of reasons. First, MSC lines have been isolated from human and animal tissues, both adult and embryonic (Deans and Moseley, 2000Deans R.J. Moseley A.B.

Marrow stromal cells as stem cells for nonhematopoietic tissues.Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). Second, the use of MSCs is already a reality in regenerative medicine (Bianco et al., 2001Bianco P. Riminucci M. Gronthos S. Robey P.G. Bone marrow stromal stem cells: nature, biology, and potential applications.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), a striking example of which is the recent success in correcting osteogenesis imperfecta (Horwitz et al., 2002Horwitz E.M. Gordon P.L. Koo W.K. Marx J.C. Neel M.D. McNall R.Y. Muul L. Hofmann T. Isolated allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells engraft and stimulate growth in children with osteogenesis imperfecta: Implications for cell therapy of bone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8932-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Finally, recent reports showing the existence of MSC-like cells (MAPCs) with unexpectedly high potential to give rise to cells of all three germ layers are expected to open new avenues into the understanding of the biology of MSCs (Jiang et al., 2002Jiang Y. Jahagirdar B.N. Reinhardt R.L. Schwartz R.E. Keene C.D. Ortiz-Gonzalez X.R. Reyes M. Lenvik T. Lund T. Blackstad M. et al.Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow.Nature. 2002; 418: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (4990) Google Scholar). Despite these increased expectations, the most significant problem in studying MSCs is the lack of knowledge concerning their in vivo characteristics, such as their development, exact tissue localization, and physiological role. Because of a difficulty in defining MSCs other than by the operational definition of in vitro self-renewal and differentiation potential, our knowledge of MSCs is solely based on the characterization of cultured cells (Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17022) Google Scholar). Development of the CFU-F, a functional assay to measure fresh MSCs in tissue (Bianco et al., 2001Bianco P. Riminucci M. Gronthos S. Robey P.G. Bone marrow stromal stem cells: nature, biology, and potential applications.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, Friedenstein et al., 1970Friedenstein A.J. Chailakhjan R.K. Lalykina K.S. The development of fibroblast colonies in monolayer cultures of guinea-pig bone marrow and spleen cells.Cell Tissue Kinet. 1970; 3: 393-403PubMed Google Scholar) improved the situation by defining markers that is exploited for purifying MSCs prospectively (Gronthos et al., 1994Gronthos S. Graves S.E. Ohta S. Simmons P.J. The STRO-1+ fraction of adult human bone marrow contains the osteogenic precursors.Blood. 1994; 84: 4164-4173PubMed Google Scholar). But yet little is known about the behavior of MSCs in vivo. The aim of this study is to identify MSC progenitors and track them prospectively to define MSC differentiation pathway. For instance, if MSCs are derived from mesoderm as have been widely believed (Dennis and Charbord, 2002Dennis J.E. Charbord P. Origin and differentiation of human and murine stroma.Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), it should be possible to define their development prospectively by investigating whether purified mesoderm cells can give rise to MSCs. Once the earliest progenitor is identified, there are various ways to identify intermediate stages in the MSC differentiation pathway. To this end, we exploited ES cell cultures that support differentiation of various mesenchymal cell lineages (Kawaguchi et al., 2005Kawaguchi J. Mee P.J. Smith A.G. Osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells in response to specific growth factors.Bone. 2005; 36: 758-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Sakurai et al., 2006Sakurai H.

Embryonic Stem Cells, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, New Jersey, USA2002: 127-156Google Scholar), as it is easier to dissect the differentiation process in vitro than in the living embryo. Thus, we began this study by attempting to define MSC progenitors in the in vitro differentiation of ES cells to adipocytes. Here, we present evidence that Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells supply the earliest wave of MSC differentiation, which occurs during embryogenesis but is later replaced by MSCs from other origins in postnatal development. In order to specify the culture condition for ES cell differentiation to MSC, we compared two methods that have been used for inducing mesenchymal cell lineages from ES cells (Figure 1A). The first condition (Condition A) is culture on collagen IV-coated dish under serum-containing medium, which supports generation of mesodermal cells that give rise to osteocytes, chondrocytes and myocytes (Sakurai et al., 2006Sakurai H. Era T. Jakt L.M. Okada M. Nakai S. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. In vitro modeling of paraxial and lateral mesoderm differentiation reveals early reversibility.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The other method involves the treatment of ES cells with pulse exposures to retinoic acid (RA) from day 2 to day 5 of culture (Condition B) followed by incubation under the adipocyte-inducing condition from day 11 (Dani et al., 1997Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolin S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells into adipocytes in vitro.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing PDGFRα that is expressed in mesenchymal cells including adipocytes (Drozdoff and Pledger, 1991Drozdoff V. Pledger W.J. Cellular response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB after down-regulation of PDGF alpha-receptors. Evidence that functional binding does not require alpha-receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17165-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generated under both culture condition, but they reached a peak on day 4 under Condition A and on day 9 under Condition B (Figure 1B). Under both conditions, adipogenic activity was detected only in the PDGFRα+ population (Figure 1C). With respect to the efficiency of adipogenesis as assessed by the TG content of the cultures, Condition B showed 10-fold higher activity than Condition A (Figure 1C). We then assayed the ability of MSCs to undergo sustained proliferation in vitro. Under the culture condition for maintaining MSC lines established from bone marrow and adipose tissue (MSC condition) (Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17022) Google Scholar), the PDGFRα+ population induced under Condition B, but not A, exhibited sustained growth (Figure 1D). Moreover, they underwent clonogenic growth and developed into fibroblast-like cell clones (a in Figure 1F) that expressed molecular markers of mesenchymal cell lineage such as OB-CAD and PDGFRβ ; they did not, however, express markers of mesoderm or neural crest (Figure 1E). Of 10 clonal lines established, three lines gave rise to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes (b-d in Figure 1F). These results suggest that only PDGFRα+ population induced under Condition B contains MSC progenitors. Considering our previous study that Condition A is the optimum for mesoderm differentiation, this result suggests that MSCs generated in the ES cell culture are not derived from mesoderm. Indeed, no paraxial mesoderm markers (Figure 2A, Brachyury, Mesp2, and Mesogenin) were expressed in the PDGFRα+ population induced by Condition B, whereas they were detected in the PDGFRα+ population induced by Condition A. Though clearly distinctive each other, the two populations express common mesenchymal markers such as OB-CAD and PDGFRβ (Figure 2A). Taken together, the two PDGFRα+ populations represent mesenchymal lineage but derived from distinct pathways. To gain an insight into their origins, we assessed the expression of molecular markers for mesoderm, endoderm, and neural lineages of cells cultured under the two conditions. Mesoderm and endoderm markers were expressed under Condition A, but not B (Figure 2B). In contrast, expression of neural markers was detected only under Condition B. Thus, the next issue is whether or not PDGFRα+ MSC induced under Condition B are actually derived from neural lineage. In order to define neural lineage, we used Sox1 as a molecular marker, as it was shown to be the most specific marker for neuroepithelial cells (Aubert et al., 2003Aubert J. Stavridis M.P. Tweedie S. O'Reilly M. Vierlinger K. Li M. Ghazal P. Pratt T. Mason J.O. Roy D. Smith A. Screening for mammalian neural genes via fluorescence-activated cell sorter purification of neural precursors from Sox1-gfp knock-in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A role for SOX1 in neural determination.Development. 1998; 125: 1967-1978PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize the Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells, we used an ES cell line to which the gfp gene has been inserted in the sox1 allele (ES-Sox1gfp/+) (Aubert et al., 2003Aubert J. Stavridis M.P. Tweedie S. O'Reilly M. Vierlinger K. Li M. Ghazal P. Pratt T. Mason J.O. Roy D. Smith A. Screening for mammalian neural genes via fluorescence-activated cell sorter purification of neural precursors from Sox1-gfp knock-in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11836-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As expected, Condition B supports preferential differentiation to Sox1+ cells (Figures 2C and 2D). We then investigate whether or not Sox1+ neuroepithelium can give rise to PDGFRα+ MSC. GFP+ but not GFP− population in day 4 culture of ES-Sox1gfp/+ cells under Condition B could give rise to adipocytes (Figure 1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Neither GFP+ nor GFP− cells expressed PDGFRα at day 4, but on culturing the sorted cells for 6 more days, the PDGFRα+ population reached 30%–40% in the culture of GFP+ cells (n = 3), whereas only a low level of PDGFRα+ was induced from the GFP− cells (Figure 2E). These Sox1+-derived PDGFRα+ cells have already lost neural and neural crest markers such as Sox1, Sox10 and Wnt1 (Figure 2F). Adipocytes were generated only from the PDGFRα+ population in the culture of Sox1+ cells (Figure 2G). Moreover, this PDGFRα+ population had the potential to undergo sustained in vitro growth (data not shown) and to give rise to MSC lines that can give rise to the three lineages of adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes (Figure S1B). Taken together, Sox1+PDGFRα− and subsequent Sox1−PDGFRα+ populations are successive intermediates in a MSC differentiation pathway. We next attempted to confirm this differentiation pathway in the embryo. ES-Sox1gfp/+ were aggregated with tetraploid embyos (Nagy et al., 1993Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Derivation of completely cell culture-derived mice from early-passage embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar), incubated in utero and harvested at E9.5. In this embryo, GFP expression was detected almost exclusively in neuroepithelial cells (Figure 3A), whereas somitic cells are present in PDGFRα+ population (Takakura et al., 1997Takakura N. Yoshida H. Ogura Y. Kataoka H. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. PDGFR alpha expression during mouse embryogenesis: immunolocalization analyzed by whole-mount immunohistostaining using the monoclonal anti-mouse PDGFR alpha antibody APA5.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We removed the cranial and tail regions upon preparing single-cell suspension of embryonic cells, as cranial neuroepithelial cells normally give rise to mesenchymal cell lineages through the neural crest (Le Douarin et al., 2004Le Douarin N.M. Creuzet S. Couly G. Dupin E. Neural crest cell plasticity and its limits.Development. 2004; 131: 4637-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Cells dissociated from the trunks of E9.5 embryos were divided into three populations, Sox1−PDGFRα+, Sox1+PDGFRα−, and Sox1−PDGFRα−; no double-positive cells were detected (right panel in Figure 3A). Expression of molecular markers confirmed that Sox1+PDGFRα− cells from the trunk correspond to neuroepithelium and Sox1-PDGFRα+ cells contain mesodermal but not neural cells (Figure S1C). Consistent with our in vitro experiments, adipocytes differentiated from both Sox1+ and PDGFRα+ populations (Figure 3B), but only Sox1+ cells underwent sustained growth under MSC condition (Figure 3C). In separate experiments, we confirmed that cells expressing endodermal makers were present in the double negative fraction and failed to give rise to MSCs nor adipocytes (Figure S1C). In all attempts (n = 3), multipotent MSC lines could be established directly from Sox1+ cells. Moreover, Sox1−PDGFRα+ cells were generated by incubating Sox1+PDGFRα− cells in culture (Figure 3D). Thus, in complete agreement with our in vitro results, only Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells in the trunk of E9.5 embryo contain MSC progenitors. While it was difficult to establish MSC clones directly from Sox1+ cells in the embryo, a fraction (7/576) of PDGFRα+ cells that were induced by 6-day incubation of FACS-purified Sox1+ cells could undergo sustained clonogenic growth. Among them, three clones maintained the potential to give rise to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes under conditions appropriate to those lineages (Figure 3E). To determine the correlation between Sox1+ MSC progenitors in E9.5 embryos and MSCs in later life, we carried out a persistent labeling experiment of Sox1+ cells (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). For this experiment, we exploited the Cre-recombinase-mediated labeling method by inserting Cre gene in the Sox1 allele (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S2A), and the resulting mice were crossed to the ROSA26R-EYFP strain, whose YFP expression was switched on by Cre-recombinase and constitutively maintained under ROSA promoter (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). Considering the possibility that Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells give rise to MSCs via the neural crest stage, we also used P0-Cre/YFP embryos. As compared with Wnt1 that is also used for neural crest labeling but expressed in the dorsal region of the neural tube (Parr et al., 1993Parr B.A. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Mouse Wnt genes exhibit discrete domains of expression in the early embryonic CNS and limb buds.Development. 1993; 119: 247-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Pietri et al., 2003Pietri T. Eder O.

Biol. 2003; 259: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the P0 promoter expresses genes only after the differentiation of neural crest cells (Yamauchi et al., 1999Yamauchi Y. Abe K. Mantani A. Hitoshi Y. Suzuki M. Osuzu F. Kuratani S. Yamamura K. A novel transgenic technique that allows specific marking of the neural crest cell lineage in mice.Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the Sox1-Cre/YFP embryos, YFP expression was detected in the neural fold of E8.5 embryos and in the neural tube of E9.5 embryos (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D, and 4E). Proportion of YFP+ cells (more than 80%) was mainatained at the same level in the central nervous system up to adult stage (Figure S4E). Sox1 expression was segregated completely from the somites and restricted to the neuroepithelium in the trunk (Figure 4G). While YFP expression in first branchial arch is low (Figure 4E), nearly all neural tubes and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of E11.5 embryos were YFP+ (Figure 4H), suggesting that labeling efficiency per se is high. In contrast, in P0-Cre/YFP embryos, YFP expression was mainly observed in branchial arches and cranial mesenchymal tissues (Figures 4C and 4F) but not in neural tube. At E11.5, YFP expression was not detected in the neural tube, but was in the dorsal root ganglia (Figure 4I). Using the Sox1-Cre/YFP mice, we first explored the presence of PDGFRα+ cells derived from Sox1+ cells in E14.5 embryos. Again, we prepared cell suspensions only from the trunk region. YFP+PDGFRα+ cells were detected in the trunk region of the two mouse strains (Figure 5A). Thus, a PDGFRα+ population derived from Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells as well as from P0+ neural crest cells are present in the trunk of the embryos. PCR analyis showed that YFP+ cells from the trunk of E14.5 embryo no longer express endogenous Sox1 as well as Cre, suggesting that they are the progeny of Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells generated before E14.5 (upper panel in Figure S2B). In contrast, Cre expression is still observed in YFP+ cells from E14.5 P0-Cre/YFP embryos (lower panel in Figure S2B), suggesting sustained expression of P0 in some neural crest lineages. Section analysis showed that almost all YFP expression is detected in neural crest-derived tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (Figure 4I), and YFP+PDGFRα− cells expressed Sox10, a marker of trunk neural crest (lower panel in Figure S2B). Interestingly, the proportion of YFP+PDGFRα+ cells in the cell suspension from the trunk of Sox1-Cre/YFP embryos was 8-fold less than that from P0-Cre/YFP embryos (Figure 5A). This suggests that a considerable proportion of neural crest cells that differentiate to PDGFRα+ cells do not originate from Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells. The same may be also the case for cranial region, as YFP+ cells in the mesenchymal population of the first branchial arch was far lower in Sox1-Cre/YFP embryos than in P0-Cre/YFP embryos (Figures 4E and 4F). Nonetheless, we found PDGFRα+ cells derived both from neuroepithelial cells and from neural crest cells in the trunk of E14.5 embryo. The YFP+PDGFRα+ populations from the Sox1-Cre/YFP and P0-Cre/YFP embryos were sorted and assayed for the potential to give rise to MSCs and CFU-F (Figure 5B). Both populations expressed mesenchymal markers, such as OB-CAD and PDGFRβ (Figure S2B). CFU-F was detected at the same frequency in the YFP−PDGFRα+ and YFP+PDGFRα+ populations in both stains of embryo, but almost no CFU-F was detected in the PDGFRα− populations, irrespective of YFP expression. Moreover, YFP+PDGFRα+ and YFP−PDGFRα+ cells of both mouse strains exhibited sustained growth in vitro (Figure 5C). These results strongly suggest that the MSC progenitors in the trunk of E14.5 embryos are PDGFRα+ but derived not only from neural crest but also from other, as yet unidentified, sources. We also confirmed the multipotentiality of MSC established from YFP+PDGFRα+population of Sox1-Cre/YFP mice (Figure 5D). YFP+PDGFRα+ cells in the trunk of E14.5 Sox1-Cre/YFP embryos are likely to contain oligodendrocyte (OG) precursors (OGPs) generated in the neural tube (Stolt et al., 2006Stolt C.C. Schlierf A.

We thus investigated whether or not MSCs in the PDGFRα+ population derived from Sox1+ cells in E14.5 embryos are different from OGPs that express A2B5 (Kondo and Raff, 2000Kondo T. Raff M. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells reprogrammed to become multipotential CNS stem cells.Science. 2000; 289: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). YFP+ PDGFRα+ cells in E14.5 Sox1-Cre/YFP mice contain both A2B5+ and PDGFRβ+ populations. Interestingly, the two populations are segregated almost completely (Figure 6A). By RT-PCR analysis, markers for OGs are detected only in A2B5+ population (Figure 6B). Sorted A2B5+ population could form neurosphere upon culturing under the condition described in previous reports (Morrison et al., 1999Morrison S.J. White P.M. Zock C. Anderson D.J. Prospective identification, isolation by flow cytometry, and in vivo self-renewal of multipotent mammalian neural crest stem cells.Cell. 1999; 96: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A), whereas could not undergo sustained growth under MSC condition nor give rise to adipocytes (data not shown). As those neurosphere could give rise to OG, A2B5+ cells derived from Sox1+ neuroepithelium are OGP with self-renewing capacity (Figure S3B). The PDGFRβ+ population expresses none of OG markers used in this study and failed to form the neurospheres (Figures 6B and S3A). CFU-Fs are enriched in the PDGFRβ+ population (Figure 6C). In addition, this population undergoes sustained growth and gives rise to adipocytes (Figures 6D and 6E). Cells isolated from individual CFU-Fs gave rise to adipocytes but not OG (data not shown). The frequency of CFU-F in YFP+PDGFRα+PDGFRβ+ population was 2%, and 50% of the colonies could develop to adipogenic cell lines. Thus, OGPs and MSCs, which are derived from neuroepithelium and express PDGFRα are fully segregated, respectively, to A2B5+ and PDGFRβ+ fractions at E14.5. As bone and bone marrow has been the major sources of MSC (Deans and Moseley, 2000Deans R.J. Moseley A.B. Mesenchymal stem cells: Biology and potential clinical uses.Exp. Hematol. 2000; 2: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, Javazon et al., 2004Javazon E.H. Beggs K.J. Flake A.W. Mesenchymal stem cells: Paradoxes of passaging.Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 414-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), we focused the analysis of postnatal mice on cells dissociated from femoral and tibial bones by treatment with collagenase and dispase. YFP+PDGFRα+ cells were detected in the bone cell preparation of neonates, 4-week and 12-week old mice of Sox1-Cre/YFP and P0-Cre/YFP (Figures 7A, 7B, and S4A). However, the proportion of YFP+PDGFRα+ cells in the bone cell preparation of neonates was far lower than in the whole embryonic trunk, and the population significantly decreased with age in both Sox1-Cre/YFP and P0-Cre/YFP mice (Figure 7C). This is consistent with the result showing low expression of Ki67, suggesting MSCs derived from Sox1+ neuroepithelium do not proliferate after birth (Figures S4B and S4C). Similarly, YFP−PDGFRα+ in the bone cell preparation of both mice decreased along with neonatal development (Figures 7A, 7B, and S4A). Notably, CFU-F activity was found at the same level both in YFP+PDGFRα+ and YFP−PDGFRα+ populations representing, respectively, neural crest and nonneural crest pathways (Figure 7D). The ability of YFP+PDGFRα+ cells to give rise to the multipotent MSC was also confirmed, as before (Figure 7E). Thus, PDGFRα+ population in the bone preparation of postnatal mouse contains MSCs derived from neuroepithelium and neural crest, but their contribution is not high. Moreover, they rapidly decrease during neonatal development (Figures 7A–7C and S4A). As the YFP expression in central nervous system is maintained at the same level during postnatal development and YFP expression of MSC does not fade during culture, it is unlikely that decrease of YFP+ population during postnatal development is due to silencing of the YFP gene (Figures S4D and S4E). Taken together, these results suggest that MSCs are differentiated through multiple routes with distinct cellular origins, among which the wave originating from neuroepithelium including the neural crest, although it is transient, is the earliest. The aim of this study was to define the developmental pathway of MSCs, which is largely unstudied in vivo. While we demonstrated two pathways for adipocyte differentiation, one from Sox1−PDGFRα+ paraxial mesoderm and the other from Sox1+ neuroepithelium; only the latter could give rise to MSCs. This observation in ES cell culture was confirmed in E9.5 embryos. In the embryo, it is well established that cranial neural crest cells give rise to mesenchymal cells (LaBonne and Bronner-Fraser, 1999LaBonne C. Bronner-Fraser M.

To avoid unnecessary confusion, this study focused only on the trunk region. We obtained PDGFRα+ somitic cells and Sox1+ neuroepithelium from the trunk, which are segregated each other in FACS analysis (Figure 3A). Consistent with the in vitro result, Sox1+ neuroepithelium in the trunk did give rise to MSCs. While somitic cells have been believed as progenitors of MSCs, none of the PDGFRα+ cells in the E9.5 embryos could differentiate to MSCs, although they could give rise to adipocytes. Thus, the first MSC progenitors in the embryo, which are identifiable by the method herein, are derived from neuroepithelial cells. This observation, however, does not rule out a possibility that paraxial mesoderm has potential t"

The COPII coat consists of the Sec23/24-Sar1 complex that selects cargo and the Sec13/31 assembly unit that can polymerize into an octahedral cage and deform the membrane into a bud. Crystallographic analysis of the assembly unit reveals a 28 nm long rod comprising a central α-solenoid dimer capped by two β-propeller domains at each end. We construct a molecular model of the COPII cage by fitting Sec13/31 crystal structures into a recently determined electron microscopy density map. The vertex geometry involves four copies of the Sec31 β-propeller that converge through their axial ends; there is no interdigitation of assembly units of the kind seen in clathrin cages.

Vesicle transport pathways are responsible for the propagation and maintenance of organelles, and the underlying mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion are conserved among eukaryotes (Bock et al., 2001Bock J.B.

Budding occurs when cytoplasmic coat proteins assemble on a membrane surface, capture cargo molecules, and polymerize into spherical cages to bud off cargo-laden vesicles (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S.

Cells contain a variety of coats—including COPI, COPII, and numerous clathrin/adaptor complexes—with each coat budding vesicles from a discrete subcellular location. COPII-coated vesicles form on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to transport newly synthesized cargo to the Golgi complex. Three proteins—Sec23/24, Sec13/31, and the ARF-family GTPase Sar1—are sufficient to bud ∼60-nm COPII vesicles from native ER membranes and from synthetic liposomes (Barlowe et al., 1994Barlowe C.

COPII budding is initiated by the activation of Sar1 to its GTP-bound form, causing it to translocate to the membrane and embed an N-terminal α helix in the bilayer (Antonny et al., 1997Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M.

Sar1-GTP recruits Sec23/24 to form a Sec23/24-Sar1 “prebudding complex” that binds directly to cargo molecules (Miller et al., 2003Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L.

Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. SNARE selectivity of the COPII coat.Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The prebudding complex has a concave surface that conforms to the shape of the underlying membrane vesicle in order to maximize the opportunities for interactions with the membrane and with membrane-proximal elements of cargo proteins (Bi et al., 2002Bi X.

Finally, the Sec13/31 complex is recruited through an interaction with Sec23/24, and it self-assembles into a polyhedron, leading to membrane deformation (Barlowe et al., 1994Barlowe C. Orci L.

Electron microscopy (EM) studies of the isolated Sec13/31 assembly unit reveal a 28–30 nm rod, consistent in size with a heterotetramer composed of two Sec13 and two Sec31 polypeptides (Lederkremer et al., 2001Lederkremer G.Z.

Recently, the self-assembly reaction has been reconstituted using purified Sec13/31 protein, and the resultant cages have been analyzed by cryo-EM at 30 Å resolution (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gürkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This reveals a striking cuboctahedral architecture for the COPII lattice, built from 24 copies of the Sec13/31 assembly unit. The assembly unit constitutes the edge of the cuboctahedron, and four assembly units converge to form each of 12 vertices (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gürkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The organization of the COPII cuboctahedron contrasts with that of clathrin cages, which remain the best-characterized vesicular carriers (Kirchhausen, 2000Kirchhausen T. Three ways to make a vesicle.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, Pearse et al., 2000Pearse B.M. Smith C.J. Owen D.J. Clathrin coat construction in endocytosis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The clathrin lattice is built from triskelion assembly units—trimers of clathrin heavy chain—that are centered on the vertices of the cage, and the 47 nm long “legs” of the clathrin heavy chain interdigitate extensively with neighboring legs as they extend toward the adjacent vertices (Fotin et al., 2004bFotin A. Cheng Y. Sliz P. Grigorieff N. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Walz T. Molecular model for a complete clathrin lattice from electron cryomicroscopy.Nature. 2004; 432: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, both the symmetry and the nature of the vertex contacts seem to be completely distinct in clathrin and COPII lattices, but the relationship between these vesicular cages remains unknown in the absence of a molecular model of the COPII cuboctahedron. In this paper, we describe the atomic structure of the Sec13/31 assembly unit, and we present a molecular model of the COPII cage built by fitting the Sec13/31 crystal structures into the cryo-EM density map. We define the geometry of the multivalent contacts between assembly units at the cage vertices, the organizing principle for propagating the COPII cuboctahedron, and we compare the fundamentally different architectures of COPII and clathrin lattices. We prepared the yeast Sec13/31 complex by coexpression in baculovirus-infected insect cells and subjected the purified protein to limit proteolysis (Figure 1A; see also Dokudovskaya et al., 2006Dokudovskaya S. Williams R. Devos D. Sali A. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. Protease accessibility laddering: A proteomic tool for probing protein structure.Structure. 2006; 14: 653-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three protease-resistant products were obtained: the N-terminal β-propeller domain of Sec31 formed from seven WD40 sequence repeats or blades; the short C-terminal α-solenoid region of Sec31; and a complex comprising the central α-solenoid region of Sec31 (residues 370–763) and full-length Sec13, a β-propeller protein containing six WD40 repeats. Absent from the proteolysis products was a stable portion of the proline-rich region, the domain of Sec31 that interacts with Sec23/24 (Shaywitz et al., 1997Shaywitz D.A. Espenshade P.J. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. COPII subunit interactions in the assembly of the vesicle coat.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25413-25416Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Shugrue et al., 1999Shugrue C.A. Kolen E.R. Peters H. Czernik A. Kaiser C. Matovcik L. Gorelick F. Identification of the putative mammalian orthologue of Sec31P, a component of the COPII coat.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4546-4556Google Scholar). Although transiently stable fragments were observed in some proteolysis reactions, we could not identify a robustly stable core, and we tentatively conclude that the proline-rich region is unstructured within the assembly unit (Figure 1A; 20% of residues 770–1110 are proline). Since this implies that the C-terminal α-solenoid domain of Sec31 may be flexibly linked to the remainder of the Sec13/31 complex, we tested whether this domain might fold back to interact with the N-terminal regions, using a protein pull-down assay. We detected no interactions between the C-terminal α-solenoid domain and the β-propeller or central α-solenoid domains of Sec31 or with Sec13; nor did we detect evidence for self-association or interaction with the Sec23/24-Sar1 complex (data not shown). This preliminary analysis suggested that the C-terminal portion of Sec31, encompassing the proline-rich region and terminal α-solenoid domain (residues 764–1273), might lie outside the “architectural core” of the assembly unit. Indeed, the crystallographic analysis described below confirms that the 28 nm long core particle is a Sec13/31-Sec31/Sec13 heterotetramer constructed from Sec13 plus the N-terminal region of Sec31 (the β-propeller and central α-solenoid domains). The atomic model of the assembly unit was built from two crystal structures of yeast Sec13/31 subcomplexes that we refer to as the edge and vertex elements (Table 1). Crystals of the edge element, comprising full-length Sec13 β-propeller and residues 370–763 (central α-solenoid) of Sec31, grew in space group P21 and contain a Sec13/31–Sec31/Sec13 heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1C). The initial electron density map was calculated to 2.9 Å resolution using combined phases from multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) experiments with selenium as the anomalous scatterer (Figure 1D shows the density-modified map). The structure of the edge element was refined to 2.35 Å resolution (Table 1). In order to facilitate this structure determination we mutated multiple conserved leucine residues to methionine (see Experimental Procedures). For completeness, we crystallized and refined a structure of the native protein to 2.45 Å resolution (Table 1). There are no significant conformational differences between selenomethionine mutant and native structures.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsSec13/31 ComplexEdgeEdgeEdgeVertex elementData SetMADSADNativeNativePDB Accession #2PM72PM62PM9Space Group:P21P21P21P43Cell Parameters a, b, c (Å) β (°)128.1, 53.2, 133.1 108.4128.2, 52.5, 133.1 108.3128.4, 52.3, 133.1 108.6155.2, 155.2, 59.9Data ProcessingPeakInflectionRemotePeakWavelength (Å)0.97950.97980.96430.97951.540.9792Resolution (Å)50–2.850–2.850–2.840–2.3530–2.4540–3.3Rmerge (%)aRmerge = 100 × ∑h∑i | Ii(h) − <I(h)> | / ∑h<I(h)>, where Ii(h) is the ith measurement and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurement of I(h) for Miller indices h.6.2 (29.0)eHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.5.7 (31.8)6.3 (40.2)4.7 (24.7)4.1 (36.8)9.2 (41.8)I/σ25.8 (5.1)25.3 (4.4)23.0 (3.4)26.7 (4.6)20.0 (2.4)14.8 (2.1)Completeness (%)99.6 (99.9)99.7 (99.6)99.8 (99.4)97.1 (91.1)94.7 (93.2)92.6 (76.3)Redundancy3.6 (3.7)3.7 (3.6)3.7 (3.6)3.4 (3.2)2.3 (2.2)2.7 (2.2)Refinement StatisticsData Range (Å)30–2.3530–2.540–3.3Reflections685415498618996Nonhydrogen Atoms993899385170Water Molecules26126128R.m.s.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the vertex element, comprising full-length Sec13 β-propeller and residues 1–411 (the β-propeller) of Sec31, was determined by the molecular replacement method using Sec13 as the search model and refined with data to 3.3 Å resolution (Figure 1B). The polypeptide tracing was assisted by the regular arrangement of bulky tryptophan (or phenylalanine) residues of the WD signature on the A- and C-strands of the Sec31 β-propeller domain (Figure S1). The crystal structures share a full-length Sec13 β-propeller, and, since this domain shows negligible conformational differences in the two crystal forms, it was possible to combine the structures straightforwardly to construct a composite model for the assembly unit, the 28 nm long Sec13/31-Sec31/Sec13 heterotetramer (Figures 2A and 2B). The structure of the COPII assembly unit comprises a central α-solenoid dimer capped by two β-propeller domains at each end (Figures 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B). The α-solenoid regions of the two Sec31 molecules interact about a 2-fold symmetry axis to form a 14 nm long central rod (Figure 1C). The rod is relatively straight and is uniformly ∼30 Å in diameter since it is formed from two α-solenoids along its length. However, the two Sec31 molecules are not arranged as an extended antiparallel dimer; instead each Sec31 polypeptide folds back on itself, creating an interlocked dimer. Helices α1–α4 fold back to form intermolecular interactions with helices α11–α18, and helices α5–α10 form isologous interactions with the opposite Sec31 molecule (Figure 1C). The 28 nm long assembly unit is not uniformly straight along its length because the Sec31 and Sec13 β-propellers are displaced from the axis of the α-solenoid rod (Figures 2A and 2B). Specifically, the Sec13 (inner) β-propellers are displaced ∼15 Å from the α-solenoid axis, as can be seen most clearly in Figure 2A. Likewise, the Sec31 (outer) β-propellers are displaced 15–20 Å in a direction roughly parallel with the 2-fold axis of the assembly unit (Figure 2B). The off-axis arrangement of the Sec13 and Sec31 β-propeller domains gives the assembly unit its characteristic shape that can be recognized in the cryo-EM density map (Figure 2, Figure 3). As the crystallographic results indicate, the Sec31 β-propeller domain is positioned at the ends of the assembly unit to mediate the vertex contacts that propagate the COPII cage (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). This is surprising from a structural perspective, as it means that the Sec13 molecule separates the β-propeller and α-solenoid domains of Sec31. Figures 4B and 4C show how the Sec31 polypeptide passes directly through Sec13 and contributes a seventh blade (Sec31 residues 380–406) to the six blades of the Sec13 β-propeller. This intimate interaction between the polypeptide chains is reinforced by extensive interfaces involving both axial ends of the Sec13 β-propeller: one end of Sec13 interacts with the Sec31 β-propeller (Figure S2); the other end interacts with the Sec31 α-solenoid domain (via the α14–α15 and α16–α17 loops plus helix α18 of Sec31; see Figure 1C). As a result, the β-propellers probably maintain a fixed orientation relative to the α-solenoid rod. This is important because it determines the geometry and hence the contact interfaces through which the Sec31 β-propellers converge at the vertex. The dimensions of the composite model of the Sec13/31 heterotetramer (Figures 2A and 2B) are consistent with images of the isolated assembly unit obtained in two EM studies, one of which employed negative staining and the other rotary shadowing to visualize COPII proteins (Lederkremer et al., 2001Lederkremer G.Z.

However, both studies revealed a range of conformations for the assembly unit in EM images that involved variation in the angle between the terminal domains and the center of the rod. In both studies it was inferred that the 28 nm long rod may be flexible about a central “protein hinge” (Lederkremer et al., 2001Lederkremer G.Z. Cheng Y. Petre B.M. Vogan E. Springer S. Schekman R.

When viewed along the 2-fold axis, the overall shape of the molecular model corresponds closely to the asymmetric unit of the cuboctahedron (Figure 2A). However, the orthogonal view (Figure 2B) reveals a major difference between the two structures: in the cryo-EM map, the two halves (two Sec31 molecules) of the α-solenoid rod are bent 45° from parallel about the center of the rod, whereas in the crystal structure the angle is just 15°. This evidence for a hinge, together with the earlier EM analyses, suggests a mechanism by which the Sec13/31 assembly unit could adapt to lattices of variable curvature, as discussed in more detail below. (Hinge is not meant to imply that the α-solenoid interface is disordered in the crystal structure of the edge element; this region is in fact well ordered with lower crystallographic B-factors than the average for the molecule; Figure S3). For fitting into the cryo-EM map, we separated the molecular model of the assembly unit into two halves (at the α-solenoid interface) and fitted these independently as rigid bodies into the 30 Å map (Figures 2C and 2D). Initial fitting was done manually and then improved via real- and reciprocal-space approaches, which gave essentially the same result from a range of refinement starting points (see Experimental Procedures). The complete molecular model of the COPII cage, comprising 24 copies of the assembly unit with octahedral symmetry, is illustrated in Figure 2D. The quality of the fit is indicated in Figure 3, which shows the correspondence of the Sec13 and Sec31 β-propellers to features in the cryo-EM map (the map correlation coefficient for the fit shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 is 0.85). We did not attempt to model in detail the hinge region at the interlocked Sec31-Sec31 center owing to the low resolution of the cryo-EM data. The Sec13/31-Sec31/Sec13 assembly unit constitutes the asymmetric unit of the COPII cuboctahedron (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gürkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This means that although the assembly unit is a symmetric dimer, it is utilized as an asymmetric rod to construct the cage (in other words, the 2-fold symmetry operator of the assembly unit does not belong to the 432 point group of the cage). Importantly, this also means that the two ends of the assembly unit are in different environments at the cage vertices. At one end, a Sec31 β-propeller converges at the vertex dyad axis and interacts with its β-propeller symmetry partner—we refer to this as the proximal Sec31 β-propeller (Figures 2C, 3, and 4A). At the other end of the assembly unit, the distal β-propeller resides ∼20 Å from the vertex dyad axis and does not interact with its symmetry partner. As this description implies, the vertex is constructed from four Sec31 β-propellers: a proximal pair and a distal pair. Figure 3 illustrates the excellent fit of the proximal and distal β-propellers to the cryo-EM density. Since both ends of the assembly unit were fitted into the map as rigid bodies, this suggests that the disposition of the α-solenoid and β-propeller domains is essentially the same at the proximal and distal ends. We surmise that flexibility is limited to the interlocked α-solenoid center of the rod and that plasticity at the β-propeller interdomain contacts is not required for the optimal positioning of the proximal and distal ends in their distinct environments at the vertex. This proposal is substantiated by the aforementioned extensive interfaces between the β-propeller and α-solenoid domains. When viewed along its 2-fold axis, as in Figure 2C, the vertex can be described as a distorted 4-fold center such that the proximal and distal β-propellers converge on the vertex in a similar orientation. As a consequence, all four Sec31 β-propellers are positioned with their flat axial ends mediating the major contact interfaces (Figure 4A). This geometry is imposed by the relative juxtaposition of the β-propeller and α-solenoid domains along the rod. Specifically, the axis of the Sec13 β-propeller is parallel with, and displaced ∼15 Å from, the α-solenoid axis; the Sec31 β-propeller axis in turn is inclined at a 50° angle to the Sec13 β-propeller axis (Figure 4). Figure 4A illustrates the relationship between the pairs of proximal and distal Sec31 β-propellers. The assembly unit is pentavalent, forming three contact interfaces via its proximal end (labeled cI, cII, and cIII in Figure 4A) and two at the distal end (cII and cIII). Thus the molecular model of the cage comprises 24 pentavalent assembly units that form 12 vertices. The multivalent nature of the vertex interactions is the principle for organizing a tetramer at the vertex, and the individual pairwise contacts (cI, cII, and cIII) and the assembly-unit dimers that correspond to them are likely to be exceedingly weak. The cI proximal-proximal contact appears not to involve the entire surface of the axial end of the Sec31 β-propeller because the β-propeller is tilted ∼13° from the vertex 2-fold axis. This slight cant of the proximal β-propellers is suggested by a depression in the cryo-EM map at the vertex center (Figure 3B). We have not explored other features of the vertex contacts in atomic detail at this stage because the current cryo-EM data provide for a relatively low-resolution model of the cage. For descriptive purposes we referred to the vertex as a distorted 4-fold center. In reality the distal β-propellers are translated ∼15 Å in toward the center of the cage relative to the proximal β-propellers (Figure 3C). Thus, the cIII proximal-distal interface joins two Sec31 β-propellers that are related by an ∼90° rotation and an ∼15 Å translation (Figure 4A). A similar interaction to cIII is observed as a crystal contact in the crystals of the vertex element, where it propagates the 43 crystallographic screw axis (c = 59.9 Å). Our model predicts that the vertex element illustrated in Figure 1B should form a tetramer in solution at sufficiently high concentrations. However, we detected only monomeric Sec13/31(1–411) in gel filtration experiments using protein concentrations up to 30 mg/ml (data not shown). We propose that in the COPII polyhedron, as in viral capsids, the ligation of multiple very weak vertex contacts yields a globally stable cage. Weak vertex interactions are presumably important in the self-assembly reaction to prevent the accumulation of too many nuclei—we assume that Sec13/31 nucleation involves the low-probability association of four assembly units to form a vertex. The other general possibility in this context is that assembly is assisted by a template protein—an assembly chaperone—though there is no evidence for such a factor in COPII coat formation. In summary, the positions of the β-propeller and α-solenoid domains in the COPII cage have been assigned unambiguously to structural features of the 30 Å cryo-EM map. Although the details of the vertex contacts in our model of the cage cannot be assessed at this resolution, it is nevertheless clear that the pairwise contacts of the Sec31 β-propellers look much like conventional protein-protein interactions and that the vertex is not constructed through the interdigitation of assembly units. Thus, both the symmetry and nature of the vertex contacts are completely distinct in COPII and clathrin cages. Finally, Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gürkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P. Foss T.R. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Balch W.E. Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage.Nature. 2006; 439: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar observed that the 2-fold symmetry axis of the assembly unit is not located centrally along the edge of the cuboctahedron. Consistent with this, we find that the 30 Å diameter central α-solenoid dimer fits well into the cryo-EM map and the interlocked Sec31-Sec31 center coincides with the 2-fold symmetry center of the assembly unit in the map (Figure 2, Figure 3). Although the symmetry of the assembly unit is not connected to the symmetry of the cage, the assembly unit is oriented such that its 2-fold axis passes close to the center of the cuboctahedron (Figure 3C). COPII and clathrin cages are both constructed from α-solenoid and β-propeller building blocks (Fotin et al., 2004bFotin A. Cheng Y. Sliz P. Grigorieff N. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Walz T.

We observe a close correspondence of the COPII and clathrin α-solenoid folds despite some divergence at the point where the two Sec31 chains interlock (in the vicinity of helix α9; see Figure S4).

https://openalex.org/W1976530870,"The cardiac conduction system is an anatomically discrete segment of specialized myocardium that initiates and propagates electrical impulses to coordinate myocardial contraction. To define the molecular composition of the mouse ventricular conduction system we used microdissection and transcriptional profiling by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Conduction-system-specific expression for Id2, a member of the Id gene family of transcriptional repressors, was identified. Analyses of Id2-deficient mice demonstrated structural and functional conduction system abnormalities, including left bundle branch block. A 1.2 kb fragment of the Id2 promoter proved sufficient for cooperative regulation by Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 in vitro and for conduction-system-specific gene expression in vivo. Furthermore, compound haploinsufficiency of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 or Tbx5 and Id2 prevented embryonic specification of the ventricular conduction system. We conclude that a molecular pathway including Tbx5, Nkx2-5, and Id2 coordinates specification of ventricular myocytes into the ventricular conduction system lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1986663423,"Helicases are molecular motors that separate DNA strands for efficient replication of genomes. We probed the kinetics of individual ring-shaped T7 helicase molecules as they unwound double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or translocated on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A distinctive DNA sequence dependence was observed in the unwinding rate that correlated with the local DNA unzipping energy landscape. The unwinding rate increased approximately 10-fold (approaching the ssDNA translocation rate) when a destabilizing force on the DNA fork junction was increased from 5 to 11 pN. These observations reveal a fundamental difference between the mechanisms of ring-shaped and nonring-shaped helicases. The observed force-velocity and sequence dependence are not consistent with a simple passive unwinding model. However, an active unwinding model fully supports the data even though the helicase on its own does not unwind at its optimal rate. This work offers insights into possible ways helicase activity is enhanced by associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2142219733,"We reported previously that calpain-mediated Cdk5 activation is critical for mitochondrial toxin-induced dopaminergic death. Here, we report a target that mediates this loss. Prx2, an antioxidant enzyme, binds Cdk5/p35. Prx2 is phosphorylated at T89 in neurons treated with MPP+ and/or MPTP in animals in a calpain/Cdk5/p35-dependent manner. This phosphorylation reduces Prx2 peroxidase activity. Consistent with this, p35−/− neurons show reduced oxidative stress upon MPP+ treatment. Expression of Prx2 and Prx2T89A, but not the phosphorylation mimic Prx2T89E, protects cultured and adult neurons following mitochondrial insult. Finally, downregulation of Prx2 increases oxidative stress and sensitivity to MPP+. We propose a mechanistic model by which mitochondrial toxin leads to calpain-mediated Cdk5 activation, reduced Prx2 activity, and decreased capacity to eliminate ROS. Importantly, increased Prx2 phosphorylation also occurs in nigral neurons from postmortem tissue from Parkinson's disease patients when compared to control, suggesting the relevance of this pathway in the human condition."

To determine whether the increased apoptosis in embryonic brain and affected brain development are due to anemia in utero and lack of oxygen delivery or due to endogenous Epo signaling in brain or neural cells, we developed mice that expressed EpoR driven by the endogenous EpoR promoter in hematopoietic tissue but not in the central nervous system. Homozygous mice can survive to adulthood, have normal hematocrit, and exhibit no gross morphologic defects. Mice with selective rescue of EpoR showed undetectable EpoR expression in brain. We present evidence for novel functions of endogenous Epo on NPCs and neural cell survival. In culture, EpoR from wild type (WT) mice is expressed at higher levels on NPCs than mature neurons in culture, and NPC proliferation is elevated in the presence of Epo. Examination of brain during development of the mice with selective EpoR expression revealed increased apoptosis during embryogenesis, reduced proliferation in the hippocampus, and increased sensitivity of neurons to hypoxia and glutamate toxicity. In addition, injection of glutamate showed increased toxicity in these mice. These observations exemplify the neural protective activity of endogenous Epo and indicate that Epo directly stimulates proliferation in the hippocampus and subventricular zone, regions associated with adult neurogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Hippocampal Cell/Neurosphere Culture and Immunocytochemical Staining—The hippocampus from embryonic day 16 (E16) mouse embryos were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and mechanically dissociated. For primary hippocampal cell cultures, dissociated cells (105/well) were plated in 6-well dishes pre-coated with poly-d-lysine and cultured in serum-free medium containing 0.6% d-glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 6 μm putrescine, 30 nm selenium, 0.5 units/ml Pen-Strep, 1 mm l-glutamine, 50% minimum Eagle's medium, and 50% F-12. Without additional trophic factors, these cultures are predominantly mature neurons (MAP-2 immunopositive cells) with only small proportions of NPCs (nestin immunopositive cells) and glia.For neurosphere cultures, dissociated cells were plated in uncoated T25 flask with supplemental basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) until NPCs aggregated and proliferated to form neurospheres (2-3 days) (18Ray J. Peterson D.A. Schinstine M. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To test the mitogenic effect of Epo on NPCs, Epo was used in place of bFGF. The neurospheres were then collected for Western blotting. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) at 25 μm was added to the medium for proliferation assay. The cultures were maintained for 24-48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, then immunocytochemically stained with rabbit anti-mouse EpoR (M-20) (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-nestin antibodies (1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) using fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200; Chemicon). The stained neurons were examined under a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-U fluorescent microscope, and the images were captured using PerkinElmer confocal image system. Fluorescence density was analyzed by Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD).Western Blotting—Tissues or cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100) and protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The protein sample was run on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 200 V. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose by standard methods. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tween 20 Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h, probed with primary antibodies for EpoR, nestin, and β-actin (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight, washed in Tris-buffered saline, probed with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline for chemiluminescent detection.Development of Conditional Rescue Mice—The mouse EpoR gene was replaced by the human EpoR gene by substituting the genomic region between exon 1 to exon 8 of the endogenous mouse EpoR gene with exon 1 to exon 8 of the human EpoR gene. The human EpoR gene was inactivated using a neo cassette flanked by LoxP sites inserted into intron 7 (19Divoky V. Liu Z. Ryan T.M. Prchal J.F. Townes T.M. Prchal J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Joshi S.K. Temann U.A. Olson D. Burkly L. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Expression of Cre in cells that normally express Tie2, such as embryonic endothelium, which give rise to hematopoietic stem cells, results in recombination of the two LoxP sites and excision of the neo cassette that restores appropriately regulated expression of the EpoR gene in Cre-expressing cells and subsequent generations of cells derived from these cells. Mice from resultant litters were screened and crossed to obtain mice homozygous for the disrupted EpoR gene that carry the Tie2-Cre transgene (designated ΔEpoR). All animal protocols were approved and carried out according to the guidelines of the NIDDK Animal Care and Use Committee.Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Adult brains were harvested and put in Qiagen RNAlater™ RNA stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)16 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The EpoR transcripts in the brain were determined with RT-PCR using primers m-hEpoR-F2, 5′-GCAGTGAGCATGCCCAGGA-3′ and m-hEpoR-R2, 5′-GCTTCACCAATCCCGTTCAAG-3′. The primers are specific for both mouse and human EpoR. Reaction conditions were optimized to give amplification of PCR product for even low levels of expression. PCR reaction was performed for 40 cycles of 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 58 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C.Blood Analysis—For analysis of red cell indices, blood was drawn into a K2EDTA coated micro-hematocrit tube from the orbital sinus of anesthetized adult mice. The red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were determined for each sample.Physical Characteristics and Gross Morphology—Adult wild type and ΔEpoR (six-month-old) male mice (n = 5 each) were weighed, deeply anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were dissected, weighed, length and width measured, and frozen sections prepared.TUNEL Analysis of Conditional Rescue Embryonic Brains—Wild type and ΔEpoR E16 embryonic brains were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, prepared for frozen section, sliced, and then analyzed with TUNEL labeling reagent (Roche Diagnostics) followed by DAPI counter staining of nuclei. Serial sections were examined under a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-U fluorescent microscope, and the images were captured using PerkinElmer confocal Image system.BrdUrd Immunohistochemistry and Quantification—Three-month-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (100 mg/kg body weight). After 2 weeks of injection, mice were perfused, and the brains were dissected. Coronal sections (12 μm in 2:20 series) were cut with a cryostat and mounted on Superfrost®/Plus slides. Sections containing the hippocampal and subventricular zone (SVZ) regions were selected and treated sequentially with trypsin (0.1%) and HCl (2 m) followed by overnight incubation with sheep anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences) at 4 °C. After exposure to fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences), the sections were mounted with vector DAPI mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Serial sections were then examined with a fluorescent microscope, and the images were captured. All BrdUrd-positive cells in the hippocampus and SVZ were counted as described previously (21Cheng Y. Black I.B. DiCicco-Bloom E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Glutamate Exposure—To assess glutamate toxicity in adult animals, 100 μl of glutamate solution (25 m) was stereotaxically injected into the right ventricle of the mice. After 24 h the mice were euthanized, and the brains were dissected. Coronal sections (12 μm in 2:20 series) were collected on Superfrost®/Plus slides for apoptosis analysis by an indirect TUNEL labeling assay (Roche Diagnostics). For in vitro studies, cultured neural cells were exposed to different dose (0-500 μm) glutamate for 5 min. The glutamate was washed out completely after the exposure. The culture was examined under phase-contrast microscope after 24 h of glutamate exposure.Statistical Analysis—Standard deviations and p values determined by the Student's t test were calculated by standard methods (Microsoft Excel; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).RESULTSNeural Progenitor Cells Express Higher Level of Epo Receptors than Mature Neurons—We used a primary hippocampal cell culture system to evaluate whether EpoR is expressed in mature neurons or NPCs. Immunohistochemical colocalization studies showed that EpoR was colocalized with both mature neurons (MAP-2+) (Fig. 1) and NPCs (Fig. 2, A-D). Qualitatively, we found that NPCs gave more intense staining for EpoR than mature neurons (Fig. 2E). Thus, we compared the level of EpoR in two cell culture systems; one system contained predominantly neurons, and the other contained predominantly a NPC population (primary hippocampal culture and neurosphere culture, respectively). EpoR level was found higher in neurospheres than in primary cultures (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that EpoR is down-regulated as NPC terminally differentiates to mature neurons. We have reported that the expression of EpoR in the mouse brain peaks at mid gestation and then subsequently decreases to modest levels in the adult (22Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Liu C. Yu K. Shen K. Liu Z. Noguchi C.T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 108: 449-454PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in EpoR expression level on NPC and mature neurons may account in part for the decrease of EpoR during development (22Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Liu C. Yu K. Shen K. Liu Z. Noguchi C.T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 108: 449-454PubMed Google Scholar) because of the reduction of the NPC ratio.FIGURE 2NPC expression of EpoR. A-D, cultures of E16 hippocampal cells were double-immunostained with (A) EpoR (red) and (B) nestin (green) antibodies. The merged image (D) shows all nestin positive cells are also EpoR positive. The bright field image is shown in C. Scale bar, 100 μm. E, relative fluorescence intensity corresponding to EpoR staining was determined for EpoR positive and nestin positive cells (Nes+/EpoR+), for EpoR positive and nestin negative cells (Nes-/EpoR+) and for background staining of EpoR negative and nestin negative cells (Nes-/EpoR-). The EpoR density indicated by the pixel values of the fluorescence intensity was measured using ImagePro image analysis software. *, p < 0.001 compared with nestin negative cells.

The number of NPCs is increased in the presence of Epo, and dose response indicated that 10 units/ml of Epo gave the optimum effect. Epo at 10 units/ml increased the number of nestin positive cells by 3-fold (Fig. 3, E and G). To test the proliferation response to Epo, the culture medium was supplemented with BrdUrd, a thymidine analogue incorporated into newly synthesized DNA of replicating cells. Double labeling of BrdUrd and nestin of 5 day cultures showed that about 50% NPC proliferated in response to 10 units/ml Epo (Fig. 3, E and H). The Epo response is about half as strong as that of bFGF (Fig. 3, F, H, and I). In the presence of bFGF (20 ng/ml), the number of NPC increased by 4-fold, and almost all NPC show BrdUrd incorporation. However, the combination of Epo and bFGF treatment showed no additive response on NPC proliferation (cell number) compared with bFGF alone.FIGURE 3Increased NPC proliferation by Epo stimulation. A-F, primary hippocampal cells cultured in medium containing 25 μm BrdUrd. Neural cells in control medium (A and D), 10 units/ml Epo (B and E), and 20 ng/ml bFGF (C and F) were subsequently fixed and double-immunostained with BrdUrd (green) and nestin (red). A-C, bright field images of the cultures. D-F, BrdUrd and nestin double-immunostaining. Scale bar, 100 μm. G, number of NPCs was determined after 2 days in culture without and with Epo (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 units/ml as indicated), and results are normalized to the control value. H, number of NPCs was determined after 2 days in culture without and with bFGF (bFGF at 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml as indicated) and with bFGF (20 ng/ml) and Epo (10 units/ml), and results are normalized to the control value. I, the proliferation rate is the ratio between BrdUrd-labeled cells and the total number of NPCs. The proliferation rate of NPC in the presence of Epo and/or bFGF was determined. *, p < 0.001 compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Generation of Brain EpoR-null Mice—Insertion of the neo cassette in intron 7 of the EpoR gene disrupts EpoR expression, and homozygous mice exhibit a phenotype similar to mEpoR-/- mice and die in utero because of lack of mature red blood cell production (19Divoky V.

Control mice were obtained by unconditional deletion of the neo cassette using a cytomegalovirus/Cre transgene (19Divoky V. Liu Z. Ryan T.M. Prchal J.F. Townes T.M. Prchal J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 986-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conditional expression of EpoR in hematopoietic tissue but not in brain was obtained by breeding mice carrying the disrupted EpoR genetic background with the Tie2-Cre transgenic mouse (ΔEpoR) (20Koni P.A. Joshi S.K. Temann U.A. Olson D. Burkly L. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Embryonic expression of Tie2-Cre in endothelium that gave rise to endothelial cells and hematopoietic stem cells rescued the EpoR-null phenotype by allowing for EpoR expression in early erythroid progenitor cells and restoring production of mature erythrocytes. ΔEpoR mice exhibited no gross morphologic defects. Red cell indices demonstrated that the ΔEpoR selective rescued mice had similar red blood cell content as their control peers. The red blood cell count was 8.8 ± 0.9 m/μl for ΔEpoR mice and 8.8 ± 1.6 m/μl for control mice. The hemoglobin values were 13.2 ± 1.0 g/dL for ΔEpoR mice and 14.2 ± 2.4 g/dL for control mice, and the hematocrit was 42.3 ± 1.5% for ΔEpoR mice and 44.2 ± 7.1% for control mice. RT-PCR confirmed the down-regulation of EpoR expression in brain in the ΔEpoR mice (Fig. 4A). We used Western blotting to confirm the marked reduction of EpoR protein in brain as expected for the selective expression of EpoR only in tissue derived from Tie2-expressing cells such as hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Deletion of brain EpoR expression and increased apoptosis in ΔEpoR embryonic brain.

Shacka J.J. Eells J.B. Suarez-Quian C. Przygodzki R.M. Beleslin-Cokic B. Lin C.S. Nikodem V.M. Hempstead B. Flanders K.C. Costantini F. Noguchi C.T. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective expression of EpoR in the ΔEpoR mice restores normal hematopoiesis and the mice appear normal confirming that whereas EpoR expression in hematopoietic tissue is required for production of mature red blood cells and survival, EpoR expression in the central nervous system is not critical for life. We observed that during embryogenesis, ΔEpoR mice showed increased apoptosis in the brain compared with control mice (Fig. 4, B and C). The extent of apoptosis indicated by TUNEL positive cells was 2-fold greater in ΔEpoR embryonic brain (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that endogenous Epo signaling is required for normal brain development. The increased apoptosis in brain observed in EpoR-null mice prior to death in utero is not only a consequence of disrupted erythroid progenitor cell differentiation and lack of oxygen delivery (8Yu X. Shacka J.J. Eells J.B. Suarez-Quian C. Przygodzki R.M. Beleslin-Cokic B. Lin C.S. Nikodem V.M. Hempstead B. Flanders K.C. Costantini F. Noguchi C.T.

We report a novel approach to manipulate BMP activity through a down-regulation of the potent BMP antagonist Noggin, and examined the effects on the bone forming capacity of osteoblasts. Reduction of noggin enhanced BMP signaling and in vitro osteoblast bone formation, as demonstrated by both gene expression profiles and histological staining. The effects of noggin suppression on in vivo bone formation were also investigated using critical-sized calvarial defects in mice repaired with noggin-suppressed osteoblasts. Radiographic and histological analyses revealed significantly more bone regeneration at 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. These findings strongly support the concept of enhanced osteogenesis through a down-regulation in Noggin and suggest a novel approach to clinically accelerate bone formation, potentially allowing for earlier mobilization of patients following skeletal injury or surgical resection.

These findings strongly support the concept of enhanced osteogenesis through a down-regulation in Noggin and suggest a novel approach to clinically accelerate bone formation, potentially allowing for earlier mobilization of patients following skeletal injury or surgical resection. Skeletal homeostasis involves a dynamic interplay of multiple factors, each influencing the metabolic activity of local bone-forming cells. Alteration in the capacity of these cells to deposit a mineralized extracellular matrix occurs not only in disease states and aging, but also during bone repair and natural growth. A multitude of cytokines with the capacity to regulate recruitment and differentiation of osteoprogenitors have already been identified (1Margolis R.N. Canalis E. Partridge N.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81,: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Skeletal cells themselves synthesize several growth factors that can act in an autocrine fashion, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinMOImultiplicity of infectionGFPgreen fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinMOImultiplicity of infectionGFPgreen fluorescent protein. which induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells and enhance subsequent bone deposition by osteoblasts (2Wang E.A.

Nature. 2003; 422,: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It is their osteoinductive ability, however, that BMPs are most commonly identified with, and this property has been exploited clinically to accelerate bone generation and repair (6Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150,: 893Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar, 11Carlisle E. Fischgrund J.S.

Spine. 2001; 26,: 2751-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). BMPs execute their pro-osteogenic effect by promoting dimerization of specific receptors, resulting in phosphorylation of either Smad1/5 or p38 MAPK intermediates and ultimate modulation of transcriptional activity (13Nohe A. Hassel S. Ehrlich M. Neubauer F. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277,: 5330-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The level of signaling activity can be tempered by a variety of intracellular and extracellular antagonists. Well described mechanisms by which cells naturally regulate the BMP pathway include ligand-competing pseudoreceptors, inhibitory Smads, and cytoplasmic binding proteins inducing ubiquitination and degradation of both Smads 1 and 5 (14Nakayama T. Gardner H. Berg L.K. Christian J.L. Genes Cells. 1998; 3,: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C.

A. 2001; 98,: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).Several structurally unique extracellular BMP antagonists have also been described, each of which bind to BMPs and interfere with their ability to induce receptor dimerization (19Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277,: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Of the many extracellular proteins capable of down-regulating BMP signaling, however, studies have identified noggin to be most closely involved in the osteoinductive role of BMPs (20Abe E. Yamamoto M. Taguchi Y. Lecka-Czernik B. O'Brien C.A. Economides A.N. Stahl N. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner Res. 2000; 15,: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 21Smith W.C. Harland R.M. Cell. 1992; 70,: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In response to BMP-2, -4, or -6, osteoblasts have been shown to dramatically upregulate noggin, suggesting a protective role in negative feedback fashion to limit excessive exposure of cells to BMP signaling (22Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102,: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, several reports have demonstrated the inhibition of BMP signaling by exogenous application of noggin to significantly impair bone formation both in vitro and in vivo (23Devlin R.D. Du Z. Pereira R.C. Kimble R.B. Economides A.N. Jorgetti V. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144,: 1972-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Xiao G. Gopalakrishnan R. Jiang D. Reith E.

Blair H.C. Zaidi M. Abe E. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112,: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These investigations collectively highlight the capacity of noggin to downregulate BMP activity and inhibit subsequent bone deposition by osteoblasts. In contrast, the potential ability to promote endogenous BMP signaling and subsequent osteogenesis through the suppression of noggin remains poorly defined. As an aging population increasingly faces skeletal-related problems, such a novel approach could prove advantageous and more cost-effective in future clinical strategies for the treatment of bone deficiencies.In this study, we evaluated the effects of noggin suppression on osteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix mineral deposition. Using restriction enzymes, multiple noggin-directed siRNA constructs were generated and validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis (26Sen G. Wehrman T.S. Myers J.W. Blau H.M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36,: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of noggin in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts both resulted in enhanced expression of osteogenic differentiation markers and bone nodule deposition. Furthermore, differences in mineralization by osteoblasts expressing noggin-directed siRNA constructs could be detected as early as 12 days. Confirmation of these findings was obtained using Cre-mediated DNA recombination in floxed noggin osteoblasts. Finally, we showed that early reossification of in vivo critical-sized calvarial defects 2 and 4 weeks following injury can be accelerated by RNAi-mediated gene suppression using osteoblasts expressing noggin-specific siRNA constructs. These observations provide strong evidence for the ability of BMP signal manipulation, through novel down-regulation of a potent BMP antagonist, to enhance bone formation in vitro and in vivo. By suppressing noggin, endogenously produced BMP agonists may be left relatively unopposed to drive the differentiation of osteoprogenitors, thereby leading to more rapid repair of bone defects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Harvest and Culture—All experiments were approved by the Administrative Panels on Laboratory Animal Care and Biohazard Safety Committee at Stanford University. MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Primary osteoblasts were harvested from 5-day-old CD-1 mice as previously described (27Frick K.K. Bushinsky D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275,: F840-F847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, calvaria were harvested and parietal bones were trimmed under ×2.5 magnification to within 0.5 mm of each fibrous border. Dura mater and pericranial tissue were removed with the assistance of a dissecting microscope and resulting bone was digested in media containing Dispase II and collagenase A. Osteoblasts obtained from each digestion cycle were plated on standard 10-cm culture dishes and incubated with standard growth media (α-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% PCN/Strep).Generation of siRNA Constructs—First passage calvarial osteoblasts were processed for mRNA using a Qiagen RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Inc, San Diego, CA) and reverse transcription was performed with a Taqman® Reverse Transcription Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Noggin-specific primers designed through Primer3 (Whitehead Institute) were used to amplify a 614-base pair sequence from osteoblast cDNA. Primer sequences used were (5′-GGCCAGCACTATCTACACATCC-3′) for the forward reaction and (5′-GAACACTTACACTCGGAAATGATG-3′) for the reverse reaction. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose gel for isolation of noggin cDNA using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.). A modified restriction enzyme generated system, as described by Sen et al. (26Sen G. Wehrman T.S. Myers J.W. Blau H.M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36,: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was employed to create candidate small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs. Ecotropic phoenix packaging cells (gift from Garry Nolan, Stanford University) were transfected with 1 μg of vector plasmid using FuGENE6 (3 μl/1 μg plasmid) (Roche) and media containing infection-competent virus was collected 48 h following transfection.Validation of Noggin siRNA Constructs—Early passage MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and first passage primary calvarial osteoblasts were expanded on 12-well tissue culture plates and grown to subconfluence prior to retroviral infection. Hexadimethrine bromide (5 μg/ml) was added to the viral supernatant to augment infection efficiency. Cells were infected four times and following the last infection, puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection was performed for 3 days. Cells were then expanded in standard growth media.RNAi-mediated noggin transcript suppression was evaluated in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Noggin and GAPDH primers were designed with the assistance of PrimerBank and QRT-PCR was performed using a two-step, multiplexed Taqman® 5′→3′ exonuclease assay (28Mathy J.A. Lenton K. Nacamuli R.P. Fong K.D. Song H.M. Fang T.D. Yang G.P. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2003; 112,: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each sample was evaluated for noggin and GAPDH transcript levels in triplicate using a SYBR Green assay and quantified with an ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Noggin-directed siRNA constructs demonstrating significant transcript suppression by QRT-PCR analysis were evaluated for protein suppression in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and primary calvarial osteoblasts. Cells were incubated with standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the protein fraction was isolated by 4 °C ultracentrifugation at 55 × g for 15 min. 80 μg of total protein was then loaded from each cell group and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). Products were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with goat polyclonal anti-mouse noggin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin antibodies (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with a donkey anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect for protein (Amersham Biosciences). siRNA constructs demonstrating greater than 50% noggin transcript reduction and, more importantly, suppression of translated protein were considered efficacious and employed in subsequent studies on differentiation.Evaluation of BMP Signaling—The effects of noggin suppression on endogenously produced BMP activity were evaluated by QRT-PCR analysis of the signaling intermediates Smad1 and 5. Primers were designed with the assistance of PrimerBank (29Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31,: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Transcript levels in cells expressing noggin-directed siRNA constructs, a control siRNA, or cells undergoing vehicle only sham infection were compared with baseline Smad expression in unperturbed MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. For reference, Smad transcript levels were also determined in a separate group of cells cultured in standard growth media supplemented with 1 ng/ml rhBMP-4 (R & D Systems) for 24 h.Smad5 and phosphorylated Smad Western blot analysis was performed on 50 μg of protein from total cell lysate harvested by incubation of cells in standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 0.5% phosphatase inhibitor and 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture mix (Sigma). Separation was performed on a 7.5% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), and membranes were probed with either monoclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Smad1/5 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or goat polyclonal anti-Smad5 antibodies. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA).Histological Assessment of Differentiation—MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and primary calvarial osteoblasts were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM, α-MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% PCN/Strep, 250 μm ascorbate-2-phosphate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). Histological assessment of osteoblast differentiation was performed by Alizarin Red staining (30Tataria M. Quarto N. Longaker M.T. Sylvester K.G. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2006; 41,: 624-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All quantified data were obtained in triplicate to facilitate statistical analysis.Gene Expression Analysis—To confirm any differences observed in histologic staining, quantitative gene expression analysis was performed every 3 days beginning at day three of osteogenic differentiation and continuing until day 21. Primers for Runx2, OP, and OC were designed with the assistance of PrimerBank (29Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31,: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). QRT-PCR was performed with transcript levels normalized to GAPDH. Comparison for each gene was performed relative to undifferentiated cells. Each reaction was run in triplicate to provide for statistical comparison between groups.Cre-dependent Noggin Recombination—Primary calvarial osteoblasts were harvested from a noggin conditional null mice with the noggin allele flanked by loxP sites. Cells were then cultured in growth media containing 50 MOI of Cre-expressing adenovirus (Ad-CMV-Cre, Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) or empty adenovirus for 48 h. Evaluation of Cre-mediated DNA recombination was performed by Western blot analysis for noggin, as described above. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an LSR model 1a (Becton Dickinson) running CellQuest Pro. Quantification of data was obtained with FlowJo v6.4.4 (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, OR). Osteoblasts were cultured in ODM for 21 days and extracellular matrix mineralization was determined using Alizarin Red staining, with comparison made to control osteoblasts harvested from the same mice with no adenoviral infection.Critical-sized Defect Repair—Primary calvarial osteoblasts (1 × 105) infected with noggin-directed siRNA constructs, control siRNA, or undergoing sham infection were resuspended in 20 μl of growth media and seeded onto 4-mm apatite-coated polylactic co-glycolic acid scaffolds (31Chou Y.F. Dunn J.C. Wu B.M. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. B Appl. Biomater. 2005; 75,: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to implantation into animals. Criticalsized calvarial defects were created in the right parietal bone of 60-day-old skeletally mature CD-1 mice, as previously described (n = 9 for each group) (32Aalami O.O. Nacamuli R.P. Lenton K.A. Cowan C.M. Fang T.D. Fong K.D. Shi Y.Y. Song H.M. Sahar D.E. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2004; 114,: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Seeded scaffolds were placed into the defect, and the skin was sutured closed. Three animals for each group were sacrificed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks for radiographic and histological analyses. Image acquisition was performed on a CTI Micro-CAT II (CTI Molecular Imaging, Inc., Knoxville, TN) at an x-ray voltage of 80 kVP and an anode current of 450 μA. A resolution of 40 μm was obtained, with 144 steps over a 360° rotation. X-ray data reconstruction and analysis was performed using Amira v4.0 (Mercury Computer Systems, San Diego, CA) and GEHC Microview v2.0.0029 (GE Healthcare, London, ON). Percentage healing in the region of the defect was evaluated using Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD).Following radiographic imaging, calvaria were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Specimens were then decalcified in 19% EDTA, processed, and embedded into paraffin wax for sectioning. Regeneration in the region of the defect was evaluated by pentachrome staining of 8-μm thick sections. Aniline blue staining was also performed on every fifth slide (n = 10 slides evaluated per specimen) through the region of the defect and quantification of bone content was performed using ImageJ. All stained slides were imaged using a Zeiss AxioPlan microscope.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed in triplicate. A Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance between groups with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test on GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses. A *, p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSEvaluation of RNAi-mediated Noggin Suppression—RNA interference was employed to induce a reduction in the level of noggin transcript and protein. Using a modification of the restriction enzyme generated siRNA system, five individual noggin-directed siRNA constructs were obtained and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 1a). An additional 13 constructs were found to be in the reverse orientation on sequencing and were not further evaluated. QRT-PCR analysis of noggin in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts following infection and puromycin selection demonstrated a strong reduction in transcript level (siRNA1 89.6 ± 1.5%; siRNA2 87.9 ± 5.2%; siRNA3 51.5 ± 5.3%; siRNA4 72.3 ± 3.3%; and siRNA5 55.5 ± 4.7%; all *, p < 0.001) when compared with control, vehicle only sham-infected cells (Fig. 1b). MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts infected with a control GFP-targeted siRNA construct demonstrated no significant change in noggin level when compared with controls.Western blot analysis was next performed to determine the capacity of each noggin-directed siRNA construct to suppress noggin protein. Noggin levels were not affected by infection with a control siRNA when compared with cells treated with vehicle only sham infection. And while each of the noggin-targeted siRNA constructs induced a reduction in the level of transcript, only two constructs, siRNA1 and siRNA2, resulted in elimination of detectable protein (Fig. 1c). Noggin protein could still be observed when MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were induced to express siRNA3, siRNA4, or siRNA5. Therefore, only siRNA constructs 1 and 2 were selected for further analyses.Noggin Suppression Enhances Smad Expression and BMP Signaling—The effect of noggin reduction on BMP signaling was first evaluated by QRT-PCR analysis of Smad1 and Smad5 transcription. As expected, relative to untreated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts, transcript levels for Smad1 or Smad5 did not change significantly following infection with a control siRNA or vehicle only sham infection (Fig. 2a). Cells expressing either of the two noggin-targeted siRNA constructs, however, demonstrated significant up-regulation of both Smad1 and Smad5 (siRNA1: Smad1 1.29 ± 0.05, Smad5 1.54 ± 0.07; siRNA2: Smad1 1.27 ± 0.08, Smad5 1.50 ± 0.03; all *, p < 0.05), demonstrating that noggin reduction enhances mRNA levels of these BMP signaling intermediates (Fig. 2a). Similar results were observed when untreated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were cultured in the presence of exogenous rhBMP-4 (1 ng/ml) for 24 h (Smad1 1.35 ± 0.06, Smad5 1.67 ± 0.20; both *, p < 0.05).FIGURE 2Noggin suppression enhances BMP signaling and osteogenic differentiation.a, expression of siRNA1 or siRNA2 or exogenous application of 1 ng/ml rhBMP-4 enhanced levels of mean transcripts ± S.D. of both Smad1 and Smad5 in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts (*, p < 0.05). b, Western blot analysis for phospho-Smad1/5 demonstrated increased levels of this signaling intermediate when cells were either infected with noggin-directed siRNA constructs or exposed to rhBMP-4. However, no change was observed in total Smad5 protein levels. c, Alizarin Red staining of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts revealed increased extracellular matrix mineralization when noggin was suppressed. Quantification revealed significantly more staining when cells were infected with either siRNA1 or siRNA2 (mean absorbance ± S.D.; *, p < 0.01) (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As BMP ligand-receptor interactions culminate in phosphorylation of Smad intermediates, Western blot analysis of phospho-Smad1/5 protein was next performed. Similar to cells treated with rhBMP-4, suppression of noggin was enough to induce a detectable increase in phospho-Smad1/5 relative to control cells (Fig. 2b). Total Smad5 protein level was not observed to change with either rhBMP-4 or infection with noggin-directed siRNA constructs. Together, these findings indicate that a reduction in the level of noggin enhances the signaling activity of endogenously produced BMPs, as reflected by the increase in phosphorylated Smad intermediates.Reduction of Noggin Promotes Osteoblast Differentiation—With noggin suppression promoting phosphorylation of BMP signaling intermediates, the consequences of noggin reduction on the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were subsequently evaluated. Cells were either induced to express a noggin-directed siRNA construct, a control siRNA construct, or underwent vehicle only sham retroviral infection. Following 21 days of culture in ODM, histological assessment was performed using Alizarin Red staining. Notable qualitative differences were observed in the degree of osteoblast differentiation, with cells expressing noggin-directed siRNA constructs 1 or 2 depositing more mineralized extracellular matrix relative to either control siRNA expressing or vehicle only sham-infected controls (Fig. 2c). Quantification of staining demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the amount of bone nodule formation observed from cells with noggin suppression relative to controls (*, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2d). No significant difference was observed between siRNA1 and siRNA 2 or between control siRNA infected and vehicle only sham-infected cells.Gene expression analysis was performed to confirm histological findings. Importantly, noggin expression was observed to increase in control siRNA and sham-infected MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts when cultured in ODM over 21 days (Fig. 3a). In contrast, cells expressing either siRNA1 or 2 demonstrated continued suppression of noggin transcripts below the level found in undifferentiated cells at all time points (both *, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3a). Expression levels for the early osteoblast transcription factor Runx were also evaluated. While control siRNA and sham-infected MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts demonstrated maximal up-regulation following 9 days of differentiation relative to undifferentiated cells, expression of Runx peaked 3 days earlier in noggin-suppressed cells (*,p < 0.01) (Fig. 3b).FIGURE 3Noggin suppression promotes expression of osteogenic differentiation markers.a, following 3 weeks of culture in osteogenic differentiation media, MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts expressing siRNA1 or siRNA2 continued to demonstrate significant noggin suppression (mean expression ± S.D.; *, p < 0.05). Maximal mean expression ± S.D. of Runx (b), an early marker of bone differentiation was noted 3 days earlier in noggin-suppressed cells (red and blue bars) when compared with differentiated control cells (white and yellow bars) (*, p < 0.05). Significant differences in OP expression, an intermediate marker, were noted at days 6 and 9, and again at days 18 and 21 (mean expression ± S.D.; *, p < 0.05) (c). A shift toward earlier up-regulation was again noted in noggin-suppressed cells (red and blue bars). OC expression, a late marker for bone differentiation was greatest in noggin-suppressed cells beginning at day 9 (mean expression ± S.D.; *, p < 0.05) (d). All transcripts levels were expressed relative to undifferentiated control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An intermediate marker of osteoblast differentiation, OP, was similarly examined by QRT-PCR analysis. Relative to undifferentiated cells, control siRNA and sham-infected MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts demonstrated greatest expression following 12-15 days of osteogenic differentiation (Fig. 3c). Cells expressing noggin-targeted siRNA constructs; however, reached similar levels 3 days earlier. Evaluation at each time point between control and noggin-suppressed cells revealed significant differences in OP expression at 6 and 9 days and again at 18 and 21 days of differentiation as expression of this intermediated marker tapered (*, p < 0.05). Lastly, transcript levels for the late marker of osteogenic differentiation, OC, were investigated by QRT-PCR. When compared with undifferentiated cells, MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts expressing siRNA1 or 2 were found to significantly upregulate OC expression as early as 9 days (Fig. 3d). In contrast, significant up-regulation in control siRNA or sham-infected cells could not be detected until 3 days later. Comparing cells at each time point, noggin suppressed MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts demonstrated significantly more OC transcripts than control siRNA or sham-infected cells beginning at day 9 and continuing through day 21 (*, p <"

Emerging data suggest that members of the Gα12/13 and Gαq/11 families of heterotrimeric G proteins signal downstream to RhoA via distinct pathways. Although studies have elucidated mechanisms governing Gα12/13-mediated RhoA activation, proteins that functionally couple Gαq/11 to RhoA activation have remained elusive.

We have used biochemical/biophysical approaches with purified protein components to better understand the mechanism by which activated Gαq directly engages and stimulates p63RhoGEF. Basally, p63RhoGEF is autoinhibited by the Dbl homology (DH)-associated pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; activated Gαq relieves this autoinhibition by interacting with a highly conserved C-terminal extension of the PH domain.

GPCR-mediated activation of RhoA effectively couples signaling pathways mediated by two distinct groups of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins: the heterotrimeric Gα-subunits and the monomeric small GTPases. These two groups of G proteins share a universal mechanism for guanine nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and conformational switching between two discrete states: a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state (13Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate G proteins by promoting the release of bound GDP, allowing the subsequent binding of GTP. Active, GTP-bound G proteins can then interact with numerous downstream effector molecules, further propagating the signal initiated at the plasma membrane.GPCRs function as GEFs for heterotrimeric Gα-subunits, whereas Dbl-family GEFs are the major class of exchange factors for Rho GTPases. Dbl-family GEFs are defined by the presence of a Dbl homology domain (DH domain), which is almost invariantly followed by a pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) (14Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The catalytic guanine nucleotide exchange activity resides entirely within the DH domain, although recent evidence indicates that the PH domain can function to fine-tune this exchange activity (15Rossman K.L.

Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1307-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies have focused on the DH-associated PH domain as a simple membrane targeting device, by virtue of its ability to bind phosphoinositides. However, emerging evidence suggests that PH domains may also play important regulatory roles by serving as protein-protein interaction modules (17DiNitto J.P. Lambright D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).The coordinated cross-talk from GPCR stimulation to RhoA activation is mediated by Dbl-family GEFs that are responsive to activated Gα-subunits. A growing body of literature implicates both Gα12/13 and Gαq/11 family members as upstream activators of RhoA (18Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S.

RhoA activation downstream of the Gα12/13 family is mediated by the p115 family members, which consists of p115-RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF. The p115 family members are directly activated by Gα12/13 via a protein-protein interaction mediated by a highly divergent regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain, but are not activated by Gαq/11 family members (22Chen Z.

However, whereas numerous studies have elucidated mechanisms underlying Gα12/13-mediated RhoA activation, the signaling pathways that couple Gαq/11 to RhoA activation have remained elusive.Recently, the Dbl-family member p63RhoGEF/GEFT has been described as a novel mediator of Gαq/11 signaling to RhoA based on its ability to synergize with Gαq/11 resulting in enhanced RhoA signaling (30Lutz S.

Using cell model systems, the authors clearly demonstrate that Gαq/11-coupled GPCR activation or overexpression of activated mutants of Gαq/11 enhance the ability for overexpressed p63RhoGEF to activate serum response factor-dependent gene reporters. Furthermore, using co-immunoprecipitation studies, the authors deduced that activated Gαq/11 associates with the C-terminal half of p63RhoGEF, which contains the PH domain. However, the mechanistic aspects underlying Gαq/11-mediated p63RhoGEF activation remain unclear. In particular, the previous co-immunoprecipitation studies do not rule out the indirect association of Gαq/11 with p63RhoGEF through ancillary proteins. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine whether Gαq/11 can directly modulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of p63RhoGEF using a defined in vitro system. Here we use biochemical/biophysical approaches with highly purified protein components to show that p63RhoGEF directly and specifically associates with activated Gαq to enhance robustly the catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. Therefore, p63RhoGEF is a bona fide effector of Gαq. Furthermore, these studies strongly implicate p63RhoGEF, together with the related Dbl-family members, Trio and Kalirin, as a major nexus for the activation of RhoA downstream of Gαq/11.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Constructs—Truncation mutant constructs of human p63RhoGEF were PCR amplified from full-length human p63RhoGEF (GenBank accession number BC012860, kindly provided by T. Wieland) resulting in the following constructs: DH-Ct (residues 155–580), DH-Ext (residues 155–493), DH-PH (residues 155–472), and DH (residues 155–347). PCR products were then subcloned into a modified pET-21a vector (Novagen) using a previously published ligation-independent cloning strategy (31Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression vector, pLiC-His-TEV, which encodes an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site, was used to generate vectors for the DH-Ct, DH-Ext, and DH-PH His6-tagged p63RhoGEF constructs. The p63RhoGEF DH construct was cloned into a His6-tagged, TEV-cleavable, maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector (pLiC-His-MBP-TEV) for improved expression and solubility. N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged constructs for p63RhoGEF DH-Ext and DH-PH were cloned into a GST fusion vector using a similar strategy. Point mutant constructs of p63RhoGEF (F471A, L472A, N473A, L474A, Q476A, S477A, P478A, I479A, E480A, Y481A, Q482A, R483A) were generated in the context of the His6-tagged DH-Ext using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) followed by automated sequencing to confirm each mutation. The coding region for the C-terminal DH-Ext region of Trio (Trio-C DH-Ext, residues 1291–2299) was PCR amplified from full-length human Trio (GenBank accession number NM_007118, kindly provided by M. Strueli) and introduced into the pLiC-His-TEV bacterial expression vector as above.

Cells were grown up at 37 °C in LB media containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until an A600 of ∼0.6, then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown up at 18 °C for ∼18 h. Cells containing His6-tagged proteins were harvested and soluble recombinant proteins were purified using standard Ni2+-affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Prior to size-exclusion chromatography, some His6-tagged proteins were treated with TEV to remove the His6 tag. Additionally, treatment with TEV allowed for removal of the N-terminal MBP fusion of the p63RhoGEF DH construct. E. coli cells containing GST fusion p63RhoGEF proteins (GST-DH-Ext, GST-DH-PH) were also harvested and recombinant proteins purified using standard glutathione-affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Chimeric fusion constructs of the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαq and Gα13 were purified using a baculovirus-based expression system (Invitrogen) in High-5 insect cells based on methods previously described (32Kreutz B.

Heterotrimeric Gα-subunits were confirmed active using several independent methods including AlF4-dependent binding to effectors proteins. Additionally, Dbs DH-PH (residues 623–967), Tiam1 DH-PH (residues 1022–1406), Rac1 (residues 1–189 C189S), Cdc42 (residues 1–189 C189S), RhoA (residues 1–190 C190S), RhoB (residues 1–190, C190S), and RhoC (residues 1–191, C191S) were expressed in E. coli and purified essentially as previously described (15Rossman K.L.

Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography was used for all recombinant protein preparations to ensure samples eluted as monodispersed species of correct molecular weight. All recombinant protein concentrations were determined using the A280 method with extinction coefficients calculated using the ProtParam tool (ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (38Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar)), analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm concentration and ensure purity, and subsequently stored at –80 °C.Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of purified RhoGEFs was determined using a kinetic, fluorescence-based assay with Rho GTPases (RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, Cdc42) that were preloaded with BODIPY FL-conjugated GDP (BODIPY-GDP, Molecular Probes) essentially as previously described (39Rojas R.J. Kimple R.J. Rossman K.L. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All exchange assays were performed using an LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with wavelengths set at λex = 500 nm (slits = 15 nm), λem = 511 nm (slits = 5 nm), and quartz cuvettes thermostatted at 20 °C while constantly stirred. Reactions were carried out in exchange buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 μm GDP. For each exchange assay, BODIPY-GDP-preloaded Rho GTPases (200 nm) were allowed to equilibrate in exchange buffer. Then 30 μm AlF4 (30 μm AlCl3 + 10 mm NaF) and/or heterotrimeric G proteins at the indicated concentrations were added. The presence of AlF4 had no impact on the spontaneous exchange rate of Rho GTPases and was used to selectively activate heterotrimeric G proteins. Finally, the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction was initiated by the manual addition of the RhoGEF at the indicated concentrations and the exchange reaction was monitored in real time until completion. The observed exchange rates (kobs) were then calculated for each condition by fitting the change in relative fluorescence intensity over time for a given condition to a single-phase exponential decay using Prizm data analysis software (GraphPad). Exchange data depicted in bar graphs are the mean ± S.D. for each condition, conducted in triplicate. Representative real time kinetic exchange data depicted in curves are normalized as follows: relative fluorescence units prior to addition of RhoGEF (100% BODIPY-GDP bound) and relative fluorescence units at reaction completion (0% BODIPY-GDP bound).Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Studies—All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). An anti-GST antibody was covalently coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip per the manufacturer's protocol. Binding studies were performed in SPR buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 μm GDP, and 30 μm AlF4 (30 μm AlCl3 + 10 mm NaF). GST fusion binding surfaces were subsequently generated for individual flow cells by the application of GST only, or the GST-tagged p63RhoGEF constructs GST-DH-Ext and GST-DH-PH. To generate SPR-based binding isotherms, an analyte consisting of 10 μm Gαq in AlF4-containing SPR buffer was flowed over each surface; background binding to the GST only surface was subsequently subtracted from each condition and the corresponding relative units were plotted.Fluorescence Polarization Binding Studies—A peptide spanning the conserved PH domain extension of p63RhoGEF was synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography purified by the Tufts University peptide core facility. This peptide consisted of an N-terminal fluorescein moiety followed by a β-alanine linker and residues 467–493 of human p63RhoGEF followed by a C-terminal amide group. Gαq or Gαi were added at varying concentrations to a 96-well plate containing 5 nm peptide in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 30 μm GDP, and 30 μm AlF4 (30 μm AlCl3 + 10 mm NaF) with a total volume of 200 μl. Each condition was allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for ∼15 min before polarization was determined using a PHERAstar fluorescence microplate reader (BMG Labtech) using the polarization mode. The excitation laser (λex = 485 nm) was vertically polarized and the subsequent fluorescence emission intensity (λem = 520 nm) was observed through a polarizer orientated parallel or perpendicular to the excitation vector. Polarization (P) was then calculated using the formula: p = (I∥ – I⊥)/(I∥ + I⊥), where I∥ is the intensity of the parallel component and I⊥ is the intensity of the perpendicular component of the emitted light (40Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Peptide in the absence of heterotrimeric G protein was used to adjust the gain prior to data collection.RESULTSSequence Analysis Reveals a Highly Conserved Extension of the DH-associated PH Domain of p63RhoGEF—Unlike the majority of the 69 human Dbl-family GEFs, p63RhoGEF lacks any additional signaling domains outside of the canonical DH-PH cassette that defines this family. To identify conserved regions that may impart signaling properties or suggest modes of regulation for p63RhoGEF, we generated a multiple sequence alignment using Clustal-X (41Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35195) Google Scholar) for eight representative p63RhoGEF orthologs and projected the sequence conservation for each residue onto the predicted domain architecture (Fig. 1A). The three-dimensional structure of PH domains is well characterized and takes on a β-sandwich fold capped on one side by a C-terminal α-helix, termed αC (17DiNitto J.P. Lambright D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted αC helix of p63RhoGEF has a highly conserved extension, which is predicted to be unstructured and is not considered an integral part of the PH domain based on sequence analysis (Fig. 1A). The strict conservation of this region and its proximity to the PH domain led us to hypothesize that this unique extension may be essential for regulating the exchange activity of p63RhoGEF. Based on these sequence analysis studies, we generated several p63RhoGEF truncation mutant constructs (Fig. 1A) and purified recombinant protein components to near homogeneity for use in our subsequent biochemical/biophysical analyses (Fig. 1B).The Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity of p63RhoGEF Is Autoinhibited by the DH-associated PH Domain—We tested p63RhoGEF truncation mutants for their ability to promote guanine nucleotide exchange using RhoA as a substrate GTPase to investigate the mechanism of autoregulation. The exchange activities of p63RhoGEF constructs encompassing the DH-Ct, DH-Ext, and DH-PH were similarly activating toward RhoA, yielding an ∼2–3-fold increase in the exchange rate over the spontaneous exchange rate of RhoA alone (Fig. 2). Full-length p63RhoGEF was similar in its activation of RhoA (data not shown). These results rule out possible regulation by inhibitory sequences, which have been well characterized for Vav and more recently, Tim-family RhoGEFs (42Yohe M.E. Rossman K.L. Gardner O.S. Karnoub A.E. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Graves L.M. Der C.J. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13813-13823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, under identical conditions, the DH construct was ∼22-fold more active than the spontaneous exchange rate of RhoA alone (Fig. 2), implicating the PH domain as a negative regulator of p63RhoGEF exchange activity. To generate a soluble p63RhoGEF DH fragment, we used a TEV-cleavable MBP fusion at the N terminus; both MBP fusion and TEV-treated DH constructs retained similar activity toward RhoA. Whereas there is conflicting literature regarding the regulatory role of the PH domain of p63RhoGEF, our results are in accordance with previous studies that suggest an autoinhibitory role (43Bryan B.A. Mitchell D.C.

Recent studies have shown that relaxin-3 is involved in the regulation of stress and feeding behaviors. The mechanisms underlying the involvement of relaxin-3/GPCR135 in the regulation of stress, feeding, and other potential functions remain to be studied. Because relaxin-3 also activates the relaxin receptor (LGR7), which is also expressed in the brain, selective GPCR135 agonists and antagonists are crucial to the study of the physiological functions of relaxin-3 and GPCR135 in vivo. Previously, we reported the creation of a selective GPCR135 agonist (a chimeric relaxin-3/INSL5 peptide designated R3/I5). In this report, we describe the creation of a high affinity antagonist for GPCR135 and GPCR142 over LGR7. This GPCR135 antagonist, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, consists of the relaxin-3 B-chain with a replacement of Gly23 to Arg, a truncation at the C terminus (Gly24-Trp27 deleted), and the A-chain of INSL5. In vitro pharmacological studies showed that R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 binds to human GPCR135 (IC50 = 0.67 nm) and GPCR142 (IC50 = 2.29 nm) with high affinity and is a potent functional GPCR135 antagonist (pA2 = 9.15) but is not a human LGR7 ligand. Furthermore, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 had a similar binding profile at the rat GPCR135 receptor (IC50 = 0.25 nm, pA2 = 9.6) and lacked affinity for the rat LGR7 receptor. When administered to rats intracerebroventricularly, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 blocked food intake induced by the GPCR135 selective agonist R3/I5. Thus, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 should prove a useful tool for the further delineation of the functions of the relaxin-3/GPCR135 system.

The high affinity interaction between relaxin and LGR7 as well as knock-out studies demonstrate that relaxin is the endogenous ligand for LGR7 (15Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K.

Because GPCR142 is a pseudogene in the rat (13Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S.W. Bonaventure P. Nepomuceno D. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is not detected in the mouse brain (5Sutton S. Bonaventure P. Kuei C. Nepomuceno D. Wu J. Zhu J. Lovenberg T. Liu C. Neuroendocrinology. 2005; 82: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), activation of GPCR142 by central administration of relaxin-3 is not a great concern in these species. However, potential activation of LGR7 by relaxin-3 remains a potentially confounding issue, especially because LGR7 is expressed in the brain and is reported to play a role in drinking (8McGowan B.M. Stanley S.A. Smith K.L. White N.E. Connolly M.M. Thompson E.L. Gardiner J.V. Murphy K.G. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R.

Lett. 2006; 393: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Nistri S. Bani D. Curr. Neurovasc. Res. 2005; 2: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Sherwood O.D. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar).Previous studies showed that the B-chain of relaxin-3 is capable of binding to and activating GPCR135 (2Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), suggesting that the B-chain of relaxin-3 contains the receptor binding domains for GPCR135. Later studies have demonstrated that a chimeric peptide (R3/I5) composed of the relaxin-3 B-chain and the INSL5 A-chain selectively activates GPCR135 over LGR7 (23Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which further support our hypothesis. Homology modeling of the relaxin-3 structure (Fig. 1) and solution structure analysis of relaxin-3 (24Rosengren K.J. Lin F. Bathgate R.A. Tregear G.W. Daly N.L. Wade J.D. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) show that the middle segment of the relaxin-3 B-chain forms an α-helix. Amino acid residues Arg12, Ile15, Arg16, Ile19, and Phe20 are presented on one side of the α-helix that faces away from the A-chain, suggesting that these residues may play a role in the interactions between relaxin-3 and its receptors. In addition, although the N termini of the B-chains of the members in the insulin/relaxin family have no conservation (Fig. 1), a few different members can activate the same receptor (relaxin-1 and -2, and relaxin-3 for LGR7; relaxin-1, -2, and INSL3 for LGR8; relaxin-3 and INSL5 for GPCR142), suggesting that the N terminus of relaxin-3 may not be important for interactions between relaxin-3 and its receptors. In this report, using mutagenesis studies, we describe the identification of the GPCR135 binding domain (the α-helix region of the relaxin-3 B-chain) and the receptor activation domain (the C terminus of the relaxin-3 B-chain) of relaxin-3. In addition, we report the creation of a selective GPCR135 antagonist (R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5) that consists of the relaxin-3 B-chain with a truncation at the C terminus (Gly23–Trp27, the GPCR135 activation domain), an addition of an Arg residue in place of Gly23 of the B-chain, and the A-chain of INSL5. This novel, high affinity GPCR135 antagonist, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, does not interact with LGR7. In addition, we demonstrate increased feeding in satiated Wistar rats following intracerebroventricular dosing of R3/I5 (a selective GPCR135 agonist), which is blocked by prior administration of the GPCR135-specific antagonist R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Relaxin-3 Mutant Peptides—Different relaxin-3 mutant peptides with various mutations at the B-chain were created, including truncations at the N terminus (mutants Δ1–6, Δ1–7, Δ1–8, and Δ1–9), different point mutations at residues Arg8, Arg12, Ile15, Arg16, Ile19, Phe20, Arg26, and Trp27 as well as truncations at the C terminus (R3(BΔ23–27), R3(BΔ24–27), R3(BΔ25–27), R3(BΔ26–27), and R3(BΔ23–27)/I5). All peptides (except as specified) were generated recombinantly in mammalian cells similar to the production of relaxin-3 as described previously (2Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B.

All relaxin-3 mutant coding regions were created by a two-step PCR using primers shown in supplemental Table 1. In the first round PCR, overlapping 5′-end and 3′-end coding regions for each mutant were PCR-amplified. The human relaxin-3 cDNA construct (2Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C.

The first-step PCR products (5′-end and 3′-end) were then mixed and used as the templates for the respective second-round PCR reactions using primers P1 and P2 (Pi5 for R3(BΔ23–27)/I5; listed in supplemental Table 1). All PCRs were run under the conditions of 94 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. The final PCR products were cloned into a modified pCMV-SPORT1 vector containing a coding region for an α-signal peptide for secretion, which was followed by a FLAG peptide coding region for affinity purification (2Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol.

All mutant peptides (except for R3(BΔ23–27)/I5) have the intact A-chain of the wild type relaxin-3 but different B-chains. R3(BΔ23–27)/I5 has an A-chain of human INSL5. The B-chain sequences of the mutant peptides with truncations at the C terminus of relaxin-3 B-chain are shown in Table 1. B-chain sequences of other mutants are shown in supplemental Table 2. All recombinant peptides were co-expressed with furin protease in COS-7 cells for efficient removal of the C-chain (2Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H.

The N-terminal FLAG-tagged peptides were first purified using an anti-FLAG affinity column, and then the tag was removed by enterokinase (Novagen, Madison, WI) digestion. The peptides, free of the tag, were then further purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described (2Liu C.

R3(BΔ23–27)R and R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, which are derivative of R3(BΔ23–27) and R3(BΔ23–27)/I5 respectively, have an extra Arg residue at the C terminus of the B-chain because of incomplete processing (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab Radioligand Binding Assays—125I-Relaxin-3/INSL5 (125I-R3/I5), a radiolabeled chimeric peptide with the human relaxin-3 B-chain and the human INSL5 A-chain (23Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used at a final concentration of 50 pm as the tracer to characterize the binding properties of GPCR135 and GPCR142 for the mutant relaxin-3 peptides. 125I-H2 (human gene-2) relaxin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used at a final concentration of 50 pm to characterize the binding properties of the relaxin receptor LGR7 for the peptides. COS-7 cells in 24-well tissue culture plates that transiently expressed GPCR135, GPCR142, or LGR7 were used in radioligand binding assays as described (13Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S.W. Bonaventure P. Nepomuceno D. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The results were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (San Diego). The IC50 values, which are the ligand concentrations that inhibited 50% of the maximum binding, were calculated and then converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff formula (31Whittingham J.L. Edward D.J. Antson A.A. Clarkson J.M. Dodson G.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11516-11523Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with Kd values of 0.41, 0.89, and 0.18 nm for binding of 125I-R3/I5 to GPCR135, 125I-R3/I5 to GPCR142, and 125I-H2 relaxin to LGR7, respectively.Agonist and Antagonist Analysis for Mutant Relaxin-3 Peptides—All peptides were tested for their agonist activities against GPCR135, GPCR142, and LGR7 expressed in SK-NMC/CRE cells as described previously (23Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SK-N-MC/CRE-βgal cells harbor a β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene under the control of a CRE promoter. An increase in cAMP concentration in these cells is associated with increased β-gal expression, which can be measured using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate and reading the optical absorbance at 570 nm. GPCR135 and GPCR142 are coupled with Gαi proteins; therefore agonists inhibit forskolin-stimulated β-gal expression in GPCR135- or GPCR142-expressing cells. LGR7 is Gs linked, and therefore agonists stimulate expression in LGR7-expressing cells. R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 was tested for its ability to produce a rightward-shift in the relaxin-3 or R3/I5 dose-response curve in the presence of 10 nm, 100 nm,or 1 μm R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 to demonstrate functional antagonism. Wild type relaxin-3 peptide was used as positive control in all experiments. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. The EC50 values, which are the ligand concentrations that stimulate 50% of the maximum responses, were then calculated.The agonism and antagonism of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 for rat GPCR135 was tested in the same way as the human GPCR135 using SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells stably expressing rat GPCR135. The agonism and antagonism of peptides for rat LGR7 was assayed using a cAMP luminescence assay. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA construct expressing rat LGR7 (4Sutton S. Bonaventure P. Kuei C. Chen J. Nepomuceno D. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. Neuroendocrinology. 2004; 80: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm EDTA and plated at a density of 25,000 cells/well in 96-well white opaque plates (Thermo Electron Corp., catalog no. 7571). To test the agonism of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, cells expressing rat LGR7 were stimulated with different concentrations of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 with relaxin-3 as the positive control. To test the antagonism of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 for rat LGR7, different concentrations of relaxin-3 were added to cells expressing rat LGR7 in the presence of 10 nm, 100 nm,or 1 μm of R3(Δ23–27)R/I5. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cAMP in the cells was measured with a cAMP detection kit (DiscoveRx HitHunter, catalog no. 90–0041) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software.Autoradiographic Studies—R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 peptide was evaluated pharmacologically using endogenous GPCR135 from rat brain slices in autoradiographic studies as described previously (4Sutton S. Bonaventure P. Kuei C. Chen J. Nepomuceno D. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. Neuroendocrinology. 2004; 80: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-R3/I5 was applied in a binding buffer to rat brain slices. Unlabeled human relaxin-3 or R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 was used at various concentrations as competitors to displace GPCR135 binding of 125I-R3/I5. The specific binding of 125I-R3/I5 to the rat brain slices was quantitated using a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer system (BAS-5000).In Vivo Studies—Experimentally naive male Wistar rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), weighing 200–225 g at the time of arrival, were used. The animals were initially housed at two/cage and given a 1-week acclimation period to the vivarium prior to intracerebroventricular cannula implantation. All animals had free access to food and water throughout the experiment. The animal colony was maintained at 22 ± 2 °C during a 12-h light/12-h dark illumination cycle with lights on from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. All behavioral testing occurred during the light phase between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the U. S. National Institutes of Health.Surgical Preparation—Following the acclimation period, the animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and surgically implanted with a 20-gauge guide cannula aimed at the lateral ventricle. Guide cannulae (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) were unilaterally implanted using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA) using the following coordinates relative to Bregma (flat skull): AP =+1.0 mm, ML =–1.3 mm, DV =–3.8 mm from the top of the skull (25Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three screws mounted in the skull and covered with dental cement served as an anchor for the guide cannula. Animals were then housed individually and given a 7-day recovery period from surgery. During the surgical recovery period, the animals were handled 2–3 times to minimize stress effects that might occur because of being handled at the time of behavioral testing.Apparatus—The testing apparatus consisted of a plastic cage (containing no bedding) in which a wire grid was placed on the floor of the cage. A food hopper and drinking spout were located on opposite walls of the cage. The drinking spout was connected to an automated watering system and thereby delivered water to the animal on demand throughout the session(s).A predetermined amount of standard rat chow (Formulab Diet no. 5008) was placed in the food hopper at the start of the 4-h session(s). The amount of food remaining in the food hopper was determined by subtracting the weight of the food at 1 and 4 h from the initial food weight (i.e. weight of the food at the start of the session). Food crumbs detected on the floor of the apparatus were included in the determination of food weights.Drugs—The peptides (i.e. R3/I5, R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5) were dissolved in vehicle (sterile physiological saline plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin). All solutions were infused in a 5-μl volume. R3/I5 and R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 were infused at a concentration of 2 μg/μl.Feeding Procedure—Following the surgical recovery period, the animals were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment conditions: vehicle (5 μl) + vehicle; vehicle + R3/I5 (10 μg); R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 (10 μg) + vehicle; R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 (10 μg) + R3/I5 (10 μg).Testing consisted of a two-day protocol. Day 1 served as the base-line session. No injections were administered during this session, and it served as a habituation period to the testing apparatus, while also providing a base-line measure of food intake. Day 2 served as the test session. Immediately prior to this session, all animals were removed from their home cage, and two infusions were administered directly into the lateral ventricle. Test substances were given via a preloaded catheter without removing the catheter between injections. A 0.5-μl air bubble separated each injection to prevent mixing. The animals were first infused with vehicle or R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, followed by a second infusion that consisted of vehicle or R3/I5. The infusions were separated by 10 min, and the injection needle remained in the guide cannula for 1 min following the termination of the final infusion. Following the second infusion, the animals were placed in the testing apparatus, and food intake was measured at 1 and 4 h during a 4-h session. Food intake measured at the end of the session served as a measure of total food intake. All animals were euthanized with carbon dioxide, and cannula placements were verified at the end of behavioral testing.RESULTSProbing the Receptor Binding and Activation Domains of Relaxin-3—The functions of the N terminus of the relaxin-3 B-chain were evaluated by removing residues Arg1–Gly6 (Δ1–6), Arg1–Val7 (Δ1–7), Arg1–Arg8 (Δ1–8), or Arg1–Leu9 (Δ1–9) from the N-terminal region of the relaxin-3 B-chain. The A-chains of those mutant peptides were left unchanged. The RΔ1–6 and Δ1–7 mutants were expressed in mammalian expression system with the similar yield to that of the wild type relaxin-3 peptide (5Sutton S. Bonaventure P. Kuei C. Nepomuceno D. Wu J. Zhu J. Lovenberg T. Liu C. Neuroendocrinology. 2005; 82: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Δ1–8 mutant had a significantly reduced expression level (∼100 μg/liter), but the expression level for Δ1–9 mutant was too low to generate enough peptide for functional testing. Δ1–6 and Δ1–7 mutants retained high binding affinity and agonist potency for GPCR135, GPCR142, and LGR7."
https://openalex.org/W1997364024,"Bone senses and adapts to meet mechanical needs by means of an extensive mechanotransduction network comprising osteocytes (former osteoblasts entrapped in mineral) and their cytoplasmic projections through which osteocytes communicate with osteoblasts and osteoclasts on the bone surface. Mechanical stimulation promotes osteocyte (and osteoblast) survival by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERKs. Estrogens have similar effects and, intriguingly, the adaptive response of bone to mechanical forces is defective in mice lacking estrogen receptor (ER) α or ERβ. We report that ERKs are not activated by stretching in osteocytic and osteoblastic cells in which both ERα and ERβ have been knocked out or knocked down and this is reversed partially by transfection of either one of the two human ERs and fully by transfection of both receptors. ERK activation in response to stretching is also recovered by transfecting the ligand-binding domain (E) of either receptor or an ERα mutant that does not bind estrogens. Furthermore, mechano-responsiveness is restored by transfecting the Eα targeted to the plasma membrane, but not to the nucleus, whereas ERα mutants with impaired plasma membrane localization or binding to caveolin-1 fail to confer ERK activation in response to stretching. Lastly, the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 abrogates ERK activation and the anti-apoptotic effect of mechanical stimulation. We conclude that in addition to their role as ligand-dependent mediators of the effects of estrogens, the ERs participate in the transduction of mechanical forces into pro-survival signaling in bone cells, albeit in a ligand-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2113356069,"All DNA polymerases require a divalent cation for catalytic activity. It is generally assumed that Mg2+ is the physiological cofactor for replicative DNA polymerases in vivo. However, recent studies suggest that certain repair polymerases, such as pol λ, may preferentially utilize Mn2+ in vitro. Here we report on the effects of Mn2+ and Mg2+ on the enzymatic properties of human DNA polymerase ι (pol ι). pol ι exhibited the greatest activity in the presence of low levels of Mn2+ (0.05–0.25 mm). Peak activity in the presence of Mg2+ was observed in the range of 0.1–0.5 mm and was significantly reduced at concentrations >2 mm. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that Mn2+ increases the catalytic activity of pol ι by ∼30–60,000-fold through a dramatic decrease in the Km value for nucleotide incorporation. Interestingly, whereas pol ι preferentially misinserts G opposite T by a factor of ∼1.4–2.5-fold over the correct base A in the presence of 0.25 and 5 mm Mg2+, respectively, the correct insertion of A is actually favored 2-fold over the misincorporation of G in the presence of 0.075 mm Mn2+. Low levels of Mn2+ also dramatically increased the ability of pol ι to traverse a variety of DNA lesions in vitro. Titration experiments revealed a strong preference of pol ι for Mn2+ even when Mg2+ is present in a >10-fold excess. Our observations therefore raise the intriguing possibility that the cation utilized by pol ι in vivo may actually be Mn2+ rather than Mg2+, as tacitly assumed. All DNA polymerases require a divalent cation for catalytic activity. It is generally assumed that Mg2+ is the physiological cofactor for replicative DNA polymerases in vivo. However, recent studies suggest that certain repair polymerases, such as pol λ, may preferentially utilize Mn2+ in vitro. Here we report on the effects of Mn2+ and Mg2+ on the enzymatic properties of human DNA polymerase ι (pol ι). pol ι exhibited the greatest activity in the presence of low levels of Mn2+ (0.05–0.25 mm). Peak activity in the presence of Mg2+ was observed in the range of 0.1–0.5 mm and was significantly reduced at concentrations >2 mm. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that Mn2+ increases the catalytic activity of pol ι by ∼30–60,000-fold through a dramatic decrease in the Km value for nucleotide incorporation. Interestingly, whereas pol ι preferentially misinserts G opposite T by a factor of ∼1.4–2.5-fold over the correct base A in the presence of 0.25 and 5 mm Mg2+, respectively, the correct insertion of A is actually favored 2-fold over the misincorporation of G in the presence of 0.075 mm Mn2+. Low levels of Mn2+ also dramatically increased the ability of pol ι to traverse a variety of DNA lesions in vitro. Titration experiments revealed a strong preference of pol ι for Mn2+ even when Mg2+ is present in a >10-fold excess. Our observations therefore raise the intriguing possibility that the cation utilized by pol ι in vivo may actually be Mn2+ rather than Mg2+, as tacitly assumed.

However, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ have the capacity to substitute for Mg2+ under certain conditions in vitro (2Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 6: 219-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 7Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A.

The effect of substituting Mg2+ with Mn2+ on the activity of A- and B-family polymerases has been widely studied (8Goodman M.F. Keener S. Guidotti S. Branscomb E.W. J. Biol.

In addition to reducing fidelity, Mn2+ also helps facilitate translesion synthesis by certain replicative polymerases, including Escherichia coli pol I (13Rabkin S.D. Moore P.D. Strauss B.S. Proc.

DNA polymerase cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide The effect of Mn2+ on X-family polymerases has also been studied. In the case of pol β, Mn2+ decreases the Km value of nucleotide incorporation by ∼30-fold (15Wang T.S. Eichler D.C. Korn D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4927-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), such that there is little regard for the instructions provided by the templating base (16Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12762-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest that the phylogenetically related pol λ may have actually evolved to utilize Mn2+ under physiological conditions, because the enzyme is active over a wide range of Mn2+ concentrations and is inhibited by high levels of Mg2+ (17Blanca G. Shevelev I. Ramadan K. Villani G. Spadari S. Hubscher U. Maga G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7467-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Maga G. Shevelev I. Villani G. Spadari S. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To date, there have been few studies on the effects of Mn2+ on the Y-family of DNA polymerases. In the single published report, Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 behaved in a similar manner to the replicative polymerases, in that 5 mm Mn2+ increased the efficiency of lesion bypass, but with a concomitant 3–4-fold decrease in the overall fidelity of the enzyme (19Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The effect of Mn2+ on other Y-family polymerases, including human DNA polymerases η, ι, and κ, is largely unknown. We were therefore very interested in determining the effects of various metal ions on the activity of the human Y-family polymerases and in particular pol ι, because its reported biochemical properties are quite unusual. Indeed, pol ι exhibits a remarkable template-dependent fidelity in vitro. When replicating template T in the presence of Mg2+, pol ι preferentially misinserts G over the correct base A by a factor of 3–10-fold (20Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R.

In contrast, when replicating template A, the enzyme is relatively accurate with misincorporations occurring in the range of 10–3–10–4 (20Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R.

Thus, the fidelity of pol ι can vary by up to 100,000-fold depending upon the template sequence being replicated. Here we report on the enzymatic properties of pol ι in vitro in the presence of various divalent cations, in particular Mg2+ and Mn2+. Enzymes—N-terminal glutathione S-transferase-tagged human pol ι was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells as described (20Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R.

Primers and Templates—All primers, undamaged templates, and the abasic site-containing template, TXT30, were synthesized by Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) and gelpurified prior to use. The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer containing template, TTA48, was synthesized and purified by Phoenix Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4)-containing template, 6-4TT30, was a kind gift from Shigenori Iwai (Osaka University). The benzo-[a]pyrene diol epoxide-containing template, BPDE29, was a kind gift from Don Jerina (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). For the experiments presented in Fig. 1, the template was T50, 5′-CGT CTA GAC GAA TTC ACG GCT CAA GCT TGC TTG CGC ATG CTC TGC AGG CG-3′, and the primer was a 22-mer that was complementary to the template nucleotides underlined.

The primer was a 16-mer that was complementary to the template nucleotides underlined. The adjacent Ts were covalently linked to form a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) in template TTA48. The experiments described in Fig. 4 utilized three lesion-containing templates. TXT30 was a 30-mer with the sequence 5′-CTC GTC AGC ATC TXC ATC ATA CAG TCA GTG-3′, where the X was a synthetic tetrahydrofuran moiety (abasic site). The primer was a 16-mer that was complementary to the template nucleotides underlined. The second template, BPDE29, was a 29-mer with the sequence 5′-GCT CGT CAG CAG ATT TAG AGT CTG CAG TG-3′, where the A has a benzo[a]pyrene adduct at its N6 position (28Frank E.G. Tissier A.

The ability of pol ι (top) and pol η (bottom) to extend a 32P-labeled 20-mer primer annealed to template “T50M13” was assayed in the presence of 50 μm of all four dNTPs and various concentrations of MnCl2 or MgCl2 ranging from 0.05 to 8 mm in 20-min reactions at 37 °C. The sequence of the template immediately downstream of the primer (Pr.) is shown on the left-hand side of each gel. The arrows indicate the location of a template T that is located 6 bp from the end of the primer terminus. In the presence of Mg2+, pol ι frequently misincorporates G opposite template T. The mispair is poorly extended compared with the correct base pair, and as a consequence a strong pause site is observed 6 bp from the primer terminus. Thus, one measurement of the overall catalytic activity of pol ι is its ability to extend beyond the normal pause site at template T. When products 7 bp and longer are plotted as a function of Mn2+ (▴) or Mg2+ (▵), it is clear that pol ι exhibits greatest activity at 0.075 mm Mn2+ and 0.25–0.5 mm Mg2+. Although pol η does not pause at template T, we used the same method to determine the optimal conditions for pol η activity.

Primer Extension Reaction—Standard replication reactions (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 nm of 5′-32P-labeled primer-template DNA, 2 nm glutathione S-transferase-pol ι, 5 nm His-pol η, or His-pol κ. Reaction times, divalent metal ions, in the form of –Cl2 salt, and dNTPs concentrations are specified in the figures and legends. After incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min and then immediately transferred on ice. The reaction products were separated by 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis and analyzed using a Fuji FLA-5100 PhosphorImager and ImageGauge software. Steady-state Kinetics—Steady-state kinetic parameters Vmax and Km, for incorporation opposite template T or A, were measured in standing-start reactions as described previously (20Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar, 27Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F.

For reactions measuring incorporation opposite template A in the presence of 0.075 mm Mn2+, we used 0.0001–0.0015 μm of dTTP and 0.0005–0.003 μm of dATP in 3-min reactions. For reactions containing 0.25 mm Mg 2+, we varied the concentration of dTTP from 0.001 to 0.015 μm and dATP from 10 to 100 μm in 2-min reactions. For reactions containing 5 mm Mg 2+, we varied the concentration of dTTP from 0.005 to 0.03 μm and dATP from 10 to 100 μm in 2.5-min reactions. In reactions where both metal ions were present (0.075 mm Mn2+/0.25 mm Mg2+), we used 0.001–0.02 μm of dTTP and 0.025–0.15 μm of dATP in 2-min reactions. To measure incorporation opposite template T, in the presence of 0.075 mm Mn2+, we varied dNTPs concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.0015 μm in 2.5-min reactions. Reactions in the presence of 0.25 mm Mg2+ contained dNTPs that ranged in concentration from 0.005 to 0.03 mm in 2.5-min reactions, whereas in assays containing 5 mm Mg2+, the dNTPs ranged from 20 to 150 μm in 2-min reactions. Reaction mixtures were subjected to 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis and analyzed using Fuji FLA-5100 PhosphorImager and ImageGauge software. Saturation plots of velocity as a function of dNTPs concentrations (in μm) were calculated as a percentage of the primer extension per min. Vmax and Km values were determined from a Hanes-Woolf plot by linear least squares fit as described (27Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F.

Effects of Various Divalent Metal Ions on the Activity of Human Y-family Polymerases—The ability of human DNA polymerases ι, η, and κ to utilize various divalent cations as activators for polymerization was assayed in replication reactions using a radiolabeled 22-mer primer annealed to a 50-mer oligonucleotide template. Each metal ion was present as the chloride salt, at a concentration of either 0.5 or 5 mm. Quite surprisingly, of the eight divalent cations assayed, only Cu2+ failed to support any catalysis. The remaining seven cations all promoted polymerization to some extent, with the degree of activation being acutely polymerase-specific (Fig. 1). As expected, robust synthesis was observed with pol η and pol κ in the presence of both 0.5 and 5 mm Mg2+. In contrast, however, the activity of pol ι was far greater in 0.5 mm Mg2+ than in 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1). All three polymerases were highly active in the presence of Mn2+ with greater activity observed in 0.5 mm Mn2+ compared with 5 mm Mn2+. Co2+ also served as an activator for all three polymerases, with pol η being the most active of the three enzymes in 0.5 mm Co2+. Similarly, pol η was more active than either pol ι or pol κ in the presence of Ca2+ or Zn2+. In contrast, pol κ exhibited much greater activity in the presence of 5 mm Cd2+ or Ni2+, compared with either pol ι or pol η. We conclude from these studies that each human Y-family polymerase possesses its own unique ability to utilize different metals as cofactors for DNA synthesis. In the case of pol η and pol κ, the preferred activator appears to be Mg2+. However, based upon the data presented in Fig. 1, pol ι either prefers low levels of Mg2+ or Mn2+ for optimal activity in vitro. Titration of Mn2+ or Mg2+ in pol ι and pol η Replication Reactions—We next determined the optimum concentration of Mg2+ or Mn2+ required to promote peak activity of pol ι or pol η by performing primer extension assays in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ranging in concentrations from 0.05 to 8 mm. The template for these assays was a 50-mer oligonucleotide that has a run of five template As followed by a T and then four additional As immediately downstream of the primer. This sequence context was chosen, as we have previously shown that in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ pol ι readily incorporates T opposite the five template As, but then frequently misinserts G opposite template T (29Vidal A.E. Kannouche P. Podust V.N. Yang W. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48360-48368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The efficiency of G (or A) insertion opposite T is much lower than that of the incorporation of T opposite A (20Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar). Further elongation from the mispair is also reduced compared with that of the correct A:T base pair (24Vaisman A. Tissier A. Frank E.G. Goodman M.F. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30615-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, there is a strong pol ι-dependent pause 5–6 bases from the starting primer terminus (Fig. 2, top, 0.1–0.5 mm Mg2+). The percentage of replication products longer than 6 bp therefore provides a reasonably accurate method of measuring the catalytic activity of pol ι. By using this approach, it is readily obvious that pol ι is very active in the presence of low levels of Mn2+ (Fig. 2, top, left-hand panel). Presumably, the ability of pol ι to overcome the kinetic block to replication when the enzyme encounters a template T reflects a change in the specificity of nucleotide (mis)insertion (see below for more detailed analysis), as well as through an increased ability to extend G:T mispairs. 3E. G. Frank and R. Woodgate, unpublished observations. The peak activity of pol ι was observed in the range of 0.05–0.2 mm Mn2+. Similarly, pol ι was also much more active in the presence of low levels of Mg2+, with peak activity occurring within the range of 0.2–0.5 mm Mg2+. Indeed, higher concentrations of Mg2+ appear to inhibit pol ι, as under these assay conditions the limiting amount of pol ι in the reaction was barely sufficient to elongate the primer by 1–2 bp (Fig. 2, right-hand panel, 8 mm Mg2+). In parallel experiments with human pol η, the enzyme was very active in the presence of 0.05–0.1 mm Mn2+, but it rapidly began to lose activity at higher concentrations and was severely inhibited in reactions containing >2 mm Mn2+. Peak activity of pol η in the presence of Mg2+ was observed in the range of 0.075–2 mm Mg2+, and similar to pol ι, the limiting amount of pol η in the reaction appeared to have somewhat reduced activity in 5–8 mm Mg2+. In an attempt to further optimize the in vitro reaction conditions for pol ι synthesis, we also performed replication assays in the presence of low Mn2+ or Mg2+ in buffers that ranged in pH from 7.5 to 9.0 and in the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl. In general, changing the pH of the assay buffer had little effect on the activity of the enzyme. In contrast, the activity of pol ι steadily decreased as the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0 to 150 mm. 3E. G. Frank and R. Woodgate, unpublished observations. Activity of pol ι and pol η on a CPD-containing Template in the Presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+—We have previously reported that in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, pol ι is capable of inserting a base opposite the 3′T of a T-T CPD, as well as facilitating low levels of complete translesion synthesis (30Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5259-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Vaisman A. Frank E.G. Iwai S. Ohashi E. Ohmori H. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to reinvestigate the ability of pol ι to facilitate translesion synthesis over a range of Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations (Fig. 3). In these reactions, the 3′ end of the primer was juxtaposed to the CPD and are therefore considered “standing start” reactions. Similar to the observations reported above, maximal activity for pol ι was observed in the range of 0.075–0.25 mm Mn2+ on the damaged template (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, there was significant extension of primers past the CPD. Indeed, we estimate that approximately 60% of the primer was elongated past the CPD by pol ι in the presence of 0.2 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 3A, right-hand panel). The results with Mg2+ were similar to our earlier published observations (30Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5259-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Vaisman A. Frank E.G. Iwai S. Ohashi E. Ohmori H. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in that the 3′T of the CPD is a strong kinetic block to pol ι and elongation past the 3′T was greatest in the range of 0.25–2 mm Mg2+. Indeed, we estimate that in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+, ∼8% of the primers are elongated past both Ts of the CPD, compared with ∼2.5% in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+,"

We recently proposed a model for binding of fibronectin to FnBPA in which the bacterial protein contains 11 potential binding sites (FnBPA-1 to FnBPA-11), each composed of motifs that bind to consecutive fibronectin type 1 modules in the N-terminal domain of fibronectin. Here we show that six of the 11 sites bind with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range; other sites bind more weakly. The high affinity binding sites include FnBPA-1, the sequence of which had previously been thought to be encompassed by the fibrinogen-binding A domain of FnBPA. Both the number and sequence conservation of the type-1 module binding motifs appears to be important for high affinity binding. The in vivo relevance of the in vitro binding studies is confirmed by the presence of antibodies in patients with S. aureus infections that specifically recognize complexes of these six high affinity repeats with fibronectin.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important bacterial pathogens to affect humans. Clinical manifestations of infection range from superficial skin infections (1Murakawa G.J.

The increasing virulence and antibiotic resistance exhibited by this major source of both community and hospital-acquired infection presents an urgent challenge. Furthering our understanding of the mechanism by which staphylococcal pathogenesis occurs is thus imperative for the development of novel therapeutic and preventative strategies. Since attachment to host tissue is a critical early step in infection, one particular group of targets for intervention is the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) 4The abbreviations used are:MSCRAMMmicrobial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix moleculesLIBSligand-induced binding sitesFnfibronectinITCisothermal titration calorimetryFnBRfibronectin-binding repeatNTDN-terminal domainFib1proteolytic fragment encompassing the N-terminal domain of fibronectinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseFgfibrinogenmAbmonoclonal antibodyFnBPfibronectin-binding proteinLBLuria-Bertani. family of surface-expressed adhesins (6Schwarz-Linek U.

These proteins exploit extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn), using them as a bridge between the bacterial cell surface and host cell receptors that effect downstream signaling (8Fowler T.

There is an emerging view that S. aureus can exist intracellularly, hijacking and invading host cells to establish persistence (16Sinha B. Herrmann M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 266-277PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, this mechanism could facilitate rapid and effective bloodstream dissemination while allowing the bacterium to evade antibiotics and host immune surveillance, an apposite theory given the prevalence of bacterial metastasis (3Ing M.B.

Fn is a large glycoprotein present in a soluble form in human plasma and other body fluids and in an insoluble form in the extracellular matrix. Its principal functions include cellular adhesion, differentiation, and tissue repair. The protein has a modular structure and is composed of type 1, type 2, and type 3 (F1, F2, and F3) modules.

S. aureus contains two principal FnBPs, FnBPA and FnBPB, each having similar organization and gene structure. Two separate analyses of clinical isolates (25Nashev D. Toshkova K. Salasia S.I.

Infect. 2000; 41: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown all to contain at least one fnbp gene, with many (37 and 77%, respectively) containing two. Furthermore, FnBPs participate in chronic and deep seated bacterial infection via adhesion to surgical implants (27Arrecubieta C. Asai T. Bayern M. Loughman A. Fitzgerald J.R. Shelton C.E. Baron H.M. Dang N.C. Deng M.C. Naka Y. Foster T.J. Lowy F.D. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antibiotic-resistant strains appear to show similar distribution levels, with 91% of methicillin-resistant samples (n = 46) in one study testing positive for both genes (28Rice K. Huesca M. Vaz D. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3791-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Common features of FnBPA and FnBPB (Fig. 1A), include a hydrophobic cell wall anchor, an LPXTG motif that has been shown to be crucial for host cell attachment (29Grundmeier M. Hussain M. Becker P. Heilmann C. Peters G. Sinha B. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 7155-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and an unstructured region with Fn binding activity. FnBPA also possesses fibrinogen (Fg) (30Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and tropoelastin (31Keane F.M. Clarke A.W. Foster T.J. Weiss A.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7226-7232Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) binding capacity, mediated by the N-terminal A domain region. In both FnBPA and FnBPB, this region also binds elastin (32Roche F.M. Downer R. Keane F. Speziale P. Park P.W. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38433-38440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In FnBPA, the Fn binding activity was initially identified in a stretch of repetitive sequence in the C-terminal “D-region” (18Signäs C. Raucci G. Jonsson K. Lindgren P.E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). More recently, we have proposed a Fn-binding repeat (FnBR) classification based on structural data for a complex between two F1 modules of Fn and a peptide from a streptococcal FnBP (33Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Upon binding, the bacterial peptide forms a β-strand that aligns antiparallel to an existing sheet in each of the Fn F1 modules. In this β-zipper model, sequential F1 modules in the NTD of human Fn (Fig. 1B) engage specific motifs in an FnBR. Thus, the mosaic structure of the NTD (Fig. 1B) is mirrored within each FnBR. The mechanism of interaction requires that bacterial F1-binding motifs be presented to the NTD in the same sequence as the F1 modules in order for high affinity binding to occur. This new classification extends the number of potential Fn-binding sites in FnBPA to 11. The main aim of this work is to address three key aspects of the FnBPA-Fn interaction that are predicted by the new classification of FnBRs. First, using a variety of assays, we demonstrate Fn binding for nine of the 11 repeats defined by our model. Second, we show that high affinity sites for Fn occur outside the traditionally defined D-region. Third, we show that a specific order and composition of bacterial F1-binding motifs appears to be required for high affinity interactions of FnBRs with Fn. In addition, it is shown that although isolated FnBRs are recognized weakly by antibodies, upon complexation with Fn, ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes are formed that are recognized by both monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and by sera from patients with staphylococcal infections. Collectively, these results strongly support both the idea that S. aureus engages Fn through a tandem β-zipper mechanism and the reclassification of FnBR boundaries. Escherichia coli strain BL21 was used as a host, and pGEX-2T, pGEX-5X, or pGEX-6P2 (GE Healthcare) was used as vector for cloning and expressing recombinant FnBRs from FnBPA. S. aureus strain Newman was obtained from Prof. T. J. Foster (Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland). E. coli strains were grown in LB broth or on LB agar at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotics. Staphylococci were grown in brain heart infusion (Difco) broth or on brain heart infusion agar at 37 °C overnight with constant shaking. DNA preparation, purification, restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligation were performed using standard methods (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or following the manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise stated. All enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Routine preparation of E. coli competent cells and transformation of DNA into E. coli were performed by a one-step procedure (35Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). S. aureus genomic DNA, isolated as previously described (36Lofdahl S. Guss B. Uhlen M. Philipson L. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was used as template for all PCR reactions except those amplifying DNA for constructs of FnBPA-4 and FnBPA-5 used in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (supplemental Table 1). In this case, a pQE vector (Qiagen) encoding full-length FnBPA was used as template. In all cases, oligonucleotide primers were designed to encode BamHI (5′-end) and EcoRI site (3′-end) restriction sites (supplemental Table 1). PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, purified, and ligated to BamHI- and EcoRI-digested and dephosphorylated pGEX-2T (for cloning of FnBPA-1 and -11), pGEX-5X (for cloning of FnBPA-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10), and pGEX-6P2 (for cloning of FnBPA-4 and FnBPA-5 constructs used in ITC) (supplemental Table 1). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli BL21, and the cells were incubated on LB agar plates (100 μg/ml ampicillin) (Sigma) at 37 °C to select for transformants. Insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FnBRs were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. E. coli BL21 transformed with a particular pGEX-FnBR construct was selected on LB agar (100 μg/ml ampicillin). An overnight culture of transformant was diluted 1:100 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C, with shaking (225 rpm), until A600 nm reached 0.5-0.6. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (Melford Laboratories) to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by passage through a French press. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g), and filtered supernatant (0.45-μm membrane) was applied to a 5-ml glutathione-Sepharose-4B® column (GE Healthcare). Fusion protein was eluted with five column volumes of 10 mm reduced glutathione GSH (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For solid phase binding studies, fractions corresponding to each recombinant protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.0 mm Na2PO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). A single band of the expected molecular weight was observed for each of the different FnBR GST fusions on SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm or using a BCA (bicinchonic acid) protein assay kit (Pierce). For ITC, GST fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin (pGEX-2T series; Sigma), Factor Xa (New England Biolabs; pGEX-5X series), or 3C proteases (pGEX-6P series; GE Healthcare). After enzymatic cleavage, the residues GS, GIP, and GPLGS, respectively, were retained at the N terminus of the FnBR. FnBRs further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as previously described (37Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were subsequently lyophilized, and molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. Concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm by weighing freeze-dried material or from amino acid analysis. Human Fn was prepared as previously reported (38Vuento M. Vaheri A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For solid-phase binding studies, the N-terminal Fn fragment (Fib1) was isolated using the procedure described by Zardi et al. (39Zardi L. Carnemolla B. Balza E. Borsi L. Castellani P. Rocco M. Siri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas for ITC, Fib1 was obtained commercially (Sigma). Peptides D1, D2, and D3 were synthesized and purified as previously described (40McGavin M.J. Gurusiddappa S. Lindgren P.E. Lindberg M. Raucci G. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23946-23953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs directed toward full-length FnBPA or recombinant GST-D1-D3 were raised as previously described (41Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12803) Google Scholar, 42Visai L. De Rossi E. Valtulina V. Casolini F. Rindi S. Guglierame P. Pietrocola G. Bellotti V. Riccardi G. Speziale P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Full-length FnBPA was purified from S. aureus Newman as described previously (43Froman G. Switalski L.M. Speziale P. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6564-6571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEXD1-3, for expression in E. coli of the GST fusion protein GST-D1-D3, has been described elsewhere (44Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isotyping of the mAbs was performed using a Mouse-Typer sub-isotyping kit (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Four clones producing mAbs to full-length FnBPA (1F9 (IgG2b-k), 5G3 (IgG1-k), and 6B7 (IgG2b-k)) or D1-D3 (7D4 (IgG1-k)) were subcloned and grown to high cell density. The antibodies were purified by using ammonium sulfate precipitation of the supernatant, followed by affinity chromatography on Protein A/G-Sepharose columns according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). No cross-reactivity of the produced mAbs toward Fn or Fn fragments was observed either in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot. An anti-GST mAb 10G7 (IgG1-k) was produced by immunization of mice with the purified GST as described above. Mouse anti-Fib1 mAb 843 was kindly provided by L. Zardi (Cell Biology Laboratory, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy). Anti-human Fn polyclonal antibody was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with a purified preparation of human Fn. Fn and Fib1 Binding to FnBRs of FnBPA—Microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 5 μg/ml FnBPA-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -11 in fusion with GST or with GST alone in coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.5). After washing with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), the wells were blocked for 1 h at 22 °C with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA. Subsequently, 100 μl of either Fn (5.25 μg/ml) or Fib1 (0.75 μg/ml) was added to the wells before incubation at 22 °C (1 h). Wells were washed with PBST and incubated with 100 μl of rabbit anti-human Fn polyclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) or mouse anti-Fib1 mAb 843 (10 μg/ml) for 90 min at 22 °C. Binding of anti-Fn or anti-Fib1 antibodies to the wells was detected by incubating the plates with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), respectively, for 1 h at 22 °C. The binding of the secondary antibody was quantified by adding the substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and measuring the resulting absorbance at 490 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The coating efficiency with each FnBR-GST was verified by incubating the wells with an anti-GST mouse mAb 10G7; in the assay conditions used, all of the recombinant FnBRs showed very similar reactivity with the anti-GST antibody. The saturability of the binding was determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by incubating the FnBR-coated wells with increasing concentrations (0-120 nm) of Fib1 and with spectrophotometric detection of Fib1 as described above. Binding of mAbs to FnBRs—Microtiter wells coated with each of the 11 FnBRs of FnBPA (5 μg/ml) were preincubated with PBS alone or with Fn (5.25 μg/ml) or Fib1 (0.75 μg/ml) in PBS. After washing with PBST, 100 μl of the mAbs 1F9, 5G3, 6B7, or 7D4 (2.5 μg/ml) was added to the wells before incubation at 22 °C for 1 h. Bound mAb was detected by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody 7E11 produced against FnbB (42Visai L. De Rossi E. Valtulina V. Casolini F. Rindi S. Guglierame P. Pietrocola G. Bellotti V. Riccardi G. Speziale P. Biochim. Biophys.

Identification of LIBS Antibodies in Human Sera of Patients with Staphylococcal Infections—Serum antibodies from patients with staphylococcal endocarditis were purified as previously described (45Rindi S.

Diagnosis of infection was made on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data, and the clinical characteristics of the patients used in this study are reported in supplemental Table 2. To assess the binding of purified IgG (from patient serum) to the 11 FnBRs of FnBPA, microtiter wells were coated with the individual repeats (5 μg/ml) and then incubated without or with Fn (20 μg/ml) for 90 min at 22 °C. After washing, 1 μg of each antibody preparation was added to the wells. Bound antibody was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibodies (1:2000 dilution; Dako Cytomation). IgG from healthy donors was used as a control. To exclude the possibility that patient IgG could react with Fn alone, microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of human Fn and then tested with 1 μg of each antibody preparation. Under these conditions, no reactivity of antibodies to Fn was detected. Calorimetry experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). In a typical experiment, the calorimeter cell contained 1.4 ml of Fib1, and the syringe contained 295 μl of concentrated FnBR (Table 1). The concentration of protein in the syringe was typically 10-15 times that in the cell, whereas the cell concentration was chosen according to a predicted c value of 100-1000, where c = [macromolecule]/(predicted) KD (46Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in PBS, pH 7.4. Both cell and syringe solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm membranes and degassed at 20 °C for 10 min before use.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of Fib1 with FnBRs from FnBPAFnBPA residuesPotential interaction motifs (in order, from N terminus)[Fib1][FnBR]ΔHΔSKDnμmμmkcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1nmFnBPA-1512-5505F1-4F1-3F1-2F14.551−26.0−49.14.8 ± 0.60.84FnBPA-4610-6364F1-3F1-2F14.848−28.9−60.410.5 ± 0.90.37FnBPA-5637-6725F1-4F1-3F1-2F15.060−17.0−23.444.2 ± 9.70.91FnBPA-8733-7624F1-3F1-2F14.750−19.5−40.0∼3000aThe shape of the curve precludes a reliable fit to these data.0.76FnBPA-9763-8005F1-4F1-3F1-2F14.836−28.0−56.77.3 ± 0.40.99FnBPA-10801-8385F1-4F1-3F1-2F15.348−24.4−46.519.5 ± 1.10.98FnBPA-11839-8745F1-4F1-3F1-2F15.879−28.4NF<1.0bThe steepness of the binding isotherm transition precludes a reliable fit of these data.

A single preliminary injection of 2 μl of FnBR solution was followed by 20-40 injections (5-7 μl), delivered at an injection speed of 0.5 μls-1. Injections were spaced over 4-5-min intervals at a stirring speed of 310 rpm. For all titrations, other than those involving D1 and D2, the shape of the binding isotherm allowed heats of dilution to be assessed by continuing peptide injections beyond saturation and obtaining an average value over several post-transition injection points. The averaged heat of dilution was then subtracted from the main experiment. For FnBPA-8, D1, and D2 a separate heat of dilution control experiment where equivalent volumes of peptide were injected into buffer was performed. This ruled out the possibility of large heats of dilution masking weak binding. Raw titration data were integrated and fit to a one-site model of binding using MicroCal Origin version 7.0.

Previously, we suggested that FnBPA in fact contains 11 contiguous FnBRs and that these would bind Fn with varying affinities largely dependent on the number of proposed F1 module binding motifs in the FnBR and on the presence of conserved residues. Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of predicted FnBRs from S. aureus FnBPA, based on our tandem β-zipper model for binding to Fn (33Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H.

The sequence alignment suggests that the FnBRs FnBPA-1, -5, -6, -9, -10, and -11 contain motifs that will bind four sequential modules (2-5F1) in the NTD of Fn. FnBPA-2, -3, -4, and -8, lack the putative 5F1-binding motif, so they are only predicted to bind three F1 modules (2-4F1) and therefore might be expected to bind with lower affinity.

The recent identification of the TRPV2 channel protein in an early endosomal fraction (1Wainszelbaum M.J. Proctor B.M. Pountow S.E. Stahl P.D. Barbieri A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has raised the possibility of characterizing the physiological roles of the TRP-like channel in the native environment of the endosome membrane. To achieve this goal, it would be necessary to apply the patch clamp technique directly to endosome membranes. Past attempts at such studies have been unsuccessful, mainly because of the submicron size of endosomes. We have been able to increase the size of the endosome membrane by introducing a hydrolysis-deficient mutant of SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) into HEK293 cells. Overexpression of SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q), which disrupts endosome trafficking (2Fujita H. Yamanaka M. Imamura K. Tanaka Y. Nara A. Yoshimori T. Yokota S. Himeno M. J.

Using these enlarged EE, we have made the first patch clamp recordings of a novel endosome calcium channel (ECC). This ECC was sensitive to >500 μm La3+ inhibition as reported in other TRP family channels, but was activated by 100 μm La3+ and by 200 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), whereas being insensitive to TRPV1 activator capsaicin.

GFP-tagged SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q)-expressing cells were used to demonstrate co-localization of GFP-SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) with endocytosed rhodamine sulfate. c-myc-SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q)-expressing cells were used to show Lysotracker Green negative staining in the rhodamine sulfate containing enlarged endosomes and were also used in patch clamp experiments. Enlarged endosomes of sizes from 3-6 μm were visually identified and dissected manually with a glass electrode. Under the phase contrast microscope, enlarged endosomes were viewed as phase-bright (see Fig. 1C, circled). To facilitate slicing of the plasma membrane with an electrode, cells with enlarged endosomes, closer to the edge of cells, were used because cell thickness increased toward the center. The electrode was pressed against the cell vertically and then was quickly pulled away from the cell to slice the cell membrane. Plating the cells on poly-l-lysine-treated cover glass prevented the cells from detaching from the cover glass. Multiple attempts (2-3 times) were required to free the enlarged endosomes from the cell. When successful, enlarged endosomes were seen as phase-dark spheres. Isolation was successful for 20-30% of attempts. Compared with cell membrane blebs, the surface of isolated enlarged endosomes looked slightly rough as if the surrounding structures such as actin filaments were still connected. The cell membrane blebs were usually bigger than enlarged endosomes, and their surface looked smooth. The patch pipette resistance was 5-6 megOhms. Following giga seal (>5 Gohm) formation, ion channel activities were examined in inside-out configurations. The whole endosome capacitance was 298.06 ± 149.03 femtofarad (n = 4), which corresponds to an EE diameter of 3-6 μm, if the lipid unit membrane capacitance is assumed to be 1 microfarad/cm2.An Ag/AgCl agar bridge was used as a ground electrode. The Ag/AgCl agar bridge eliminated a junction potential caused by varying Cl- in the bath solution. The solutions used were (in mm) a pipette solution (KCl 30, K2SO4 60, MgCl2 0.1, EGTA 0.5, HEPES 10, pH 7.20); a Na+-based solution (NaCl 145, KCl 5, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, pH 7.2); a K+-based solution (KCl 150, MgCl2 0.1, HEPES 10, pH 7.2); and a K+-based low Cl- solution (KCl 30, K2SO4 60, MgCl2 0.1, HEPES 10, pH 7.2). For the chloride effects, [Cl-] was varied by mixing KCl 150 and K2SO4 75 in different ratios. Patch clamp data were analyzed with the Clampfit program (Axon Instruments), OriginPro 7 (OriginLab), and Sigmaplot 9.0 (Systat Software Inc.). The data were filtered with a low pass filter at 1 kHz for analysis and at 200 Hz for display. Single channel data were analyzed by plotting all point histograms. When multiple channel activities were observed, the mean of the channel amplitudes was plotted against the applied voltages. RT-PCR was carried out using HEK293 total RNA. The RNAs were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT). The PCR reaction was done using a sense primer (TGCTGACGGGCCACATCCTTATCC) and nested antisense primers (First, AAGCCCAGTTCACCTCCTCCAC; second, GCCCCGTTGCCCTCGTCCTC). The hTRPV2 cDNA was used as a positive control. The PCR result was analyzed using 1% agarose gel, and the DNAs were visualized with ethidium.

Cell Sci. 2004; 118: 917-928Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar) suggests that the ECC could be a TRP-like channel. Newly formed EE membranes are exposed to two distinct environments. One environment is the EE lumen, which contains an endocytosed extracellular high Cl- and high Ca2+ solution, and the other is the cytosolic environment, which contains low Cl- and low Ca2+. The difference in ionic compositions between the two leads to a time-dependent release of Cl- and Ca2+ ions from the EE (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ClC type Cl- channels (i.e. ClC-5) are reported to regulate the Cl- movement. They are localized in the EE, and a disruption of the ClC-5 gene causes a dramatic slowing of endocytosis and reduced endosome acidification (17Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Jentsch T.J. Maritzen T. Zdebik A.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no study has been reported describing the existence and/or the characteristics of an endosome Ca2+ channel. To explore such a possibility, a patch clamp study of the native EE membrane is essential; however, the submicron size of and thus lack of direct access to the EE membrane have previously prevented such an approach. We have overcome this difficulty by generating enlarged EE (∼3-6 μm in diameter) with the help of a hydrolysis-deficient SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) (2Fujita H. Yamanaka M. Imamura K. Tanaka Y. Nara A. Yoshimori T. Yokota S. Himeno M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells (3Lin Y. Kimpler L.A. Naismith T.V. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12799-12809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The SKD1/VPS4B AAA + ATPase regulates membrane trafficking at the early endosome junction between lysosomes and recycling endosomes (2Fujita H. Yamanaka M. Imamura K. Tanaka Y. Nara A. Yoshimori T.

HEK293 cells expressing SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) formed enlarged EE vacuoles, which were visible under a phase contrast microscope (Fig. 1C). When the cells were incubated with media containing rhodamine sulfate (Rhod), these enlarged EE accumulated the Rhod (Fig. 1A). This suggests that newly formed primary endosomes continue to fuse to the enlarged EE even after expression of SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q). These Rhod containing enlarged EE were not stained by the acidotrophic dye, Lysotracker Green, even after 40 min of incubation with the Rhod containing solution (Fig. 1B). Some Rhod containing endosomes escaped the SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) effect and matured to become lysosomes (stained by Lysotracker Green, Fig. 1B, circled). This suggests that SKD1/VPS4B (E235Q) inhibits the maturation of enlarged EE, and thus the enlarged EE do not acquire lysosome-like acidity. From these results we concluded that these visible large vacuoles represent EE. We then developed a procedure to manually isolate the Rhod containing enlarged EE using a glass pipette (see Fig. 1C). This allowed us to use them for patch clamp studies. Endosome Cation Channel—The enlarged EE were electrically quiet in the on-endosome and inside-out excised patch clamp configuration. Reports describing changes in the EE luminal Cl- and Ca2+ concentrations show that i) within 60 s of EE formation, luminal Cl- is released to the cytosol (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); and ii) a slow loss of luminal Ca2+ to the cytosol follows (16Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For that reason, we explored whether a reduction in [Cl-]lum might affect ECC activity. By reducing chloride concentrations in the bath from 150 to 30 mm, a physiological change in [Cl-]lum was simulated using inside-out EE patches that exposed their luminal surface to bath solution. As we predicted, reducing the bath [Cl-] to 30 mm induced the activation of the ECC (Fig. 2, A and B; 7 out of 8 patches). This Cl--dependent current was inhibited by a common TRP channel blocker, La3+ (n = 6; 0.5-1 mm La3+ inhibited the current to 22 ± 13.3%; Fig. 2, A and B; see also Fig. 3, A and B). To determine the ion selectivity of this channel, ion substitution experiments were carried out. Replacing luminal Na+ with K+ did not shift the reversal potential (Erev); however, replacing K+ with an impermeant cation, NMDG+, resulted in a leftward shift of the Erev, suggesting that this endosome channel was a non-selective cation channel (Fig. 2, C and D). In symmetrical K+ (150 mm) solutions, this channel had a conductance of 50-60 picosiemens (n = 8).FIGURE 3The ECC is a Ca2+ permeable channel. A, in symmetrical K+ (150 mm), ECC current was induced by lowering the bath [Cl-] to 30 mm (left). Replacing K+ with Ca2+ in the bath resulted in a Ca2+ carrying inward current (middle). Both the Ca2+ inward current and the K+ outward current were blocked by 1.5 mm La3+ (right). Current traces were recorded at -20, 0, and 20 mV. Broken lines indicate no current level (0 pA). The reversal potential was shifted leftward when Ca2+ was present (Ca2+/K+ = 1.9). B, I-V plot showing low [Cl-] activated ECC (filled circles), K+/Ca2+ = pipette/bath condition (open triangles), and inhibition by 1.5 mm La3+ (filled squares). C, acidic pH activates ECC. ECC responses to voltages from -20 to 20 mV in 10 mV steps are shown. ECC is activated progressively as pH is reduced from 7 to 6 and then to 5.4. D, I-V plot of control and acid pH-activated ECC (pH 7, filled circles;pH6, open circles; pH 5.4, filled squares). E, effects of acidic pH and of low Cl- on the ECC single channel current. In the control solution (150 mm KCl, neutral pH), the ECC activity was rarely seen (Po = 0.06, top trace). Low Cl- and pH 6 increased Po to 0.49 (second trace). Changing the solution to restore the original Cl- concentration, whereas keeping the pH low, resulted in reduced ECC activity (Po = 0.33, third trace). On returning to neutral pH, the ECC current was further inhibited (Po = 0.19, bottom trace). F, all point amplitude histograms of corresponding traces in E. The histograms consist of two Gaussian distributions.

The results were subjected to a Hill Plot analysis (Fig. 2G). The K50 for ECC chloride dependence was found to be 82 mm. The Early Endosome Cation Channel Is Ca2+ Permeable—To demonstrate whether this endosome channel was a Ca2+ channel, Ca2+ permeability was examined. The Erev shifted from 0 mV (150 mm symmetrical K+; n = 8) to -10 + 2 mV, when K+ was replaced with Ca2+ in the bath solution (150 mm K+ pipette/150 mm Ca2+ bath; n = 3). A Ca2+ carrying inward current was clearly seen and was reversibly inhibited by 1.5 mm La3+ (Fig. 3, A and B). From the difference in Erev, the relative calcium permeability (PCa) was determined to be PCa/PK = 1.9 (20Fat P. Ginsborg B.L. J. Physiol.

In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, C and D, ECC activity was enhanced 2-3-fold (n = 3) when the luminal surface of EE excised patch membranes was exposed to pH 5.4 and 6 (the intact EE pH is reported to be 6.2 (8Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 9Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar)). Having demonstrated that ECC activity is regulated by both Cl- concentration and pH separately, we next examined how the two together would affect ECC single channel currents (Fig. 3, E and F). Under control conditions (150 mm KCl, neutral pH), ECC activity was rarely seen (open probability, Po = 0.06). Following a change to low Cl- and pH 6 conditions, the single channel current was activated and Po increased to 0.49. Changing the solution to restore Cl- concentration, whereas keeping the pH low, resulted in reduced ECC activity (Po = 0.33). This confirmed that ECC could be activated by lower pH independently of activation by Cl- reduction. Finally, upon returning to neutral pH conditions, the ECC channel current was further inhibited (Po = 0.19). ECC and TRP Channel Pharmacology—Because TRP family channels (22Clapham D.E. Julius D. Montell C. Schultz G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 427-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), i.e. growth factor regulated calcium channel (TRPV-2) (13Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), PKD2 (4Gonzalez-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L.

Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A. Chasan B. Goldmann W.H. Stahl S. Cooney A. Goldin E. Cantiello H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are found in intracellular membranes, known TRP inhibitors such as ruthenium red (RuR), amiloride, and La3+ were tested for their ability to affect ECC activity. Inhibition of ECC by 0.5-1 mm La3+ are shown in Figs. 2A and 3A (n = 6). Amiloride (∼1 mm) reversibly inhibited ECC activity (50-80% maximum inhibition; Fig. 4, A-C). RuR also reversibly inhibited ECC (70% inhibition with 40 μm) (Fig. 4, D and E). We noticed that the ECC current was potentiated upon application of a low concentration of La3+. Because addition of 100 μm La3+ has previously been shown to potentiate the TRPC5 current (23Jung S. Muhle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the possibility that 100 μm La3+ could act as an ECC activator was examined (Fig. 4, F and G). Before the addition of La3+, ECC activities were relatively quiet and were only induced at negative voltages (Fig. 4F, left). The addition of 100 μm La3+ resulted in the induction of ECC currents. The effect was clearly evident at positive voltages (n = 3; Fig. 4, F (right) and H). Macroscopic ECC currents were also potentiated by 1.5-fold with 100 μm La3+ (3 out of 5 experiments). To pharmacologically evaluate the identity of ECC, the effect of 2-APB, a specific activator of TRPV1-3 channels (24Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Jisen T. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), was examined. Addition of 200 μm 2-APB further potentiated, by more than 2-fold, ECC currents that had been previously activated by 100 μm La3+ (n = 2; Fig. 4, H and I). The TRPV1-specific activator capsaicin had no effect in concentrations, as high as 5 μm (n = 3) on ECC currents, which still could be activated by 100 μm La3+ (not shown). TRPV2 Presence in HEK293 Cells—Because the pharmacological characteristics of ECC are closer to those of TRPV2, than those of other known TRP channels (see discussion below), we wanted to know whether TRPV2 was expressed in HEK293 cells. This was examined by RT-PCR of HEK293 total RNA. Primers specific to hTRPV2 detected a signal from transcribed HEK293 total RNA that was identical in size to the control product made from hTRPV2 cDNA (Fig. 4J). Importance of ECC in Endocytosis—Within 60 s of endocytosis the EE [Cl-]lum is reduced to ∼20 mm (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This reduction in the EE [Cl-]lum is likely to be a consequence of the activation of voltage-dependent Cl- channels (25Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) in the EE membranes (i.e. ClC-5). Negatively charged membrane proteins, which have no effect on a large volume in the extracellular space, can readily affect charge distributions in small primary endosomes (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These negative charges, which create a Donnan potential in the endosome lumen (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), not only become a driving force for Cl- to exit the endosomes but also affect the direction of the voltage gradient through the membrane. The plasma membrane separates extracellular space (0 mV) from cytosolic space (negative resting membrane potential). After endocytosis, this plasma membrane becomes an endosome membrane and separates the more negatively charged endosomal luminal space from the cytosol (see above and also Fig. 5I). Consequently the charge gradient through the membrane reverses during the endocytosis. Cl- channels in the endosome membrane sense this reversed voltage gradient as an activation stimulus. Masking these negative charges with acidic pH or poly-l-lysine treatment prevented [Cl-]lum reduction (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Donnan potential could be the cause of chloride channel activation prior to [Cl-]lum reduction. This charge-masking treatment also inhibited acidification of endosomes (15Sonawane N.D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Significantly reduced endosome acidification and a dramatic slowing of endocytosis were also observed when the ClC-5 endosome chloride channel gene was disrupted (17Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Jentsch T.J. Maritzen T. Zdebik A.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Gerasimenko et al. (16Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) have reported that the luminal-free [Ca2+] falls in acidifying endosomes. Low extracellular Ca2+ (200 μm) significantly inhibited the acidification of endosomes without affecting endocytosis (16Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which suggests that acidification of endosomes is also dependent on the efflux of Ca2+ from endosomes. Thus it appears that without a reduction (or efflux) of luminal Cl- and Ca2+, the endosomes do not acidify. Acidification, vesicle fusion, and endosome maturation are closely related (8Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 9Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Because primary endosomes fuse to early endosomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, if one assumes that this Ca2+ efflux from the primary endosomes is responsible for the endosome fusion, then the role of the low Cl- and pH-activated ECC in mediating Ca2+ release becomes significant (Fig. 5). One interpretation of this data is that local Ca2+ release through ECC controls endosome fusion and maturation. Reports describing the importance of EE luminal calcium (10Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Yan Q. Sun W. McNew J.A. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and intravesicular calcium release (26Mills I.G. Urbé S. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in EE fusion support this notion. Is ECC the TRPV2 Channel?—TRPV2 was so far the only cation channel protein that was detected in the proteomics study of the rab5 positive early endosomal fraction suggesting its relative abundance in early endosomes. Our RT-PCR experiment detected TRPV2 message in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4J); therefore it is possible that TRPV2 may be responsible for the ECC current. ECC was inhibited by ∼500 μm to 1 mm La3+, RuR, and amiloride (as are other TRP channels) and was potentiated by acidic pH, 100 μm La3+, and 200 μm 2-APB. TRPV2 was shown to form a heteromultimer with TRPV1 and/or TRPV3 (14Hellwig N. Albrecht N. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 118: 917-928Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). All three TRPV1-3 are potentiated by 2-APB (24Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Jisen T. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of ECC to capsaicin, a specific TRPV1 activator, eliminates the possibility of TRPV1 involvement in the ECC current. The concentration used for 2-APB was higher than the reported EC50 for both TRPV2 and TRPV3; thus we cannot rule out the involvement of TRPV3. However, the reported biophysical properties of TRPV3 (22Clapham D.E. Julius D. Montell C. Schultz G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 427-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) are very different from those of TRPV2. The conductance of TRPV3 (170 picosiemens) is approximately twice as high as that of ECC (50-60 picosiemens), and the Ca2+ selectivity of TRPV3 (PNa/PCa =∼10) is far larger than that of ECC (PCa/PK = 1.9). Approximately TRPV4-6 are not likely to be the ECC because they are insenitive to 2-APB (24Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Jisen T. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). TRPM6 is another TRP channel that is activated by 2-APB in the μm range (27Li M. Jiang J. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, it is not likely that TRPV2 will form a heteromultimeric channel complex with the structurally distant TRPVM6. There are no reports of potentiation of TRPV channels by 100 μm La3+, but it has been seen in TRPC4 and TRPC5 (24Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Jisen T. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Similar to ECC, 100 μm La3+ potentiates TRPC4 and TRPC5, but millimolar concentration of La3+ inhibits them. Finally the relative Ca2+ permeability of the ECC to K+ or Na+ (PCa/PK = 1.9) was slightly smaller but comparable with that of TRPV2 (PCa/PNa = 2.94) (28Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). The pharmacological similarity between the ECC and the TRPV2, together with the proteomics study (1Wainszelbaum M.J. Proctor B.M. Pountow S.E. Stahl P.D. Barbieri A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggests that the ECC is likely a product of the TRPV2 channel or a closely related TRP gene family channel. In conclusion, the successful patch clamp analysis of genetically enlarged endosomes revealed a novel endosome calcium channel. This approach allows us to examine ion channels in the native membrane environment leading to a better understanding of their physiological role in whole endosome function. We thank Drs. C. Lingle, W. Pearson, L. Salkoff, and A. Wei for helpful discussions and Ms. A. Butler and S. Saito for editing the manuscript."

However, sequence information alone does not allow us to identify candidates for bioactive peptides. To increase an opportunity to discover bioactive peptides, we have focused on C-terminal amidation, a post-translational modification shared by many bioactive peptides. We analyzed peptides secreted from human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells that produce amidated peptides, and we identified two novel amidated peptides, designated neuroendocrine regulatory peptide (NERP)-1 and NERP-2. NERPs are derived from distinct regions of the neurosecretory protein that was originally identified as a product of a nerve growth factor-responsive gene in PC12 cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitate using specific antibodies as well as reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay analysis of brain extract demonstrated the endogenous presence of NERP-1 and NERP-2 in the rat. NERPs are abundant in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the rat hypothalamus and colocalized frequently with vasopressin but rarely with oxytocin. NERPs dose-dependently suppressed vasopressin release induced by intracerebroventricular injection of hypertonic NaCl or angiotensin II in vivo. NERPs also suppressed basal and angiotensin II-induced vasopressin secretion from hypothalamic explants in vitro. Bioactivity of NERPs required C-terminal amidation. Anti-NERP IgGs canceled plasma vasopressin reduction in response to water loading, indicating that NERPs could be potent endogenous suppressors of vasopressin release. These findings suggest that NERPs are novel modulators in body fluid homeostasis. Recent advances in peptidomics have enabled the identification of previously uncharacterized peptides.

These findings suggest that NERPs are novel modulators in body fluid homeostasis. Peptide hormones or neuropeptides function as cell-to-cell signaling molecules to mediate a variety of physiological phenomena. These bioactive peptides are cleaved from precursor proteins via limited cleavage and often undergo post-translational modifications to perform their functions (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Technological advancement in mass spectrometry, along with an ever increasing number of genomes being sequenced, has made it possible to study the peptidome or a whole set of endogenously processed peptides. In fact, peptidomic approaches have been applied to the analysis of peptides found in mammalian tissues or body fluids, leading to the description of a number of previously uncharacterized peptides (2Schrader M. Schulz-Knappe P. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: S55-S60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Clynen E. Baggerman G. Veelaert D. Cerstiaens A. van der Horst D. Harthoorn L. Derua R.

Chromatogr. B. 2003; 792: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In mammalian peptidomic studies, however, most peptides identified are fragments of intracellular proteins. Even in the studies designed to identify pituitary and hypothalamic peptides using specific sample preparation methods (5Svensson M. Skold K. Svenningsson P. Andren P.E. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Che F.Y. Vathy I. Fricker L.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2006; 28: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the peptides identified have turned out to be N-terminally or C-terminally deleted or extended fragments of relatively abundant precursors of known peptide hormones or secretory proteins. This is because mass spectrometry schemes detect only abundant molecules or easily ionized molecules, although tandem mass spectrometry has the potential to efficiently identify peptides present in complex mixtures. Thus, candidates for novel bioactive peptides present in trace amounts remain elusive in peptidomic identification studies. Another critical issue in peptidomics is that we cannot infer biological activity just from the sequence of a target peptide; it is practically impossible to synthesize and test all the peptidomic-identified peptides for assessing bioactivity.We thought that one solution to increase the probability of identifying potentially bioactive peptides is to focus on secretory peptides with a post-translational modification characteristic of bioactive peptides. In this study, we targeted C-terminal amidation, which is shared by many known bioactive peptides or peptide hormones (7Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). By analyzing peptides released by a human cell line of endocrine origin, we discovered two C-terminally amidated peptides derived from the neurosecretory protein VGF (8Levi A. Eldridge J.D. Paterson B.M. Science. 1985; 229: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although VGF has long been considered a precursor of bioactive peptides, functional studies are limited to C-terminal peptides as yet (9Levi A. Ferri G.L. Watson E. Possenti R. Salton S.R. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 24: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Bartolomucci A. La Corte G. Possenti R. Locatelli V. Rigamonti A.E. Torsello A. Bresciani E. Bulgarelli I. Rizzi R.

S. A. 2006; 103: 14584-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Biological functions of other VGF-related peptides, identified by recent peptidomic studies, have not been investigated (11Yuan X. Desiderio D.M. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2005; 40: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Lim J. Berezniuk I. Che F.Y. Parikh R. Biswas R. Pan H. Fricker L.D. J. Neurochem. 2006; 4: 1169-1181Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To get a clue for identifying their biological functions, we prepared antisera against these peptides and performed immunohistochemical studies to identify peptide-producing tissues and cells in the rat. We took advantage of the well documented findings on the localization and production sites of peptide hormones and deduced the possible biological functions of candidate peptides in relation to these known peptide hormones. This study would provide a new approach to the peptidomics-aided discovery of mammalian bioactive peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMass Spectrometric Analysis—The supernatant of human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells (13Gkonos P.J.

The resultant eluate was applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex Peptide PE7.5/300, GE Healthcare) to obtain peptide-rich fractions.

Purity of the peptides was confirmed on separate HPLC systems. Synthetic rat NERPs were used in all the in vivo and in vitro administration experiments.Antibody Preparation and Radioimmunoassay (RIA)—A C-terminal octapeptide common to human and rat NERP-1 (QGLAQVEA-NH2) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) by the glutaraldehyde method. Cysteinyl C-terminal decapeptides of rat NERP-2 (CQGGARQRDLG-NH2) and human NERP-2 (CQGGARQRGLG-NH2) were each coupled with maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) through its thiol groups. Rabbits were immunized with each conjugate emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Radioimmunoassay was carried out as reported (16Katafuchi T. Kikumoto K. Hamano K. Kangawa K.

A half-maximum inhibition concentration of ligand binding in each RIA was 20 fmol/tube (human and rat NERP-1), 10 fmol/tube (rat NERP-2), or 20 fmol/tube (human NERP-2).

Vasopressin, neuromedin U, neurokinin A, calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide, adrenomedullin, proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20-amino acid peptide, peptide histidine isoleucine, corticotropin-releasing factor, angiotensin II, leucine-enkephalin, and methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu.Immunological Detection of NERPs—Rat hypothalamus was extracted and condensed with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge as described previously (17Mondal M.S. Nakazato M. Date Y. Murakami N. Yanagisawa M. Matsukura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An aliquot of cartridge eluate was examined by RIA to quantify each NERP. The remaining portion was separated by RP-HPLC and assessed by RIA to identify individual immunoreactive (ir-) NERPs. To determine major endogenous forms of rat NERPs, Sephadex G-50 gel-filtrated fractions of rat brain extracts (1.1- and 5.9-g eq for NERP-1 and NERP-2, respectively) were immunoprecipitated with anti-NERP antibodies and then analyzed on a surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer (Ciphergen, Fremont, CA). Immunoprecipitate from TT cell extract was prepared and mass analyzed as described (14Sasaki K. Sato K. Akiyama Y. Yanagihara K. Oka M. Yamaguchi K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4894-4898PubMed Google Scholar).Intracerebroventricular Administration—Male Wistar rats (aged 9–10 weeks, from Charles River Laboratories, Shiga, Japan) were maintained in individual cages under controlled temperature (21–23 °C) and light (light on 08:00–20:00) conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. Cannulation and intracerebroventricular (icv) administration were performed as described (18Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). Test materials for icv administration were dissolved in 10 μl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.24 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 25.9 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3. All animal experiments were repeated three to five times and performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal care from the Japanese Physiological Society.Immunohistochemistry—Brains were removed from colchicine (200 μg)-treated rats following perfusion with either 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or 4% PFA containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde, respectively, for immunofluorescence microscopy or electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining and immunogold electron microscopy were performed as described previously (19Toshinai K. Date Y. Murakami N. Shimada M. Mondal M.S. Shimbara T. Guan J.L. Wang Q.P.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2861-2869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For light microscopy, peripheral tissues from rats perfused with 2% PFA were stained with antibodies against NERP-1 (1:2,500), rat NERP-2 (1:5,000), oxytocin (1:15,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and vasopressin (1:80,000; Peninsula Laboratories, Torrance, CA). Samples were visualized as described (21Date Y. Ueta Y. Yamashita H. Yamaguchi H. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Nakazato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Control studies were done with normal rabbit serum or NERP antisera that had been pretreated with 10 μg of synthetic NERPs.In Situ Hybridization—VGF and vasopressin mRNA levels in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) from rats deprived of water for 48 h were examined by in situ hybridization with 33P3′ end-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide probes specific for VGF (complementary to bases 1741–1785 and 1825–1870 of rat VGF nucleotides; GenBank™ accession number M74223) and vasopressin (complementary to bases 1843–1868 of rat vasopressin nucleotides) as described (18Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic images were analyzed on an MCID imaging analyzer (18Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). VGF mRNA intensity is expressed relative to that of control rats drinking water ad libitum (n = 5 per group).Vasopressin Secretion and Measurements—Rats (n = 8–14 per group) received an icv injection of test peptide 5 min before icv injection of either hypertonic NaCl (8.5 μmol of NaCl/10 μl of aCSF) or AII (0.1 nmol/10 μl of aCSF). Plasma vasopressin was measured using an RIA kit (Mitsubishi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) in blood samples taken 10 min after the hypertonic saline or AII injection. Static incubation of PVN and SON explants punched out from the hypothalamus was performed as reported previously with minor modifications (22Beak S.A. Heath M.M. Small C.J. Morgan D.G. Ghatei M.A. Taylor A.D. Buckingham J.C. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1334-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). They were sequentially stimulated (each at a final concentration of 10-6m for 5 min) as indicated in Fig. 5. Stimulation periods were separated by 5-min recovery periods. At the end of each experiment, KCl was added at a final concentration of 6 × 10-2m to confirm depolarization-induced secretion. Perifusion assays were replicated 5–8 times.Effects of NERPs on Plasma Vasopressin in Rats—Rats (n = 8 per group) deprived of water for 48 h were decapitated 10 min after icv administration of NERP-1 or NERP-1-Gly (1nmol/rat) to measure plasma vasopressin. Prior to immunoneutralization studies of NERPs, water (5 ml/100 g body weight) was loaded to rats (n = 8 per group) by oral injection through a stomach tube. Fifteen minutes after water loading, rats received an icv injection of anti-NERP-1-IgG (0.1 μg), anti-NERP-2-IgG (0.1 μg), or control IgG (0.1 μg). Rats were decapitated 45 min after immunoneutralization, and plasma vasopressin was measured.Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Groups of data were compared with analysis of variance and the post-hoc Fisher's test. p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSPeptidomic Identification of NERPs from Culture Supernatant of TT Cells—We analyzed peptides secreted from human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells, because this cell line is known to actively secrete the C-terminally amidated peptide hormones calcitonin gene-related peptide α and calcitonin (13Gkonos P.J. Born W. Jones B.N. Petermann J.B. Keutmann H.T. Birnbaum R.S. Fischer J.A. Roos B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14386-14391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant of the cell line cultured in a serum-free medium for 6 h was concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography to obtain a peptide-rich fraction, whose cysteine residues were then converted to carboxy-amidomethyl cysteine using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. This peptide fraction was separated by conventional RP-HPLC to 50 fractions (Fig. 1A), each of which was analyzed with tandem mass spectrometric techniques for identification. We identified 19 C-terminally amidated peptides (Fig. 1B), of which 15 peptides were the entire or partial sequences corresponding to calcitonin gene-related peptide α and calcitonin. The identification of a series of 13 calcitonin gene-related peptide α-derived (CRGPα) peptides with sequential N-terminal deletions is consistent with the fact that this cell line produces this peptide α at higher levels than calcitonin (13Gkonos P.J. Born W. Jones B.N. Petermann J.B. Keutmann H.T. Birnbaum R.S. Fischer J.A. Roos B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14386-14391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, we discovered two novel amidated peptides with monoisotopic masses of 2677.4 and 4062.2, both of which were derived from distinct regions of the neurosecretory protein VGF; one is from human VGF-(281–306), and the is other from VGF-(310–347) (NCBI accession number gi|17136078) (Fig. 1, C and D). Shorter fragments of both peptides were also identified (Fig. 1B). Based on their localization and physiological role described below, we designated these peptides as neuroendocrine regulatory peptide (NERP)-1 and NERP-2.FIGURE 1Peptidomic identification of NERPs.A, RP-HPLC of the secretory peptides obtained from culture supernatant of TT cells.

The resultant spectra, deconvoluted with MaxEnt3TM (Micromass), were interpreted by SeqMS (15Fernandez-de-Cossio J. Gonzalez J. Satomi Y. Shima T. Okumura N. Besada V. Betancourt L. Padron G.

Residue numbering is based on the human (gi|17136078) and rat (gi|13591864) VGF precursor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Antisera against NERP-1 and NERP-2—The rat VGF sequences registered in the NCBI data base, as represented by gi|13591864 and gi|1352860, suggest that the rat precursor comprised of 617 amino acids generates amidated peptides as well. To characterize rat endogenous peptides, we prepared antibodies specific to the C-terminal region of each peptide; an octapeptide common to human and rat NERP-1 (QGLAQVEA-NH2) and decapeptides of rat NERP-2 (QGGARQRDLG-NH2) and human NERP-2 (QGGARQRGLG-NH2) were used for immunization. We confirmed that each antiserum strictly recognizes the C-terminal amide structure but does not show more than 0.1% cross-reactivity with its C-terminally Gly-extended peptide or another NERP. Furthermore, the antisera did not recognize rat C-terminal VGF-(588–617) peptide or human C-terminal VGF-(586–615) peptide even at 10 μm, indicating that they do not detect the intact VGF precursor.Characterization and Identification of NERP-1 and NERP-2—In the Sephadex G-50 gel filtration of rat brain extracts, ir-NERP-1 and ir-NERP-2 were observed as distinctive peaks in the region of relative molecular mass <6 kDa (data not shown). These NERP-1- and NERP-2-immunoreactive fractions were further characterized by mass analysis of immunoprecipitates using these antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). Based on the observed mass of the immunoprecipitates, we concluded that rat NERP peptides are derived from the VGF precursor (gi|13591864, Gly at residue 342), with the major endogenous forms of rat NERP-1 and NERP-2 being 25 and 38 amino acids long, respectively (Fig. 1E). The rat hypothalamus ir-NERPs behaved identically to synthetic rat NERP-1 or NERP-2 on RP-HPLC (Fig. 2C). Immunoprecipitation experiments with TT cell extract also showed the dominant peaks that correspond to human NERP-1 (2677 Da) and NERP-2 (4062 Da). These findings suggest that the processing and amidation of NERPs occur intracellularly before secretion, as is known with amidated bioactive peptides secreted by endocrine cells (7Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Major endogenous forms of rat NERPs determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and RP-HPLC. Peptides immunoprecipitated with an antibody against NERP-1 (A) or NERP-2 (B) from rat brain extracts were analyzed. The values correspond to the molecular masses of 25-amino acid-long NERP-1 (A, VGF-(285–309)) and 38-amino acid-long NERP-2 (B, VGF-(313–350)) of rat VGF (gi|13591864).

Cell bodies with strong immunostaining of NERPs were observed in the SON (Fig. 3, A–D) and PVN (Fig. 3, E–J), the nuclei that produce vasopressin and oxytocin (23Bondy C.A. Whitnall M.H. Brady L.S. Gainer H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 4: 427-446Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Ludwig M. Sabatier N. Dayanithi G. Russell J.A. Leng G. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 139: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that NERPs frequently colocalized with vasopressin, which controls body fluid homeostasis, but rarely with oxytocin (Fig. 3, A–D). Within the PVN, immunostaining of NERPs was detected in both magnocellular and parvocellular divisions, whereas that of arginine vasopressin was mainly observed in the magnocellular division. Thus, arginine vasopressin-positive cells are concluded to contain NERPs at high frequency. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed the colocalization of NERPs with vasopressin in storage granules (Fig. 3, A and C, insets). Based on these results, we supposed that we could elucidate a biological function of NERPs in the context of vasopressin physiology.FIGURE 3NERPs colocalize with vasopressin in the PVN and SON of rats.A–D, NERPs-specific immunohistochemistry of the SON.

These in vivo and immunocytochemical observations suggest that NERPs are involved in the central control of body fluid balance. Consistent with previous reports (25Yamashita H. Ueta Y. Dyball E.R. Pfaff D.W. Arnold A.P. Etgen A.M. Fahrbach S.E. Rubin R.T. Hormones, Brain, and Behavior, Vol. , pp. , Academic Press, New York. 160. 2002: 1-49Google Scholar, 26Wells T. Forsling M.L. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 59-64PubMed Google Scholar), icv injection of hypertonic NaCl or AII increased plasma vasopressin levels in rats (Fig. 4C, 2nd and 11th lanes). This stimulation was dose-dependently suppressed by icv injection of NERP-1 before injection of the vasopressin secretagogues (Fig. 4C). Similar effects were observed with NERP-2, but its potency was weaker than that of NERP-1 because 0.3 nmol of NERP-2 was not effective. Neither nonamidated NERP-1 (NERP-1-Gly) nor nonamidated NERP-2 (NERP-2-Gly) suppressed vasopressin secretion (Fig. 4C). The increase in plasma vasopressin levels caused by water deprivation was also suppressed by icv-administered NERP-1 or NERP-2 (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, icv administration of anti-NERP-1 IgG or anti-NERP-2 IgG significantly reversed plasma vasopressin suppression induced by acute water loading (Fig. 4E), suggesting that NERPs function as endogenous peptides to regulate vasopressin secretion. Next, we examined the in vitro effect of NERPs on vasopressin secretion using hypothalamic explants. NERP-1 suppressed basal and AII-induced vasopressin secretion from the PVN and SON (Fig. 5). NERP-2 was likewise effective, but NERP-1-Gly or NERP-2-Gly was not (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4NERPs suppress vasopressin secretion in vivo in rats.A, increased VGF gene expression in the PVN and SON following 48 h of water deprivation.

https://openalex.org/W2169545632,"Human cervical mucus is a heterogeneous mixture of mucin glycoproteins whose relative concentration changes during the ovulatory phases, thereby producing different mucus aggregation structures that can periodically permit the transit of spermatozoa for fertilization. In preovulatory phase, mucus is arranged in compact fiber-like structures where sperm transit is hindered. Previously, through observations made of fixed and dehydrated samples, a permissive structure in the ovulatory phase was attributed to the larger diameters of pores in the mucus network. Instead, by means of atomic force microscopy, we can show, for the first time, that unfixed ovulatory mucus is composed by floating globules of mucin aggregates. This finding sheds new light on the mechanism that governs spermatozoa transit toward the uterine cavity. In addition, we demonstrate that the switch from globular ovulatory to fibrous preovulatory mucus largely depends on a pH-driven mechanism. Analysis of mucin 5B primary sequence, the main mucin in ovulatory mucus, highlights pH-sensitive domains that are associated to flexible regions prone to drive aggregation. We suggest an involvement of these domains in the fiber-to-globule switch in cervical mucus."
https://openalex.org/W1973147965,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) are master regulators of cellular iron metabolism. IRPs bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) present in the untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding proteins of iron storage, uptake, transport, and export. Because simultaneous knockout of IRP1 and IRP2 is embryonically lethal, it has not been possible to use dual knockouts to explore the consequences of loss of both IRP1 and IRP2 in mammalian cells. In this report, we describe the use of small interfering RNA to assess the relative contributions of IRP1 and IRP2 in epithelial cells. Stable cell lines were created in which either IRP1, IRP2, or both were knocked down. Knockdown of IRP1 decreased IRE binding activity but did not affect ferritin H and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression, whereas knockdown of IRP2 marginally affected IRE binding activity but caused an increase in ferritin H and a decrease in TfR1. Knockdown of both IRPs resulted in a greater reduction of IRE binding activity and more severe perturbation of ferritin H and TfR1 expression compared with single IRP knockdown. Even though the knockdown of IRP-1, IRP-2, or both was efficient, resulting in nondetectable protein and under 5% of wild type levels of mRNA, all stable knockdowns retained an ability to modulate ferritin H and TfR1 appropriately in response to iron challenge. However, further knockdown of IRPs accomplished by transient transfection of small interfering RNA in stable knockdown cells completely abolished the response of ferritin H and TfR1 to iron challenge, demonstrating an extensive excess capacity of the IRP system."
https://openalex.org/W1989326780,"Villin is a major actin-bundling protein in the brush border of epithelial cells. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that villin can bundle actin filaments using a single F-actin binding site, because it has the ability to self-associate. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate villin self-association in living cells in microvilli and in growth factor-stimulated cells in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. Using sucrose density gradient, size-exclusion chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, the majority of villin was identified as a monomer or dimer. Villin dimers were also identified in Caco-2 cells, which endogenously express villin and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that ectopically express villin. Using truncation mutants of villin, site-directed mutagenesis, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, an amino-terminal dimerization site was identified that regulated villin self-association in parallel conformation as well as actin bundling by villin. This detailed analysis describes for the first time microvillus assembly by villin, redefines the actin-bundling function of villin, and provides a molecular mechanism for actin bundling by villin, which could have wider implications for other actin cross-linking proteins that share a villin-like headpiece domain.

Villin is an epithelial cell-specific actin-binding protein that regulates cell migration, cell death, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition underscoring the significance of this protein to epithelial cell function (1Athman R.

Villin is expressed in differentiated epithelial cells with a brush border such as intestinal villi, proximal renal tubules, oviduct, and seminiferous ducts (8Ezzell R.M. Chafel M.M. Matsudaira P.T. Development. 1989; 106,: 407-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Grone H.J. Weber K. Helmchen U. Osborn M. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124,: 294-302PubMed Google Scholar, 10Horvat B. Osborn M. Damjanov I. Histochemistry. 1990; 93,: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Microvilli are unique apical cell surface structures of epithelial cells and are extensions of uniform diameter with a core of cross-linked actin filaments that extend from the electron-dense material at the tip into the cell cortex as rootlet. It may be noted that, although most of the microvillar structural proteins have been isolated, the identification of the in vivo functions of these proteins, the role they play in the assembly of the microvilli as well as the molecular mechanism of cytoskeletal-protein interactions, has been a challenge. The microvilli of renal and intestinal epithelial cells contain a compact core of ∼20 highly ordered parallel microfilaments that are believed to increase the cell surface thus regulating the absorptive functions of these tissues. Villin is the major protein associated with actin filaments in the microvillus core. Simple mixtures of villin and F-actin form uniformly polarized bundles similar to those seen in the ultrastructural analysis of brush borders (11Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108,: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Overexpression or microinjection of villin in fibroblasts results in the growth of microspikes on the dorsal surface of these cells containing bundled actin filaments to which villin is associated (12Franck Z. Footer M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111,: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59,: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Further, down-regulation of the endogenous villin mRNA using antisense RNA reversibly inhibits brush-border assembly (14Costa de Beauregard M.A. Pringault E. Robine S. Louvard D. EMBO J. 1995; 14,: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that villin facilitates formation of organized actin structures such as those seen in the microvilli. Changes in the microvillar structure have been noted at the ultrastructural level in villin knock-out mice. The actin bundles in the microvillar core are not as well organized or as tightly packed as those in the wild-type littermates (15Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211,: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Likewise, the terminal web appears thicker and less well organized in the villin null mice (15Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211,: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The absence of more significant changes in the brush-border morphology in the villin-null mice may be due to compensation by other brush-border actin-bundling proteins that share a villin-like headpiece domain such as advillin or other actin-bundling proteins such as espin or fimbrin. The genetic deletion of villin accompanied by significant changes in the ultrastructure of the microvilli has been noted in pediatric cholestasis (16Phillips M.J. Azuma T. Meredith S.L. Squire J.A.

This study points to the physiological significance of villin in the structure and function of the microvilli in the bile canaliculi. Although the role of villin as an actin-bundling protein is well established, the molecular mechanisms regulating this function of villin are not well characterized like the regulation of the microvilli, which itself remains poorly understood. Villin is a 92.5-kDa protein with two tandem homologous halves (segments S1-S3 and segments S4-S6 that form the villin core) and a carboxyl-terminal headpiece (segment S7). Villin shares structural and functional homology with two conserved families of proteins. One family of proteins, which includes gelsolin and adseverin, shares the conserved domain(s) found in the villin core. The second family of proteins, which includes advillin, supervillin, Drosophila quail, and protovillin from Dictyostelium, shares a villin-like headpiece. Villin is unique among the actin-regulatory proteins in that it can sever, cap, nucleate, and bundle actin filaments. It has been speculated that villin must use two F-actin binding sites, one located in the core and the second in the headpiece domain, to bundle F-actin (17Jr. Glenney J.R. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78,: 2810-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274,: 26751-26760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, while characterizing the ligand-binding functions of villin, we made the serendipitous observation that a villin mutant that lacks the F-actin binding site in the core could cross-link actin filaments in vitro. Similar observations have been noted in other studies (13Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59,: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Friederich E.

Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116,: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although nothing was reported about the relevance of these findings to the actin-bundling activity of villin. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that villin must self-associate to exhibit actin bundling using a single F-actin binding site. In this study we test this hypothesis and demonstrate for the first time the self-association of villin in vitro and in living cells. Further, we identify the dimerization site in villin and demonstrate that deletion of this site prevents actin bundling by villin. Based on these studies a model for actin cross-linking by villin dimers is proposed, providing new insights about villin function in cells.

The amplicon was purified and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-3 vector. A villin mutant lacking the phosphatidylinositol (4Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B.

Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Villin truncation mutants, VT-3 and CT-1, were cloned as described previously (22Zhai L. Kumar N. Panebra A. Zhao P. Parrill A.L. Khurana S.

Villin 1-136 truncation was constructed by introducing a stop codon after aa 136 in full-length villin cloned in pGEX-4T-3 by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The following primers were used for this cloning: (forward) 5′-CCTATGACGTCCAGTGACTGCTGCATGTCAAGG-3′; (reverse) 5′-CCTTGACATGCAGCAGTCACTGGACGTCATAGG3′. A villin deletion mutant, VIL/Δ21-67, was constructed similarly by site-directed mutagenesis in pGEX-4T-3 by using: (forward) 5′-ACCCCGGGGCTGCAGCAGGACTCATCC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGATGAGTCCTGCTGCAGCCCCGGGG-3′. A villin double mutant, VIL/Δ21-67/112-119, was prepared by using the primers for Δ112-119 described previously and those described above for Δ21-67 (21Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged villin proteins were purified as described before (20Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281,: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST tag was cleaved by thrombin digestion (1 unit/100 μg of protein at room temperature, 16 h) and removed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Cloning of Wild-type and Mutant Villin Proteins—Full-length human villin was cloned in pTRE-HA as described previously (4Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Three additional constructs of villin were made: DsRed2-tagged villin (carboxyl-terminal tag); super-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (SEYFP)-tagged villin (amino-terminal tag); and cerulean-tagged villin (amino-terminal tag). Full-length villin cloned in pTRE-HA was used as a template, and PCR was used to introduce EcoRI (forward) and SacII (reverse) restriction sites and cloned into the EcoRI and SacII sites of pDsRed2-N1. Similarly, PCR was used to introduce XhoI (forward) and EcoRI (reverse) restrictions and ligated with XhoI- and EcoRI-digested pmCerulean C1 vector. SEYFP-tagged version of full-length villin was made by subcloning SEYFP into the SalI site between the HA tag and full-length villin cloned in pTRE-HA essentially as described before (23Tomar A. George S. Kansal P. Wang Y. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 31972-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For cloning of full-length villin in pBudCE4.1, cerulean-villin was amplified from pmCerulean-C1 vector containing cerulean-villin using the primers, which contain the NotI and BstBI sites: (forward) 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GATAGCTTCGAAAAATAGTCCTTTTC-3′. The PCR products and pBudCE4.1 were restricted using NotI and BstBI enzymes, ligated and transformed in Escherichia coli XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent cells. To clone cerulean-tagged Δ21-67/112-119 in pBudCE4.1, cerulean-villin was amplified from pmCerulean-C1 vector and inserted into the NotI and KpnI sites using the following primers: (forward) 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGGGTACCGGACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-3′. Δ21-67/112-119 villin was inserted into the XhoI/BstBI sites by amplifying it from pGEX-4T-3 vector by using the following primers: (forward) 5′-GATAGCCTCGAGAATGACCAAGCTGAGC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CCGCTCTTCGAATCAAAATAGTCCTTTTTC-3′. The sequence and frame of the inserts was checked by sequencing. Transfection of MDCK Tet-Off Cells with Wild-type and Mutant Villin Proteins—MDCK Tet-Off cells were stably transfected with HA-, SEYFP-, cerulean-, or DsRed2-tagged villin as described previously (23Tomar A. George S. Kansal P. Wang Y. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 31972-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml G418 sulfate, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 10% fetal calf serum. To repress the expression of the villin gene in MDCK Tet-Off cells transfected with HA-tagged villin, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml doxycycline. Cell Motility Assay—Cell migration was measured as described previously with slight modification (4Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers were scraped with a sharp blade across the diameter of the well to produce wounds of ∼1 mm. Both villin-null as well as villin-expressing cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml). Data are expressed as distance moved (in microns) from the original wound margin 8 h post-wounding. Comparisons between mean values were made using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey's modified t test (Bonferroni criteria) with a p < 0.05 considered significant. Chemical Cross-linking of Villin Protein—In vitro cross-linking of purified recombinant human villin protein (20 nm) with chemical cross-linkers was performed at different concentrations of cross-linker (0-to 100-fold molar excess) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for different time intervals (0-60 min). Reactions involving DTNB were performed in Tris-Cl buffer at pH 8. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 mm lysine or cysteine (for DTNB), pH 7.4. Proteins were cross-linked in Caco-2 and MDCK Tet-Off cells by incubating the cells at room temperature in various concentrations (0-2.5 mm) of cross-linkers for different time intervals (0-60 min). Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—A 10-ml linear 10-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in phosphate-buffered saline was prepared by carefully layering 2 ml each of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% sucrose solutions prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The gradient was incubated at room temperature for 2 h to allow the uniform diffusion and the formation of the continuous gradient. The villin samples (200 μl of 20 μm villin cross-linked with DFDNB, 50-fold molar excess for 30 min at room temperature), and calibration proteins were run in parallel. Samples were loaded onto the gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h in an SW-41-Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C. 500-μl samples were collected and analyzed by Western analysis. Protein standards run simultaneously were detected by using GelCode Blue stain. SEC-HPLC—Cross-linked recombinant villin proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) on a Waters 600 HPLC system equipped with a 996-photodiode array detector. Separation was performed on a TSK-GEL G3000SWXL column (Tosoh Biosep, 7.8 mm × 30 cm, 5 μm) using 0.05 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.3) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 70 μl of the reaction mixture was injected per run. Runs were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, fractions were collected manually, and monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric fractions were identified by MALDI-TOF. Protein standards were used for correlation of retention time and molecular mass. MALDI-TOF Analysis of Cross-linked Villin Proteins—MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE Biospectrometry Workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the linear mode using a nitrogen laser (337 nm), in the positive ion mode. All experiments utilized an acceleration voltage of 25 kV, a grid voltage of 93%, a guide wire of 0.2%, and a delay time of 225 ns. Each spectrum obtained was the sum of 100 laser shots. Cross-linked samples were prepared using sinapinic acid as the MALDI matrix, and each sample was applied using the sandwich method on stainless steel sample holders. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with bovine serum albumin. Spectra were recorded, and the data were processed with Data Explorer 3.5.0.0. In Vitro Interaction of Recombinant Villin Proteins—GST-tagged recombinant villin as well as recombinant villin protein with the GST tag cleaved by thrombin digestion (1 unit/100 μg of protein at room temperature, 16 h) were used to examine villin self-association in the absence of cross-linkers. The GST-tagged proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation the resin was washed, and the GST-fused recombinant villin protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with untagged villin protein for 1 h at 4 °C (pulldown assay). The beads were centrifuged, washed (in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl), and the proteins bound to the beads were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by using GelCode Blue staining. FRET Analysis in Living Cells—FRET analysis was done in MDCK Tet-Off cells co-expressing SEYFP- and cerulean-tagged or DsRed2- and cerulean-tagged villin proteins. To study the localization of the FRET signal in migrating cells, cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml). FRET calculations were made using the method of sensitized FRET. FRET was calculated from at least 15 cells in 5 independent experiments. Cerulean and SEYFP were excited with the 448 nm or 514 nm line of an argon ion laser, respectively, and fluorescence was recorded with a 475 nm or a 530 nm long pass filter, respectively. DsRed2 and cerulean were excited with the 543 nm or 448 nm lines of a helium neon and argon ion laser, respectively, and fluorescence was recorded with a 560 nm and 475 nm long pass filter, respectively. Calculation of corrected FRET (FRETc) was carried out on a pixel-bypixel basis for the entire image. The bleedthrough of cerulean and SEYFP through the FRET filter channel was corrected by applying the equation: FRETc = raw FRET - (A* acceptor) - (B* donor), where A* and B* = coefficient A and coefficient B. Similar measurements were made for DsRed2- and cerulean-co-expressing cell lines, where cerulean was the donor and DsRed2 the acceptor fluorophore. The Förster distance, Ro, which is the donor-acceptor distance at which FRET efficiency is 50%, for DsRed2/cerulean is 50.9 Å and for cerulean/SEYFP is 49.2 Å (24Erickson M.G. Moon D.L. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 2003; 85,: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284,: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The overall intensity of FRET was calculated using Metamorph Software. Images are displayed in pseudocolor mode, where white and black areas display high and low values of FRET in the range of 0-200 relative light units, respectively. Actin-bundling Activity of Villin—Actin bundles were examined by electron microscopy as described before (26Zhai L. Zhao P. Panebra A. Guerrerio A.L. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 36163-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). VIL/HP was incubated without or with DTNB (equimolar concentration) for 1 h at room temperature, and the chemical cross-linking reaction was terminated by incubation with excess cysteine. A low speed actin bundling assay was performed by incubating F-actin with recombinant full-length villin (VIL/WT), mutant villin proteins, uncross-linked or cross-linked villin headpiece (VIL/HP), or GST protein alone in bundling buffer (25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA for 60 min). The samples were centrifuged at low speed (10,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and distribution of F-actin in these two fractions was analyzed by using GelCode Blue staining. Villin Can Bundle Actin Filament Using a Single F-actin Binding Site—Previous in vitro studies using truncation mutants of villin or proteolytic fragments of the villin protein have reported that neither the core nor the headpiece alone can bundle actin filaments in vitro, leading to the hypothesis that both actin binding sites in villin are required for this function (13Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59,: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Jr. Glenney J.R. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274,: 26751-26760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined that villin does not require both F-actin binding sites to cross-link actin filaments in vitro.We examined the effects of villin deletion mutant lacking the F-actin binding site in the core (ΔPB2) on actin filament morphology. F-actin in the absence of villin appear as single, long filaments (Fig. 1A, panel a), while in the presence of saturating amounts of wild type villin show long, straight, closely aligned, well-organized, tight bundles (Fig. 1A, panel b). Deletion of the F-actin binding site in the villin core (ΔPB2) had no effect on the actin-bundling activity of villin (Fig. 1A, panel c). The low speed actin bundling assay demonstrates the ability of villin mutant ΔPB2 to bundle actin similar to full-length villin protein (Fig. 1B). In the absence of villin, the actin filaments were not bundled and sedimented in the supernatant fraction (control). We have previously shown that deletion of the F-actin binding site in the headpiece eliminates actin cross-linking by villin (21Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the F-actin binding site in the villin headpiece is obligatory, however the F-actin binding site in villin core is not necessary for the actin-bundling function of villin in vitro. Formation of Villin Dimers—We hypothesized that the actin-bundling function of villin in the absence of the second F-actin binding site could be determined by villin self-association. To evaluate villin self-association in vitro, recombinant villin protein (20 nm) was cross-linked in vitro with chemical cross-linkers of varying spacer length (supplemental Table S1). We elected to use multiple cross-linkers, including the zero-length cross-linking reagent, DTNB. Disulfide bonds can be reversibly formed by oxidation using DTNB (Ellman's reagent) and has been used to examine protein-protein interactions, including oligomerization of cofilin (27Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151,: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Pfannstiel J. Cyrklaff M. Habermann A. Stoeva S. Griffiths G. Shoeman R. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 49476-49484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate villin oligomerization with all cross-linkers under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2A). Under reducing conditions villin oligomers were observed with non-cleavable cross-linkers, EGS and DSS (supplemental Fig. S1A). Because DFDNB can also react with imidazolyl and phenolate groups of amino acid side chains, we could detect villin oligomers cross-linked with DFDNB in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (29Zahn H. Meinhoffer J. Makromol. Chem. 1958; 26,: 153Crossref Google Scholar). Cross-linkers of varying spacer lengths, including DTNB, resulted in the oligomerization of villin, suggesting that in villin dimers two thiol groups must come as close as 2 Å (the length of a disulfide bond). To determine the ability of purified villin proteins to self-associate in the absence of cross-linkers we examined the association of GST-tagged and untagged villin (GST tag cleaved by thrombin digestion) proteins in vitro. For these studies GST-tagged full-length recombinant villin immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with untagged villin protein for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and the proteins bound to the beads were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by using GelCode Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-tagged villin protein associates with untagged villin protein even"
https://openalex.org/W2003058284,"Oxidative stress-responsive transcription is regulated in part through cis-active sequences known as antioxidant response elements (ARE). Activation through the ARE involves members of the CNC-subfamily of basic leucine zipper proteins including Nrf1 and Nrf2. In particular, Nrf2 has been shown to coordinate induction of genes encoding antioxidant and phase 2 metabolizing enzymes in response to stimulation with electrophilic compounds and exposure to xenobiotics. Here we show that the 65-kDa isoform of the Nrf1 gene functions as a repressor of Nrf2. Transient expression of p65Nrf1 suppressed Nrf2-mediated activation of ARE-dependent reporter genes in cells. Induction of endogenous ARE-genes is blocked in Hepa1c1c7 cells stably expressing p65Nrf1 leading to increased cell death. Consistent with these findings, electrophilic activation of ARE-gene expression is augmented by loss of p65Nrf1 function in Nrf1–/– fibroblasts, and the protective effects of oxidative preconditioning and ARE-gene expression are blocked in Nrf1–/– cells stably expressing p65Nrf1. Gel shift experiments demonstrated that p65Nrf1 binds the antioxidant response element as a heterodimer with small-Maf protein. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that p65Nrf1 competes with Nrf2 for interaction with small-Maf protein and binding to the antioxidant response element in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that p65Nrf1 has the potential to play an important role in modulating the response to oxidative stress by functioning as a transdominant repressor of Nrf2-mediated activation of ARE-dependent gene transcription.

Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). These elements have been identified in the regulatory regions of genes encoding phase-2 detoxification enzymes and various other cytoprotective proteins such as NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase) that catalyzes reduction of a variety of quinones and quinoid compounds, GST (glutathione S-transferase) enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of glutathione to electrophiles, and GCL (glutamate-cysteine ligase) enzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit GCLC and a modifier subunit GCLM that catalyzes glutathione synthesis in cells. Nrf1 and Nrf2 are expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell types, and both share structural similarities beyond the CNC and bZIP domains (3Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nrf2 is an important activator of AREs in cells by coordinating the expression of antioxidant and phase 2 metabolizing enzymes in response to oxidative stress and xenobiotic exposures (10Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). For example, genetic and biochemical studies indicate that expression of NQO1, GCLC and ferritin heavy chain are dependent on Nrf2 (11Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Biochim. Biophys.

While Nrf2 is dispensable for development in mice, a deficiency of Nrf2 leads to impaired xenobiotic metabolism and various oxidative stress-related pathologies (15Lee J.M. Li J. Johnson D.A.

In contrast to Nrf2, loss of Nrf1 leads to embryonic lethality in mice (16Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Yen T.S. Kan Y.W.

Nrf1 is essential for fetal hematopoiesis, and recent studies indicate a link between Nrf1 and chronic liver disease in mice (18Xu Z. Chen L. Leung L. Yen T.S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4120-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cell-based studies indicate that Nrf1 is also important in ARE function. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nrf1 mutant embryos have been shown to be susceptible to oxidant-induced cell death, and Nrf1 has been shown to transactivate through the AREs in the promoters of both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of glutamyl-cysteine ligase genes that are involved in glutathione biosynthesis (19Kwong M. Kan Y.W. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37491-37498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Myhrstad M.C. Husberg C. Murphy P. Nordstrom O. Blomhoff R. Moskaug J.O. Kolsto A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, fibroblasts deficient in Nrf1 and Nrf2 are severely impaired in expression of ARE-bearing genes and are markedly sensitive to oxidative stress indicating that Nrf1 shares an overlapping role with Nrf2 in the oxidative stress response (21Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The human Nrf1 gene has been shown to encode at least 4 alternatively spliced variants predicted to encode proteins ranging in sizes from 728 to 772 amino acids (22Luna L. Skammelsrud N. Johnsen O. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1995; 27: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The significance of these alternative mRNA splicing variants is unknown. In addition to these large protein isoforms, an N-terminal-truncated form of Nrf1 consisting of 447 amino acids (also called LCR-F1) has also been described (23Caterina J.J. Donze D. Sun C.W. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2383-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggests that the N-terminally truncated form of Nrf1, which has an apparent mass of 65-kDa, is generated by alternative translation initiation from highly conserved in-frame start codons downstream from the normal start site present in the Nrf1 transcript (3Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The function of 65-kDa Nrf1 (p65Nrf1) in gene activation is not clear. Although p65Nrf1 has been shown to activate globin-reporter gene expression in erythroid cells, transactivation was not observed in other cell types (23Caterina J.J. Donze D. Sun C.W. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2383-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We report here that p65Nrf1 blocked Nrf2-mediated activation of ARE-dependent reporter genes, and enforced expression of p65Nrf1 in Hepa1c1c7 cells inhibited induction of endogenous ARE-genes by oxidative stress. Loss of p65Nrf1 function led to increased induction of ARE-genes, and expression of p65Nrf1 blocked the protective effects of oxidative preconditioning mediated by Nrf2 in fibroblasts. The p65 isoform interacted with small-Maf proteins to bind the ARE in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that p65Nrf1 binds to the promoter of the ARE-regulated NQO1 gene in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that p65Nrf1 can potentially inhibit Nrf2 and may function as an important component modulating ARE-gene expression in response to oxidative stress.

Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19676-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The p65Nrf1-EGFP plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of Nrf1 using primers CGAATTCTGACCATGGTTTCTCTG and GGCTCACTTTACCGGTTCCTTTGGCTT. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and Age1 and subcloned into EcoR1 and Age1 sites 3′ to the EGFP coding region of pEGFP-N1. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—COS-7, Hela, HEK293, or Hepa1c1c7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 μg/ml of each streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at least 12 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cellular extracts were prepared and luciferase activities were measured with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase control. Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times, and data points were calculated as the mean of the results (3 wells/experiment) ± S.D. Retroviral Transduction—p65Nrf1- and Nrf2DN-encoding retroviruses and control backbone retroviruses were prepared by transfecting into Phoenix eco packaging cell line with pBabe, pBabe-Nrf2DN, and pBabe-p65Nrf1, followed by harvesting supernatant. The resultant ecotropic retroviral supernatants were used to infect Hepa1c1c7 cells or Nrf1–/– cells. After 24 h of infection, cells were cultured with puromycin at 5 μg/ml for selection of transduced cells. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to cell lysates and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system. RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using UltraSpec-RNA (Biotecx) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For real-time RT-PCR, cDNAs were synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA in 20-μl reactions containing 1× RT buffer with 1 mm dNTPs, 0.3 μg of random hexamer, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 250 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcription reactions were incubated at 72 °C for 5 min, then 25 °C for 10 min, followed by 42 °C for 60 min, then aliquots of the reaction products were used in PCR reactions. SYBR Green-based Real Time PCR was used to determine cDNA levels. Aliquots of cDNA were amplified in an Opticon PCR machine (Bio-Rad) using Dynamo Probe PCR reagents (New England Biolabs) in triplicates in 20-μl reaction volumes. Sequences of the PCR primers were previously described (21Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PCR cycling conditions consist of 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 45 s. Expression levels were calculated relative to RPL10 or 18S rRNA levels as endogenous control. Relative expression was calculated as 2(Ct test gene-Ct control). Cell Viability Assay—Viability assays for Hepa1c1c7 cells were carried out in six-well plates. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before hydrogen peroxide treatment. At various times after treatment, floating and attached cells were collected from each well and stained with Trypan Blue. The number of viable and dead cells was counted using a hemocytometer. Viability assays for Nrf1–/– cells were done with CyQuant Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated in 96-well black wall plates, at a density of 5000 cells/well. For preconditioning, triplicate wells were cultured first in the presence of 20 μm DEM or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as the vehicle control. After 24 h, triplicate wells were treated with various concentrations of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) or vehicle. After 12 h of treatment at 37 °C, the media were discarded, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and remaining adherent cells were incubated with the CyQuant dye for 5 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured on a microplate reader with filters set at 480 nm for excitation and 520 nm for emission. Each experiment was repeated independently three times. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nrf2, p65Nrf1, and Maf-G were synthesized using the rabbit reticulocyte TnT system from Promega. TnT lysate from vector alone was used as a negative control. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI/dC), 4% glycerol containing 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the antioxidant response element of human NQO1 gene promoter (5-CAGTCACAGTGACTCAGCAGAATCT-3′). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 4% acrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C temperature. For supershift experiments, antibodies were added 10 min prior to addition of ARE probe to the binding reaction mix. Coimmunoprecipitation—Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transfected with Maf-G, Nrf2, and p65Nrf1 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000, and were lysed in RIPA buffer 48 h after transfection. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C followed by overnight incubation with anti-V5, -Nrf2, -Myc, -Nrf1 antibodies or control (IgG) antibodies. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added the next day, followed by a 2-h incubation in the cold. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and then washed with RIPA buffer. Proteins were eluted in 1× SDS-sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, followed by immunoblotting with indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies or rabbit TruBlot secondary antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Detection of peroxidase signal was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence method. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were done using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology. HEK293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with p65Nrf1. After 48 h, cells were treated with TBHQ for 8 h to induce Nrf2 expression. Cells were then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction stopped by adding 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of protease inhibitors followed by lysis in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) for 20 min followed by sonification and centrifugation at 10,000 × g. A portion of the lysate was kept without immunoprecipitation for subsequent purification of input genomic DNA. The supernatant was precleared with protein-A Sepharose beads and sheared herring sperm DNA. The pre-cleared supernatant was incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, Nrf2-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody or pre-immune antibody control at 4 °C overnight with 10-fold diluted ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris–HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). The DNA-protein complexes were then washed with low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), followed by high salt immune complex wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and then 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA pH 8.0 buffer. DNA was eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 15 min twice, and then reverse cross-linked by proteinase-K at 65 °C for 16 h with 200 m sodium chloride followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation to purify DNA. Purified DNA was PCR-amplified for 35 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C) with primers CAGTGGCATGCACCCAGGGAA and GCATGCCCCTTTTAGCCTTGGCA that flank the ARE site in the NQO1 gene promoter, and non-precipitated (input) genomic DNA was amplified as positive control. p65Nrf1 Represses Nrf2-mediated Transcriptional Activation of ARE-containing Genes—It was previously observed that the Nrf1 transcript contains several internal AUG codons within a Kozak consensus sequence favorable of supporting alternative translational initiation to generate the 65-kDa form of Nrf1 (Fig. 1a). Consistent with this, immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts of mouse embryonic fibroblasts detected a band corresponding to the 65-kDa form of Nrf1, which was absent in extracts prepared from Nrf1–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 1a). Western blotting indicated that p65Nrf1 is expressed in various cell lines (Fig. 1a). While we previously demonstrated that the p120-kDa form of Nrf1 is membrane localized, p65Nrf1 expressed as a fusion protein with EGFP was constitutively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1b). This finding is in accordance with the fact that an ER membrane targeting signal contained within the N-terminal amino acids of the 120-kDa isoform is missing in p65Nrf1 (24Wang W. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19676-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine the function of p65Nrf1 in ARE-gene activation, co-transfection studies using p65Nrf1 expression vector and luciferase reporter gene containing an antioxidant response element of the NQO1 gene were done. Transient expression of p65Nrf1 did not activate reporter gene expression in Hepa1c1c7 or COS7 cells, and increasing the levels of p65Nrf1 conferred a progressive decrease in reporter activation instead (Fig. 1c and data not shown). Next, we sought to determine whether p65Nrf1 could function in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit ARE-gene activation. Luciferase reporter gene containing the NQO1-ARE was transfected along with fixed amounts of Nrf2 and increasing amounts of p65Nrf1 into Hepa1c1c7. As expected, Nrf2 activated luciferase expression driven by the NQO1-ARE (Fig. 1d). Co-expression of p65Nrf1 suppressed this activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1d). Suppression was not observed when a mutant p65Nrf1 with the bZIP domain deleted was cotransfected (Fig. 1d). Immunoblot analysis indicated that expression levels of p65Nrf1 and Nrf2 proteins were comparable in transfected cells (Fig. 1e). Similar repression of reporter activation was observed in COS-7 and Hela cells indicating that the inhibitory effect of p65Nrf1 was not unique to Hepa1c1c7 cells (data not shown). Activation of reporter driven by the GCLC-ARE4 or GCLM-gene promoter was similarly repressed by p65Nrf1 (Fig. 1f). As a control, we examined the effects of p65Nrf1 on luciferase expression driven by the Grp78 promoter, which does not contain antioxidant response elements. Overexpression of p65Nrf1 did not inhibit activation from the Grp78 reporter (data not shown). These results indicate that inhibition by p65Nrf1 is ARE-dependent. Expression of Endogenous ARE-genes Is Suppressed by p65Nrf1—We then investigated whether enforced expression of p65Nrf1 could lead to suppression of endogenous ARE-gene induction by oxidative stress in cells. Hepa1c1c7 cells were transduced with control or p65Nrf1-encoding retrovirus. Hepa1c1c7 cells were chosen because of their responsiveness to electrophilic stimulation of phase 2 gene expression. 3W. Wang, A. M. Kwok, and J. Y. Chan, unpublished results. Overexpression of p65Nrf1 in transduced cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 2a). As a positive control, cells stably expressing dominant negative Nrf2 mutant were also generated by retrovirus transduction. Cultures of control, p65Nrf1-, and Nrf2DN-infected lines were treated with TBHQ to induce oxidative stress and analyzed for ARE-gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR. In p65Nrf1-infected cells, TBHQ-induced expression of NQO1 and GCLC genes was severely blunted (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, GCLM induction was not suppressed by p65Nrf1. As expected, expression of Nrf2DN suppressed TBHQ-induction of NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM. To further confirm suppression of ARE-mediated function, we examined NQO1-ARE luciferase reporter expression in p65Nrf1 stable cells. In contrast to pBabe-control cells, reporter gene expression was not induced by TBHQ treatment in p65Nrf1-expressing cells (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that p65Nrf1 acts as repressor of ARE-mediated gene expression. Cells Stably Expressing p65Nrf1 Are Hypersensitive to Oxidative Stress—To determine the functional relevance of the antagonistic effects of p65Nrf1 on ARE-gene expression, we investigated whether cells stably expressing p65Nrf1 are sensitized to oxidative stress. Control Hepa1c1c7 cells, and cells expressing p65Nrf1 were cultured in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and viability was determined. As a positive control, cells expressing Nrf2DN were similarly treated. No difference in viability was observed in untreated cultures of control, p65Nrf1-, and Nrf2DN-expressing Hepa1c1c7 cells (data not shown). Compared with pBABE-control cells, p65Nrf1-expressing cells showed a 2-fold increase in cell death after 6 h of treatment with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3). At 12 h after exposure, cell death in p65Nrf1-expressing cultures was 3-fold higher compared with control cells. As expected, Nrf2DN-expressing cells were hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 3). In addition to hydrogen peroxide, hypersensitivity to TBHQ was similarly observed in Hepa1c1c7 cells expressing p65Nrf1 (data not shown). These results indicate that p65Nrf1 expression sensitizes cells to killing caused by oxidative stress, which is consistent with its ability to down-regulate ARE-gene expression by Nrf2. Oxidative Stress Response Is Inhibited by p65Nrf1 in Vivo—The data presented thus far suggest that p65Nrf1 can inhibit ARE-specific gene e"

https://openalex.org/W1979662546,"Genetic construction of a mutant strain (designated MSMEG4245) of Mycobacterium smegmatis, defective in a broadly conserved gene for a putative glycosyltransferase of the glycosyltransferase-C superfamily, results in a phenotype marked by the virtual absence of the phosphatidylinositol-containing lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan, replaced instead by a novel truncated form of lipomannan. The normal spectrum of phosphatidylinositol mannosides, long presumed precursors of these lipoglycans, was retained. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry of the mutated form of lipomannan shows a family of phosphatidylinositol-anchored lipomannans with from only 5 to 20 Manp residues as compared with lipomannan from the wild type strain consisting of 21–34 Manp residues but with few changes in the branching pattern. Thus, MSMEG4245 is apparently a key mannosyltransferase, required for the proper elongation of lipomannan to its normal state and subsequent synthesis of lipoarabinomannan. The corresponding ortholog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has been identified as Rv2174. This previously unrecognized feature of the biosynthesis of lipomannan/lipoarabinomannan allows a significant revision of structural and biosynthetic schemata and provides a molecular basis of selectivity in biosynthesis, as conferred by the MSMEG4245 gene.

Thus, MSMEG4245 is apparently a key mannosyltransferase, required for the proper elongation of lipomannan to its normal state and subsequent synthesis of lipoarabinomannan. The corresponding ortholog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has been identified as Rv2174. This previously unrecognized feature of the biosynthesis of lipomannan/lipoarabinomannan allows a significant revision of structural and biosynthetic schemata and provides a molecular basis of selectivity in biosynthesis, as conferred by the MSMEG4245 gene.

In addition, LAM possesses a branched arabinan and, in some cases, non-reducing termini composed of single or short linear Manp-containing oligosaccharides, products known as ManLAM (7Chatterjee D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIMs are predominantly found in the di- (PIM2) and hexa- (PIM6)mannoside forms, and all forms are multiacylated (9Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. AcPIM2 contains one additional fatty acid linked to the 6-position of the Manp on carbon-2 of the myo-inositol of PI, whereas Ac2PIM2 contains an additional fatty acid residue linked directly to the 3-position of the myo-inositol. PIM biosynthesis is initiated by two distinct α-mannosyltransferases (ManT), PimA and PimB, requiring GDP-Manp as sugar donor for the transfer of Manp residues to the 2- and 6-positions of the myo-inositol ring to form PIM1 and PIM2, in succession (10Kordulakova J.

A third Manp unit is introduced onto the growing molecule to form PIM3 in a reaction catalyzed by PimC, identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 but absent from Mycobacterium smegmatis, suggesting redundancy in this step (12Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the acyltransferases responsible for the multiacylated nature of the PIMs have been identified (13Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Mikusova K. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36285-36295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Manp unit at position 6 of PIM3 is then further extended to generate PIM4–6. However, the steps and enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of PIM6 and LM/LAM are poorly defined, although recently, PimE, the ManT responsible for the synthesis of PIM5, was identified (14Morita Y.S. Sena C.B. Waller R.F. Kurokawa K. Sernee M.F. Nakatani F. Haites R.E. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25143-25155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PIM6 is a “dead end” product, not involved in the biosynthesis of LM/LAM, as it contains two (1 → 2) linked Manp residues, a combination absent from LM/LAM (15Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PIM4 is regarded as the crucial intermediate linking the early PIMs with LM/LAM, an assumption reinforced by the isolation of a M. smegmatis mutant unable to synthesize PIM6 but accumulating PIM4 (16Kovacevic S. Anderson D. Morita Y.S. Patterson J. Haites R. McMillan B.N. Coppel R. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9011-9017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, synthesis of LAM was unaffected by this mutation, and conversely, we have recently demonstrated that the synthesis of the PIMs was unaffected in a mutant unable to synthesize LM but endowed with a truncated LAM, questioning for the first time the implied linear relationship of PIM1 → PIM2 → PIM3 → PIM4 → LM → LAM (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite the sophistication of our understanding of the structures and functions of LM/LAM, nothing was known until recently of the ManTs responsible for the latter polymerization steps. LM consists of a linear α(1 → 6) linked mannan backbone extending from C-6 of myo-inositol modulated by α(1 → 2) Manp side branches, the product of the integral membranous GT-C ManT, Rv2181, and decaprenol-P-Manp (C50-P-Man) rather than GDP-Man as the Manp donor (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). EmbC of the Emb operon combining with C50-P-Araf as the Araf donor are responsible, at least in part, for the synthesis of arabinans of LAM, presumably relying on LM as acceptor (18Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The requirement for lipid-linked sugar donors for the later polymerization steps in the biosynthesis of LM and LAM implicates the membranous GT-C superfamily as distinct from members of the soluble GDP-Man requiring GTs of the GT-A or GT-B superfamilies (19Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have developed a strategy involving genetic mutations of members of the GT-C superfamily and examination of the biochemical phenotype in an effort to understand the final polymerization steps in the synthesis of LM and LAM. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Sequence Analysis—The wild type strain (WT) of M. smegmatis mc2155 and the mutant generated in this study were grown as described (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of M. smegmatis mc2155 and the M. smegmatis-ΔMSMEG4245 mutant was performed in LB medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, with or without kanamycin (Km), as appropriate; 1 μCi/ml of [14C]glucose (50–62 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cultures at A600 nm 0.4. DNA sequence information from finished and unfinished genomes was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Amino acid sequences were aligned at ClustalW. Similarity searches were performed by SIM alignment; secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and transmembrane topology were predicted by the Transmembrane Hidden Markov Model (TMHMM 2.0). Construction of M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 and Cloning of Rv2174—MSMEG4245 and its flanking regions were amplified by PCR with the forward 5′-TATAATCTAGAGTTCACCGAACAGCACCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TATAATCTAGACGGTCCAGGCGCGTGTC-3′ primers; XbaI sites are underlined. The 3.5-kb PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM (Promega). The resulting plasmid, pGEM-MSMEG4245, was digested with AgeI and XhoI, resulting in a deletion of about 900 bp within the MSMEG4245 coding sequence, which was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with a Km resistance (Kmr) gene excised from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) by HincII digestion. A 3.2-kb fragment of MSMEG4245::Km was then excised from the resulting plasmid with XbaI and inserted into the XbaI site of the temperature-sensitive pPR27xylE. The plasmid, pPR27xylEMSMEG4245::Km, was transformed into M. smegmatis, and transformants were selected on LB-Km plates at 30 °C. Two Kmr and xylE + transformants were then propagated in LB-Km liquid medium at 30 °C prior to plating on LB-Km-sucrose plates at 42 °C. Allelic replacement of MSMEG4245 was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The blots were hybridized with a 3.5-kb 32P-labeled DNA probe generated by digestion of the PCR fragment subcloned in the pGEM vector as described above. To produce the complementation plasmid, pVV16Rv2174, the full-length Rv2174 gene was amplified by PCR from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA by using the primers 5′-TATAACATATGACTACTCCGAGCCATG-3′ and 5′-TATAAAAGCTTCTATGGCGTATTGACCAC-3′, containing an NdeI and HindIII restriction site, respectively (underlined) to enable direct cloning into the expression vector pVV16, a derivative of pMV261 (20Stover C.K. de l.C.V.

Plasmid pVV16Rv2174 was transferred by electroporation into M. smegmatis-ΔMSMEG4245, and transformants were selected on plates containing kanamycin and hygromycin. Analysis of PIMs, LM, and LAM—Cells were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The residue was extracted with equal volumes of water and phosphate-buffered saline-saturated phenol at 80 °C for 2 h. The aqueous layer on cooling (containing LAM, LM, and PIMs) was dialyzed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by periodic acid Schiff staining (21Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) on commercial 10–20% gradient Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Blotting to nitrocellulose membrane was performed at 50 V for 1 h. Immunodetection was performed with monoclonal antibody CS-35, specific for the arabinan component of LAM (22Kaur D. Lowary T.L. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Microbiology (Reading). 2002; 148: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and concanavalin A (ConA), which recognizes terminal Manp residues. The nitrocellulose membranes probed with ConA-peroxidase were subsequently developed with the 4-chloro-1-naphthol/3,3′-diaminobenzidine, tetrahydrochloride substrate kit (Pierce). In the case of 14C-labeled products, membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at -70 °C for 15 days. Gel filtration chromatography of deacylated lipid fractions was conducted on a Bio-Gel P-100 column (1.5 × 120 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm acetic acid. For structural characterization, requiring large amounts of products, the WT M. smegmatis and the M. smegmatis-ΔMSMEG4245 mutant cells were harvested in late log phase from 24 liters of liquid medium and lyophilized. Dried cells were delipidated with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and freeze-thawed before mechanical disruption by sonication (23Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusova K. Brennan P.J.

The resulting suspension was refluxed in 50% ethanol three times for 2 h each time. The combined supernatants were evaporated and digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) followed by dialysis. The aqueous solution was further purified by a two-step protocol involving hydrophobic and gel exclusion chromatography (24Berg S. Starbuck J. Torrelles J.B. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5651-5663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the LM and mutated LM were monitored on Tricine gels stained with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent, pooled, and dialyzed. Analytical Procedures—To determine linkage patterns, samples were per-O-methylated (25Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and alditol acetates were prepared as described (26McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), solubilized in CHCl3, and analyzed by GC/MS (Thermoquest GCQ Plus; Thermo Electron Corp). For MALDI-TOF/MS, the matrix consisted of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a mixture of water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1.0 μg of sample mixed with 1.0 μl of the matrix solution. Analyses were performed on a Bruker Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument using reflector mode detection. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode for the underivatized material and positive mode for the permethylated sample using a 30-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 94% and full accelerating voltage (25 kV). The mass spectra were mass-assigned using external calibration. NMR spectra were acquired after several lyophilizations in D2O of 1 mg/0.6 ml in 100% D2O. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. Sugar composition of selected fractions from the Bio-gel P-100 sizing column was determined after hydrolysis with 2 m CF3COOH for 2 h at 120 °C. Deacylation of the 14C-labeled CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) fraction and phenol-extracted LM/LAM fractions was performed as described (27Mikusova K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 28Mikusova K. Mikus M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Deacylated “mutLM” (dmutLM) was chromatographed on HPTLC plates (Merck), which were developed once in each solvent system: propanol/nitromethane/water (5:2.3:2.7, v/v), propanol/nitromethane/water (5:2:3, v/v), propanol/nitromethane/water (5:1.7:3.3, v/v), and propanol/nitromethane/water (5:1.4:3.6, v/v) (29Tsai P.K. Frevert J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3805-3811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing chromatograms to Kodak X-Omat AR films at -70 °C for 4–5 days. Genome Comparisons of the MSMEG4245 Locus—We analyzed an 18-kb chromosomal region of the M. smegmatis genome coding a known GT-C ManT, MSMEG4250 (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and compared it with that of other mycobacteria, corynebacteria, and nocardia (Fig. 1A). This region includes two other putative GTs (MSMEG4245, MSMEG4257) and an unidentified acyltransferase (MSMEG4251) suggestive of a possible PIM/LM/LAM gene cluster. Based on blast analysis, this set of genes is conserved in Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and Mycobacterium leprae as well as in corynebacteria and nocardia, indicative of functionality common to actinomycetes. MSMEG4245 shows significant homology to PIG-M, a eukaryotic ManT utilizing a PI-based sugar acceptor and a polyprenyl-linked sugar donor. Further, the amino acid sequence of MSMEG4245 is highly similar to that of the orthologs in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis, M. leprae, nocardia, and corynebacteria (Fig. 1B). MSMEG4245 is a 505-amino acid membrane protein containing 12 predicted transmembrane-spanning domains with both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus predicted to be located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). A DGLD motif is located in an extracytoplasmic loop predicted beyond the third transmembrane domain, which may correspond to the DXD signature commonly found in members of the GT-C superfamily (30Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); this conserved motif has been shown to be critical for the function of several eukaryotic (31Kang J.Y.

Taken all together, the predicted structural features as well as the localization of MSMEG4245, close to MSMEG4250, a GT-C ManT involved in LM/LAM biosynthesis (17Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P. Gicquel B. Chatterjee D. McNeil M.R. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggest that MSMEG4245 represents a GT involved in LM/LAM biosynthesis. Construction of M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 by Allelic Exchange and Growth Phenotype—The ortholog of MSMEG4245 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv is Rv2174, reportedly an essential enzyme (34Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). Attempts to generate a knock-out mutant of MSMEG4245 in M. smegmatis by homologous recombination using the thermosensitive vector pPR27 were successful (supplemental Fig. 1A). Two types of colonies grew on LB-Km-Suc plates at 42 °C; 80% of them were of the normal expected size, whereas the other 20% were unusually small. Spraying with catechol revealed that only the small colonies exhibited the expected phenotype for allelic exchange mutants and the large colonies all displayed a XylE-positive phenotype. Further analysis by Southern blot of nine Kmr-Sucr-XylE- colonies revealed that all had undergone gene replacement at the MSMEG4245 locus (supplemental Fig. 1B). M. smegmatis-ΔMSMEG4245 grew slowly in Sauton medium and failed to grow at 42 °C (supplemental Fig. 1C). It also displayed smaller colonies on LB-Km plates and an enhanced tendency to clump. Clearly, MSMEG4245 is not essential but is required for optimal growth. Effects of MSMEG4245 Inactivation on LM/LAM Synthesis—The hypothesis that MSMEG4245 is present in a genetic cluster likely involved in PIM, LM, and LAM biosynthesis led to a comparison of the status of these glycolipids/lipoglycans from the wild type and mutant strains. Preliminary examination of the phenol extracts of whole cells by SDS-PAGE revealed the accumulation of a new major product, intermediate in size between LM and PIMs, referred to as mutLM (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, there was a complete absence of WT LM and LAM from this mutant. This newly accumulated product was acid-stable and base-labile, indicative of the presence of fatty acyl esters. MutLM reacted strongly to ConA (Fig. 2B), specific for t-Manp residues, but not to the monoclonal antibody CS-35 (data not shown), known to react with the arabinan component of LAM. Thus, the evidence pointed to the synthesis of an altered mannooligosaccharide in the PI-containing LM, intermediate in size between the PIMs and LM proper. Altogether, these data point to a block in LM/LAM synthesis and infer that the putative GT-C GT, MSMEG4245, plays a key role in their biosynthesis, beyond the PIM pathway. Complementation of M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 with Rv2174 Restores LM and LAM Synthesis—The identity between the amino acid sequence of MSMEG4245 and its ortholog Rv2174, of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, is 67%. To obtain evidence that Rv2174 is also a functional ortholog of M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245, it was placed under the control of the hsp60 promoter in the mycobacterial expression vector pVV16 and transformed into M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245. Complementation of the mutant with Rv2174 restored the wild type growth phenotype insensitive to temperature. LM/LAM was extracted with phenol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The complementation of the mutant with Rv2174 also led to restoration of LM and LAM, whereas cells transformed with vector alone had the same phenotype as M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of these molecules showed patterns consistent with those of the WT LM and LAM (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that Rv2174 is the functional equivalent of MSMEG4245. Characterization of 14C-labeled mutLM—M. smegmatis WT and M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 were metabolically labeled with [14C]glucose, and lipids were extracted and analyzed. Sequential extraction of M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), and phenol revealed that unlike WT LM, mutLM was almost completely solubilized in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), as revealed by Tricine gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography, further indicative of a heterogeneous less polar population (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) extracts by HPTLC or two-dimensional TLC revealed no significant alterations in PIM composition. Also, in accordance with results in Fig. 2A, a minor amount of 14C-labeled mutLM appeared in the phenol-extracted LM/LAM fraction from the mutant, and there was an absence of LM and LAM as compared with WT, as shown by Tricine gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2D). Deacylation of the 14C-labeled mutLM (dmutLM) from CHCl3/CH3OH:/H2O (10:10:3) extracts and subsequent Bio-Gel P-100 gel filtration chromatography lead to a single main peak (Fig. 3A). No radioactivity eluted at this position from a similar fraction obtained from WT M. smegmatis. The profile from the LM/LAM fraction of the WT strain showed the expected 14C-labeled dLAM and dLM eluting at positions prior to 14C-labeled dmutLM from the mutant. Sugar compositional analysis of the peak representing 14C-labeled dmutLM revealed [14C]Man as the main component with minor amounts of Gal and Glc; [14C]arabinose was absent (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that mutLM is probably a novel member of the PIM family, more extensively mannosylated than PIM6, less so than LM. However, mutLM is not a single product in that the 14C-labeled dmutLM, as eluted from the Bio-Gel P-100 column and resolved by HPTLC in a highly polar solvent, revealed a hierarchical array of products with an obvious difference in the degree of labeling (Fig. 3C). These data imply that the accumulated mutLM contains a heterogeneous population of mannooligosaccharides, namely a novel class of extended PIMs or shorter LMs. Quantitative analysis of the alditol acetate derivatives of WT LM demonstrated a Man/inositol ratio of 15:1. In comparison, mutLM isolated from M. smegmatisΔMSMEG4245 demonstrated a relationship of 8:1. The MALDI-TOF/MS spectrum of mutLM in the negative mode was dominated by a set of peaks assigned to PI-linked mannooligosaccharides or their acylated counterparts with a mannan domain of up to 20 Manp units. The most abundant version contained one palmitoyl and one tuberculostearoyl group, whereas the acylated version had an additional palmitoyl chain (supplemental Table 1), all in accord with the known composition of the PIM, LM, and LAM populations (35Gilleron M. Nigou J. Nicolle D. Quesniaux V. Puzo G. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 39-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Independent of the degree of acylation, the number of Manp units for each form varied between 5 and 20, with the most abundant being Man13–15. The abundance and fatty acid composition of these PI-linked mannooligosaccharides are similar to those of PIM2 (36Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol.

Phosphorylation of RyR2 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II modulates channel activity. Hyperphosphorylation at a single amino acid residue, Ser-2808, has been proposed to directly disrupt the binding of a 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12.6) to RyR2, causing a RyR2 malfunction that triggers cardiac arrhythmias in human heart failure. To determine the structural basis of the interaction between Ser-2808 and FKBP12.6, we have employed two independent approaches to map this phosphorylation site in RyR2 by three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy. In one approach, we inserted a green fluorescent protein (GFP) after amino acid Tyr-2801, and mapped the GFP three-dimensional location in the RyR2 structure. In another approach, the binding site of monoclonal antibody 34C was mapped in the three-dimensional structure of skeletal muscle RyR1. The epitope of antibody 34C has been mapped to amino acid residues 2,756 through 2,803 of the RyR1 sequence, corresponding to residues 2,722 through 2,769 of the RyR2 sequence. These locations of GFP insertion and antibody binding are adjacent to one another in domain 6 of the cytoplasmic clamp region. Importantly, the three-dimensional location of the Ser-2808 phosphorylation site is 105-120Å distance from the FKBP12.6 binding site mapped previously, indicating that Ser-2808 is unlikely to be directly involved in the binding of FKBP12.6 to RyR2, as had been proposed previously.

SCD is the leading cause of natural death in the United States, producing about 330,000 deaths each year (1 American Heart Association, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, Dallas, TX2007Google Scholar). SCD occurs when the electrical system in the heart malfunctions, leading to fatal arrhythmias. Most cases of SCD can be explained by cardiovascular abnormalities identifiable at autopsy, but some SCD is associated with structurally normal hearts (2Tester D.J. Spoon D.B. Valdivia H.H. Makielski J.C. Ackerman M.J. Mayo Clin. Proc. 2004; 79: 1380-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In some such cases, abnormal calcium release through a dysfunctional cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor (type 2 RyR, or RyR2) has been implicated, and molecular genetic analysis has demonstrated that mutations in the RyR2 gene can be linked to about 14% of these structurally normal heart SCD cases (2Tester D.J.

RyR2 functions as a calcium release channel in the heart, where it plays a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling. To date, more than 60 naturally occurring mutations in RyR2 have been linked to two genetic forms of ventricular arrhythmias: catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2; Refs. 2Tester D.J.

These mutations are largely clustered in three regions of the RyR2 amino acid sequence: region 1 is near the N terminus, from residues 77 to 466; region 2 is near the middle of the sequence, spanning residues 1,724 through 2,958; and region 3 includes both cytoplasmic and membrane-associated regions of the sequence and comprises residues 3,778 through 4,959. Intriguingly, the same three regions are homologous to the three malignant hyperthermia and central core disease mutation regions in skeletal isoform RyR (type 1 RyR or RyR1, Ref. 7McCarty T.V. Quane K.A. Lynch P.J. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), suggesting that the three regions represent structural domains critical for the regulation of both RyR1 and RyR2, and suggesting also that the molecular pathologies underlying these RyR-linked skeletal and cardiac muscle diseases involve similar mechanisms. The causal relationships among RyR2 mutations, the abnormal Ca2+ release function, and physiological manifestation is under investigation. Some mechanisms underlying RyR2 channel dysfunction in SCD have been proposed, including channel instability because of destabilization of the RyR2-FKBP12.6 interaction (8Marx S.O. Reiken S.

FKBP is an isomerase that is widely expressed and involved in many cell functions. Two isoforms, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, bind tightly to RyR1 and RyR2, respectively, and they are considered to be integral subunits of RyR (15Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S.

FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 have been shown to stabilize the closed state of the RyR1 and RyR2 Ca2+ channels, thereby preventing inappropriate spontaneous channel openings (17Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K.

Subsequently, Wehrens et al. (9Wehrens X.H.T. Lehnart S.E. Huang F. Vest J.A. Reiken S.R. Mohler P.J. Sun J. Guatimosim S. Song L-S. Rosemblit N. D'Armiento J.M. Napolitano C. Memmi M. Priori S.G. Lederer W.J. Marks A.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) have shown that disease-causing mutations in RyR2 (three CPVT mutations: S2246L, R2474S, and R4497C) reduced the binding affinity of FKBP12.6 for RyR2, and increased the channel leakage that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias under physical and emotional stresses. However, the mechanisms proposed by Marx, Wehrens, and colleagues are not consistent with other laboratory findings. Li et al. (19Li Y. Kranias E.G. Mignery G.A. Bers D.M. Circ.

Xiao et al. (22Xiao B. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. Chen S.R.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) found that FKBP12.6 can bind to both the Ser-2808 (mouse) phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of RyR2, and that a S2808D phosphomimetic mutant retained the ability to bind FKBP12.6. Furthermore, complete phosphorylation at Ser-2808 by exogenous PKA did not disrupt the FKBP12.6-RyR2 complex. George et al. (23George C.H. Higgs G.V. Lai A.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CPVT RyR2 mutations augmented Ca2+ release, yet the RyR2-FKBP12.6 complex remained intact. The binding sites for FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 have been mapped in the three-dimensional structures of RyR1 and RyR2, respectively (24Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H-B.

However, no information regarding the phosphorylation site Ser-2808 in the RyR three-dimensional architecture has been reported. We believe that a direct structural approach to localize the Ser-2808 in the three-dimensional structure of RyR is relevant to testing the proposed FKBP12.6 dissociation mechanism. Recently, we have mapped two mutation hotspots in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2 by green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling at specific amino acid residues, combined with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle image processing methods (26Liu Z.

In the present study, we employed the same structural approach to determine the Ser-2808 phosphorylation site in the three-dimensional structure of RyR, thereby directly testing the mechanism of PKA phosphorylation-induced FKBP12.6 dissociation that was proposed by Marks and colleagues. We have used two independent approaches to identify the three-dimensional location of the phosphorylation site. In the first approach, we inserted GFP after amino acid Tyr-2801, and mapped its three-dimensional location in the RyR2 structure. In the second approach, the binding site of monoclonal antibody 34C (mAb34C) was mapped in the three-dimensional structure of RyR1. The epitope of the 34C antibody has previously been determined to include amino acid residues 2,756 through 2,803 of RyR1, corresponding to residues 2,722 through 2,769 of RyR2 (28Tong J. Oyamada H.

We found that the mapped GFP insertion site and the antibody binding site are adjacent to one another in domain 6 of the cytoplasmic clamp region. However, neither site is close to the FKBP12.6 binding site mapped previously. Construction of RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP—The A4860G mutation was introduced into the mouse RyR2 as described previously (29Wang R. Bolstad J. Kong H. Zhang L. Brown C. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To generate the RyR2Y2801-GFP construct, the cDNA encoding the GFP, which was flanked by a glycine-rich linker and an AscI endonuclease restriction site, was obtained by PCR as described previously (30Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An AscI site was introduced into RyR2A4860G after Tyr-2801 by overlap-extension PCR. The “outer” primers are: forward, 5′-ACCATCTATGATGCAACACCTA-3′; and reverse, 5′-CTTGGCTGTCAGTGTGTCATAA-3′. The “inner” primers are: forward, 5′-ATGGCCCTTTATGGGCGCGCCCGACGAATTTCTCAGACA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGAAATTCGTCGGGCGCGCCCATAAAGGGCCATGCTGTC-3′. The AscI fragment containing the cDNA encoding GFP and the linkers was then subcloned into the full-length RyR2A4860G after Tyr-2801 to yield RyR2Y2801-GFP, containing the A4860G mutation. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (31Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18-20 h after subculture were transfected with 12 μg of RyRA4860G or RyRY2801-GFP cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation. Expression and Purification of RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP—HEK293 cells grown for 24-26 h after transfection were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 2.5 mm EDTA and were harvested in the same solution by centrifugation for 8 min at 700 × g in an IEC Centra-CL2 centrifuge. The cell pellets were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Na-PIPES (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g twice in a micro-centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min, and the cell lysates were collected. Sucrose (400 mm final concentration) and NaCl (400 mm final concentration) were added to the cell lysates. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl) containing 400 μg of bound glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12.6 fusion protein were added to the cell lysates, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 days. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS and 0.25% egg lecithin. The RyR2 proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with 100 mm glutathione in 25 mm Na-PIPES (pH 7.2), 400 mm NaCl, 400 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.16% egg lecithin, 200 mm Tris/HEPES (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min. The eluate was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -90 °C. Ca2+ Release Measurement and [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—The concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ in the transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 as described previously (31Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was carried out as described previously (32Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Fluorescence Imaging—The purified RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP proteins were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and were detected by Western blotting using anti-RyR antibody (1:1000) and anti-GFP antibody (1:1000) (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) as described previously (30Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For detection of the green fluorescence of RyR2Y2801-GFP, HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips placed in a 100-mm tissue culture dish and transfected with RyR2Y2801-GFP as described above. 24 h after transfection, the coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on a glass slide, and visualized with a Leica DMRB fluorescent microscope using a ×40 objective. mAb34C Fab Purification and Activity Test—The mAb34C hybridoma cell line was injected into mice to produce ascites fluid. MAb34C IgG was purified from 1.2 ml of ascites fluid by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein A using the Pierce ImmunoPure IgG purification kit as described by the manufacturer (Perbio Science, Rockford, IL). Fab fragments were obtained from purified IgG by papain digestion using Pierce ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit. To test the binding activity of Fab, a precipitation experiment was performed: 40 μg of GST-FKBP12 with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and 12 μg of purified 34c Fab with or without 20 μg of RyR1, were incubated separately for 30 min at room temperature, and the two complexes were then mixed together and incubated for a further 30 min. The whole protein complexes were eluted and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purification of RyR1 and Preparation of RyR1 + mAb34c Fab Complexes—RyR1 was isolated from terminal cisternae vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle as previously described (33Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RyR1 + mAb34c Fab complexes were formed by addition of mAb34c Fab fragments to purified RyR1 with a molar ratio 8:1 (8 Fab fragments per RyR monomer), and incubated for 30 min. Cryo-electron Microscopy and Image Processing—EM grids were prepared for cryo-EM by an FEI Vitrobot computer-controlled freeze-plunging instrument (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). Micrographs were recorded using low-dose protocols on an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV, equipped with an Oxford CT3500 cryo-transfer holder (Gatan, Inc., Warrendale, PA). The temperature of the grids was maintained at around -170 °C. The defocus of the micrographs ranged between 1.5 and 4.5 μm, at a magnification of 50,760 × (±2%). To obtain more side-view information of the RyR molecules, we tilted the grids between 0° and 50° during data collection. Each exposure corresponded to an electron dose of ∼10 e-/Å2. Micrographs were checked for drift, astigmatism, and the presence of Thon rings by optical diffraction. Selected electron micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss/Imaging scanner (Z/I Imaging Corporation, Huntsville, Alabama) with a step size of 14 μm. Images were processed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional multi-reference classification analysis, each particle image was assigned to one group of a set of different orientations after the first round of projection matching, and two-dimensional averages for each group were computed for both the control RyR1 and the RyR1 + mAb34C Fab complex. A set of multi-reference images was generated by mixing the control RyR1 and RyR1 + mAb34C Fab complex two-dimensional averages (with 0 to 4 Fab fragments occupied the binding sites). The particles from the RyR1 + mAb34C Fab complex dataset were subjected to a supervised classification employing the multi-reference image templates, and particles were assigned to a class based on the highest similarity (judged by the cross-correlation coefficient, Ref. 35Frank J. Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Oxford University Press, New York2006: 145-192Crossref Google Scholar). Any particles without 4 Fab fragments bound were then eliminated from the dataset in the following image processing. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained from images of particles lying in all available orientations, through a projection matching procedure (36Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The final three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2A4860G, RyR2Y2801-GFP, control RyR1, and the RyR1 + mAB34C Fab complex were computed from 7,591, 6,086, 16,043, and 16,782 particle images, respectively, ensuring that the particle orientations covered the entire angular space, and that each view would be represented by almost equal numbers of particles. 4-fold symmetry was enforced in all three-dimensional reconstructions. The final resolutions were estimated to be 27 Å by the Fourier shell correlation with a cut-off of 0.5 (37Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Junemann R. Burkhardt N.

Construction, Expression, Functional Characterization, and Purification of RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP—We have previously shown that mutation A4860G, located in the pore inner helix of RyR2, displays a reduced basal channel activity and a reduced sensitivity to activation by caffeine (29Wang R. Bolstad J. Kong H. Zhang L. Brown C. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the A4860G mutation stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We reasoned that such a mutant channel would be superior to the wild-type channel for structural studies. Indeed, we found that the A4860G mutant protein can be readily purified and visualized by cryo-EM as intact, square-shaped particles, and there is no structural difference between the wild-type and A4860G RyR2s. Accordingly, the A4860G mutant RyR2 (RyR2A4860G) was subsequently used as the control for our structural studies. To determine the location of the phosphorylation site, Ser-2808, in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2, GFP was inserted after Tyr-2801 in the RyR2A4860G (Fig. 1A). The resulting GFP-RyR2 fusion protein, RyR2Y2801-GFP, was expressed in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, HEK293 cells expressing RyR2Y2801-GFP were readily detected by their green fluorescence, indicating proper folding of the inserted GFP. To determine whether RyR2Y2801-GFP functions as a Ca2+ release channel, we measured intracellular Ca2+ release, using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 AM) in HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2A4860G or RyR2Y2801-GFP. As shown in Fig. 1C, HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2Y2801-GFP cDNA displayed multiple Ca2+ release events in response to repeated stimulation by caffeine, a well known RyR activator. Interestingly, the addition of ryanodine led to a diminished response to multiple caffeine stimulations (Fig. 1D). This diminution most likely resulted from modulation of the channel by ryanodine, which is known to bind only to the open state of the channel, and to dramatically increase the channel open probability. As a consequence of binding, the ryanodine-modified channel no longer responded to further caffeine stimulation (30Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RyR2Y2801-GFP is sensitive to caffeine and ryanodine modification. Importantly, the Ca2+ release responses of RyR2Y2801-GFP to caffeine and ryanodine were similar to those observed for the control RyR2A4860G. Furthermore, RyR2Y2801-GFP and RyR2A4860G showed similar Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 1E). The EC50 for Ca2+ of RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP are 0.32 ± 0.01 μm and 0.31 ± 0.02 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 6), respectively. These data suggest that the RyR2Y2801-GFP protein retains proper folding and channel function. The RyR2A4860G and RyR2Y2801-GFP proteins were purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography, with GST-FKBP12.6 used as the affinity ligand (30Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A single high molecular mass band, which migrated at a slightly slower rate than the RyR2A4860G band did (as expected, due to the additional mass of GFP), was detected in the purified sample of RyR2Y2801-GFP. This band was recognized by both the anti-RyR and anti-GFP antibodies. On the other hand, the purified RyR2A4860G protein was recognized only by the anti-RyR antibody (Fig. 1F).

Membrane trafficking is essential for eukaryotic cells to proliferate, differentiate, and perform various physiological processes such as neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, fibroblast motility, and pathogen engulfment. It also plays certain roles in mammalian spermiogenesis, a differentiation process of postmeiotic male germ cells (spermatids) into mature elongated spermatozoa, including acrosome and flagellum formation, nuclear elongation and condensation, and mitochondrial rearrangement (1Clermont Y.

In early developing spermatids, numerous proteins and membranes necessary for acrosomal biogenesis are delivered to the immature acrosomal vesicle via the Golgi-derived vesicles (1Clermont Y. Oko R.

Some portion of glycoproteins has been found to be simultaneously sorted away from this acrosome pathway to be transported to the endosomal system (3Clermont Y. Tang X.M. Anat.

Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is catalyzed by the sequential action of three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity and direct the transfer of the activated ubiquitin moiety to substrate proteins. They are grouped into two major families based on the presence of the E3 catalytic core domain; that is, the RING-finger and HECT families. Several ubiquitin ligases have been shown to ubiquitinate plasma membrane proteins, including receptors, transporters, and ion channels, leading to their endocytic sorting to the MVB and subsequent lysosomal degradation (14Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By contrast, little is known about E3 molecules responsible for ubiquitin-mediated sorting at the TGN, with the exception of two yeast proteins, Rsp5 (15Helliwell S.B. Losko S. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and Tul1 (16Reggiori F. Pelham H.R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In rat spermatids, ubiquitinated proteins have been shown to be abundant on membranes of the TGN and MVBs (17Haraguchi C.M. Mabuchi T. Hirata S. Shoda T. Hoshi K. Yokota S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting mechanism in the TGN-MVB pathway. As yet the E3 molecules responsible for mediating these ubiquitination have not been identified. Recently, a novel family of RING-finger ubiquitin ligases has been identified in mammals, termed membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) or c-MIR (cellular modulator of immune regulation) (18Bartee E.

Dodd R. Duncan L.M. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the majority shares a similar structure, an N-terminal C4HC3-type RING finger (RING-CH finger) and two or more C-terminal transmembrane spans (18Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Früh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among them, MARCH-IV, -VIII, and -IX have been shown to ubiquitinate and down-regulate transmembrane glycoproteins, such as major histocompatibility complex class I and II, B7-2, CD166, and ICAM-1 (18Bartee E.

Aoki M. Goto E. Mito M. Uematsu M. Kakiuchi T. Hotta H. Ishido S. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Particularly, ubiquitination of major histocompatibility complex class I leads to its endocytosis and subsequent sorting to the MVB pathway for lysosomal degradation (18Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Früh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Previously we have demonstrated that MARCH-II and -III are endosomal proteins bound to the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 and are involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking (24Fukuda H. Nakamura N. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Nakamura N. Fukuda H. Kato A. Hirose S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1696-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, it is conceivable that the MARCH family could function in protein sorting and transport. In this study we identified a novel member of the MARCH family, termed MARCH-XI, that is highly expressed in developing spermatids of rats. To address the role of MARCH-XI in spermiogenesis, we determined its subcellular localization and identified associated proteins. Our results suggest that MARCH-XI is likely a ubiquitin ligase mediating protein sorting in the TGN-MVB pathway. Cloning of MARCH-XI—A partial cDNA fragment of MARCH-XI was obtained from rat brain by PCR amplification with primers 5′-TGTCTAGACACTTGGTCCACCCAAC-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGAAGTGCTATGGTTTTGCCATTC-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the XbaI site of pBluescript II SK– (Stratagene), yielding pBS-Kdg5Xba. A rat testis λ cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened by the standard method with the XbaI fragment of pBS-Kdg5Xba as a probe. Positive clones were plaque-purified, and the cDNA inserts were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK–, yielding pBS-Kdg5#9–4. The nucleotide sequence for rat MARCH-XI has been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL databases with accession number AB048841. Plasmids—A mammalian expression vector for MARCH-XI (pcDNA3-MARCH-XI) was constructed by cloning the 1.4-kilobase PstI-EcoRI fragment of pBS-Kdg5#9–4 into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To construct a mammalian expression vector for the deletion mutant lacking the last amino acid residue of MARCH-XI (pcDNA3-MARCH-XIΔ), the cDNA fragment encoding residues 167–397 of MARCH-XI was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AAGATCTGCTTCCAGGGCGCGGAGCAGGGT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCAAGACGTCACTCTCATCACTAC-3′, digested with BglII and XhoI, and then inserted into the same sites of pBS-Kdg5#9–4, yielding pBS-Kdg5Δ. Then, the SacII-XhoI fragment of pBS-Kdg5Δ was inserted into the same sites of pcDNA3-MARCH-XI, yielding pcDNA3-MARCH-XIΔ. To generate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-His6-Xpress expression vector (pGex-His6-Xpress), a cDNA fragment encoding a His6-Xpress tag was amplified by PCR from pTrcHis (Invitrogen) with the primers 5′-GGCCAGATCTATGGGGGGTTCTCATCAT-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGATCCTTTATCGTCATCGTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with BglII and BamHI and then inserted into the BamHI site of pGex4T (GE Healthcare). GST-His6-Mar11N was constructed by cloning the fragment encoding residues 1–146 of MARCH-XI into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGex-His6-Xpress. His-Mar11C and His-Mar11CΔ were constructed by cloning the fragments encoding residues 323–398 and 323–397 of MARCH-XI, respectively, into the XhoI-EcoRI sites of pRSET (Invitrogen). GST-RING was constructed by cloning the fragment encoding residues 147–227 of MARCH-XI into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGex4T. GST-GOPC was constructed by cloning of the coding region of rat GOPC into pGex4T. FLAG-CD4 was constructed by cloning of the fragment encoding residues 29–457 of rat CD4 into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the FLAG-furin expression vector (25Nakamura N. Fukuda H. Kato A. Hirose S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1696-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 3 × FLAG-tagged μ1-adaptin was constructed by cloning of the coding region of rat μ1A-adaptin into the HindIII-XhoI sites of p3 × FLAG-CMV10 (Sigma). Myc-tagged Veli-3 was constructed by cloning of the coding region of rat Veli-3 into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pCMV-Myc (Clontech). GST-Veli was described previously (25Nakamura N. Fukuda H. Kato A. Hirose S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1696-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All point mutations were introduced by site-direct mutagenesis using PCR. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The GST-fusion and His6-tagged proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and Talon metal affinity resins (Clontech), respectively. Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against saline, with the exception that His-Mar11C and His-Mar11CΔ were done against 2% Triton X-100 solution. For detail information, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were purchased. Anti-ubiquitin (Ubi-1) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., anti-γ-adaptin (clone 88) and anti-TGN38 (clone 2) were from BD Transduction Laboratories, anti-ubiquitin (FK1) was from Biomol, anti-FLAG (M2), anti-His6, and anti-GST were from Sigma, and anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-HA (3F10) were from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit and rat polyclonal anti-Mar11 antisera were raised against a GST-His6-Mar11N protein. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Veli and anti-GOPC antisera were raised against GST-Veli and GST-GOPC proteins, respectively. The immunization protocols and the specificity of rabbit and rat anti-Mar11 antisera are described in the supplemental data. The anti-Veli and anti-GOPC immunoaffinity beads were prepared as follows. The appropriate antigen (2 mg) was covalently coupled to 1 ml of the HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacture's protocol. The antiserum (5 ml) was incubated with the affinity column for 30 min at room temperature. Then, after washing with 15 ml of 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, bound antibodies were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 and subsequently dialyzed against 0.1 m Na2PO4, pH 7.0. The affinity-purified anti-Veli and anti-GOPC antibodies (500 μg of IgG each) were coupled to 500 μl of the Carbolink gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed with 32P-labeled XbaI fragment of pBS-Kdg5Xba as described previously (24Fukuda H. Nakamura N. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Maintenance of cultured cells and transient transfection were described previously (24Fukuda H. Nakamura N. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For ubiquitination experiments, at 16–20 h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in culture medium containing 50 nm concanamycin A (Wako), a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase used to prevent the lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated CD4 (26Mansouri M.

In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Purified GST-RING or GST-RINGmut (1 μg) was incubated with a mixture (20 μl) composed of 0.1 μg of rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 1 μg of purified recombinant His6-tagged E2 (24Fukuda H. Nakamura N. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 1 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma), and 1 mm creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) in an ATP-regeneration buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm creatine phosphate) for 4 h at 30 °C. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with a tank-blotting apparatus (Atto) as described previously (27Nakamura N. Kimura Y. Tokuda M. Honda S. Hirose S. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin conjugates were detected with anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation—All operations were carried out at 4 °C, and all solutions and buffers were added with protease inhibitors (10 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-CD4, the membrane fractions were lysed with TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA). The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) followed by Western blotting as described previously (27Nakamura N. Kimura Y. Tokuda M. Honda S. Hirose S. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of MARCH-XI, rat testes (3 g) were homogenized in 30 ml of SPH buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 m KCl, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0). The homogenate was layered onto a 1.5 m sucrose cushion (12 ml) in an SW28 tube (Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged for 2 h at 25,000 rpm on an SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The membrane fraction (0.25/1.5 m sucrose interface) was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm on an SW41 rotor. The resulting membrane pellet was lysed with 6 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was incubated with 20 μlof protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and 2 μl of rabbit anti-Mar11 antiserum overnight. For immunoprecipitation of Veli or GOPC, the lysate was incubated for 4 h with 500 μl of the anti-Veli or anti-GOPC immunoaffinity beads. After washing 7 times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, the beads were eluted with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Lectin Blotting—The rat testicular membranes were lysed in 6 ml of TNE buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysate (800 μg of protein) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-Mar11 or preimmune serum. The eluted proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). The filter was blocked with T-TBS (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with biotin-labeled Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) (10 μg/ml in T-TBS; Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C. The filter was incubated with goat antibiotin antibody (2.5 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (1:100,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescence Microscopy—Wister rats (8 weeks old) were perfused with PBS followed by ice-cold fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). Testes were extracted, bisect, immersed with the same fixative for 2 h, and then immersed with PBS containing 15% sucrose followed by PBS containing 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. Preparation and staining of sections and smear preparations of rat testis were described previously (28Kato A. Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the exception that primary antibodies were incubated for 2 days at 4 °C. For staining of fucose glycoproteins, spermatids were incubated with 10 μg/ml biotin-labeled ALL in PBS at overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse anti-biotin monoclonal antibody (2F5; 5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies were as follows: anti-ubiquitin FK1, 1:200; anti-γ-adaptin, 1:500; anti-TGN38, 1:250; anti-Mar11, anti-Veli, and anti-GOPC, 1:1000; Alexa Fluor 488 or 546-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes), 1:2000; Cy3-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories), 1:2000. After the nuclei were stained with TO-PRO3 (2 μm; Molecular Probes) or Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes), the samples were observed with a confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy was performed by the previous method (29Sakai Y. Yamashina S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1990; 32: 389-395Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with modifications. Wister rats were perfused with ice-cold fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS). Testes were extracted, cut into small pieces (∼20 × 20 × 20 mm), and fixed in the same fixative for 2 h. The pieces of testes were further cut (∼3 × 3 × 3 mm), fixed in the same fixative for 8 h, immersed with PBS containing 7% sucrose at 4 °C, and then frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound. Cryosections (15-μm thickness) were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-Mar11 (1:300 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The samples were treated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako) followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako). Signals were developed with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The samples were post-fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (80-nm thickness) were contrasted with uranyl acetate for 10 min followed by lead citrate for 5 min and observed with an electron microscope (H-600, Hitachi). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 was purchased from Clontech. The cDNA fragments encoding rat μ1A-adaptin and μ2-adaptin were inserted into the ClaI-XhoI sites of pGADT7. The fragments encoding residues 323–398 of MARCH-XI and its Y367A mutant were inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pGBKT7, yielding pGBKT7-Mar11C and pGBKT7-Y367A, respectively. These constructs were transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (MATa) with the Fast-yeast transformation kit (Geno Technology). AH109 cells were transformed with pGADT7–53 and pGBKT7-T or with pGADT7 and pGBKT7, which were used as a positive or negative control, respectively. The double transformants were grown on SD agar plates lacking Trp and Leu, with exception of the pGADT7-μ1-pGBKT7-Mar11C and positive control clones which were grown on plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His for 3–10 days at 30 °C. Colonies were picked and restreaked on Trp–/Leu–/His– plates for selection of interacting clones and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. For β-galactosidase assay, a single colony was grown overnight at 30 °C in 2 ml of Trp–/Leu– media. A portion of each culture was centrifuged, and the yeast pellet was resuspended to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. One hundred microliters of the yeast samples were used to test β-galactosidase activity with the Beta-Glo assay system (Promega). Dot-blot Assay—Various amounts of GST and GST fusion proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes using a vacuum. The membranes were blocked with T-TBS containing 5% nonfat milk followed by incubation with His-Mar11C or His-Mar11CΔ in 2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was probed with anti-His6 or anti-GST antibody (1:3000 or 1:1000 in T-TBS) followed by anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, respectively (1:3000; Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories). Identification of a Novel Member of the MARCH Family—The sequences of a novel mammalian MARCH member were found by Blast searches of the GenBank™ expression sequence tag (EST) databases (GenBank™ accession numbers AW070319, AA868748, and AI046596). A corresponding cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification from rat brain and used to screen a rat testis cDNA library. Positive clones contained a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 398 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 44.1 kDa (Fig. 1A). A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cloned protein is the newest 11th MARCH member closely related to MARCH-IV and -IX (see Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1 for sequence alignment). Therefore, we designated this novel protein “MARCH-XI.” A hydropathy plot analysis predicted that MARCH-XI has a typical MARCH membrane topology with N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails flanking two transmembrane spans. As shown in Fig. 1A, the N-terminal tail contains proline-rich sequences (dots) and a RING-CH finger (underline), and the C terminus contains a PDZ binding sequence (wavy line; the consensus sequence E(S/T)X(V/I)) (30Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of rat tissues showed that MARCH-XI mRNA (∼1.7 kilobases) is predominantly expressed in testis and weakly in brain (Fig. 1C). In addition, reverse transcription-PCR experiments revealed that MARCH-XI is also expressed in rat pituitary and the mouse pituitary corticotroph tumor cell line AtT20/D16v (Fig. 1D). To assess the protein expression of MARCH-XI, we generated rabbit and rat polyclonal antisera specific to MARCH-XI (anti-Mar11, see supplemental Fig. S2). When membrane extracts of rat testis were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Mar11, a single band was detected at ∼48 kDa corresponding to endogenous MARCH-XI protein (Fig. 1E, arrowhead). MARCH-XI was extracted from membranes by Triton X-100 treatment but not with high salt or alkaline carbonate solution (Fig. 1F), indicating that MARCH-XI is a transmembrane protein. To examine whether the RING-CH finger of MARCH-XI possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed using an established method with recombinant GST fusion proteins of the MARCH-XI RING-CH finger (GST-RING) or its mutant containing point mutations in the conserved cysteine residues (C169S, C182S, and C184S; GST-RINGmut). As shown in Fig. 2A, GST-RING but not GST-RINGmut catalyzed the formation of polyubiquitinated products in the presence of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5B and UbcH5C. Next, we sought to address whether the full-length MARCH-XI protein exhibits an E3 activity. A previous report has demonstrated that MARCH-IV down-regulates CD4 in a manner dependent on the lysine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 (18Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Früh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD4 is likely an E3 substrate for MARCH-IV. The structural similarity of MARCH-XI to MARCH-IV allowed us to determine whether MARCH-XI has ability to ubiquitinate CD4. FLAG-tagged CD4 (FLAG-CD4) was coexpressed in COS7 cells with HA-tagged ubiquitin in the absence or presence of MARCH-XI or its RING-finger mutant. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-CD4 followed by Western blotting for HA-ubiquitin revealed increased levels of FLAG-CD4 ubiquitination in the cells expressing wild-type MARCH-XI but not the RING-finger mutant (Fig. 2B). In addition, Western blotting of the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates revealed that both wild-type and mutant MARCH-XI were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CD4, indicating that MARCH-XI acts as a ubiquitin ligase through its RING-finger domain, targeting CD4 for ubiquitination. Together, these results indicate that MARCH-XI is a transmembrane ubiquitin ligase highly expressed in testis. Stage-specific Expression in Rat Spermatids—To determine cell types that express MARCH-XI, immunofluorescence histochemistry of rat testicular sections was performed with anti-Mar11. Strong punctate staining was observed in the middle p"
https://openalex.org/W2070054741,"Replication forks that collapse upon encountering a leading strand lesion are reactivated by a recombinative repair process called replication restart. Using rolling circle DNA substrates to model replication forks, we examine the fate of the helicase and both DNA polymerases when the leading strand polymerase is blocked. We find that the helicase continues over 0.5 kb but less than 3 kb and that the lagging strand DNA polymerase remains active despite its connection to a stalled leading strand enzyme. Furthermore, the blocked leading strand polymerase remains stably bound to the replication fork, implying that it must be dismantled from DNA in order for replication restart to initiate. Genetic studies have identified at least four gene products required for replication restart, RecF, RecO, RecR, and RecA. We find here that these proteins displace a stalled polymerase at a DNA template lesion. Implications of these results for replication fork collapse and recovery are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2093594635,"Ceramide is synthesized in mammals by a family of ceramide synthases (CerS) each of which uses a relatively restricted set of fatty acyl-CoAs for N-acylation of the sphingoid long chain base (Pewzner-Jung, Y., Ben-Dor, S., and Futerman, A. H. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 25001-25005). CerS are characterized by two functional domains, the Tram-Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain and the homeobox (Hox) domain, which is found in all mammalian CerS except CerS1. We now demonstrate that the majority of the Hox domain is not required for CerS activity since its deletion in CerS5 does not affect activity. Subsequently, we define a highly conserved new motif of 12 amino acid residues that flanks the Hox and TLC domains but is not part of the TLC domain, which is essential for CerS5 and CerS6 activity. Two positively charged residues in this domain, one of which is conserved in all putative CerS in all organisms, are essential for activity since site-directed mutagenesis of either (Lys-134 and Lys-140 in CerS5) results in an ∼50% loss of activity, whereas mutation of both leads to a complete loss of activity. Because this region is conserved across species, we propose that it plays a previously unidentified and essential role in CerS activity and can be used as a new motif to define Hox domain-containing CerS. Ceramide is synthesized in mammals by a family of ceramide synthases (CerS) each of which uses a relatively restricted set of fatty acyl-CoAs for N-acylation of the sphingoid long chain base (Pewzner-Jung, Y., Ben-Dor, S., and Futerman, A.

Prominent among these are two domains, (i) the Tram-Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain, defined in a broad manner as a region of ∼200 residues also found in other proteins (7Winter E. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 381-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and in a narrower manner as the Lag domain, a region of ∼50 amino acid residues (8Venkataraman K.

Based on the presence, or not of a Hox domain, we designate CerS as (Hox)CerS (Hox domain-containing CerS) or (non-Hox)CerS (non-Hox domain-containing CerS). Recent studies have provided evidence that the catalytic activity of CerS proteins resides in the TLC domain (10Kageyama-Yahara N. Riezman H. Biochem.

In the current study we determine the role of the Hox domain in CerS activity and demonstrate that the majority of the Hox domain of CerS5 is not required for catalytic activity. However, and surprisingly, we show that a highly conserved region at the end of the Hox domain, that is, adjacent to the TLC domain but not part of the TLC domain, is essential for CerS5 and CerS6 activity. We also demonstrate that two positively charged conserved residues in this region are critical for catalytic activity and suggest that this region is a new motif that can be used to define (Hox)CerS.

Those with a TLC domain were further analyzed to determine which have Hox domains (accession number PS50071).

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of Hek293 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate method using 0.25 μg of plasmid per cm2 of culture dish, which gave a transfection efficiency of ∼80% (determined by co-transfection using green fluorescent protein). Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic Labeling—Hek293 cells were incubated with 0.33 μCi/ml [4,5-3H]sphinganine (14Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) for 30 min. Cells were subsequently scraped into methanol using a rubber policeman, lipids were extracted (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), and glycerolipids were degraded by alkaline hydrolysis (chloroform, 0.6 m NaOH in methanol (1:1) (37°C for 1 h)). Lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol (50:3.5, v/v) as the developing solvent, recovered from the thin layer chromatography plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Ceramide Synthase Assay—Thirty-six hours after transfection, Hek293 cells were removed from culture dishes by gentle shaking in phosphate buffered-saline, centrifuged (4 min, 150 × gav), and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikerin IU/ml aprotinin). Protein was determined using the Bradford reagent. Homogenates (25 μg of protein in 250 μl of buffer) were incubated with 0.25 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine, 15 μm sphinganine, 20 μm defatted bovine serum albumin, 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA for 20 min at 37°C. Lipids were extracted (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform, methanol, 2 m NH4OH (40: 10:1, v/v/v) as the developing solvent and using N-palmitoyl-sphingosine as standard. 3H-Labeled lipids were visualized using a phosphorimaging screen (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), recovered from the thin layer chromatography plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described (20Lahiri S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33735-33738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HA-tagged proteins were identified using a rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:2000 dilution), and FLAG-tagged proteins were identified using a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:10,000 dilution). Goat anti-mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. Detection was performed using the ECL detection system. Immunolocalization—Thirty-six hours after transfection, COS cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% sucrose for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (10 min, room temperature). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-protein disulfide isomerase, 1:400 dilution; rabbit anti-HA, 1:300 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Cy™2-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse and Cy™3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were diluted 1:800. After 1 h of incubation, slides were mounted in Gel Mount™ and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus Fluoview FV500 imaging system. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine fluorescence were detected using an argon and two helium-neon laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 543 nm, respectively. Images were acquired in sequential mode and analyzed using Fluoview 3 imaging software. Sequence Analysis of the Hox Domain in CerS Genes—The Hox domain is derived from homeobox proteins, sequence-specific transcription factors important in development (9Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In mammals all CerS genes apart from CerS1 have a Hox domain, but no Hox domains are found in yeast and plant CerS (2Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The function of the Hox domain in (Hox)CerS is not known, but there is no evidence that the Hox domain acts as a transcription factor in (Hox)CerS genes (2Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To attempt to determine the role of the Hox domain in (Hox)CerS genes, we performed a series of bioinformatics and biochemical studies. First, TLC domain-containing proteins were identified using the Prosite domain data base (15Hulo N. Bairoch A. Bulliard V. Cerutti L. De Castro E. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Pagni M. Sigrist C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The entries were analyzed to determine which have a Hox domain. 32 proteins were selected for further analysis from a wide range of organisms. The Hox domains in most of these proteins were incomplete, with the N-terminal portion of the domain missing. The proteins were aligned, and the portion of the Hox domain present in all sequences was used to build a sequence logo (17Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7851) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The major portion of the Hox domain (from residues 1-34 of the domain) is generally variable. However, conservation is much greater in the distal portion of the Hox domain in (Hox)CerS, particularly in the last 11 residues (Fig. 1). In this region the sequence is almost invariable and is enriched in positively charged amino acids. The conservation is maintained over a wide range of species, from sea squirt to man, including insects (fly and mosquito), non-mammalian vertebrates (fish and frog), and several species of mammals (supplemental Table 1). Deletion of the Hox Domain in Mouse CerS5—To determine whether the Hox domain plays a role in the catalytic activity of mouse CerS5, we prepared a series of deletion constructs. The initial constructs were based on SMART data base predictions (18Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 142-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggest an overlap of two residues (139-140) between the Hox and TLC domains (residues 78-140 and 139-340, respectively). In contrast, according to Prosite (15Hulo N. Bairoch A. Bulliard V. Cerutti L. De Castro E. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Pagni M. Sigrist C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), there is no overlap between the domains (with the Hox domain designated as residues 92-136 and the TLC domain as residues 139-340), with residues 137 and 138 not designated as part of either domain. The difference between SMART and Prosite predictions is due to a less stringent definition of the Hox domain in SMART. Based on the SMART predictions, two constructs were made, Δ82-140, which removed the entire Hox domain, and Δ87-128, which removed most of the Hox domain but left most of the highly conserved region immediately before the TLC domain intact. Surprisingly, removal of 42 amino acids (CerS5Δ87-128) from the Hox domain had no effect on CerS activity (Fig. 2). In contrast, removal of an additional 5 residues at the N-terminal end together with another 12 residues at the C-terminal end of the Hox domain (CerS5Δ82-140) led to a complete loss of activity (Fig. 2). This suggests that the majority of the Hox domain can be removed from CerS5 without loss of catalytic activity and implies that the highly conserved region immediately before the TLC domain may be required for activity. Identification of a Region Adjacent to the TLC Domain Essential for Activity—We next tested whether this conserved region (residues 129-140) plays a role in catalytic activity. Deletion of the entire sequence (CerS5Δ129-140) led to a complete loss of activity (Fig. 3). To attempt to resolve the conflict between the SMART and Prosite predictions, we prepared two additional constructs, CerS5Δ129-135 and CerS5Δ135-140, each of which displayed ∼50% activity (Fig. 3). In wild type CerS5, a positively charged lysine residue, Lys-140, is located next to a conserved sequence, FCES, which designates the beginning of the TLC domain. Upon deletion of residues 135-140, Lys-134 becomes adjacent to the FCES sequence. To ascertain whether Lys-134 could act in a similar fashion to Lys-140 in this deletion construct, we prepared another construct in which Lys-134 was no longer adjacent to FCES (CerS5Δ136-140) due to the presence of a proline residue. This construct did not display any CerS activity (Fig. 3), suggesting that a lysine residue must be located adjacent to FCES for catalytic activity. To determine the role of Lys-134 and Lys-140, we mutated these residues to another positively charged residue (arginine, i.e. K134R and K140R) or to a neutral residue (alanine, i.e. K134A and K140A). Mutation of either residue to alanine led to an ∼50% loss of activity, and a double mutation (K134A/K140A) led to complete loss of activity (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutation of either or both residues to arginine had essentially no effect on activity (Fig. 4). We conclude that two positively charged amino acids, residues Lys-134 and Lys-140, are required for maximal CerS activity of CerS5. We next examined whether the loss of activity of K140A, K134A/K140A, and the CerS5Δ129-140 deletion was due to a change in Km or Vmax using sphinganine as substrate. The Km of CerS5 was 3.6 μm, with a Vmax of 215 pmol of dihydroceramide synthesized/mg/min (Fig. 5). The Vmax of K134A/K140A and CerS5Δ129-140 were close to the limit of detection and similar to mock-transfected cells (31 and 24 pmol/mg/min, respectively), and therefore, Km values could not be accurately determined. A significant reduction in the Vmax of K140A was observed (92 pmol/mg/min) compared with CerS5, with a small change in Km (1 μm) (Fig. 5). We, therefore, suggest that the loss of activity is likely due to a change in Vmax rather than a change in affinity toward sphinganine. Because this region is highly conserved between (Hox)CerS proteins (Fig. 1), we examined whether positively charged residues are also required proximal to the TLC domain in another (Hox)CerS protein. For this purpose, we used human CerS6, which contains an arginine residue, rather than a lysine, immediately before FCES (Fig. 6). Mutation of Arg-131 to lysine (R131K) had no effect on activity, whereas 50% activity was lost upon mutation to alanine (R131A) (Fig. 6). As expected, deletion of the entire 12-residue sequence before the TLC domain resulted in complete loss of activity (Fig. 6). Thus, we conclude that the conserved positively charged residues proximal to the TLC domain in (Hox)CerS proteins are required for maximal activity. Finally, we examined the effects of various mutations on CerS activity measured by metabolic labeling using [4,5-3H]sphinganine. The results (Fig. 7) were similar to those obtained by in vitro analysis (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). [4,5-3H]Dihydroceramide synthesis was similar in CerS5Δ87-128 compared with wild type CerS5, confirming that most of the Hox domain can be removed without affecting CerS activity, whereas no increase in [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide synthesis in CerS5Δ82-140 or CerS5Δ129-140-transfected cells was observed compared with mock-transfected cells. A role for the positively charged residues, Lys-134 and Lys-140 was confirmed since there was no increase in [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide synthesis upon overexpression of the double mutation, K134A/K140A (Fig. 7). All of the constructs were expressed at normal levels, and all were located to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 8), demonstrating that protein mis-localization was not responsible for the loss of activity. 3Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility, we considered it unlikely that the mutations effect the stability of CerS5 due to the following. (i) There was no change in the protease sensitivity (tested using trypsin, 37 °C for 2 h) of CerS5 compared with CerS5Δ129-140. (ii) Residues 129-140 are believed to be located in a loop of the protein, according to a number of different topology prediction programs, rather than the transmembrane domains, which is a region less likely to be involved in protein folding; similar conclusions were drawn from study of the yeast CerS, lag1p (10Kageyama-Yahara N. Riezman H. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). (iii) Removal of 42 amino acids (CerS5Δ87-128) from the Hox domain had no effect on CerS activity (Fig. 2). (iv) We mutated Lys-134 to a charged residue, Arg, and to a neutral residue, Ala; the former resulted in essentially no loss of activity, whereas a more significant loss of activity was observed in the latter (Fig. 4B); the opposite result would be expected if the addition of a charged residue affected protein stability and/or folding. (v) No changes in protein levels and no anomalous bands were seen upon expression of any of the mutations or of the deletion construct in any of our analyses (see for instance Figs. 3B and 4B). Together with the normal localization of the mutants (Fig. 8), we, therefore, consider that a major change in protein structure and, hence, stability is highly unlikely to account for our observations. FIGURE 8Intracellular localization of CerS5, CerS5Δ129-140, and CerS5Δ129-135.

Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are two major observations in the current study. In the first we show that most of the Hox domain is not required for the catalytic activity of CerS5. This result by itself is perhaps not surprising, since one mammalian CerS, namely CerS1, and also yeast and plant CerS do not contain Hox domains and yet effectively function as CerS proteins. However, the yeast CerS, Lag1p, which is most homologous to CerS1 (2Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), requires another protein, Lip1, for its activity (21Vallee B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). No data are currently available about whether mammalian CerS1 requires additional subunits for its activity, since this enzyme has not been purified to homogeneity, but the possibility that CerS1 is regulated differently to other CerS is consistent with phylogenetic analysis, which reveals that CerS1 is on an entirely separate branch of the phylogenetic tree (2Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mammalian (Hox)CerS, at least CerS5 (20Lahiri S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33735-33738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), do not require an additional subunit. Various definitions of Hox domains exist, but the most accepted suggests that Hox domains contain 60 residues (9Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In (Hox)CerS, the first 15 amino acid residues of the Hox domain are missing (with the exception of proteins bearing homology to CerS2 in various organisms). The Hox domain, therefore, appears to be degenerate toward the N-terminal region of the domain, consistent with the much lower conservation in this region between species (Figs. 1 and 9). In contrast, the C-terminal end of the Hox domain is one of the most highly conserved regions in (Hox)CerS proteins (Fig. 1), whereas the corresponding region upstream to the TLC domain in (non-Hox)CerS shows very little conservation between a wide variety of species (compare Fig. 9, A and B, and see supplemental Table 2), except for a minor preference for positively charged amino acids. Together these results imply that the conserved region at the end of the Hox domain in (Hox)CerS may be of previously unsuspected functional significance. This becomes even more likely upon comparison of this region with the Hox domain in other Hox domain-containing proteins (Fig. 10) in which this region is highly conserved. However, some critical differences exist that may impact upon the function of this domain. For instance, the invariant residue Asn-51 in other Hox domains (9Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) is never (with one exception) an asparagine in Hox domains in (Hox)CerS (residue 4 in Fig. 10). Asn-51 has been implicated in DNA binding, an essential feature if the Hox domain is to act as a transcription factor. Likewise, residue 58 in other Hox domains is a lysine or arginine residue in more than 90% of sequences analyzed but is replaced by proline in the Hox region of (Hox)CerS (residue 11 in Fig. 10). A number of other critical differences exist, and together these differences strongly suggest that the Hox domain in (Hox)CerS does not act as a sequence-specific transcription factor but, rather, may play an important role in, for instance, the regulation of catalytic activity. Further support for this idea comes from the second major observation in the current study, namely that deletion or modification of this sequence leads to loss of CerS activity. The mechanism by which the two positively charged residues adjacent to the Hox domain function in CerS catalytic activity is not known, but it appears that the presence of a positively charged amino acid is required immediately before the FCES sequence (residues 141-144 in CerS5) for maximal CerS activity. All prediction programs demonstrate that Lys-134 is part of the Hox domain, and most programs suggest that Lys-140 is part of the TLC domain, with the exception of SMART, which defines Lys-140 as part of both the Hox and TLC domains. A positively charged residue (either Lys or Arg) is found immediately before FCES in all putative CerS in all organisms (Fig. 9). This renders somewhat surprising the observation that K140A retains 50% activity (Fig. 4). To resolve this, we propose that the three-dimensional structure in this region may allow another positively charged residue in the C-terminal portion of this region, such as Lys-134, to substitute for Lys-140. Remarkably, when the 12 residues of this region are used as the input for a pattern search using all residues at each position, the only proteins recognized are (Hox)CerS, with the exception of three unrelated proteins which show the lowest homology; these proteins are not recognized upon inclusion of an additional four residues at the N terminus of this region (Fig. 10 and supplemental Table 3). We, therefore, propose that this region can be used as a new motif to define (Hox)CerS and, moreover, is functionally important for CerS activity since its modification or removal leads to a loss of CerS activity. In summary, we provide novel mechanistic insights into the mode of catalytic activity of mammalian CerS proteins and demonstrate a previously unsuspected role in CerS activity for two positively charged residues flanking the Hox and TLC domains. These residues are part of a new functional motif that can be used to define (Hox)CerS.

ABC transporters generally consist of two homologous halves, each containing a membrane-spanning domain with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane helices and a hydrophilic cytosolic nucleotide binding fold (NBF) (21Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The NBF contains the highly conserved motifs Walker A, Walker B and 19-mer that are important for substrate specificity and nucleotide binding (22Walker J. Saraste M. Runswick M. Gay N.

ABC transporters can either be found as complete full-size transporters comprising twelve transmembrane helices and two NBFs, or as half transporters comprising six transmembrane helices and a single NBF.

All four mammalian peroxisomal ABC transporters known to date belong to the group of ABC half-transporters and thus form obligate homodimers or heterodimers to attain functionality (27van Endert P.M.

So far, in vitro studies for dimerization of peroxisomal ABC transporters have given inconsistent observations. Investigations by three different groups using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that human ALDP could form either homodimers or heterodimers with PMP70 and ALDR (28Liu L.X.

These results could not be confirmed by a further investigation using immunoprecipitated ALDP and PMP70 complexes from digitonin-solubilized mouse liver peroxisomes; ALDP as well as PMP70 could only be detected as homomeric proteins and not in heteromeric association (31Guimarães C.P.

To further elucidate the interaction of ABC transporters in the peroxisomal membrane and especially the formation of homo- or heterodimers for human ALDP and PMP70, we applied FRET microscopy in intact living cells, a method that avoids artificial alterations due to biochemical sample preparation prior to analysis. In addition, we generated various ALDP deletion constructs to identify the protein domains that mediate ALDP dimerization. Plasmid Constructions—All oligonucleotides used for plasmids constructions are listed in Table 1. The cDNA fragments encoding ALDP, ALDP390 (AA1 to AA390), ALDP550 (AA1 to AA550), ALDP658 (AA1 to AA658), ALDPΔ551–657 (residues 551–657 were deleted), and ALDPΔNBF (residues 391–657 were deleted) (Fig. 1) were amplified from RZPD clone IRAKp961 0514Q2 (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, Berlin) by PCR. Amplification products were cloned into pECFP-N1, pEYFP-N1, or pECFP-C1 vectors (Clontech) via the corresponding restriction enzymes. The stop codon was deleted from the ALDP constructs by site-directed mutagenesis using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides “ALDP-EYFP-N1-Mut for” and “ALDP-EYFP-N1-Mut rev.” ALDPΔ551–657 was constructed as follows: the C-terminal part of ALDP (AA658-AA745) was amplified using the oligonucleotide pair “ALDP down” and “ALDPdel551–657”. The PciI restriction site inside the vectors of the ALDP658-ECFP-N1 and ALDP658-EYFP-N1 constructs was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides “Mut-PciI for” and “Mut-PciI rev”. Digestion of these constructs with PciI and HindIII resulted in the AA1 to AA551 fragment to which the C-terminal part of ALDP (AA658-AA745) was ligated leading to ALDP missing residues 551 to 657 (Fig. 1). The stop codons were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis PCR with oligonucleotides “ALDP-Stop-Del for” and “ALDP-Stop-Del rev”. For the ALDPΔNBF constructs AA 391 to AA 657 were deleted. Therefore, ALDP390 constructs were linearized by HindIII and ligated with the C-terminal part of ALDP (AA658 to AA745) amplified with oligonucleotides ALDPdelNBF and ALDPdown without Stop by PCR. PMP70 was amplified from total human cDNA by PCR using oligonucleotides “PMP70-N1 up” and “PMP70-N1 down.” The amplified product was cloned into vectors pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 via the appropriate restriction sites. Pex26, a peroxisomal single transmembrane protein with its N terminus exposed to the cytosol, was amplified from the constructs described by Weller et al. (32Weller S. Cajigas I. Morrell J. Obie C. Steel G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 987-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides “Pex26 for” and “Pex26 rev” and subsequently cloned into vector pECFP-C1. All PCR amplifications except for the mutagenesis were performed using the BD Advantage™ 2 PCR kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The identity of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used for construction of plasmids Oligonucleotide sequences are shown from 5′- to 3′-end.

Because an efficient electroporation protocol for VERO cells was established in our laboratories, we used these cells for the experiments. For cell culture, Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells, ECACC 84113001) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 10% CO2. At the time of confluency, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 300 μl of cytomix (120 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm K2HPO4, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 5 mm GSH, and 2 mm ATP pH7.4) containing 10 to 15 μg of each DNA coding for the indicated proteins. Immediately thereafter cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad, pulse 0.7 kV, 50 μF, 1–2 ms) and grown until the experiment. Live Cell FRET Microscopy Experiments—For single cell FRET experiments, CFP and YFP were used as donor and acceptor fluorescent molecules, respectively. FRET measurements were performed 24 h after electroporation using an inverted microscope (Axiovert200, Zeiss). To minimize organelle movement, cells were cooled down on ice in cold medium prior to measurement. To minimize background fluorescence, the medium HAM's F-12 without phenol red (Promo-Cell) was used. CFP was detected using a filter set composed of an excitation filter 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter 455 nm and an emission filter 480/40 nm. For YFP an excitation filter 500/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter 515 nm and an emission filter 535/30 nm were used. The FRET filter set consisted of an excitation filter 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter 455 nm and an emission filter 535/30 nm. Images were acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera and the Metamorph 6 software (Universal Imaging Corporation West Chester). Image Analysis—All image processing was performed using ImageJ. Images were registered for stage translation between acquisitions using the “TurboReg” plugin (P. Thévenaz, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne) converted to 32 bit, binned 2 × 2, and subjected to a median filter with kernel size 0.5. The YFP image intensities were matched to the exposure time of the CFP and FRET images. Background fluorescence was estimated from an area free of cells and subtracted. The spectrally corrected FRET ratio was calculated by Equation 1, FRETratio=FRET-a×CFP-b×YFPCFP×YFP(Eq. 1) where a and b represent correction factors for YFP and CFP bleed-through emissions into the FRET images, respectively. Note that the equation normalizes the FRET signals to the expression levels of the fluorescent proteins (33Xia Z. Liu L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The resulting corrected FRET ratio was multiplied by a digital mask that was generated from an intensity-threshold YFP image of the same sample to remove noise generated by low-intensity regions. All further calculations were performed using the Igor Pro suite (Wavemetrics Inc. Portland, OR). FRET ratio distribution histograms were generated and normalized to unity. Cumulative histograms of experiments on the same conditions were re-normalized to unity to obtain probability density functions (PDF). The PDF of the negative control Pex26 co-expressed with ALDP was fitted with a Gaussian function to obtain the value of the mean + 3× the standard deviation (3σ), corresponding to a FRET ratio of 0.215. For each cell, the probability of exceeding this 3σ threshold, i.e. the probability of obtaining FRET ratios higher than contained in the negative control, was obtained by integration of the PDF above the 3σ threshold. The mean probability value for all conditions and their standard error on the mean (S.E.) was subjected to one-way analysis of variance with pair-wise Tukey post-doc testing for statistical significance. The PDFs were also subjected to statistical testing using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method that takes into account changes over the entire distribution of FRET ratios per condition. The PDFs were integrated to obtain cumulative density functions (CDFs), and the pair-wise probability for statistically significant differences between conditions was calculated from the CDFs using the statistical package of the MatLab suite (The Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA). Representative examples of the FRET ratio for different conditions are represented in an intensity-weighed color lookup table where color saturation varies in accordance with the fluorescence intensity of the YFP image. Comparison of Protein Expression Levels—Expression levels of ALDP and PMP70 were measured by means of fluorescence microscopy on a cell-by-cell basis (38Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I.H. Wirtz K.W.A. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either ALDP-ECFP-N1 or PMP70-ECFP-N1. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed and stained with either ALDP antibody (ALD-1D6-As or ALD-2B4-As, Euromedex), or PMP70 antibody (kindly provided by Wilhelm Just, Heidelberg). Corresponding Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies were used for visualization (Jackson Laboratories). Intensity differences between transfected (as judged by CFP fluorescence) and untransfected cells were used to determine the relative overexpression level of ALDP or PMP70 (endogenous and transfected protein), according to Equation 2, f=I-I0I0(Eq. 2) where f is the fold overexpression relative to endogenous protein, and I and I0 represent the staining intensities of transfected and untransfected cells in the same field of observation, respectively. Protein-Protein Interaction of ALDP with ALDP, PMP70, and Pex26 and of PMP70 with PMP70—Because ALDP and PMP70 can only function upon dimerization, we performed FRET measurements in living cells to assess potential interactions in vivo. To determine whether ALDP and PMP70 can form heterodimers as described by Liu et al. (1999) or function exclusively as a homomeric protein unit as proposed by Guimarães et al. (31Guimarães C.P. Domingues P. Aubourg P. Fouquet F. Pujol A. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1689: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we transfected Vero cells with ALDP-EYFP and co-expressed ALDP-ECFP or PMP70-ECFP or transfected cells with PMP70-ECFP and co-expressed PMP70-EYFP. As a negative control, we co-expressed Pex26-ECFP, a peroxisomal membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain that is not related to ABC transporters (34Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The proper peroxisomal localization of the fluorescently tagged proteins was verified by single transfection of each construct together with ECFP-SKL or EYFP-SKL, a well established fluorescent peroxisomal marker (data not shown). Because the peroxisomal targeting signal for ABC transporters is located at the N-terminal part while the EYFP/ECFP is located at the C terminus, the tag did not influence localization. In addition, expression of full-length proteins was verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Functionality of the proteins is not impaired by fluorescent protein fusion as shown by ALDR-EGFP that is able to rescue the C26:0 β-oxidation in X-ALD fibroblasts (35Gueugnon F. Volodina N. Et Taouil J. Lopez T.E. Gondcaille C. Sequeira-Le Grand A. Mooijer P.A.W. Kemp S. Wanders R.J.A. Savary S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the peroxisomal localization of the FRET acceptors ALDP-EYFP and PMP70-EYFP. The respective CFP-labeled donor protein revealed complete co-localization (data not shown). The FRET ratios of the expression combinations ALDP-EYFP/ALDP-ECFP, ALDP-EYFP/Pex26-ECFP, ALDP-EYFP/PMP70-ECFP, and PMP70-EYFP/PMP70-ECFP of representative cells 20 to 24 h after transfection are exemplarily shown. The FRET ratio is represented in false colors ranging from blue (low FRET) via white to red (high FRET). Cells co-expressing ALDP-EYFP and ALDP-ECFP show strong FRET with an overall ratio of 0.3 (Fig. 2, left lower panel) indicative of efficient homodimerization. The FRET ratio is homogeneously distributed over peroxisomes in the cell. In contrast, co-expression of ALDP-EYFP and Pex26-ECFP does not reveal significant FRET, confirming that ALDP does not interact with peroxisomal membrane proteins in general, and thus the applicability of Pex26 as a negative control. The FRET ratios are homogeneously low (ratio ∼0.05; Fig. 2, lower left middle panel). Co-expression of ALDP-EYFP and PMP70-ECFP results in intermediate FRET with an overall ratio of 0.15 (Fig. 2, lower right middle panel). Intermediate FRET can also be seen in cells expressing PMP70-ECFP and PMP70-EYFP. The ratio for these constructs is 0.15 (Fig. 2, lower right panel). These data are indicative of the heterodimerization of ALDP and PMP70 and of PMP70 homodimerization, respectively. Although the ratio is lower than that obtained for co-expression of ALDP with itself, it is clearly higher than that obtained for ALDP co-expression with Pex26. We further confirmed the extent of the revealed protein-protein interactions by quantitative statistical analysis in two different ways. First, using a recently published method (36Esposito A. Dohm C.P. Kermer P. Bähr M. Wouters F.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 26: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suitable for non-Gaussian distributions. Briefly, from the distribution of FRET ratios for the negative control situation ALDP/Pex26, an upper FRET ratio threshold was determined that could still be statistically attributed to the absence of FRET. This threshold was derived by Gaussian fitting of the ALDP/Pex26 distribution, followed by the calculation of the mean ratio plus three times the standard deviation. This value corresponded to a FRET ratio of 0.215 and was used as reference for all other FRET measurements. The occurrence of FRET in cells was defined as a significant increase in the probability of exceeding this threshold, namely in obtaining values larger than 0.215. This probability can be estimated by normalization of the integral of the FRET ratio distribution of each cell to unity (yielding the so-called probability density function, PDF). The integral of the PDF bins exceeding the threshold represents the probability of detecting significant FRET. By performing this analysis on 15 ALDP/Pex26, 10 ALDP/PMP70, 15 ALDP/ALDP, and 11 PMP70/PMP70 co-expressing cells, the mean probability and its standard error on the mean was obtained. The results are shown in the first four bars of panel E in Fig. 3. The corresponding cumulative normalized distributions for these conditions are shown in panel A. In this analysis, only the condition ALDP/ALDP contains significantly higher FRET than the ALDP/Pex26 control. Nevertheless, the cumulative histograms also show a clear shift of the peak FRET ratio to higher values, taking an intermediate position between the ALDP/Pex26 control and the ALDP/ALDP homodimerization. The FRET probability method is not sensitive toward changes in distribution below the FRET threshold. Clearly, the choice for the threshold point at the high value of three times the standard deviation eliminates the differences that would have been registered for a lower threshold value. Therefore, the cumulative distributions were subjected to a second analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics (37Demidenko E. Computat. Sci. Appl. 2004; 3046: 933-939Google Scholar). The integrated PDFs for these conditions are shown in panel B of Fig. 3. These curves, known as cumulative density functions (CDFs), provide a robust estimator for distribution similarity or dissimilarity. Visually, coinciding CDFs indicate statistically identical conditions, larger separations indicate statistically significant differences. All conditions are statistically different at very low confidence levels (even lower than 1‰). Consequently, the interactions seen between ALDP with PMP70 and PMP70 with PMP70 are less pronounced than the one for ALDP with itself; nevertheless, they are relevant. KS testing returns the latter two conditions to be statistically indistinguishable from each other (red bracket in panel E). We determined an expression level for PMP70-CFP of 0.5 times the amount of endogenous cellular PMP70 in 21 cells (S.E. = 0.1) and a 6.6-fold overexpression of CFP-ALDP (S.E. = 0.9 in 16 cells). These findings indicate a lower detection sensitivity for PMP70 homodimers and PMP70-ALDP heterodimers than for ALDP homodimers. Protein-Protein Interaction"

Introduction of cysteines at positions in the N-domain at residues predicted to be in close proximity to Ile-72 in Loop V-VI of arrestin (i.e. Glu-148 and Lys-298) appear to form an intramolecular disulfide bond with I72C, significantly diminishing the binding of arrestin to Rho*-P. Using a fluorescence approach, we show that the steady-state emission from a monobromobimane fluorophore in Loop V-VI is quenched by tryptophan residues placed at 148 or 298. This quenching is relieved upon binding of arrestin to Rho*-P. These results suggest that arrestin Loop V-VI moves during binding to Rho*-P and that conformational flexibility of this loop is essential for arrestin to adopt a high affinity binding state.

Rhodopsin activity is controlled by a multistep process whereby activated rhodopsin is phosphorylated on its C terminus by rhodopsin kinase, leading to the binding and quenching of rhodopsin activity by visual arrestin. Visual arrestin belongs to the arrestin superfamily, which includes rod and cone arrestins as well the β-arrestins (1Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The β-arrestins, which are involved in the inactivation of agonist-occupied G-protein-coupled receptors (for review, see Ref. 2Lefkowitz R.J. Whalen E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), have an additional role not seen in visual arrestins whereby they direct receptor endocytosis by acting as a clathrin or AP-2 adaptor; e.g. Refs. 3Laporte S.A.

Visual arrestin is an important model system not only for understanding the visual response but also for understanding the broad-reaching mechanism for controlling cellular signal transduction cascades mediated by G protein-coupled receptors.The crystal structures of rod, cone, and β-1 arrestin are remarkably similar. All show a structure consisting of two cup-shaped domains formed from a seven-stranded β sandwich (5Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G.

Several groups have identified that Loop V-VI has an important role in receptor binding. Experimental evidence shows (i) this loop is a vital component of arrestin that directs receptor preference (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

In this study we use a combination of experimental techniques to show that Loop V-VI moves relative to residues in the β-strands of the N-terminal domain and that this conformational flexibility is necessary for arrestin to bind to its receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Frozen bovine retinas were purchased from Lawson and Lawson, Inc. (Lincoln, NE), and 11-cis-retinal was a generous gift from Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health). Monobromobimane was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen), and Biomax centrifugal concentrators (10 kDa cutoff) were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Cuvettes were purchased from Uvonics (Plainview, NY), and band-pass filters and long-pass filters were obtained from Oriel (Stratford, CT). Acrylamide/bisacrylamine solution (37:5:1) and microcolumns were purchased from Bio-Rad. Spectroscopic-grade buffers were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma.Preparation of Rod Outer Segment and Recombinant Arrestin Mutants—Rod outer segment membranes were prepared for pulldown assays and trypsinolysis studies as described (13McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Rod outer segment membranes used for fluorimetry studies were prepared as described (14Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and later modified (11Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recombinant arrestins were prepared and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris as described in McDowell et al. (15McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). His-tagged arrestins were purified by nickel-agarose and heparin-agarose affinity chromatography as described (10Smith W.C. Dinculescu A. Peterson J.J. McDowell J.H. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 392-398PubMed Google Scholar). All arrestin mutants were created in a background that lacked tryptophans (W194F) and contained an N-terminal His(6) repeat inserted after the initiating methionine and contained C63A/C143A to minimize cysteines. Cys-128 was retained because mutagenesis of this residue has deleterious effects on expression of arrestin in Pichia.Bimane Labeling of Arrestin—Arrestins were labeled with excess monobromobimane as previously described (16Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9407-9417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Labeling efficiency for all mutants was >90% and was determined as described (11Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient for arrestin at 280 nm (ϵ280) is 26,360 liter m-1 cm-1 (17Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Engelman D.M. Sigler P.B. Fleming K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and for tryptophan-less arrestin mutants, a modified extinction coefficient was used (ϵ280 = 20,760 liters m-1 cm-1) (18Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar, 19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar).Functional Pulldown Assay—The functionality of expressed and modified arrestins was tested using a pulldown assay with rhodopsin in disc membranes. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3, 1 μm arrestin was mixed with 4 μm phosphorylated rhodopsin in disc membranes (Rho-P) in 10 mm HEPES/100 mm NaCl (pH 7) with or without 1 mm DTT according to the experimental conditions. After light activation of the rhodopsin for 2 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged (32,000 × g) to form a pellet of the rhodopsin-containing membranes along with any bound arrestin. This pellet was washed one time and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) for separation by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For some reactions in which the arrestin was prepared without DTT, the supernatant was retained, and 1 mm DTT (final concentration) was subsequently added. This arrestin was then mixed with a fresh aliquot of 4 μm Rho-P and binding assessed as described above. Gels were quantified by scanning densitometry (Scion Image for Windows, Scion Corp.) of the arrestin band, normalized to wild-type arrestin, and averaged over three replicates. In each case background density was determined from a portion of the gel that contained no protein and was subtracted from each band density. For SDS-PAGE analysis of arrestin variants under non-reducing conditions, arrestin was prepared in Laemmli sample buffer without DTT.FIGURE 3Formation of disulfide bonds diminishes the binding of arrestin to Rho*-P in disc membranes for cysteines close to Loop V-VI. A, pulldown assay comparing the binding of wild-type (WT) arrestin to phosphorylated rhodopsin (Rho-P, -light) or light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (Rho*-P, +light) (lanes 1–4) to that of I72C/K298C arrestin (Arr, lanes 5–10) in the presence of 1 mm DTT (lanes 1–2 and 5–6) or absence of DTT (lanes 3–4 and 7–8). In lanes 9–10, 1 mm DTT (final concentration) was added back into the supernatant obtained from samples in lanes 7–8 and reused in the pulldown assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrestin and rhodopsin bands are indicated by arrows.

The binding of arrestin to Rho*-P relative to wild-type arrestin (WT) is shown under non-reducing conditions (black bars) or in the presence of 1 mm DTT (gray bars) and was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures”; bars show the average of three replicates with S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, 3 μm bimane-labeled arrestin was added to 12 μm Rho-P in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Reactions were either kept in the dark or photoactivated (>495 nm) for 2 min at room temperature followed by a 10-fold dilution with buffer (4 °C) and centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was removed, and pellets were solubilized in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). The fluorescence of the bands was visualized using a gel-doc apparatus (Alpha-Innotech FluorChem 5500), and gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.FIGURE 5Bimane-labeled arrestins can bind Rho*-P. Arrestin affinity for dark phosphorylated rhodopsin (Rho-P, -light) and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (Rho*-P, +light) in disc membranes was assayed by a centrifugal pulldown experiment. The fluorescence of each gel is shown above and the Coomassie stain is shown below. The far right lane on each gel contains a wild-type (WT) arrestin + Rho*-P control, and the locations of the arrestin and rhodopsin bands are indicated by arrows.

Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2.5 mm DTNB stock solution was prepared in 10 mm HEPES and 750 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). For the DTNB reaction, 8.5 μm arrestin was mixed with 500 μm DTNB, and 0.75% sodium dodecyl sulfate was present to denature the protein and expose any buried sulfhydryl groups (30 °C). The DTNB reaction product (A412 nm) was monitored in a quartz cuvette using a Hewlett-Packard model 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. The number of reactive sulfhydryl groups was determined by using the extinction coefficient of the indicator product (13,600 liters m-1 cm-1 at 412 nm). For quantitation of sulfhydryls under non-reducing conditions, arrestin was first dialyzed overnight in the above HEPES buffer, changing the buffer twice to ensure that all DTT was removed. For reducing conditions, a separate aliquot of arrestin was treated with 2 mm DTT overnight and then rapidly buffer-exchanged using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) immediately before the addition of DTNB.Limited Trypsinolysis—Limited digestion of arrestin with TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was performed as originally introduced (21Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later modified (9Dinculescu A. McDowell J.H. Amici S.A. Dugger D.R. Richards N. Hargrave P.A. Smith W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11703-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, all arrestins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 8) without DTT. Arrestin (3.7 μm) was mixed with 9.6 μm phosphorylated rhodopsin in disc membranes to which 1 unit of TPCK-treated trypsin was added at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were kept in the dark or exposed to light for 2 min, after which aliquots were removed at timed intervals, quenched by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence steady-state experiments were conducted as described previously (11Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using a Photon Technologies (PTI) spectrophotometer with a DeltaRam excitation source. For experiments using rhodopsin, excitation slits were set <0.25-nm band pass (to avoid bleaching of the rhodopsin), and emission slits were set at 15-nm band pass. Samples were excited at 380 nm, and emission was measured from 400 to 600 nm using 2-nm increments (0.25-s integration per point). Determination of accurate emission λmax values was done as described previously (22Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, excitation slits were set at 1-nm band pass, and emission slits were set at 10-nm. A sample of 2 μm bimane-labeled arrestin (20 °C) was excited at 381 nm, and emission was collected from 400 to 600 nm using 1-nm increments (1-s integration per point).Quantum Yield Measurements—The quantum yield (ϕ) of each labeled arrestin mutant was determined as described previously (22Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the optical density at 360 nm (OD) and integrated fluorescence intensity (F)(λex, 360 nm; λem, 370–700 nm) of each arrestin were compared with that of a standard with a known quantum yield (0.55), quinine sulfate in 1 n H2SO4, using the relation, ϕA = ϕS ×FAFSODSODA(Eq. 1) where the subscripts A and S stand for the arrestin sample and the standard, respectively.Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, which is a measure of the rotational diffusion of a fluorophore (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar), was measured on a PTI QM-1 steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer. Polarizers were fitted over the excitation source and the emission detector and used to vary the polarization of the light. Anisotropy (r) is defined as, r = I∥−GI⊥I∥+2GI⊥(Eq. 2) where I∥ and I⊥ are the intensities of the fluorescence emission parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the excitation light, respectively. The G-factor, a term used to correct for the different sensitivities of the emission detector for vertically and horizontally polarized light, was determined before measuring the anisotropy. In a typical experiment the fluorescence emission of 1 μm bimane-labeled arrestin (200 μl sample volume, 4-mm black-jacketed cuvette, 14 °C) was measured at 475 nm (380 nm excitation) for 15 s (1-s integration per point). The average of the 15 points was used for I∥ and I⊥, and measurements were done in triplicate. Excitation slits were set at 1 nm, and emission slits were set at 10 nm. These settings caused <1% rhodopsin bleaching in samples containing Rho-P in disc membranes, as measured by absorbance spectroscopy. Background fluorescence of buffer or Rho-P was subtracted where appropriate before the calculation of anisotropy.Fluorescence Lifetime Analysis—The fluorescence decay lifetime of each bimane-labeled arrestin mutant was determined using a PTI Laserstrobe instrument (11Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μm arrestin (with or without a 4-fold excess of Rho-P in disc membranes) in 200 μl (4-mm black-jacketed cuvette) was measured at 20 °C using 381-nm excitation pulses (full width half-maximum ∼1.5 ns). A 298–435-nm band pass filter was placed over the excitation beam, and the intensity was modulated using neutral density filters. Emission was monitored through three long pass filters (>399 nm, >418 nm, >450 nm) and a monochromator set at 470 nm (slits at 15-nm band pass). Lifetime data were collected identically as described previously (11Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and data were analyzed using the commercial FeliX32 Analysis software (PTI). Each lifetime data set was fit to a double-exponential decay curve, and the amplitude-weighted average fluorescence lifetimes were reported.RESULTSRationale of Mutant Design—The arrestin crystal structures show that Loop V-VI can adopt multiple conformations (see Fig. 1) (5Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C.

Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To test if movement of this loop might be important in the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin, we focused on the relative movement of Ile-72. This residue in Loop V-VI is in close proximity (<9 Å) to Glu-148 and Lys-298 when the loop is in the β conformation and further away (>20 Å) in the α conformation (Fig. 1). We used two methodologies to measure the distance between Ile-72 and residues Glu-148 and Lys-298; that is, cysteine cross-linking and intramolecular fluorescence quenching.Di-cysteine Mutants Form Intramolecular Disulfides—We first tested whether cysteines introduced at sites 148 and 298 were in sufficient proximity to a cysteine at residue 72 to form a disulfide bond, which would be predicted to tether Loop V-VI to the N-domain of arrestin. These di-cysteine mutants of arrestin were expressed and purified to >95% homogeneity. They were subsequently dialyzed at pH 7.5 without DTT (to promote the formation of a disulfide bond) or with 1 mm DTT (to reduce any potential disulfide bonds). We then measured sulfhydryl reactivity of I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C to assess the number of free sulfhydryl groups present in oxidizing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2A). This analysis showed that both I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C had only one reactive sulfhydryl group before treatment with DTT (presumably from the native Cys-128). After treatment with DTT, the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups increased to nearly three for I72C/K298C and to ∼2.5 for I72C/E148C. This increase of approximately two reactive groups is consistent with the reduction of a disulfide bond.FIGURE 2Di-cysteine arrestin mutants form intramolecular disulfides. A, the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups increases by ∼2 when the dicysteine mutants I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C are reduced with DTT. The average number of reactive sulfhydryl groups in the arrestin mutants was measured with DTNB as a colorimetric reagent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of sulfhydryl groups was measured in arrestins that were prepared in the absence of DTT (black bars) and also after treatment with 2 mm DTT (gray bars) to reduce any disulfide bonds. The dicysteine mutants were introduced into an arrestin in which only native Cys-128 is retained (C63A/C143A). Bars represent the average (n = 3), and error bars show the S.E. B, arrestin di-cysteine mutants do not form significant intermolecular cross-links, as shown by SDS-PAGE of arrestin variants under nonreducing conditions (lanes 1–6), and under reducing conditions (lanes 7–12). Dimers of arrestin are indicated by an arrowhead. Molecular mass standards are shown in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because it is possible that these cysteine mutants of arrestin could form dimers (i.e. intermolecular disulfide bonds), we also performed SDS-PAGE gel analysis of each of the di-cysteine mutants under non-reducing and reducing conditions to assess the multimeric state of the arrestin (Fig. 2B). These included I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C, in which the cysteines are predicted to be in close proximity, and I72C/K276C, in which the cysteines are not close and, therefore, should not form an intramolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 1). This analysis showed that for all of the cysteine-containing variants of arrestin, more than 90% of the total arrestin existed as a monomer, with the remainder forming multimeric complexes. Interestingly, the two di-cysteine mutants that are predicted to form an internal disulfide bond (I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C) show even less propensity to form multimeric complexes. Under reducing conditions, all of the arrestin variants migrated as a single band.Disulfide Formation Inhibits Arrestin Binding to Rho*-P—The functionality of the arrestin di-cysteine mutants was tested using a centrifugal pulldown assay with phosphorylated rhodopsin in native rod outer segment disc membranes. Fig. 3A shows an example of the pulldown assay using the I72C/K298C mutant. This arrestin bound well to Rho*-P when DTT was present (lane 6) but had very poor binding to Rho*-P when DTT was absent (lane 8). The lack of binding of I72C/K298C in the absence of DTT could be restored to its original level by the subsequent addition of 1 mm DTT (lane 10).Fig. 3B shows a summary of the binding of each of the various arrestin mutants to Rho*-P in the presence or absence of 1 mm DTT. Note that both arrestins with cysteine replacements predicted to be in close proximity to I72C (i.e. E148C and K298C) showed a dramatic increase in binding in the presence of DTT. Also note that for I72C/K276C, in which the cysteines are not in close proximity, binding to Rho*-P was not influenced by DTT. Similarly, DTT also had a very small effect (<15%) on mutants with a tryptophan at sites 148 and 298 (these tryptophan mutants were used in our fluorescence experiments described below). Although all of these arrestin variants retained their selectivity for Rho*-P, these binding results show that the substitutions used in this study decrease the steady-state affinity of the mutants compared with wild-type arrestin to varying degrees. This effect suggests that these residues (Ile-72, Glu-148, and Lys-298) may either participate directly in binding of arrestin to Rho*-P or that mutating these residues may affect the arrestin structure, indirectly altering the binding site.The results from the pulldown assay indicate that tethering Loop V-VI blocks arrestin binding to Rho*-P. As an additional measure of arrestin functionality, we performed limited trypsinolysis. Arrestin binding to Rho*-P is characterized by an increase in the susceptibility of the C terminus of arrestin to trypsin cleavage. This technique has been used previously to show the integrity of mutagenized arrestin proteins and to assess changes in arrestin conformation upon binding to rhodopsin (9Dinculescu A. McDowell J.H.

Vis. 2006; 12: 1516-1525PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4 shows examples of the proteolysis that occurs for arrestin treated with limiting amounts of trypsin for 10 min (note that all arrestins were prepared under non-reducing conditions in the absence of DTT). In the absence of receptor binding (Rho-P, -), wild-type arrestin was slowly proteolyzed by trypsin. However, upon light activation and receptor binding (Rho*-P, +), arrestin was rapidly cleaved by trypsin as indicated by the appearance of a 44-kDa band below the full-length arrestin. In contrast, I72C/E148C and I72C/K298C both had very slow trypsinolysis, even in the presence of Rho*-P, implying that they were unable to bind Rho*-P. For the control I72C/K276C, proteolysis was virtually identical to wild-type arrestin, showing essentially no proteolysis with Rho-P but rapid cleavage in the presence of Rho*-P. A similar proteolysis pattern was observed for each of the control arrestins in which I72C was paired with a tryptophan at residue 148 or 298. Note that mutant I72C/K298W showed increased trypsinolysis in the presence of dark Rho-P compared with WT. This increased sensitivity to trypsin may be due to some instability of this mutant. However, similar to WT, trypsinolysis of I72C/K298W increased in the presence of Rho*-P.FIGURE 4Limited trypsinolysis of arrestin variants indicates that disulf"

It is also of relevance in biotechnology when cheap raw materials such as pectin-rich materials like citrus peel or sugar beet pulp are to be exploited. However, knowledge about the microbial pathways for d-galacturonate catabolism is rather limited. A bacterial catabolic pathway has been described previously, whereas a fungal path is only partly known. The bacterial pathway consists of five enzymes converting d-galacturonate to pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The intermediate metabolites are d-tagaturonate, d-altronate, d-erythro-3-deoxy-hexulosonate, and d-erythro-3-deoxy-hexulosonate-6-phosphate.

Chem. 1964; 239: 3515-3518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fungal path is distinctly different. The first two steps of this pathway have been described. In the first step d-galacturonate is reduced to l-galactonate by an NADPH-coupled d-galacturonate reductase (6Kuorelahti S. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Londesborough J. Richard P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) this enzyme activity was induced when grown on d-galacturonate but the activity was absent during growth on other carbon sources. The d-galacturonate reductase gene gar1 is identified and the purified protein characterized (6Kuorelahti S. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Londesborough J. Richard P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the second step l-galactonate is converted to l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate) by a dehydratase (7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also this activity was induced in H. jecorina when d-galacturonate was the carbon source for growth. The l-galactonate dehydratase gene lgd1 was identified and the corresponding enzyme characterized. A deletion in the lgd1 gene resulted in a H. jecorina strain unable to grow on d-galacturonate (7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It remained unclear how the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate was further metabolized, whether it was phosphorylated by a kinase as in the bacterial path and then e.g. split by an aldolase to result in pyruvate and l-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or whether an aldolase was active on the non-phosphorylated 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar acid, or whether still another enzyme was involved. In a previous work we hypothesized that the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate is split into pyruvate and l-glyceraldehyde by aldolase (7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although such an activity has never been shown. In a subsequent reaction the l-glyceraldehyde could then be converted by a reductase to glycerol. Such a reductase that would use NADPH as a cofactor has been described previously for H. jecorina (8Liepins J. Kuorelahti S. Penttilä M. Richard P. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4229-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The missing link in this pathway is an l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase that would convert l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate to pyruvate and l-glyceraldehyde. It was earlier suggested that d-galacturonate is metabolized through a non-phosphorylating pathway in the mold Aspergillus nidulans (9Visser J. Van Rooijen R. Dijkema C. Swart K. Sealy-Lewis H.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 655-659PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hondmann D.H. Busink R. Witteveen C.F. Visser J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However it was speculated that d-glyceraldehyde is an intermediate (11Uitzetter J.H. Bos C.J. Visser J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 1167-1172PubMed Google Scholar). Further support for such a non-phosphorylating pathway comes from a microarray analysis of genes transcribed in Aspergillus niger grown on d-galacturonate where, among others, genes with homologies to aldoketo reductase, racemase, and aldolase are identified, although the gene sequences are not available (12Martens-Uzunova E. Schaap P. van den Berg J. Benen J. XXIII Fungal Genetics Conference.Fungal Genetics Newsletter, Asilomar, California. 2005; 52: 93Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity Measurements—The aldolase activity in the forward direction was measured in a coupled assay with lactate dehydrogenase. The buffer contained 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm NADH, and lactate dehydrogenase (4 units/ml; Roche). With the fungal and yeast crude extracts the final protein concentration in the reaction was 0.5 mg/ml and with the purified histidine-tagged protein 1.1 μg/ml. The reaction was started by adding l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate to the final concentration of 10 mm. When the Michaelis-Menten constant was measured this concentrations was varied between 20 μm and 40 mm. The reaction was monitored by following the NADH absorbance at 340 nm. The measurements were performed in a Cobas Mira automated analyzer (Roche) at a temperature of 30 °C. l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate was synthesized from l-galactonate as described earlier (7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the reverse direction the enzyme activity was assessed by measuring the production of l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate using the thiobarbituric acid method as described earlier (13Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The buffer contained 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 40 mm pyruvate, and 16 mm glyceraldehyde, and the reaction was started by adding crude protein extract to the final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. When the affinities for the aldehyde were measured the pyruvate concentration was 60 mm, and when the affinity for pyruvate was measured the l-glyceraldehyde concentration was 24 mm, and the purified histidine-tagged protein was used at concentration 1.1 μg/ml. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 and 1.5 h at room temperature and formation of the 2-keto-3-deoxy acid quantified as described (13Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). l-Glyceraldehyde was synthesized from l-gulono-1,4-lactone as described previously (14Hubschwerlen C. Synth. Commun. 1986; 11: 962-964Crossref Google Scholar, 15Lamble H.J. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Bull S.D. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2005; 1: 124-126Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The activity is given in units, which is the activity that forms 1 μmol of product per minute. Enzyme Purification, Identification of the Gene, and Cloning of the Open Reading Frame—The mold H. jecorina (T. reesei) strain VTT-d-80133 was grown in a medium containing d-galacturonic acid/sodium d-galacturonate 20 g/liter (pH 7.0), 0.5 g/liter proteose peptone, 15 g/liter KH2PO4, 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.6 g/liter CaCl2·2H2O, and trace elements (16Mandels M. Weber J. Hajny G.J. Reese E.T. Cellulases and Their Applications, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.95. 1969: 391-414Google Scholar). The mycelia were lysed by vortexing with glass beads, and the resulting protein extract was desalted by gel filtration using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) as described (6Kuorelahti S. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Londesborough J. Richard P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The protein extract in a buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was then bound to a DEAE column (GE Healthcare). 33 mg of protein was bound to 10 ml of DEAE. The protein was eluted in 2.5-ml fractions with a salt gradient from 0 to 200 mm NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions were tested for l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase activity in the forward direction as described above. The active fractions were identified and separated on an SDS-PAGE. A 37-kDa protein band was identified as the aldolase. The protein band was then cut out from the gel and the protein alkylated in-gel with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin. The peptides resulting from trypsin cleavage were extracted, and the quality of the generated peptide mass fingerprint was first determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Partial sequences of individual peptides were then determined by liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The details of that procedure have been described elsewhere (17Poutanen M. Salusjärvi L. Ruohonen L. Penttilä M. Kalkkinen N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The obtained peptide sequences were then used to identify the corresponding gene in the H. jecorina genome. The open reading frame was amplified by PCR using H. jecorina cDNA as a template, using the DyNAzyme™ EXT DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) and introducing two BamHI restriction sites. The following primers were used: 5′-GGATCCACCATGGCCCCCCCATCCCTA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTACAAAGTCTTCTCAATCTC-3′. The PCR product was then cloned in a TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Expression of the Aldolase Gene—From the TOPO vector described above the 1-kb BamHI fragment was released and ligated to a yeast expression vector. The expression vector was a multicopy expression vector for Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing URA3 for selection and the constitutive TPI promoter. The plasmid was derived from the pYX212 plasmid (R&D Systems); it was modified to remove the ATG and the hemagglutinin tag from the multiple cloning sites and to introduce a BamHI restriction site in the multiple cloning sites. After the correct orientation was verified the vector was transformed to the S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2–1B and grown in selective medium. The l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase with a histidine tag at the C- or N-terminal end was produced in a similar manner as described above except that that the histidine tag was introduced by PCR. To introduce the C-terminal histidine tag the primers 5′-GGATCCACCATGGCCCCCCCATCCCTA-3′ for the sense direction and 5′-GGATCCCTAGTGGTGATGATGGTGATGCAAAGTCTTCTCAATCTCC-3′ for the antisense direction were used. To introduce the N-terminal histidine tag the primers 5′-GGATCCACCATGCATCACCATCATCACCACATGGCCCCCCCATCCCTAC-3′ for the sense and 5′-GGATCCCTACAAAGTCTTCTCAATCTC-3′ for the antisense direction were used. Characterization of the Enzyme Activity—The S. cerevisiae strains expressing the aldolase with or without histidine tag were disintegrated by vortexing with glass beads and the yeast extract analyzed for l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase activity in the forward direction as described above. In a control experiment a similar strain but with an empty plasmid was used. The N-terminally histidine-tagged l-threo-3-deoxyhexulosonate aldolase was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified enzyme was used to estimate the Michaelis-Menten constants. Deletion of the Aldolase Gene in H. jecorina—For the deletion of the aldolase gene a deletion cassette was constructed. For the deletion cassette 1.5 kb areas from both sides of the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase gene were cloned and ligated to the pBluekan7-1.NotI plasmid (obtained from P.J. Punt, TNO Nutrition and Food Research, The Netherlands). The part upstream of the lga1 was cloned using the oligos 5′-GAGCTCGATATCAGGAATTGAGGGGCCATTTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGGCTGTTGTGATGGAAGGAT-3′ introducing SacI and EcoRV restriction sites. The SacI fragment was ligated to the SacI cloning site of the pBluekan7-1.NotI. The part downstream of the lga1 was cloned with the oligos 5′-ACTAGTGATATCAGGCACTGGATCGTGTCATT-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGTAGGCATTAGGTACGTAG-3′ introducing SpeI and EcoRV restriction sites. The SpeI fragment was ligated to the SpeI site of the pBluekan7-1.NotI. The two DNA fragments were ligated to the pBluekan7-1.NotI vector in such a way that the orientation of the two DNA fragments relative to each other was not changed, and EcoRV could be used to release the deletion cassette. In this construct a gene for hygromycin B resistance was placed between the two fragments. The deletion cassette comprising of the two DNA fragments and the hygromycin B resistance gene was then released by EcoRV digestion, transformed to the H. jecorina VTT-d-80133 strain and selected for hygromycin B resistance using standard protocols (18Penttilä M. Nevalainen H. Rättö M. Salminen E. Knowles J. Gene. 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was called VTT-d-80133 Δlga1. Retransformation of the Aldolase Gene to H. jecorina—The aldolase gene was transformed back into the H. jecorina strain with the deletion in the aldolase gene to show that no other changes in the genome other than the aldolase gene deletion caused the observed phenotypes. An expression plasmid pAN52-1.Not1 (obtained from P.J. Punt, TNO Nutrition and Food Research, The Netherlands) was modified so that the NcoI restriction site was removed and restriction sites for BamHI, SacI, SpeI, EcoRV, ClaI, and ApaI were included between the A. nidulans gpdA promoter and trpC terminator. The aldolase open reading frame was released from the TOPO vector described above and ligated to the BamHI site of the modified pAN52–1.NotI plasmid. After the correct orientation of the open reading frame was confirmed the plasmid was cotransformed with the selection plasmid pTOC202, which contained the acetamidase-encoding amdS gene from A. nidulans as a selection marker. Transformants were selected for acetamide resistance. The retransformation of the aldolase gene was confirmed by PCR using oligos from the aldolase gene and from the gpdA promoter. The resulting strain was the VTT-d-80133 Δlga1 lga1. Growth on d-Galacturonate—The H. jecorina strains VTT-d-80133, VTT-d-80133 Δlga1, and VTT-d-80133 Δlga1 lga1 were grown in a d-galacturonic acid/d-galacturonate-containing medium as described above. 250-ml shake flasks with 50 ml of medium were inoculated with 1 × 107 spores and incubated on a shaker at 28 °C, and the contents of two parallel flasks were filtered after 2, 4, and 6 days. The biomass was dried overnight at 110 °C for dry mass. The supernatants were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) as described earlier (19Tenkanen M. Siika-aho M. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate Aldolase Activity—The mold H. jecorina was grown with d-galacturonate, d-glucose, d-xylose, lactose, or glycerol as the carbon source. The mycelia were then disintegrated by vortexing with glass beads and centrifuged to obtain a crude cytosolic cell extract. This crude extract was then tested for enzyme activities. In the forward direction with l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate as a substrate we observed pyruvate production (0.16 units/mg) when the mycelia were grown on d-galacturonate, but significantly less (0.03 units/mg) when grown on other carbon sources. The same was seen in the reverse direction with l-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate as substrates. The reverse reaction was significantly stronger with l-glyceraldehyde (0.20 units/mg) as a substrate than with d-glyceraldehyde (0.01 units/mg). The reverse reaction was also inhibited by d-glyceraldehyde because d, l-glyceraldehyde was nearly as poor a substrate as d-glyceraldehyde (0.02 units/mg). Partial Purification of the l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate Aldolase and Cloning of the Open Reading Frame—For purification of the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase the forward reaction with l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate as a substrate was used to detect the enzyme. The desalted crude extract containing 33 mg of protein and 0.2-units/mg protein activity was bound to a DEAE column and eluted with a salt gradient. The protein with l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase activity was eluted at a NaCl concentration between 60 and 90 mm as a single activity peak. The fraction with highest activity contained 0.1 mg/ml protein and had an activity of 4.5 units/mg of protein. The active fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and a 37-kDa protein was observed to coincide with the activity. This protein band was then cut out from the gel and processed to obtain partial amino acid sequences. Because the genome sequence of H. jecorina is known, these partial amino acid sequences could then be used to identify the corresponding gene sequence. The following four peptide sequences were obtained: GLVVMGSDGEAVHCTR, GFQSVPVLFGATEGS, AAGAAAALVLPPSYYR, and QTYYGYGGYPR. These sequences were encoded by a single gene of unknown function. We called this gene lga1 for 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-galactonate aldolase. We then cloned the open reading frame by PCR using cDNA as a template. Comparing the cDNA clone with the genomic DNA showed that there were no introns. The open reading frame consists of 945 nucleotides, and the sequence has been deposited at GenBank™ with the accession number EF203091. The open reading frame coded for a protein with 315 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 33,351 g/mol. Expression in S. cerevisiae—The open reading frame was then transferred to a yeast expression vector, which was a multicopy vector with a strong constitutive promoter. When transformed to a yeast strain this vector caused the expression of an active l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase. In a crude yeast extract the activity was 0.05 units/mg of protein as measured in the forward direction, whereas in the control strain no activity could be detected. To facilitate the purification we introduced a histidine tag to the N terminus or to the C terminus of the protein. The histidine tags were introduced by adding additional nucleotide sequence by PCR to the 3′-end, just before the stop codon or to the start of the open reading frame, just after the start codon. Both constructs were then expressed with the same vector in the same yeast strain. When testing the two modified proteins in the crude extract of S. cerevisiae we observed that the C-terminal tag had an activity, which was about 70% reduced when compared with the non-tagged protein. The protein with the N-terminal histidine tag however had the same activity as the non-tagged. The N-terminally tagged protein was then purified and used for more detailed enzymatic characterization. Characterization of the Purified Protein—The histidine-tagged l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase was purified from the crude yeast extract using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. This resulted in a protein preparation, which gave a single band in an SDS-PAGE. To test the specificity of the enzyme we tried as substrates d-glycero-3-deoxy-pentulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabonate), d-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-galactonate), and l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate). The production of pyruvate was measured with a coupled enzymatic assay. Activity was observed with d-glycero-3-deoxypentulosonate and l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate, and the kinetic constants were then estimated for each of the compounds. For the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate we found a Vmax of 20.3 units/mg of protein corresponding to a turnover number of 11.3 s–1 and a Km of 3.5 mm, for the d-glycero-3-deoxy-pentulosonate the Vmax and Km were 12.5 units/mg of protein (6.4 s–1) and 3.8 mm, respectively (Fig. 1). In the reverse direction we tested the activity with 50 mm pyruvate and various aldehydes and ketones at 16 mm. To analyze the product formation we used the thiobarbituric acid method (13Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We observed activity with l-glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and methylglyoxal. With the other substrates tested the activity was close to the detection limit, which was about 3% of the activity with l-glyceraldehyde. We tested the aldehydes formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, d-glyceraldehyde and glyoxal, and the ketones dihydroxyacetone, diacetyl, and acetone (Table 1).TABLE 1Activity with pyruvate and various aldehydes and ketonesSubstrateActivityunits/mgl-Glyceraldehyde9.8d-Glyceraldehydeb.d.Glycolaldehyde0.5Methylglyoxal0.6Formaldehydeb.d.Acetaldehydeb.d.Glyoxalb.d.Acetoneb.d.Diacetylb.d.Dihydroxyacetoneb.d. Open table in a new tab The Michaelis-Menten constants for pyruvate and l-glyceraldehyde were estimated. The Km values were 0.5 mm for pyruvate and 1.2 mm for l-glyceraldehyde, the Vmax was about 6.5 units/mg of purified protein which corresponds to a turnover number of 3.6 s–1 (Fig. 2, A and B). For glycolaldehyde a Km of 6.5 mm and Vmax of 0.9 units/mg were estimated (not shown). To test whether the lga1 was essential for the growth of d-galacturonate we deleted the gene in H. jecorina. A control strain where the lga1 was expressed in the lga1-deletion strain was also generated. In this control strain the lga1 was not under the natural promoter but under the gpdA from A. nidulans. These three strains were tested for growth on d-galacturonate, glycerol, and in medium without additional carbon source. The result is summarized in Fig. 3. On glycerol all three strains grew to about the same biomass. On d-galacturonate the strain with lga1-deletion (Δlga1) did not grow, whereas the control strain (lga1) regained the ability to grow on d-galacturonate. The growth rate was slightly reduced, which might be because of the heterologous promoter that was used. There was also some growth when a medium with no additional carbon source was used. This residual growth is because of the proteose peptone, which is always present in the medium. In the lga1-deletion strain (Δlga1) l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate was accumulating. The growth media was analyzed by HPLC for d-galacturonate, l-galactonate and l-threo-3-deoxyhexulosonate. During the 6 days of growth the d-galacturonate was consumed completely by the parent strain, whereas only a small fraction was consumed by the lga1-deletion strain. l-Galactonate accumulated with both strains to about 0.3 g/liter during the same period. l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate accumulated mainly in the deletion strain. It accumulated with a nearly constant rate to 3.6 g/liter after 6 days, whereas with the parent strain 0.3 g/liter were not exceeded. Here we describe the identification of the missing link in the fungal d-galacturonate pathway. In previous communications we described the enzymes and the corresponding genes of d-galacturonate reductase and l-galactonate dehydratase converting d-galacturonate to l-galactonate and l-galactonate to l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate), respectively (6Kuorelahti S. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Londesborough J. Richard P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We also identified an enzyme and corresponding gene for an l-glyceraldehyde reductase (8Liepins J. Kuorelahti S. Penttilä M. Richard P. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4229-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The missing link is an l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase. Such an enzyme has not been described previously. The l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase activity is induced when d-galacturonate is the carbon source for growth but is absent on other carbon sources. This is already an indication that the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase is related to the d-galacturonate pathway. Upon deletion of the aldolase gene the growth on d-galacturonate is prevented providing evidence that the enzyme is part of the pathway. It also shows that it is part of the main catabolic path, i.e. there are no alternative routes. This is further supported by the observation that l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate accumulated in the presence of d-galacturonate in the lga1-deletion strain (see Table 2).TABLE 2Accumulation of l-galactonate and l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate in the growth medium for the parent strain (wt) and for the lga1-deletion strain (Δlga1)0 days2 days4 days6 daysl-Galactonate (wt)0.00.10.40.3l-Galactonate (Δlga1)0.00.10.20.3l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (wt)0.00.10.30.3l-Threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (Δlga1)0.00.82.33.6 Open table in a new tab The protein has similarities with the protein family of dihydrodipicolinate synthases. These are so called class I aldolases with a lysine in the active site, which is also involved in the catalytic reaction. In the LGA1 protein the corresponding lysine is in position 174. The protein also showed homologies to the protein family of 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate aldolases. These proteins are found in archae and are part of the non-phosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff pathway facilitating the aldol cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate to pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde. The protein does, however, not show significant sequence similarities to microbial 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolases. In a BLAST search the LGA1 protein had highest homology with hypothetical proteins from filamentous fungi such as those with the protein identifiers XP385304, XP957838, AAZ79448, XP754430, BAE57893, and XP660463. These proteins have between 60 and 75% identities in the amino acid sequence. They also have in common the following sequence around the catalytic lysine: HXNIXGTK*FTCXXTGKLTRVA. The catalytic lysine is marked with an asterisk. It is likely that these proteins catalyze the same reaction as the LGA1 protein. After the lga1 gene coding for l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase was identified. We expressed it in the heterologous host S. cerevisiae. This resulted in an active enzyme. The tagging of the N terminus, unlike the tagging of the C terminus, had no detrimental effect on the enzyme activity so that we chose this construct to analyze the kinetics. To test the specificity in the forward direction we used l- and d-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate. We found activity with l- but not with the d-form. The two compounds differ in their stereo specificity in C5 and C6. We also tested d-glycero-3-deoxypentulosonate. This compound is similar to the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate except that it lacks C6 (Fig. 4). The d-glycero-3-deoxy-pentulosonate showed activity, however, with a lower maximal velocity. This suggests that the aldolase recognizes the stereo specificity of the substrate only until the C4. This is supported by the activities found in reverse direction. Only the aldehydes l-glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and methylglyoxal showed activity together with pyruvate. The lack of activity with acetaldehyde suggests that the hydroxyl group on C5 is recognized and essential for the activity. The enzyme catalyzed reaction is reversible. In the forward direction with l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate as a substrate we estimated a Vmax of 20 units/mg or 11.3 s–1. In the reverse direction with pyruvate and l-glyceraldehyde as substrates the Vmax was 6.5 units/mg or 3.6 s–1. We did not estimate the equilibrium concentrations. However, for a similar enzyme, the l-erythro-3,6-dideoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-l-rhamnonate) aldolase, the equilibrium was on the substrate site. In equilibrium the substrate had about 10-fold higher concentration than pyruvate and the aldehyde (20Twerdochlib A.L. Pedrosa F.O. Funayama S. Rigo L.U. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 896-902Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Km in forward direction was 3.5 mm. This together with the assumption that for the LGA1 reaction the equilibrium is also on the site of the substrate would suggest that l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate might accumulate. We indeed found an accumulation of up to 0.3 g/liter corresponding to 1.5 mm in the growth medium for the strain without modifications. Other reactions in the pathway, such as the reactions before and after the aldolase, were not reversible. The l-galactonate dehydratase was shown to convert l-galactonate quantitatively (7Kuorelahti S. Jouhten P. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Richard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and also the glyceraldehyde reductase showed activity only with aldehyde and not with glycerol as substrate. It seems that the aldolase operates close to equilibrium, and that the catabolism through this pathway is driven by the enzymes before and after the aldolase (Fig. 5). The catabolic path for d-galacturonate metabolism has, except for the first step, similarities to the “non-phosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff pathway”. In this pathway, d-gluconate, derived from d-glucose, is converted to d-erythro-3-deoxyhexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate) which is subsequently split to pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde. This pathway is described in a hyperthermophilic archeon (13Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar bacterial pathways have been described for d-xylose (21Dahms A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and l-arabinose (22Dahms A.S. Anderson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Common is that the 2-keto-3-deoxy-pentulosonate is split by an aldolase to pyruvate and an aldehyde. There are also a few examples for such pathways in eukaryotes. In Aspergilli similar pathways for d-gluconate (23Elzainy T.A. Hassan M.M. Allam A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 457-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and d-galactonate (24Elshafei A.M. Abdel-Fatah O.M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were described in which an aldolase splits the 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate or -galactonate to pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde. Also a yeast catabolic path for l-rhamnose is described where the 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-rhamnonate is split to pyruvate and l-lactaldehyde by an aldolase (20Twerdochlib A.L. Pedrosa F.O. Funayama S. Rigo L.U. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 896-902Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic pathways these aldolase activities were described but not the corresponding genes. The identification of the l-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate aldolase gene might help to identify the other aldolases.

These studies suggested a delay between the appearance of the NR1 and NR2A subunits and their stable association as examined by co-immunoprecipitation of NR1 and NR2A. This prompted us to examine the stability and folding of the individual subunits using nonreduced polyacrylamide gels and the sulfhydryl cross-linker BMH. Both studies showed that the NR1 subunit was expressed in a monomer and dimer form, whereas both NR2 and NR3 showed substantial aggregation on both nonreduced gels and after cross-linking. Protein degradation experiments showed that NR1 was relatively stable, whereas NR2 and NR3 were more rapidly degraded. When co-expressed with NR1, NR2 was more stable. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that, under conditions of reduced ATP, the diffusion rate of NR2 and NR3 in the endoplasmic reticulum was reduced, whereas that of NR1 was unaffected. Together these data show that NR1 folds stably when expressed alone, unlike NR2 and NR3, and provides the substrate for assembly of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor.

The NR1 subunit is encoded by a single gene, which undergoes extensive splicing to generate eight different splice variants that differ in regional distribution and functional properties (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). The NR2 subunit class consists of four different subtypes, NR2A–NR2D, encoded by four separate but closely related genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). The NR3 subunit class consists of two different subtypes, NR3A and NR3B (2Sun L. Margolis F.L. Shipley M.T. Lidow M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Ciabarra A.M. Sullivan J.M. Gahn L.G. Pecht G. Heinemann S. Sevarino K.A. J.

A number of studies of mammalian cell lines either permanently or transiently transfected with the NMDA receptor subunits have indicated that the NR1 subunit alone does not form glycine-glutamate responsive channels and requires the presence of NR2 (5Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 367-378PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the NR1 and NR2 subunits contribute differently to the binding sites of a functional NMDA receptor. The NR1 subunit forms the glycine binding site (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the NR2 subunit provides part of the glutamate binding site (10Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Anson L.C. Chen P.E. Wyllie D.J.A. Colquhoun D. Schoepfer R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies on the NR3 subunit family suggested that it could act as a dominant negative subunit that reduced channel conductances when associated with NR1 and NR2 (4Nishi M. Hinds H. Lu H.P. Kawata M. Hayashi Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perez-Otano I. Schulteis C.T. Contractor A. Lipton S.A. Trimmer J.S. Sucher N.J. Heinemann S.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1228-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have suggested that NR3 can combine with NR1 alone to form an excitatory glycine channel in both transfected cells and the central nervous system (13Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J.K. Tu S.C. Kevin A.S.K. Nakanishi N. Tong G. Lipton S.A. Zhang D.X.

Commun. 2007; 354: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, different combinations of the NMDA receptor subunits must co-assemble to form functionally distinct ion channels.Current evidence indicates that the glutamate-activated ion channels are tetrameric. Biochemical and biophysical evidence from studies on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors strongly support such a structure (16Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These studies also indicate that the assembly of the receptor is by the association of already dimerized subunits (16Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y.

Biol. 2004; 344: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the NMDA receptors are members of the same gene family as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors, and x-ray crystallographic studies of the soluble ligand binding domains of both receptors reveal similar structures, it is likely that the NMDA receptor is also a tetramer (19Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 20Furukawa H. Singh S.K. Mancusso R. Gouaux E.

However, it is unclear how the NMDA receptor is assembled or whether it too forms by association of dimers of the different subunits. Studies using tandem chimaeras of the NR1 and NR2 subunits suggested that a dimer of dimers model could account for the assembly of the NMDA receptor (22Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but evidence for the formation of dimers of the different subunits is scarce. In a study of the determinants important for NMDA receptor assembly (23Meddows E. LeBourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we found that NR1 subunits expressed alone in HEK-293 cells ran as dimers on native gels. In contrast, NR2 subunits expressed alone gave a smear of immunoreactivity suggesting that they were not folding stably. Interestingly, a recent report suggests that an N-terminal NR1-NR1 interdisulfide bond is necessary for the trafficking of the NMDA receptor to the cell surface (24Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).To investigate the assembly pathway of the human NMDA receptor we have examined the time course of the assembly of the receptor in a cell line expressing it under the control of the dexamethasone promoter. These studies revealed an unexpected delay between the appearance of the subunits and their association as judged by co-immunoprecipitation of NR1 and NR2. This prompted us to examine the stability and folding of the individual subunits using nonreduced polyacrylamide gels and the sulfhydryl cross-linker BMH, together with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of their diffusion rate in the endoplasmic reticulum. All data were consistent with the NR1 subunit being stably folded and expressed in a monomer and dimer form. In contrast both NR2 and NR3 showed substantial aggregation on both nonreduced gels and after cross-linking and rapid rates of degradation compared with NR1, suggesting that they fold less well and are, consequently, less stable than NR1. The stability of NR2 was increased when co-expressed with NR1. The results are consistent with NR1 folding stably when expressed alone and providing a substrate for the stable association and folding of the other subunits into functional NMDA receptors.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—The NR2A subunit was detected using a rabbit anti-NR2A antibody raised against the C terminus of NR2A as previously described (25McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Molnár E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.L. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 35: 1355-1367Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The NR1-1a subunit was detected using antibodies raised against the C terminus as previously described (25McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Molnár E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.L. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 35: 1355-1367Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody clone 9E10 was produced in-house from a hybridoma, and the rabbit anti-HA antibody was supplied by BabCO, Berkeley, CA. To produce an antibody against the NR3A subunit, the last 160 amino acids of NR3A (Tyr956–Ser1116) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET32a vector to produce a thioredoxin fusion protein containing a His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site and the sequence from the C terminus of NR3A. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and then purified on a Talon nickel chelate column (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The fusion peptide was released from the fusion protein by thrombin cleavage, purified, and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. The immunopositive sera were further affinity-purified using the fusion protein coupled to a Sulfo-link column (Pierce), and the antibodies were recovered using 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by immediate neutralization with 1 m Tris. The specificity of the affinity purified antibodies was tested using membranes from cells expressing NR1-1A, NR2A, and NR3A subunits, and no immunoreactivity was found with NR1 or NR2 subunits. In rat brain membranes the affinity-purified antibodies gave a single immunoreactive band at 130 kDa that showed the developmental expression profile reported for NR3A in rats (26Garside M. Physiological Sciences. University of Oxford, Oxford2005: 181-192Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected using a 1:5000 dilution of donkey anti-sheep (Sigma-Aldrich), goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega, Madison, WI).Recombinant Constructs—The human NMDA receptor subunits NR1-1a, NR2A, NR3A, and HA-tagged NR3A were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Whiting and Dr. Peter Wingrove of Merck Sharp and Dohme. The NR1Δ843 construct has been described previously (23Meddows E. LeBourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NR1-1a fused at the C terminus with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was produced by PCR using KOD HiFi polymerase (Novagen, Nottingham, Nottshire, UK) and the primers 5′-CCAGTGTGCTGGAATTCCCGCGCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGCGGGGTCGACCAGCTCTCCCTAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into a similarly digested pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). NR3A C-terminally linked to YFP was produced in the same way but using the primers 5′-CGCGCTTTCTCCAAGCTTGTCTCAGTAATG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGGACGTGAATTCGGTACTTAAGGG-3′ followed by digestion of the PCR product with HindIII and EcoRI. C-terminally linked NR2A-YFP was produced by ligation of the PCR product produced by amplification of the NR2A using the primers 5′-CTAGAGACAAGATCTACACTATAGATG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAAGATCTACATCAGATTCGATACTAGGCAT-3′ and digestion of the product with BglII. The digested insert was ligated into BglII-digested eYFP-N1. Myc-tagged NR2AΔ848 was similarly created using the primers 5′-CGAAATTAATACCAGTGGTACCTATGGGCAGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GTCGGAGCACACGCCCTCGAGACAGAAGCGCAGC-3′. The resulting PCR product was then digested with KpnI and XhoI and ligated into a similarly digested pCDNA3.1mycHisA(+) vector.Myc-tagged NR2AΔ890 was created as follows using the NR2A in pcDNA1.1 described previously (23Meddows E. LeBourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NR2A was digested with HindIII and BamHI to yield a ∼1300-bp fragment comprising residues 465–890 of NR2A, which was ligated into similarly digested pcDNA3.1mycHisB(+) vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, a ∼1400-bp fragment comprising residues 1–464 of NR2A was removed from the original NR2A vector using HindIII. This fragment was ligated into HindIII-digested NR2A456–890 in pcDNA3.1mycHisB(+) to yield the myc-His-tagged NR2AΔ890. The truncated subunit was C-terminally YFP-tagged by amplifying the YFP-encoding fragment from eYFP-N1 vector with the forward primer 5′-GCTACCGGACTCAGATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGCCGCGGCTGATTATGATCTAGAGTCG-3′, which introduces a SacII site. The resulting PCR product was digested with SacII and ligated into a similarly digested NR2AΔ890 in pcDNA3.1mycHisB-(+) to create NR2AΔ890-YFP. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C, in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For microscopy the cells were plated onto glass coverslips. Cells were transfected using JetPEI, a polyethyleneimine-derived transfection reagent (Autogen Bioclear, Calne, Wiltshire, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In co-expression experiments with NR1 and NR2 or NR3 the ratio of DNAs was 1:3.The stably transfected mouse connective tissue fibroblast L(tk–) cell line expressing recombinant human NR1-1a/NR2A receptor subunits under the control of the dexamethasone promoter system has been described previously (27Grimwood S. Lebourdelles B. Atack J.R. Barton C. Cockett W. Cook S.M. Gilbert E. Hutson P.H. Mckernan R.M. Myers J. Ragan C.I. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cell line was grown in 75-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Expression of NR1-1a and NR2A subunits was induced by addition of 1 μm dexamethasone (in methanol) to the growth medium. The excitotoxicity encountered when expressing recombinant NMDA receptors in mammalian cells was overcome by the addition of ketamine (0.5 mm) to the culture medium after induction. For metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), the L(tk–) cell line was plated onto 6-well plates and after 24 h induced to express the NMDA receptor. After 24-h induction the cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 40 min before adding [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for 15 min. The cells were then washed with full medium twice, followed by two more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed and immunoprecipitated for NR1 as described below.Co-immunoprecipitation—The L(tk–) cells were grown for 48 h then induced and processed at time points 0–8 h by quantitative co-immunoprecipitation and analyzed using SDS-PAGE, as described previously in detail (23Meddows E. LeBourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were transfected as described above and cultured for 48 h before use. Briefly, cells were lysed on ice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) plus the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 20 mm iodoacetamide. Samples of the lysate were rotated overnight at 4 °C with 2–5 μgofthe appropriate antibodies. A 100-μl suspension of Protein G-Sepharose Fast-Flow beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was added to the precipitates and mixed by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was washed twice in RIPA buffer then twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The immunocomplexes were eluted from the Protein G beads by boiling in 2× reducing sample buffer (20 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl). Both the precipitates and total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot. In the case of the immunoprecipitates from the radiolabeled cells, the gels were impregnated with Fluor and subjected to autoradiography as described previously (25McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Molnár E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.L. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 35: 1355-1367Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Cross-linking and Cycloheximide Treatment of Cells—Bismaleimidohexane (BMH), a sulfhydryl-specific cross-linker with a 16.1-Å linker arm, was purchased from Pierce. A 50 mm stock solution of BMH in Me2SO was freshly prepared on day of the experiment. It was then diluted in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 to give a 2.5 mm working solution (lysis buffer). HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the different subunits were scraped from the 6-well plates in PBS, centrifuged (5000 rpm, 5 min at room temperature), lysed with lysis buffer, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min, with occasional mixing by inversion. Excess BMH was quenched by adding an equal volume of 2× reducing sample buffer and incubating for a further 10 min. Samples were then heated to 99 °C for 5 min, and 50-μl samples of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described below.For the degradation experiments, cycloheximide (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to create a 50 mg/ml stock solution. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated NMDA receptor subunits in 25-cm2 flasks and grown for 24 h. They were then re-plated into 6-mm wells and grown for another 24 h. Rat cortical neurons were harvested at E19 as described previously (28Chan W.Y. Soloviev M.M. Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and grown for 14 days in vitro before cycloheximide treatment. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and cells were harvested by scraping into PBS, spinning down, and lysing in 150 μl of 2× reducing sample buffer at the indicated time points. Samples (45 μl) were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels, and the immunoreactive bands were quantified using the Quantity One software supplied with the FluorSmax Imager (Bio-Rad). Western blotting for tubulin was performed to ensure even loading of samples.For the lactacystin (Sigma) experiments, HEK-293 cells were transfected and seeded as described for the cycloheximide experiments. Lactacystin was added to the wells from a 1 mm stock solution in H2O to a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were incubated for 16 h. Samples were analyzed as described for the cycloheximide experiments.Western Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 6% or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Trans blot semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) the membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h. The primary antibodies were incubated with the immunoblots overnight at 4 °C and subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with the chemiluminescence SuperSignal kit (Pierce).Blue Native-PAGE—The oligomeric structure of native protein complexes was analyzed using a modification of BN-PAGE, as described previously (23Meddows E.

Briefly, membrane samples were prepared by mixing with 1 mg/ml DNase (with 10 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. An equal volume of 2× BN-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Bis-Tris, 150 mm 6-amino caproic acid, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7) was added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. The membrane samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min and mixed with 5% Serva blue dye. The markers thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin, apoferritin, and β-amylase were mixed with 5% Serva blue dye and run with the samples on a 5–18% gel containing no detergent. The samples and markers were stacked at 100 V, then run at 500 V and 15 mA at 4 °C. The gel was then subjected to a revised Western immunoblot protocol. The marker lanes were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue) then destained to visualize the protein bands. The section of the membrane containing the proteins was washed with PBS-T and processed as described for the SDS-PAGE immunoblots.FRAP Analysis—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the different NMDA receptor subunits tagged at the C terminus with YFP. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was recorded using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope essentially as described previously (31Esapa C.T. Waite A. Locke M. Benson M.A. Kraus M. McIlhinney R.A. Sillitoe R.V. Beesley P.W. Blake D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, YFP was bleached with a high power laser beam (17 milliwatts) and recovery into the bleached area monitored for 2 min. Recovery is presented as percentage of original fluorescence, corrected for any bleaching due to repetitive scanning, at 1% of total laser output. Cells were depleted for ATP by incubating for 60 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 50 μm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.02% sodium azide, which reduced the ATP content of the cells by 75% (data not shown). The FRAP data were best fitted to a single exponential using IGOR PRO software and the FRAP plug-in written by K. Miura. Statistical analysis of the FRAP data was performed in GraphPad Prism software using its analysis of variance software and the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTSTime Course of NR1-1a and NR2A Subunit Synthesis and Association—Whole cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times after cell induction of NMDA receptor synthesis following dexamethasone treatment, and then analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The resulting immunoblot showed that synthesis of the NR1-1a subunits could be detected as early as 1 h after induction while NR2A could be detected in the cell lysates by 2 h (Fig. 1A). This difference in the apparent later appearance of the NR2A subunit could reflect a lower detection threshold for the antibody recognizing NR2A, but 2 h after induction both subunits could be readily detected.The time course of NR1-1a and NR2A subunit association was examined by immunoprecipitating L(tk–) cell lysates with a NR1-1a C-terminal antibody at timed intervals after induction of the cells by dexamethasone. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the NR2A antibody to determine whether this subunit co-immunoprecipitated with the NR1-1a subunit. Stable NR1-1a and NR2A subunit association was readily detected 5 h after induction with a weak signal for NR2A visible at 4 h (Fig. 1B). Taking into account the possibility that the detection of NR2A may be less sensitive than that of NR1-1a, this result suggests that subunit association can be detected at 4 h following the start of receptor synthesis. We investigated the oligomerization of NR1-1a and NR2A subunits in membranes prepared from the L(tk–) cell line at the indicated timed intervals after induction of receptor synthesis and analyzed using the nondenaturing BN-PAGE system. The resulting immunoblots showed that oligomers with an apparent molecular mass of 860 kDa containing both NR1-1a and NR2A subunits, comparable to the oligomers formed in NR1-1a/NR2A transiently transfected HEK-293 cells as described previously (see Ref. 23Meddows E. LeBourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), can be detected 6 h after induction of the cells (Fig. 1C).When cells already synthesizing the NMDA receptor are pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min, then immunoprecipitated for the NR1-1a subunit, the NR2A subunit can be co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1D). This finding suggests that in cells already expressing the NMDA receptor subunits, newly synthesized NR2A can readily associate with NR1-1a. This result contrasts with our observation that co-immunoprecipitation of NR2A with NR1-1a occurs only after 4 or 5 h of induction, when both subunits have been present for 2 or 3 h. The delay in the association of NR1 and NR2 following induction could either reflect the time taken to synthesize and fold sufficient of each to allow their association, or the time needed for a stable pool of NR1 to form and provide a template for subunit association. We therefore examined further the stability of the individual NR1-1a, NR2A, and NR3A subunits when expressed alone in transiently transfected cells.NR1 Folds and Dimerizes, whereas NR2 and NR3 Show Aggregation When Expressed Alone—Unfolded proteins often have free cysteines that can cause aggregation of the proteins under nonreducing SDS-PAGE conditions. Therefore, we analyzed the behavior of NR1-1a, NR2A, and NR3A on both nonreduced and reduced gels. The results showed that NR1-1a and NR2A, when individually expressed, yielded predominantly single immunoreactive bands on nonreduced gels that, in the case of NR1-1a, migrated significantly faster than under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). This increase in mobility in the nonreduced samples is due to the interchain disulfide bonds in the folded, or partially folded, protein, which results in a more compact structure than the fully unfolded reduced samples. NR3A, by contrast, consistently gave a range of higher molecular weight bands under nonreducing conditions, suggesting that it is not completely folded when expressed alone (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Analysis of HEK-293 cell lysates expressing either NR1-1a, NR2A, or NR3A under nonreduced or reduced conditions. The lysates from transfected HEK-293 cells were analyzed in the presence (+), or absence (–) of dithiothreitol (DTT, 20 mm). Although the presence of dithiothreitol did not affect the behavior of NR2A, nonreduced NR1-1a migrated noticeably faster than when reduced. The arrows indicate the presence of the high molecular mass bands in"

HR is a VDR corepressor, and it has been hypothesized that VDR·HR suppress gene expression during specific phases of the hair cycle. In this study, we examined the corepressor activity of HR mutants (E583V, C622G, N970S, V1056M, D1012N, V1136D, and Q1176X) previously described as the molecular cause of APL as well as HR variants (P69S, C397Y, A576V, E591G, R620Q, T1022A) due to non-synonymous polymorphisms in the HR gene. We found that the corepressor activities of all but one of the pathogenic HR mutants were completely abolished. HR mutant E583V exhibited normal corepressor activity, suggesting that it may not be pathogenic. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, all of the pathogenic HR mutants bound VDR but exhibited reduced binding to histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), suggesting that the impaired corepressor activity is due in part to defective interactions with HDACs. The HR variants exhibited two classes of corepressor activity, those with normal activity (C397Y, E591G, R620Q) and those with partially reduced activity (P69S, A576V, T1022A). All of the variants interacted with VDR and HDAC1 with the exception of P69S, which was degraded. When coexpressed with VDR, all of the HR pathogenic mutants and variants increased the level of VDR protein, demonstrating that this function of HR was not impaired by these mutations.

HR has been shown to function as a corepressor of multiple nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR), the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (ROR) α, β, and γ and the vitamin D receptors (VDR).

HR knock-out mouse models reveal that HR regulates the timing of epithelial cell differentiation in both the epidermis and hair follicle (32Zarach J.M. Beaudoin G.M. II I Coulombe P.A. Thompson C.C. Development. 2004; 131: 4189-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR; OMIM 277440) is a rare recessive genetic disease caused by heterogeneous mutations in the VDR gene (33Malloy P.J. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The VDR is a member of the steroid-thyroid-retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), binds to the VDR, leading to either the activation or suppression of gene transcription. Interestingly, some patients with HVDRR, those with premature stop mutations, mutations in the DNA binding domain, or mutations that affect heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR), also present with alopecia and sometimes with skin lesions similar to APL. The clinical and histological findings of hair loss in HVDRR patients and APL patients are strikingly similar despite distinct genetic defects (19Zlotogorski A. Panteleyev A.A. Aita V.M.

The shared hair loss phenotype in HVDRR and APL patients suggests that both HR and VDR may impact a common signaling pathway in normal hair growth. The importance of HR and VDR in hair follicle development has been further demonstrated in mouse models. Targeted expression in keratinocytes of VDR knock-out mice of either the wild type (WT) VDR or the VDR with mutations in the ligand binding domain restores normal hair follicle cycling (35Chen C.H.

On the other hand, transgenic expression of HR in progenitor keratinocytes rescues hair follicle regeneration in HR null mice (38Beaudoin G.M. II I Sisk J.M. Coulombe P.A. Thompson C.C. Proc. Natl.

A recent report linked VDR function with HR in the hair follicle by showing that disruption of hair follicle structure during the first catagen phase in VDR null mice was associated with increased expression of HR (39Bikle D.D. Elalieh H. Chang S. Xie Z. Sundberg J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 340-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, increased expression of VDR was also found in the HR mutant mice (40Nam Y. Kim J.K. Cha D.S. Cho J.W. Cho K.H. Yoon S. Yoon J.B. Oh Y.S. Suh J.G. Han S.S. Song C.W. Yoon S.K.

In the present study we investigated whether HR mutations reported to cause APL affected HR corepressor activity with VDR. We demonstrated that these HR mutations have impaired VDR corepressor activity that is associated with defective interaction with HDACs. Cell Culture—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine growth serum, (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) and appropriate antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—Site-directed mutagenesis of the WT human HR cDNA in p3xFlagCMV7.1 (kindly provided by Dr. Axel Hillmer) was performed using the Gene Editor (Promega, Madison, WI) or the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutant oligonucleotides used are listed in supplemental Table SI. All clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. HA-HDAC1 was constructed by subcloning the mouse HDAC1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Schreiber) into the SmaI sites of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged phCMV3 (Genlantis, San Diego, CA). Transactivation—COS-7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected with either 62.5 ng of WT VDR with or without 250 ng of human WT HR or HR mutant expression plasmids and 250 ng of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24) promoter VDRE-luciferase plasmid using Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). pRLnull Renilla luciferase plasmid (5 ng; Promega) served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After a 24-h transfection, the cells were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine growth serum with vehicle or various concentrations of calcitriol (10–7–10–4 m). The transfected cells were lysed in 0.25 ml of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and aliquots assayed for protein expression by Western blot and luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) and a Turner Design luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA) as previously described (41Malloy P.J.

In some transactivation assays, WT and mutant HR corepressor activity on RORα was examined using an RORα expression vector and an RORE-luciferase reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr. Vincent Giguere).

Cell extracts were denatured in NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 70 °C and electrophoresed on 10% NuPAGE gels in 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-sodium dodecyl sulfate running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with a mouse VDR monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA (F-7) mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in T75 tissue culture flasks. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of WT HR or HR mutant expression plasmids with either 5 μg of human VDR plasmid or mouse HDAC1 plasmid using Polyfect (Qiagen). Cells were lysed in 0.25 ml of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl) (3Potter G.B. Zarach J.M. Sisk J.M. Thompson C.C. Mol.

For immunoprecipitation, extracts (0.2 ml each) were loaded to a 96-well plate coated with ANTI-FLAG HS, M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After being washed four times with IP buffer, immunoprecipitates were eluted with 30 μl of 2× NuPage lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot analysis. In this study we examined the corepressor activity of the WT, APL/AUC mutant, and polymorphic variants of the human HR on calcitriol-mediated transactivation of the CYP24A1 promoter, a known target of VDR. HR corepressor activity was examined in COS-7 cells that express low levels of endogenous VDR. Cells were co-transfected with VDR and HR cDNA expression vectors and a CYP24A1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct and then treated with graded concentrations of calcitriol. In Fig. 1, we show the calcitriol-induced VDR transactivation measured with or without co-transfected WT HR. As expected, calcitriol greatly enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by VDR in the absence of HR. Co-transfection with HR, on the other hand, resulted in a marked reduction in transcriptional activation of the CYP24A1 promoter by the liganded VDR (Fig. 1). However, the repressive effect of HR on VDR transactivation activity was gradually relieved with increasing calcitriol concentrations. Additionally, in the absence of calcitriol, HR suppressed basal VDR transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Our results are consistent with previous reports that HR suppressed both basal and liganded VDR transcriptional activity (4Hsieh J.C. Sisk J.M. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Slater S.A. Haussler M.R.

The reduced repressive activity of HR at high concentrations of calcitriol may be caused by the dissociation of HR from VDR by high concentrations of calcitriol or by the recruitment of coactivators to the liganded VDR (5Xie Z.

The corepressor activity of the mutant HRs was then examined in VDR-mediated transactivation assays in COS-7 cells. Calcitriol-induced VDR transactivation of CYP24A1 promoter activity was measured in the absence or presence of co-transfected WT or mutant HRs.

These data demonstrate that mutations in HR that cause APL/AUC alter its ability to function as a VDR corepressor. The HR mutant E583V was the only so-called pathogenic mutant that exhibited normal corepressor activity. The E583V mutant may be a polymorphism rather than a disease-causing mutation. Alternatively, it is possible that this mutant may exhibit defective corepressor activity on different target genes. Unexpectedly, several of the HR mutants (C622G, N1012D, V1136D, and Q1176X) enhanced VDR transactivation (Fig. 3A) compared with cells transfected with VDR and control vector. At the highest concentration of calcitriol the differences in transactivation are probably not relevant and not convincingly significant. The effect of pathogenic mutants on VDR basal (no calcitriol) transcriptional activity was also examined in co-transfected COS-7 cells in the absence of calcitriol. As shown in Fig. 3B, the HR mutants also exhibited defective corepressor activity on VDR basal transactivation activity with the exception of the E583V mutant, which exhibited full repressive activity similar to the WT HR, again indicating it may not be pathogenic. In addition to the pathogenic mutations described in APL patients, a number of polymorphisms in the HR gene were identified in a systematic mutation screening of HR in androgenic alopecia (8Cichon S.

We recreated these polymorphic variants in the HR cDNA and examined their effects on VDR corepressor activity. In contrast to pathogenic mutants described above, the polymorphic variants showed normal or partially reduced corepressor activity on VDR transactivation (Fig. 4A). Three N-terminal polymorphisms, C397Y, E591G, and R620Q, fully retained their repressive ability while three others, P69S, A576V, and T1022A, exhibited partial repressive activity. The T1022A mutation was initially described in a patient with AUC as the molecular cause of the disease (6Ahmad W. Faiyaz ul Haque M. Brancolini V. Tsou H.C. ul Haque S. Lam H. Aita V.M.

https://openalex.org/W2156857095,"Reepithelialization is a critical step in wound healing. It is initiated by keratinocyte migration at the wound edges. After wounding, extracellular nucleotides are released by keratinocytes and other skin cells. Here, we report that activation of P2Y2 nucleotide receptor by ATP/UTP inhibits keratinocyte cell spreading and induces lamellipodium withdrawal. Kymography analysis demonstrates that these effects correlate with a durable decrease of lamellipodium dynamics. P2Y2 receptor activation also induces a dramatic dismantling of the actin network, the loss of alpha3 integrin expression at the cell periphery, and the dissolution of focal contacts as indicated by the alteration of alpha(v) integrins and focal contact protein distribution. In addition, activation of P2Y2R prevents growth factor-induced phosphorylation of Erk(1,2) and Akt/PkB. The use of a specific pharmacological inhibitor (YM-254890), the depletion of G alpha(q/11) by siRNA, or the expression of a constitutively active G alpha(q/11) mutant (Q209L) show that activation of G alpha(q/11) is responsible for these ATP/UTP-induced effects. Finally, we report that ATP delays growth factor-induced wound healing of keratinocyte monolayers. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for a unique and important role for extracellular nucleotides as efficient autocrine/paracrine regulators of keratinocyte shape and migration during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2051003806,"RIC-3 has been identified as a chaperone molecule involved in promoting the functional expression of nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptors in mammalian cells. In this study, we examined the effects of RIC-3a (isoform a) and a truncated isoform (isoform d) on RIC-3 localization, mobility, and aggregation and its effect on 5-HT3 receptor composition in mammalian cells. Human RIC-3a possesses an amino-terminal signal sequence that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is distributed within the reticular network, often forming large diffuse “slicks” and bright “halo” structures. RIC-3a is highly mobile within and between these compartments. Despite the propensity for RIC-3a to aggregate, its expression enhances the level of surface 5-HT3A (homomeric) receptors. In contrast, RIC-3a exerts an inhibitory action on the surface expression of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. RIC-3d exhibits an altered subcellular distribution, being localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, large diffuse slicks, tubulo-vesicular structures, and the Golgi. Bidirectional trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi suggests that RIC-3d constitutively cycles between these two compartments. In support of the large coiled-coil domain of RIC-3a being responsible for protein aggregation, RIC-3d, lacking this cytoplasmic domain, does not aggregate or induce the formation of bright aggregates. Regardless of these differences, isoform d is still capable of enhancing homomeric, and inhibiting heteromeric, 5-HT3 receptor expression. Thus, both isoforms of RIC-3 play a role in determining 5-HT3 receptor composition.

Chaperone molecules play an important role in the intracellular transport of receptors. However, a fundamental question in neurobiology remains: How is receptor biogenesis orchestrated? Despite the fact that receptor composition determines receptor function and their pharmacological repertoire, little information is available regarding how this may be achieved. Specific assembly signals exist that can determine a preference for particular subunit partners (2Connolly C.N. Wafford K.A. Biochem. Soc.

In the central nervous system, 5-HT3 receptors are important targets for the control of emesis induced by chemotherapy/radiotherapy and have been implicated in schizophrenia (13Thompson A.J.

The two RIC-3 isoforms exhibit overlapping, but distinct, localizations between the ER and Golgi. In keeping with a role in receptor biogenesis, these compartments are involved in protein synthesis, assembly, and N-linked glycosylation. Despite differences in RIC-3 isoform localization and the propensity to aggregate, both isoforms promote the surface expression of homomeric receptors and inhibit the formation of heteromeric receptors. Thus, RIC3 can manipulate 5-HT3 receptor composition.

DELYK/IE/QDSAL). Underlined are residues introduced as the result of the incorporation of restriction sites for cloning purposes. Both 5-HT3A-YFP and 5-HT3B-CFP were capable of assembling into cell surface-expressed receptors as wild-type receptors. Human RIC-3a was a kind gift from M. Treinin (Hebrew University) and used as previously described (10Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22502-22507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RIC-3 isoform d and tRIC3 were generated by PCR to generate RIC-3 variants terminating with the sequence... YILFKLSKGK (tRIC-3) or... YILFKVSRIILTILHQ (isoform d). RIC-3-N and RIC-3-C possessing artificial N-glycosylation sites, AFAKANGSGGGAGGGG (K80N for RIC-3-N) and LRKRNGSGLE (P364G, Q365S for RIC-3-C), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. RIC-3-SS-DsRed was generated by replacing the amino-terminal methionine of DsRed with the amino-terminal 33 residues of RIC-3 isoform a. RIC-3-YFP, RIC-3-pHluorin, and RIC-3-DsRed were generated by PCR, cloning the relevant fluorescent protein between residues 30 and 31 of RIC-3. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The addition of these fluorescent probes to the amino terminus of RIC-3 did not alter their subcellular distribution when compared with untagged RIC-3. Furthermore, these chimeras exhibited the same modulatory behavior on 5-HT3 receptors. ER-Red and Golgi-YFP were purchased from Clontech. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as directed. Antisera (sheep) to RIC-3 were generated as previously reported (10Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22502-22507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and used at 0.5 μg/ml for Western blotting. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Perbio and used at 1/5000. Lysotracker-Red (Molecular Probes) and monodansylcadaverine (Sigma) were used as recommended by the supplier. Quantification of Cell Surface Expression—Transfected COS7 cells were plated into 24-well dishes. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) 12–24 h post-transfection. Cell surface detection was performed in the absence of detergent, and total expression levels were determined following Triton X-100 (0.5%, 15 min) treatment. Briefly, following permeabilization (if required) cells were washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in phosphate-buffered saline) and blocked (5% Marvel, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h. Receptor expression was detected via the extracellular Myc epitope using rabbit anti-Myc for 1 h, followed by five washes in block, and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Excess antibody was removed by five further washes in block. Horseradish peroxidase levels were assayed using 10 μm Amplex Red (Invitrogen) as the substrate (plus 0.003% H2O2 in sodium phosphate buffer) with excitation at 560 nm and detection at 590 nm after 30 min using a Spectramax Gemini EM plate reader (Molecular Devices). Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were l-methionine starved for 30 min before being labeled with [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi/6-cm dish) (Translabel ICN/Flow) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 nm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Triton X-114-soluble and -insoluble fractions were produced using 30 °C, 15 min, to precipitate the detergent/membranes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The insoluble pellet was washed twice (washed at 4 °C and then precipitated at 30 °C) prior to returning to 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (16Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Radioligand Binding—[3H]GR65630 binding was performed on intact and transiently transfected COS7 cells cultured in 24-well plates and analyzed 1 day post-transfection. Mock-transfected cells were used as controls. A saturating concentration (3 nm) of [3H]GR65630 was incubated in sextuplicate for 2 h in binding buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm D(+)glucose, pH 7.4). Following five washes in binding buffer, cells were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and counted in a scintillation counter. Photobleaching Studies—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching in COS7 cells were carried out using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal imaging system incorporating a heated chamber (35 °C). Optimal conditions for photobleaching were determined using a 488-nm argon laser line (100% power, 20 scans). Post-photobleach imaging was performed using minimal laser excitation to reduce indirect bleaching. Much controversy exists over whether the first hydrophobic domain in RIC-3 represents a signal sequence (10Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27062-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the original Caenorhabditis elegans RIC-3 clone is not predicted to possess an amino-terminal signal sequence (6Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), human (NP_078833) and mouse (NP_001033713) RIC-3 do not share homology with the first 48 residues of the C. elegans clone (NP_501299). Thus, it is possible that C. elegans and the mammalian form of RIC-3 are distinct at their amino terminus and may differ with respect to the existence of a cleavable signal sequence or a transmembrane domain. To address this issue, we performed a SignalP3.0 analysis (22Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar) on human RIC-3 and determined that a cleavable signal sequence is predicted between amino acids 28 and 29 (AFL-SR) with an S-mean of 0.862 and D-score of 0.601 (Fig. 1A). This compares with that of a well characterized signal sequence from human growth hormone (23Connolly C.N. Futter C.E. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (AAA72555) that has an S-mean of 0.860 and D-score of 0.807. However, unlike the majority of amino-terminal signal sequences, the amino-terminal 8 amino acids of RIC-3 are not consistent with a hydrophobic signal sequence. Therefore, to determine experimentally whether the predicted signal sequence region is capable of directing protein import into the ER and undergoing cleavage, we generated a chimera incorporating the first 33 amino acids of RIC-3 followed by the sequence of DsRed monomer in which the initial methionine had been removed (RIC-3-SS-DsRed). As expected, the RIC-3-SS-DsRed is localized to the ER, as evidenced by the reticular staining pattern (Fig. 1B). To test whether the signal sequence is cleaved, we probed for the secretion of DsRed into the culture medium. RIC-3-SS-DsRed-transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased overnight in the absence of radiolabel. DsRed was immunoprecipitated from the medium and cell lysates. To distinguish soluble and membrane-bound DsRed within cells, cells were lysed using Triton X-114. Lysates were separated into soluble and insoluble (membrane) fractions prior to immunoprecipitation. DsRed was detected in both the medium and the soluble cellular fraction, confirming that the signal sequence is cleaved (Fig. 1C). It is not clear why two molecular mass forms (∼38- and ∼28-kDa bands) exist, when only one of ∼28 kDa is expected, but this finding is reproducible (n = 3). It is not likely to be due to the presence/absence of the signal sequence as both forms are detected in the medium and soluble fractions. No sites for N-glycosylation exist within DsRed, ruling out different glycosylation. Regardless, these results indicate that the amino-terminal region of RIC-3 is capable of functioning as a cleavable signal sequence. As stated above, RIC-3 has no predicted sites for N-glycosylation with which to probe the membrane topology of RIC-3. Therefore, we introduced two novel sites by site-directed mutagenesis at positions 80 or 363. These are predicted to reside extracellularly (RIC3-N) or intracellularly (RIC3-C), respectively. A comparison of the molecular mass of each protein, in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (to inhibit N-glycosylation) reveals that the molecular mass of RIC3-N is increased by ∼2–3 kDa, consistent with N-glycosylation at this engineered site (Fig. 1D, +). Furthermore, this increase in size is lost in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 1D, –). In contrast, no changes in the molecular mass of RIC3-C were evident. These findings support the predicted extracellular location of the pre-TMDI region (downstream from the signal sequence) and the cytoplasmic localization of the carboxyl terminus of RIC-3. Controversy also exists with respect to the subcellular localization of RIC-3. The consensus of opinion supports an endoplasmic reticulum localization of RIC-3 isoform a (RIC-3a) (6Halevi S. McKay J.

To address this issue, COS7 cells were co-transfected with organelle markers, ER-Red combined with RIC-3-YFP or Golgi-YFP combined with RIC-3-Red (monomeric DsRed). Clearly, RIC-3a is localized predominantly to the ER (Fig. 2A, left panels). Although RIC-3a is not concentrated in the Golgi, it may be present at low levels (11Castillo M. Mulet J. Gutierrez L.M. Ortiz J.A. Castelan F. Gerber S. Sala S. Sala F. Criado M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27062-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in other cells RIC-3a is also present within anomalous structures that are not observed in the absence of RIC-3 expression (Fig. 2A, right panels). Two distinct types of structures can be observed: A diffuse slick of low fluorescent intensity (Fig. 2B, thin arrows) and an intensely fluorescent aggregate (Fig. 2B, wide arrows) that appears hollow when imaged using lower exposures (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). Both these structures occur adjacent to the ER (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). Similar structures are evident upon the expression of untagged RIC-3a (not shown), eliminating the possibility that protein aggregation is being induced by YFP or DsRed dimerization. When RIC-3a-YFP is co-expressed with 5-HT3A-CFP, both proteins are observed to co-localize within the ER (not shown) and within both aggregate structures, depending on which structures are evident within the cell (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). Similarly, when 5-HT3A-CFP, 5-HT3B-YFP, and RIC-3a-Red are co-expressed in the same cell, all three proteins are co-localized in the ER and aggregates (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). That the 5-HT3 receptors do not accumulate in these structures when expressed in the absence of RIC-3a, combined with the fact that the aggregates are induced by RIC-3a expression, suggests that RIC-3a is able to direct 5-HT3 receptors into these structures. To determine specificity, we investigated the co-expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit, γ2Long, which remains unassembled within the ER in the absence of α and β subunits (26Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results observed for 5-HT3 receptors, the γ2Long-Red protein did not co-localize to these RIC-3a-YFP-containing structures (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). To address the question of possible cell surface expression of RIC-3a, a fusion incorporating PHluorin, a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that can report on surface labeling when expressed extracellularly was constructed (27Ashby M.C. Ibaraki K. Henley J.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 257-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pHluorin moiety is located within the extracellular (as determined by the introduction of an N-glycosylation site) (Fig. 1D) domain of RIC-3. As such, the pHluorin would be sensitive to pH changes in the extracellular environment but only if RIC-3 were expressed on the cell surface. At an extracellular pH of 8, RIC-3a-pHluorin fluorescence is observed with the ER (∼pH 7) and aggregates, with no evidence of surface fluorescence (Fig. 2D, left panels). Given that the aggregates remain visible, it is unlikely that these represent acidic compartments such as endosomes (∼pH 5.5) or lysosomes (<pH 5). Lowering the extracellular pH to 5.5 did not reduce the fluorescence signal, suggesting that little (if any) RIC-3a is present on the cell surface of COS7 cells. Moreover, the subsequent addition of NH4Cl to quench endosomal pH did not reveal any previously masked fluorescence residing within acidic compartments. Identical results were observed when RIC-3a-pHluorin was expressed in primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2D, right panels). Thus, when expressed recombinantly, RIC3a exists predominantly within the ER and ER-associated structures, with no evidence of surface or endosomal expression. These experiments were performed rapidly (<2 min), eliminating any significant effects of the treatments on protein trafficking. Given the pleomorphic nature of the RIC-3a aggregates, we investigated the potential for dynamic morphological changes of RIC-3a-YFP and RIC-3a-Red by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. In the majority of cells possessing the bright aggre"

Our recent histopathology results have shown that the hearts of transgenic E22K mice (Tg-E22K) resemble those of human patients, demonstrating enlarged interventricular septa and papillary muscles. In this study, we show no effect of the E22K mutation on the kinetics of mutated myosin in its ATP-powered interaction with fluorescently labeled single actin filaments compared to nontransgenic or transgenic wild-type (Tg-WT) control mice. Likewise, no change in cross-bridge dissociation rates (g(app)) was observed in freshly skinned papillary muscle fibers. In contrast, maximal force and ATPase were decreased approximately 20% in Tg-E22K skinned papillary muscle fibers and intracellular [Ca2+] and force transients were significantly decreased in intact papillary muscle fibers from Tg-E22K compared to Tg-WT mice. Moreover, energy metabolism measured in isolated working Tg-E22K mouse hearts perfused under conditions of physiologically relevant levels of metabolic demand was similar in Tg-E22K and control hearts before and after 20 min of no-flow ischemia. Our results suggest that the pathological response observed in the E22K myocardium might be triggered by mutation induced changes in the properties of the RLC Ca2+-Mg2+ site, the state of the Ca2+/Mg2+ occupancy and consequently the Ca2+ buffering ability of the RLC. By decreasing the affinity of the RLC for Ca2+, the E22K mutation most likely promotes a Mg2+-saturated RLC producing less force and ATPase than the Ca2+-saturated RLC of WT fibers. Decreased Ca2+ binding may also lead to faster Ca2+ dissociation kinetics in Tg-E22K intact fibers resulting in decreased duration and amplitude of [Ca2+] and force transients. These changes when placed in vivo would result in higher workloads and consequently cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2129815266,"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 and γ-aminobutyric acid, type C (GABAC) receptors are members of the Cys-loop superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, which also includes nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA, and glycine receptors. The details of how agonist binding to these receptors results in channel opening is not fully understood but is known to involve charged residues at the extracellular/transmembrane interface. Here we have examined the roles of such residues in 5-HT3 and GABAC receptors. Charge reversal experiments combined with data from activation by the partial agonist β-alanine show that in GABAC receptors there is a salt bridge between Glu-92 (in loop 2) and Arg-258 (in the pre-M1 region), which is involved in receptor gating. The equivalent residues in the 5-HT3 receptor are important for receptor expression, but charge reversal experiments do not restore function, indicating that there is not a salt bridge here. There is, however, an interaction between Glu-215 (loop 9) and Arg-246 (pre-M1) in the 5-HT3 receptor, although the coupling energy determined from mutant cycle analysis is lower than might be expected for a salt bridge. Overall the data show that charged residues at the extracellular/transmembrane domain interfaces in 5-HT3 and GABAC receptors are important and that specific, but not equivalent, molecular interactions between them are involved in the gating process.

Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar), and further knowledge has come from x-ray crystal structures of acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBP), which are homologous to the extracellular domain of this receptor (2Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Cys-loop receptors are composed of five pseudo-symmetrically arranged subunits surrounding a central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit is composed of an extracellular, a transmembrane, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain (ECD) contains the ligand binding site, which is formed at the interface of two adjacent subunits by the convergence of three amino acid loops (A–C) from one (the principal) subunit and three β-strands (D–F) from the adjacent (or complementary) subunit. The transmembrane domain (TMD) contains four membrane spanning α-helices (M1–M4) and a short C terminus. M2 from each subunit lines the pore and contains regions responsible for channel gating and ion selectivity.

Structural details extrapolated from AChBP have greatly enhanced our understanding of the extracellular, ligand binding, N-terminal domain. However, we have considerably less knowledge of the molecular details of the transmembrane region and know little about the mechanism by which information from agonist binding results in the opening of a pore some 30–60 Å distant. It is becoming increasingly clear that some of the machinery involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating is located at the extracellular/transmembrane interface and involves loops 2, 7, and 9 in the ECD, the pre-M1 region, and the M2-M3 loop in the transmembrane domain. Specific evidence to support this includes classic mutagenesis experiments of these regions, the creation of an AChBP-5-HT3 receptor chimera (comprised of AChBP and the TMD of the 5-HT3 receptor), which only functioned when loops 2, 7, and 9 were replaced with their 5-HT3 receptor equivalents, and a study using unnatural amino acids which showed that indeed a proline located at the apex of the M2-M3 loop in the 5-HT3 receptor can control pore opening via a cis-trans isomerization (4Bouzat C.

Some charged residues, however, are conserved, including the cluster of basic residues in the pre-M1 region, and studies have shown the importance of these residues in GABAA, 5-HT3, and nACh receptors (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Vicente-Agullo F. Rovira J.C. Sala S. Sala F. Rodriguez-Ferrer C. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Ballesta J.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8300-8306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we have explored the role of conserved charged residues in two members of the Cys-loop family, the 5-HT3 receptor and the GABAC receptor, which is a member of the GABAA receptor family, and in particular explored if there is a salt bridge between this region and the β1-β2 loop as has been demonstrated in the nACh receptor (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the specific interactions between the ECD and TMD can vary between different Cys-loop receptors. Materials—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum, which was from Labtech International. GABAC receptor antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D, and Vectashield mounting medium were from Vector. [3H]Granisetron (63.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and quipazine dimaleate was from Tocris. All other reagents were of the highest obtainable grade. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant mouse 5-HT3A receptor subunits (GenBank™ accession number AY605711) or human GABAC (ρ1) receptor subunits (GenBank™ accession number M62400, kindly gifted by D. S. Weiss) were prepared in the vector pcDNA3 using standard techniques (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Mutant sequences were subcloned into the vector pGEMHE (11Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) for expression in Xenopus oocytes. Oocyte Preparation—This was as described previously (12Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were washed in 4 changes of OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), de-folliculated in 1.5 mg/ml collagenase for ∼1 h, washed again in 4 changes of OR2, and transferred to 70% Leibovitz media (Invitrogen) buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The following day they were injected with 5 ng of mRNA produced by in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) from wild type or mutant DNA. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 24–72 h post-injection. Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamping of Xenopus oocytes was performed using standard electrophysiological procedures as previously described (12Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, a GeneClamp 500B amplifier was connected to a PC running CLAMPEX Version 6.0.3 software via a DigiData1200 Series Interface (all Axon Instruments, Inc.). Glass microelectrodes were pulled from GC150TF-10 glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) using a P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter) to a resistance of 0.5–1 megaohms and back-filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were maintained at a holding potential of -60 mV unless stated otherwise and perfused continuously with ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) for GABAC receptor experiments or calcium-free ND96 for 5-HT3 receptor experiments at a rate of 3–4 ml/min. GABA or 5-HT was applied to the bath using a Valve Bank 8 II system (Automate Scientific, Inc.). Concentration-response curves and parameters were obtained using Prism v4 software (GraphPad). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained on 90-mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mix F12 (1:1) with GLUTAMAX I™ containing 10% fetal calf serum and passaged when confluent. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (13Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) at 80–90% confluency. After transfection, cells were incubated for 3–4 days before assay. Immunofluorescent Localization—The methodology was as described for localization of the 5-HT3 receptor (12Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells, grown on 22-mm coverslips, were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with the GABACρ1 antisera sc-21336, which recognizes the extracellular domain. Biotinylated anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium, and immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon optiphot or confocal microscope. [3H]Granisetron Oocyte Binding—20–40 oocytes were homogenized in 200 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1% Triton X-100. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, oocyte yolk proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was retained, avoiding the uppermost lipid layer. Single point assays were performed in 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 25 μl of oocyte preparation and 0.5 nm [3H]granisetron. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm quipazine. Tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before bound radioligand was harvested by rapid filtration onto GF/B filters pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were then washed with two 3-ml washes of ice-cold HEPES buffer and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Double Mutant Cycle Analysis—EC50 values were used to calculate the coupling coefficient (Ω) based on the equation Ω= EC50wt,wtEC50mut,mut/EC50wt,mutEC50mut,wt, where wt,wt represents the wild type (WT) receptor, wt,mut and mut,wt represent single mutations, and mut,mut represents the double mutant incorporating both single mutations. The coupling energy between these two residues was then calculated using ΔΔGint =-RT lnΩ. Application of 5-HT to Xenopus oocytes expressing WT 5-HT3 receptors produced concentration-dependent, rapidly activating inward currents that desensitized over the time-course of the application. Concentration response curves revealed an EC50 of 1.2 μm and Hill slope of 2.5 ± 0.2. Cys-loop receptor subunit alignments allowed us to identify charged residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg) belonging to 5-HT3 receptor loops 2, 7, 9, and the pre-M1 region (Fig. 1). Unlike other members of the Cys-loop LGIC superfamily, the 5-HT3 receptor M2-M3 loop and post-M4 regions do not have any charged residues. On a homology model of the 5-HT3 receptor, those residues close to the ECD-TMD interface that could interact with other charged residues (Glu-80, Asp-172, Glu-213, Glu-215, Arg-244, Arg-245, and Arg-246) were mutated to have a similar, opposite, or no charge. Single Mutations—Mutations to the charged interface residues were not well tolerated; no functional response could be detected for 7 of 15 mutations (Table 1). Some of these (Arg 245 and some Asp-172 and Glu-80 mutants) were probably due to lack of receptor expression; no [3H]granisetron binding could be detected. In addition, some mutant receptors had responses that were too small to obtain concentration-response curves (E80A, E80C, and E213R).TABLE 1Characteristics of mutant 5-HT3 receptors Data are the mean ± S.E., n = 4–10.

The exception was R246E mutant receptors, which had an EC50 of 0.08 μm. Multiple Mutations—The lack of response in the E80R and R245E mutants could not be rescued by the double mutation. Most other charge reversal double, triple, and quadruple mutations also were nonfunctional (Table 2). Swapping charges in the combination E215R/R246E, however, produced a functional receptor (Fig. 2) which had an EC50 for 5-HT of 0.35 μm that is between the EC50s for receptors displaying the single mutations E215R (1.13 μm) and R246E (0.076 μm). This finding that the impairment of channel function seen with R246E can be partially recovered by adding the E215R mutation suggests that these two residues interact. Double mutant cycle analysis of this pairing supports this suggestion and indicates an interaction energy of -0.9 kcal mol-1 (Fig. 2). This is lower than values previously seen for a buried salt bridge (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Vaughan C.K. Harryson P. Buckle A.M.

In contrast, oocytes expressing Arg-257 mutant receptors produced large inward currents in response to GABA, with EC50 values and Hill coefficients not significantly different from wild type (Table 3). Immunofluorescent studies with antisera that recognizes the extracellular domain of the GABAC receptor revealed that R258A but not R258E or R258K receptors were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 3). Mutation at Glu-92—The responses from oocytes expressing E92A and E92D mutant receptors had EC50 values ∼5- and 10-fold lower than WT receptors, respectively (Table 4). E92D receptors also had a reduction in their Hill coefficients. The shapes of the responses indicated slower off rates for all Glu-92 mutants, and determination of τoff revealed ∼3-fold increases compared with WT receptors (Table 5).TABLE 4Properties of Glu-92 mutant GABAC receptors Data are the mean ± S.E.

In E92A and E92D mutant receptors β-alanine was found to act as a full agonist (Fig. 4). E92R mutant receptors did not respond to high concentrations of GABA (up to 30 mm) or β-alanine (up to 100 mm) but were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 3). Multiple Mutations—The lack of response in the E92R and R258E mutants was rescued by the double mutation E92R/R258E. This receptor has an EC50 of 0.48 μm, ∼2-fold lower than that for wild type receptors (1.08 μm) but not as low as the values we observed for E92A or E92D receptors (0.22 and 0.10 μm, respectively). The kinetics of the response in the double mutant also revealed an increased τoff (Table 5), and β-alanine again acted as a full (96 ± 3%) rather than a partial agonist, as we had observed for the E92A and E92D receptors (Fig. 4). The lack of response of the E92R and R258E mutant receptors unfortunately precluded double mutant cycle analysis of this pairing. Understanding the method of transduction between the ligand binding site and the pore is a key goal in the Cys-loop receptor field. It is known that charged residues located at the interface of the extracellular and transmembrane domains are important, and salt bridges between such residues have been demonstrated in both nACh and GABAA receptors, although the molecular details of these are different. Here we have explored the possibility of a salt bridge between a conserved Glu residue in loop 2 and a conserved Arg residue in the pre-M1 region in 5-HT3 and GABAC receptors. The data suggest that there is such an interaction in the GABAC receptor but not in the 5-HT3 receptor. This suggests that molecular details of the links between the ECD and transmembrane domains can differ between different Cys-loop receptors. A Salt Bridge in the GABAC Receptor—The GABAC receptor subunit residues Glu-92 and Arg-258 are highly conserved in all Cys-loop receptors; they are equivalent to Glu-45 and Arg-209 in the nACh receptor that have been shown to form a salt bridge (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The charge reversal mutants E92R and R258E were nonfunctional, but the double mutation E92R/R258E restored function, and these two residues are in close proximity on a homology model of the GABAC receptor (Fig. 5). We, therefore, propose that there is a salt bridge in the GABAC receptor at the equivalent location to that in the nACh receptor, and as in the nACh receptor, it is part of the transduction pathway. Further evidence to support this hypothesis comes from our studies with the partial agonist β-alanine, which acted as a full agonist in the double mutant receptors. A change in the efficacy of a partial agonist is typically interpreted as a change in gating parameters, as it indicates that the mutation has affected the open probability (Popen) of the receptor; here, the small Popen in the wild type receptor has increased in the mutant receptor. These data combined with the recent work of Wang et al. (16Wang, J., Lester, H. A., and Dougherty, D. A. (July 2, 2007) J. Biol. Chem., DOI 10.1074/jbc.M702314200Google Scholar), which indicates that the salt bridge at in the GABAC receptor is required to stabilize the closed state and is broken when the receptor moves into the open state, provide good evidence that a E92R/R258E salt bridge is involved in receptor gating and, thus, support our hypothesis that this salt bridge is a critical part of the transduction pathway coupling agonist binding to channel gating in the GABAC receptor. Interestingly, responses obtained from the double mutant receptors did have some differences to wild type receptors; they had a slower off rate, and the EC50 was ∼2-fold lower than wild type GABA responses (Tables 2 and 5). This does not detract from our proposal that a salt bridge here is intimately involved in receptor function but indicates that the structure of the region may be subtly altered by the mutations. In contrast, nACh receptor E45R/R209E double mutants were reported to restore function to that of wild type (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), suggesting both that a salt bridge between these two residues is crucial for receptor function and that the mutations cause no other structural or functional changes. The single mutations were also informative. No Arg-258 mutations were functional, and some were also not expressed at the membrane. Interestingly a similar effect has been observed for some other Cys-loop receptors mutated at the equivalent position: α1K220Cβ2 GABAA receptors, for example, showed no specific [3H]muscimol binding, whereas α1β2R216C receptors bound similar amounts to wild type receptors, although they did not respond to GABA (17Mercado J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly the glycine receptor mutation α1R218Q, which has been found in some patients suffering from hyperekplexia, has dramatic effects on receptor expression (∼10% of wild type levels) and function (∼200-fold decrease in agonist sensitivity (18Castaldo P. Stefanoni P. Miceli F. Coppola G. Del Giudice E.M. Bellini G. Pascotto A. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Annunziato L. Taglialatela M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), and Torpedo nACh receptor R209E mutant receptors also show little or no expression at the cell surface (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Substitution of Glu-92 with Ala or Asp did result in functional receptors. Their macroscopic kinetics, however, were different from wild type receptors, with slowed off rates (Fig. 3 and Table 5) and decreased EC50s (Table 4). In these functional Glu-92 mutants, β-alanine again acted as a full agonist, inferring that receptor gating is affected by these mutations. In the nACh receptor E45K and E45D mutant receptors also have decreased EC50s compared with wild type, and E45Q and E45R mutants have altered partial agonist efficacy, again indicating an effect on gating (8Xiu X. Hanek A.P. Wang J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, single channel measurements with E45K mutant receptors have confirmed an effect on gating with shortened channel openings and lengthened channel closings (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We should also mention that in the GABAC receptor there are two adjacent Arg residues in the pre-M1 region; mutation of Arg-257, however, had no significant effect on GABA-induced responses, indicating that it is not involved in receptor function. Previous studies also support this interpretation; cysteine mutations of the residues equivalent to Arg-257 in the rat GABAA receptor α1 and β2 subunits (Arg-119 and Lys-215, respectively) yield receptors with similar GABA EC50 values as wild type receptors (17Mercado J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and even reversing the charge in K215D mutant receptors only increased GABA EC50 values ∼10-fold (19Kash T.L. Dizon M.J. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4887-4893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3 Receptor Interface Differs from That of GABAC Receptors—Our new data support previous studies (20Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Hu X.Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) which show that charged residues at the ECD/TMD interface are important for the function of the 5-HT3 receptor. There are, however, significant differences between our 5-HT3 receptor data and those we obtained for the GABAC receptor; in particular there appears to be no salt bridge between Glu-80 and Arg-245 (the residues equivalent to GABAC receptor Glu-92 and Arg-258). Glu-80 was sensitive to reverse charge mutation; E80R was nonfunctional, although small responses were observed with E80C and E80A mutants. E80R appears to prevent receptor expression; no [3H]granisetron binding could be detected in oocytes expressing these receptors. Thus, the role of Glu-80 in the 5-HT3 receptor differs from that in nACh receptors where the charge reversal mutants in this position yielded functional receptors with increased sensitivity to agonist (8Xiu X. Hanek A.P. Wang J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Substitution of Arg-245 with Glu also appears to prevent receptor expression as does the equivalent substitution in the nACh receptor (6Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); R245E mutant receptors were nonfunctional, and no [3H]granisetron binding could be detected. Previous work has shown that no response to 5-HT could be detected with R245A mutant receptors (20Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although no experiments to check receptor expression were performed. The same authors also suggested that Arg-246 (Arg-222 by their numbering) forms an important link between binding and gating (21Hu X.Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and interestingly, their mutant R246A receptors had similar changes in properties to the GABAC Glu-92 mutants, with the partial agonist 2-Me-5-HT becoming a full agonist and the 5-HT EC50 5-fold lower than in wild type receptors. We observed that both R244E and R246E were functional, and R246E had an EC50 15-fold less than wild type. These data combined with the Hu et al. data (21Hu X.Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest that Arg-246 in the 5-HT3 receptor may have an analogous role to Glu-92 and Glu-45 in GABAC and nACh receptors, respectively. Because Glu-80 does not appear to form a salt bridge with Arg-245, we explored other possible partners. Asp-172 was particularly interesting as the equivalent residue has been shown to be important for function in glycine, nACh, and GABAA receptors; indeed, in GABAA receptors it is proposed to form a salt bridge with the M2-M3 loop residue Lys-279 (5Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is highly conserved and, thus, as expected, sensitive to reverse charge mutation; D172R was nonfunctional. A double reverse charge mutant (D172R/R245D), however, was also nonfunctional, indicating a salt bridge here is unlikely. However, D172E receptors had an EC50 close to wild type receptors, and D172N receptors, although nonfunctional, did reach the cell surface, unlike D172A and D172R receptors. This suggests that a negatively charged residue is important for expression in this receptor and also appears to have a role in function. The residue does not, however, appear to form a salt bridge with Arg-245. Glu-213 and Glu-215 are also possible partners for Arg-245, but multiple reverse charge mutants with these residues indicated no salt bridges. E215R, however, could rescue R246E mutation, and these residues are also physically close on a model of the 5-HT3 receptor (Fig. 5). Double mutant cycle analysis suggested there is an interaction here, although the relatively small difference in coupling energy (0.9 kcal/mol) suggested this may not be a salt bridge; the nACh receptor Glu45/Arg-209 salt bridge had a coupling energy of 3.1 kcal/mol. Thus, our data to date would support the proposal that charge residues are important at the ECD/TMD interface but indicate that there is no specific salt bridge that is critical for receptor function. In conclusion, the data strongly indicate that there is a salt bridge between Glu-92 and Arg-258 in the GABAC receptor, as previously demonstrated for the equivalent residues in the nACh receptor. The situation appears quite distinct from that at the 5-HT3 receptor ECD/TMD interface, where there is no evidence for a salt bridge between the equivalent residues, although there does appear to be an interaction between a different pair of residues, Glu-215 and Arg-246. Thus, assuming that the mechanism of channel opening is similar in all these receptors, our data support the hypothesis that it is the global charge pattern at the ECD/TMD interface that is important for transducing ligand binding into channel gating and not specific molecular interactions between equivalent residues. We await evidence from high resolution structural data to test this hypothesis."

The genome of the hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus encodes a putative CopZ copper chaperone that contains an unusual cysteine-rich N-terminal domain of 130 amino acids in addition to a C-terminal copper binding domain with a conserved CXXC motif. The N-terminal domain (CopZ-NT) is homologous to proteins found only in extremophiles and is the only such protein that is fused to a copper chaperone. Surprisingly, optical, electron paramagnetic resonance, and x-ray absorption spectroscopic data indicate the presence of a [2Fe-2S] cluster in CopZ-NT. The intact CopZ protein binds two copper ions, one in each domain. The 1.8Å resolution crystal structure of CopZ-NT reveals that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is housed within a novel fold and that the protein also binds a zinc ion at a four-cysteine site. CopZ can deliver Cu+ to the A. fulgidus CopA N-terminal metal binding domain and is capable of reducing Cu2+ to Cu+. This unique fusion of a redox-active domain with a CXXC-containing copper chaperone domain is relevant to the evolution of copper homeostatic mechanisms and suggests new models for copper trafficking.

This unique fusion of a redox-active domain with a CXXC-containing copper chaperone domain is relevant to the evolution of copper homeostatic mechanisms and suggests new models for copper trafficking. Copper is a meticulously regulated redox-active micronutrient found in a number of important enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. Because free or excess intracellular copper can cause oxidative damage, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed specific copper trafficking and transport pathways (1Rosenzweig A.C. Acc. Chem.

Deficiencies in these processes are linked to human diseases, including Wilson and Menkes disease. In Wilson disease, accumulation of copper in the liver and brain leads to cirrhosis and neurodegeneration, and in Menkes disease, copper transport across the small intestine is impaired, leading to copper deficiency in peripheral tissues (3Llanos R.M.

The hyperthermophilic Cu+-ATPase CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus is readily expressed in fully active recombinant form, is highly stable, and contains all of the essential structural elements for copper transfer, including one N-terminal and one C-terminal MBD (27Mandal A.K.

CopA is therefore an excellent model system both for investigating the mechanisms of P1B-type ATPases and for studying interactions between a cytosolic chaperone and its intact partner Cu+-ATPase. The only potential copper chaperone protein in the A. fulgidus genome, which we have designated A. fulgidus CopZ, differs from all other known copper chaperones in that it contains an additional 130 amino acids fused to the N terminus of a 60-residue CXXC-containing sequence that is homologous to Atx1-like chaperones and Cu+-ATPase MBDs (Fig. 1A). Notably, the A. fulgidus CopA C-terminal metal binding domain (CopA C-MBD) is the most similar to the CopZ C terminus, with 42% identity. The CopA N-terminal MBD (CopA N-MBD) is only 20% identical to CopZ. The novel N-terminal domain of CopZ (CopZ-NT) contains nine conserved cysteine residues and resembles uncharacterized 10-15-kDa proteins from other extremophilic Archaea (Fig. 1B). The A. fulgidus protein is the only one in which this domain is fused to a putative copper chaperone, however. In all the other extremophilic organisms that have a CopZ-NT homolog, the putative copper chaperone exists as a separate 70-amino acid protein, and its gene is not located in an operon with that encoding a CopZ-NT homolog, suggesting that their expression might not be linked. Here we describe the characterization and 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the A. fulgidus CopZ N terminus (CopZ-NT). Surprisingly, CopZ-NT contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster and a mononuclear zinc site. The fusion of a redox-active domain with a CXXC-containing copper chaperone is unprecedented and suggests previously unrecognized paradigms for copper trafficking and regulation. Cloning and Purification of CopZ and the CopA N-terminal MBD—The gene encoding CopZ (AF03456, GenBank™ accession number NP_069182) was cloned from A. fulgidus genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5′-ATGATGCGATGCCCAGAATG-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTTCAAGCCGTGCAGA-3′. The purified gene and the plasmid pPRIBA1 (IBA, Germany) were digested with the restriction enzyme BsaI, purified, and ligated to create the plasmid pCOPZ, which fuses a 10-amino acid (SAWSHPQFEK) Strep-Tactin tag to the C terminus of the expressed gene product. The gene encoding CopZ was also cloned into pBAD/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the primers 5′-ATGATGCGATGCCCAGAATG-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTTTCAAGCCGTGCAGA-3′ to attach a His6 tag to the CopZ N terminus. The N-terminal domain of CopZ (residues 1-131, CopZ-NT) was PCR-amplified from the pCOPZ plasmid by using the primers 5′-CGGGAAGGTCTCTGCGCTTCCAACGGG-AAATCC-3′ and 5′-GCCCTTGGTCTCTAATGATCGATGCCCAGAAT-3′, which encode for a BsaI restriction site. As described above, the gene was inserted into the pPRIBA1 plasmid to create pCOPZNT. The C-terminal CXXC-containing copper chaperone domain (residues 132-204, CopZ-CT) was PCR-amplified from the pCOPZ plasmid to include the Strep-Tactin tag by using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTGAGAAGAAAGCGGCTAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAAGC-3′, which incorporate 5′ NdeI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites. The purified gene product and a pET21b plasmid (Novagen) were digested, purified, and combined to create the pCOPZCT vector. The CopA N-MBD (residues 16-87) was cloned into a pASK-IBA3 vector after PCR amplification with the primers 5′-GCCCTTGGTCTCTAATGGAAAGAACCGTCAGAGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGAAGGTCTCTGCGCTAGCAGCTTGCTCATCCACCACAC-3′ as described above to create the construct pCOPANT. BL21Star(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells carrying the plasmid pSJS1240 encoding for rare tRNAs (tRNAArgAG(A/A)GG and tRNAIleAUA) were transformed with the pCOPZ and pCOPZNT and pCOPANT constructs. BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the pCOPZCT plasmid, and the His6-tagged CopZ construct was inserted into E. coli TOP10CP cells. All cell types were grown in Luria-Bertani media at 37 °C in the presence of 100 mg/liter carbenicillin and 20 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Media for cells harboring the pSJS1240 plasmid were supplemented with 70 mg/liter spectinomycin. At an A600 of ∼0.6-0.7, protein expression was induced by adding either 100-500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to cells containing the pPRIBA1 and pET21 vectors, 200 μg/liter tetracycline to cells containing the pASK-IBA3 vector, or 0.02% arabinose to cells expressing His6-tagged CopZ from the pBAD/TOPO vector. For cells expressing CopZ or CopZNT, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate was added to the media at induction and every hour thereafter. This addition helped to produce higher quantities of fully metal-loaded protein. The addition of 100 μm CuSO4 to the media yielded protein containing <0.1 equivalent of copper and did not appear to toxic to the cells as judged by the growth rate and quantity of cell paste. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min 3-4 h after induction. The pellet was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further use. Full-length CopZ was also expressed as described above in cells grown in minimal media supplemented with 100 μm iron ammonium sulfate that contained less than 10 μm zinc. Streptactin-tagged CopZ, CopZ-NT, CopZ-CT, and the CopA N-MBD were purified by using a procedure identical to the one described for the A. fulgidus CopA ATP binding domain (29Sazinsky M.H. Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11161-11166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except that 1 mm DTT was added to all of the buffers. The His6-tagged CopZ was purified on a nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid column (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was either exchanged into 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol by several concentration and dilution steps using an Amicon Ultra YM-10 or YM-5 concentrator or into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT by using a Sephadex G-25 column. The proteins were frozen at 30 mg/ml in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use. Protein concentrations were estimated by using the Bradford assay (Sigma). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and the pCOPZ vector. The DNA primers for 9 single Cys to Ser mutations in the N terminus are listed in Table 1. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. All CopZ mutants were expressed and purified from BL21Star(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells containing the pSJS1240 plasmid using the procedures described above.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers for site-directed mutagenesis of CopZC4S5′-ATGATGCGAAGCCCAGAATGCAGCACGGAAGC7S5′-GATGCCCAGAAAGCAGCACGGAAGGATGGAGC38S5′-GGATTTTTACTTCAGCTCTTTGGAGAGCTGCGAGGC43S5′-CTGCTCTTTGGAGAGCAGCGAGGTTGTTTACTTCC75S5′-CAAAGCCGGTTAGCTACTGCAACAGGGTTACAGAGC77S5′-CAAAGCCGGTTTGCTACAGCAACAGGGTTACAGAGC109S5′-CAGGAAAAGGAAAATGGAGCGTCGTTACCAACCCATCC118S5′-CATCCGGGAGAAGCTGCCACTGGCATCTGGC119S5′-CATCCGGGAGATGCAGCCACTGGCATCTGG Open table in a new tab Metal Binding Analysis—Apo-forms of the proteins were loaded with Cu+ by incubation with a 10 molar excess of CuCl2 or CuSO4 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, or 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT for 10-60 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The unbound copper was removed by centrifuging in a 10-kDa cutoff Centricon Amicon-15 (Millipore, MA) after diluting the sample with 15-20 volumes of buffer without DTT or desalting over a PD-10 column (Bio-Rad). The amount of bound copper was determined by the BCA method (30Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were precipitated by mixing up to 55 μl of sample with 18.3 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 9,000 × g. The supernatant (66 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of 0.07% freshly prepared ascorbic acid and 29 μl of 2× BCA solution (0.012% BCA, 7.2% NaOH, 31.2% HEPES). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 359 and 562 nm was measured. CuCl2 solutions were used as standards. Concentrations of 2-10 μm Cu+ were within the linear range. The iron content was determined by using a ferrozine assay (31Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3594) Google Scholar), and acid-labile sulfide was quantified by using the method of Beinert (32Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Zinc content was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and by ICP atomic emission spectrometry. The results of three measurements were averaged, and the concentration was determined from a standard curve. The presence of various metal ions was also investigated by using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at the sector 5 beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. A small sample of 2 mm CopZ in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol was frozen at 100 K on a standard protein crystal mounting loop and exposed to x-rays tuned to the absorption edges of iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and tungsten. Cu+ Transfer between CopZ and the CopA N-MBD—Apo-CopA N-MBD was incubated with Strep-Tactin resin in a column for 20 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. To separate unbound protein, the column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer W (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm ascorbic acid). His6-tagged CopZ loaded with 1.8 ± 0.1 Cu+ was added in 6.6-fold excess to the column containing bound CopA N-MBD and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to initiate copper exchange. The proteins were then separated by washing the column with 10 volumes of buffer W followed by elution of the CopA N-MBD with buffer W containing 2.5 mm 2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid. Both the wash and elution fractions were collected and analyzed for copper and protein content. To confirm that only the CopA N-MBD was present in the elution fractions, each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As a control, copper-loaded CopZ incubated with Strep-Tactin beads without bound CopA N-MBD was subjected to the procedure described above and demonstrated no copper loss. Strep-Tactin-bound apo-CopA N-MBD incubated with just buffer W did not acquire copper either. Reduction of Cu2+ by CopZ—Under anaerobic conditions, 1 mm CopZ and CopZ-NT in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl were reduced with 4-fold excess dithionite and desalted on a PD-10 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl. A 10-fold excess of BCA and a 3-fold excess of CuSO4 were then added to the eluted protein and allowed to incubate for 4 h at 25 °C to detect the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ colorimetrically. As a control, 1 mm CopZ and CopZ-NT in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl were oxidized with 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6 under aerobic conditions, desalted, moved into the anaerobic chamber, and incubated with BCA and CuSO4 as described above. No color change was observed. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—XAS samples were prepared anaerobically and aerobically for as purified (oxidized) and dithionite-reduced CopZ and CopZ-NT. Multiple independent but reproducible samples that did not contain copper were prepared at 2.0-5.0 mm iron concentrations in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol and transferred into Lucite sample cells wrapped with Kapton tape. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Iron XAS data for full-length CopZ were collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory (NSLS) beamline X-9B using a Si(111) crystal monochromator equipped with a harmonic rejection mirror. Samples were kept at 24 K using a helium Displex cryostat, and protein fluorescence excitation spectra were collected using a 13-element germanium solid-state detector. Spectra were collected with a iron foil control in a manner described previously (33Cook J.D. Bencze K.Z. Jankovic A.D. Crater A.K. Busch C.N. Bradley P.B. Stemmler A.J. Spaller M.R. Stemmler T.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7767-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During data collection, each spectrum was closely monitored for photoreduction. The data represent the average of 7-10 scans. XAS data were analyzed using the Macintosh OS X version of the EXAFSPAK program suite (available on line) integrated with the Feff version 7.2 software (35Ankudinov A.L. Rehr J.J. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 56: R1712-R1715Google Scholar) for theoretical model generation. Processing methods and fitting parameters used during data analysis are described in detail elsewhere (33Cook J.D.

Data were simulated over the spectral k range of 1 to 12.85 Å-1, corresponding to a spectral resolution of 0.13 Å (37Lee P.A. Citrin P.H. Eisenberger P. Kincaid B.M. Rev. Mod. Phys. 1981; 53: 769-806Crossref Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). When simulating empirical data, only the absorber-scatterer bond length (R) and Debye-Waller factor (σ2) were allowed to freely vary, whereas metal-ligand coordination numbers were fixed at quarter-integer values. The criteria for judging the best fit simulation and for adding ligand environments included a reduction in the mean square deviation between data and fit (F′) (38Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Stemmler T.L. Penner-Hahn J.E. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1995; 144: 245-286Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a value corrected for number of degrees of freedom in the fit, bond lengths outside the data resolution, and all Debye-Waller factors having values less than 0.006 Å2. EPR Spectroscopy—Dithionite-reduced and as-isolated 2 mm CopZ and CopZ-NT samples in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0-10.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20-30% glycerol were frozen in liquid nitrogen in 3-mm inner diameter quartz EPR tubes. Cryoreduction was achieved by γ-irradiation of the samples by exposure to a 60Co source at a dose rate of 0.46 megarad h-1 for 5-10 min. Cryogenically reduced samples were annealed in cooled isopentane at various times and temperatures before being rapidly cooled to 77 K. X-band EPR spectra were recorded between 2 and 20 K on Bruker ESP300 or EMX spectrometers equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. Structure Determination of the CopZ N Terminus—CopZ-NT was crystallized in a Coy anaerobic chamber at room temperature by using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Equal volumes of protein at ∼15 mg/ml in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT were combined with a crystallization buffer comprising 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 15-20% PEG 2000 MME. Dark red crystals grew within 2 days. The crystals were flash-frozen aerobically in a cryosolution consisting of 75 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 20% PEG 2000 MME, 20% glycerol. Native and iron anomalous data were collected at 100 K to 2.3-1.8 Å resolution at the Advanced Photon Source on the sector 19 and 23 beamlines (Table 2).TABLE 2Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsData collectionIron peakNativeAPS beamlineGM/CA-CATSBC-CAT(sector 23)(sector 19)Wavelength (Å)1.740.979Resolution (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell (1.84 to 1.78 Å).40.0-2.350.0-1.78Unique observations13,94829,750Total observations195,626194,503Completeness (%)100 (100)98.9 (93.3)Redundancy14.0 (14.0)6.5 (4.6)I/σ19.4 (19.3)13.0 (3.2)RsymbRsym = ∑i ∑hkl|Ii(hkl) - 〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl〈I(hkl)〉, where Ii(hkl) is the ith measured diffraction intensity, and 〈I(hkl)〉 is the mean of the intensity for the Miller index (hkl).

Open table in a new tab After data collection, sections of the crystal exposed to the x-ray beam turned yellow, suggestive of photoreduction. The crystals belonged to the space group P212121 and had unit cell dimensions of a = 56.25, b = 64.50, c = 84.15. Data sets were indexed and scaled with HKL2000 (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and SOLVE (40Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

After density modification, ARP/wARP was used for automatic model building (42Cohen S.X. Morris R.J. Fernandez F.J. Ben Jelloul M. Kakaris M. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Kleywegt G.J. Perrakis A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The remainder of the model was built with XtalView (43McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refined with CNS. Residues 1-130 were observed in one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and residues 2-130 were observed in the second molecule. A Ramachandran plot calculation with PROCHECK (44Laskowski R.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that 90% of the residues have the most favored geometry, and the rest occupy additionally allowed regions. The root mean square difference (r.m.s.d.) for backbone atoms between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.3 Å, and no significant structural differences were observed. Metal Content of CopZ—Purified CopZ and CopZ-NT are 23- and 14-kDa monomers, respectively, that have a distinct red color, whereas the 9-kDa CopZ-CT is colorless. The optical spectra of the full-length protein and CopZ-NT are identical with three absorption peaks at 340, 430, 480 nm and a shoulder at 550 nm (Fig. 2A). The spectra are most similar to those observed for [2Fe-2S]-containing proteins (45Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Wieghardt K. Poulos T. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Google Scholar). Features attributable to either a mononuclear iron center or a [4Fe-4S] cluster are not present. Upon reduction with dithionite, these spectral features disappear. Because the spectra of CopZ and CopZ-NT are identical, it is likely that the C terminus is not involved in assembly of the CopZ-NT metal centers. Consistent with a [2Fe-2S] cluster, both CopZ and CopZ-NT bound 1.7 ± 0.3 iron ions per protein molecule. Full-length CopZ contained ∼0.6 eq of zinc, and the isolated CopZ, CopZ-NT, and CopZ-CT did not contain copper. Only zinc and iron were detected by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Copper Binding, Transfer, and Reduction—After incubation with excess CuSO4 and DTT and buffer exchange, CopZ, CopZ-NT, and CopZ-CT were determined to bind 2.1 ± 0.3, 1.4 ± 0.3, and 1.0 ± 0.4 Cu+ ions/protein, respectively. Thus, each domain binds a single Cu+ ion. Like all of the other Atx1-like proteins, CopZ-CT likely binds Cu+ via the conserved cysteines in the CXXC motif (see below). The presence of a Cu+ ion bound to CopZ-NT is unexpected. Copper transfer from His6-tagged CopZ to the CopA N-MBD was demonstrated by incubating Cu+-loaded chaperone with Strep-Tactin resin containing bound apo-CopA N-MBD, separating the individual proteins, and analyzing the copper content (Fig. 3). The CopA N-MBD was selected for these experiments because mutagenesis data indicate that the N-MBD, but not the C-MBD, is important for CopA activity (46Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M.

EMP2 (epithelial membrane protein 2) is a tetraspan protein recently identified as a novel regulator of caveolin-1 expression. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of EMP2-mediated caveolin-1 regulation. In NIH 3T3 cells and in the human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19), EMP2 regulates caveolin-1 transcription and more substantially its protein levels. EMP2-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1 does not affect caveolin-1 translational efficiency, phosphorylation, or proteasome-mediated degradation. Analysis of caveolin-1 protein half-life indicates the EMP2-mediated loss of caveolin-1 occurs rapidly. Protease inhibition and laser confocal microscopy associates this fate with specific intracellular compartmentalization, including early lysosomal delivery. These findings elucidate a new mechanism of caveolin-1 regulation and define an additional role for EMP2 as a key regulator of cell membrane composition.

Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma membrane invaginations thought to play a role in endocytosis, cholesterol homeostasis, intracellular signaling, and cell transformation. Caveolae are found in most cell types but are particularly abundant in terminally differentiated cells such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, type 1 pneumocytes, fibroblasts, and muscle cells (1Quest A.F.

Rev. 2002; 54,: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The primary structural component of caveolae is caveolin-1, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein believed to act as a scaffolding protein within caveolae membranes (3Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y.

A. 1997; 94,: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been shown to control caveolin-1 expression at the transcriptional level in NIH 3T3 cells (10Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272,: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), whereas activation of Src family kinases transcriptionally decreases caveolin-1 expression (2Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54,: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-1 transcription is up-regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 in response to free cholesterol, which results in caveolae formation and increased cholesterol efflux (12Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94,: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94,: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Conversely, high density lipoprotein exposure reduces caveolin-1 expression and prevents the uptake of oxidized cholesterol (14Frank P.G. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Razani B. Cohen D.E. Marcel Y.L. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280,: C1204-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell growth also plays a role in caveolin-1 regulation, as rapidly dividing cells display decreased caveolin-1 expression levels, whereas confluent cells have dramatically up-regulated caveolin-1 expression (11Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17,: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To date, little has been reported about post-transcriptional modes of caveolin-1 protein regulation. Caveolin-2 is another member of the caveolin gene family (3Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272,: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Caveolin-2 is normally coexpressed with caveolin-1 and is thought to act as an accessory molecule, aiding in the formation of caveolae by forming hetero-oligomeric complexes with caveolin-1 (3Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

However, caveolin-2 alone is not sufficient to facilitate caveolae formation (3Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272,: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Caveolin-2 expression is linked to expression of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 is thought to stabilize caveolin-2 protein and thereby post-transcriptionally regulate its protein levels (15Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Rizzo G. Grignani F. Engelman J.A.

Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) is a tetraspan protein recently identified as a novel regulator of caveolin-1 expression (16Wadehra M. Goodglick L. Braun J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EMP2 is a member of the GAS3/PMP22 (growth arrest-specific-3/peripheral myelin protein-22) family of proteins. Biologically, EMP2 plays an important role in blastocyst implantation with the uterine endometrium, in part through its direct association and regulation of αvβ3 integrin (17Wadehra M. Forbes A. Pushkarna N. Goodglick L. Gordon L.K. Williams C.J. Braun J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287,: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). EMP2 controls cell membrane expression of integrins, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, and class I major histocompatibility complex proteins (16Wadehra M. Goodglick L. Braun J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Wadehra M. Forbes A. Pushkarna N. Goodglick L. Gordon L.K. Williams C.J. Braun J. Dev.

Immunol. 2003; 107,: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). EMP2 resides at the plasma membrane within lipid raft domains, and this localization is distinct from caveolin-bearing membrane structures (16Wadehra M. Goodglick L. Braun J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that recombinant overexpression of EMP2 in NIH 3T3 cells dramatically reduced expression of caveolin-1 and -2. Conversely, loss of EMP2 expression resulted in increased caveolin protein production (16Wadehra M. Goodglick L. Braun J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings indicate an important role for EMP2 in maintaining plasma membrane structure and function. Here we further analyzed the mechanism of EMP2-mediated caveolin reduction. We show that EMP2 modulates caveolin-1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, in both murine and human cell lines. Mechanistic analysis reveals that EMP2-mediated reduction of caveolin-1 protein involves aberrant intracellular compartmentalization and rapid degradation shortly after completion of translation. These observations thus describe a novel mechanism regulating caveolae formation. Cell Lines—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM 3The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate.; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing a FLAG-tagged murine EMP2 (3T3/EMP2) or a vector control (3T3/V) were cultured as described previously (20Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97,: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein fluorescein isothiocyanate. The human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line ARPE-19 (ATCC CRL-2302) was grown in-DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented as above. To ectopically increase the expression of human EMP2, ARPE-19 (designated ARPE-19/EMP2) was stably transfected with pEGFP-hEMP2, a plasmid encoding a functional human EMP2-GFP fusion protein in the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N3 expression vector (17Wadehra M. Forbes A. Pushkarna N. Goodglick L. Gordon L.K. Williams C.J. Braun J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287,: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A vector control cell line was similarly prepared with pEGFP-N3, resulting in GFP expression alone (designated ARPE-19/V). ARPE-19 transfectants were produced using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and stable clones were selected using 700 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNA purification and RNA cleanup kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA (10 μg) was subjected to agarose electrophoresis (1.6% agarose/formaldehyde), transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action, and cross-linked by UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene, San Diego). The following primers were used to generate cDNA probes: murine caveolin-1 CTACAAGCCCAACAACAAGG(C/A)GGAAGCTCTTGATGCACGGT; murine caveolin-2 ATGACGCCTACAGCCACCACA(G/G)CAAACAGGATACCCGCAATG. Probes were 32P-labeled using random primer synthesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (20Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97,: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Membranes were pre-hybridized with Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and then hybridized with labeled probe overnight at 65 °C. Blots were washed in low stringency buffer (65 °C, 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), and 0.1% SDS) and high stringency buffer (65 °C, 0.1× SSC, and 0.1% SDS), as needed, and exposed to x-ray film. Antibodies—Anti-caveolin-1 antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1-α and -β antibody (clone 2297, BD Biosciences), and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-caveolin-1 (Tyr-14, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-caveolin-2 antibody (clone 65, BD Biosciences), mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (2524, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (ab8227, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (4050-05, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), and sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (NA931, Amersham Biosciences) were also used. Additional antibodies utilized for confocal microscopy included anti-γ-adaptin, anti-mouse CD107a (LAMP-1)-FITC, and anti-EEA-1 (all from BD Biosciences). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). For EMP2 expression, cell lysates were additionally treated with peptide:N-glycosidase (New England Biolabs) to remove N-linked glycans that interfere with the detection of EMP2 epitopes (20Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97,: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to determine transfer efficiency. Membranes were blocked with 10% low fat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation—3T3/V and 3T3/EMP2 cells (average cell number 3 × 106) were fractionated as described previously (21Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129,: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, cells were washed twice in a sucrose buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Tablets, Roche Applied Science). This sucrose buffer was used throughout all subsequent procedures that were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of the same buffer, and homogenized three times with 10 strokes in a 2-ml Potter/Elvehjem Teflon pestle homogenizer. The original cell homogenate was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 16,000 × gmax for 15 min in an Eppendorf (model 5415R) centrifuge. The resulting pellet was washed in 0.5 ml of sucrose buffer and recentrifuged as above. The washing supernatant was combined with the supernatant of the initial pellet and was saved for preparation of the microsomal membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 ml of sucrose buffer and over-layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 101,000 × gmax for 70 min. The resulting pellet containing the mitochondria, nuclei, and cell debris was collected, washed once, and re-pelleted at 16,000 × gmax for 15 min and finally was resuspended in sucrose buffer and saved as nuclear fraction. The plasma membranes were collected at the sucrose interface, were washed once, re-centrifuged at 48,000 × gmax for 45 min, and finally resuspended in sucrose buffer and saved as plasma membrane fraction. The initial supernatant was centrifuged at 212,000 × gmax for 70 min yielding the microsomal fraction in the pellet. Equal volume equivalents of each fraction were separated by immunoblot analysis as described above. Phosphorylation Studies—To induce phosphorylation, cells were stressed with 600 mm sucrose or 5 mm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C (23Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed in PBS, harvested, and assayed by immunoblot. Sucrose and H2O2 were diluted in complete growth medium. Polysome Analysis—Cell lines were used at about 80% confluency to analyze polysome distribution. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, removed using a cell scraper, and lysed in polysome lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was layered onto a 15-50% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall TH-61 rotor (Asheville, NC). Gradients were analyzed by passing the contents through a density gradient fractionator (ISCO, Los Angeles, CA) to monitor continual A260, and then 1-ml fractions were collected. Total RNA from each fraction was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen). Equal volumes from each fraction were used for Northern blot analysis, as described above. Proteasome Inhibition—Proteasome inhibition studies were also performed 3T3/V and 3T3/EMP2 cell lines at about 80% confluency. Epoxomicin (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) dissolved in Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 100 nm, 1 μm, or 10 μm, or cells were given a Me2SO control or left untreated. Cells were incubated for 6 h, harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), assayed for protein concentration, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Metabolic labeling was performed by starvation for 20 min in DMEM without methionine and cysteine (supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics) followed by incubation for 1 h with 240 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine Pro-mix (Amersham Biosciences). The media were replaced by DMEM supplemented with 2 mm methionine, and cells were analyzed at various time points ranging from 0 to 24 h. Cells were harvested in PBS, and cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. To extract and denature proteins, cell pellets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml, pepstatin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm KCl. Lysates were sonicated and then centrifuged to remove cell debris. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration in the supernatant was then measured using the Bradford Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples were precleared using 8 μg of agarose-conjugated normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were then incubated overnight with 30 μg of anti-caveolin-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and protein A-agarose beads (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody-bound protein was collected by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 3 min, and equal volumes were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Resolved gels were then fixed, treated with Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences), dried under vacuum, and exposed using a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare). Analysis was performed using Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant 5.2 software. Lysosome Inhibition—3T3/EMP2 or 3T3/V cells were plated at 0.6 × 105/well in 6-well plates and cultured for 2 days. Cells were then placed in serum-free DMEM with lysosome inhibitors pepstatin A and leupeptin (both at 1 or 5 μm; Calbiochem) alone or in combination as described previously (24Kundra R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274,: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 4 h and then harvested for Western blot analysis. Bands were quantitated using Image J 1.36b software (25Abramoff M. Magelhaes P. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11,: 36-42Google Scholar). Laser Confocal Microscopy—1 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells or 3T3/EMP2 were plated on 18-mm diameter glass coverslips (Fisher) and incubated for 48 h. Cells were fixed in methanol and blocked with 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were incubated with the primary antibodies, as listed in the figure legends, for 1 h at room temperature and visualized using a fluorescent secondary antibody. Confocal pictures were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope at ×600 magnification. To measure caveolin-1 localization in different intracellular compartments, cells were processed for dual staining with antibodies for caveolin-1 and compartment markers (γ-adaptin, EEA-1, or LAMP-1). To assess the lysosomal compartment, cells prior to fixation were incubated for 1 h in 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin (to reduce caveolin-1 degradation). The colocalization coefficient was quantitated by Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany), and values represent the relative number of colocalizing pixels of caveolin compared with the total number of pixels above threshold. The mean colocalization coefficient was averaged from at least three independent images. Statistics—Differences in caveolin levels and mean colocalization coefficients were evaluated using an unpaired Student's t test at a 95% confidence level (GraphPad Prism version 3.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego). EMP2 Selectively Regulates Expression of Caveolin-1 Protein—Previously, our research group identified a role for EMP2 in regulating expression of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 in NIH 3T3 cells with either increased or decreased EMP2 protein levels (16Wadehra M. Goodglick L. Braun J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further define this relationship, we performed quantitative titration analysis of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 mRNA and protein (26Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92,: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with either EMP2 (3T3/EMP2) or a vector control (3T3/V). Samples were diluted serially in 2-fold increments from 1:1 to 1:8, then separated using electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Membranes were probed for expression of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, increased EMP2 levels reduced caveolin-1 steady state mRNA 3-fold and caveolin-2 mRNA levels by 2-fold. Ethidium bromide staining illustrated relative sample RNA amounts. We next quantified steady state protein levels of caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and EMP2 in 3T3/EMP2 and 3T3/V cell lines (Fig. 1B). For analysis of caveolin-1, 3T3/V total cell lysates were diluted serially in 2-fold increments from 1:1 to 1:64, whereas 3T3/EMP2 total cell lysates were diluted serially from 1:1 to 1:4. Caveolin-1 protein was decreased by 15-fold in 3T3/EMP2 cells. To analyze caveolin-2 protein levels, 3T3/V total cell lysate was serially diluted from 1:1 to 1:8, whereas 3T3/EMP2 total cell lysate was diluted serially from 1:1 to 1:4. Caveolin-2 protein levels were decreased 2-fold in 3T3/EMP2 cells. Notably, changes in caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels differed substantially, whereas changes in caveolin-2 mRNA and protein levels were comparable. To determine whether caveolin-1 mRNA and protein level differences were significantly different, a Student's t test was performed. This analysis showed that changes in expression between caveolin-1 mRNA and protein were significant (p = 0.038; Fig. 1C). Thus, EMP2 regulated expression of caveolin-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, regulation of caveolin-2 by EMP2 occurred only at the mRNA level. EMP2 Regulates Expression of Caveolin-1 in Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells—To confirm the role of EMP2 in regulating expression of caveolin-1, we examined a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line, ARPE-19, which endogenously expresses EMP2, caveolin-1, and caveolin-2. ARPE-19 cells were stably transfected with an EMP2 overexpression construct (ARPE-19/EMP2) or a vector control plasmid (ARPE-19/V), and selected for expression using geneticin. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2-fold reduction in caveolin-1 mRNA when EMP2 is overexpressed (Fig. 2A). Conversely, caveolin-2 mRNA levels did not change. Ethidium bromide staining indicated equal RNA loading. Western blot analysis was then used to examine changes in protein expression levels (Fig. 2B). Cell extracts were assayed for expression of EMP2, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and β-actin. Expression of the EMP2/GFP fusion protein is indicated by the presence of two bands, one at the expected 18-kDa size of endogenous EMP2 and another at 46 kDa, the expected size of an EMP2/GFP fusion protein. Consistent with our results in NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-1 protein levels using an antibody specific for the full-length protein revealed a dramatic 96% reduction in caveolin-1 expression when EMP2 levels were increased by 80%. No change in caveolin-2 expression levels was observed (Fig. 2B). β-Actin was used to show equal protein loading. EMP2 Does Not Alter Caveolin-1 Translation Efficiency—Although a number of factors have been shown to control caveolin-1 transcription, little is known about post-transcriptional modes of caveolin-1 regulation (1Quest A.F. Leyton L. Parraga M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82,: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Given the dramatic ability of EMP2 to alter caveolin-1 protein levels, we next chose to examine how EMP2 was mediating this effect. To investigate if EMP2 was controlling the rate of caveolin-1 translation, we examined caveolin-1 polysome profiles in 3T3/EMP2 and 3T3/V cell lines. Fig. 3A shows a typical polysome distribution for sucrose gradient eluents. Transcripts that were being translated at the time of extract preparation were polysome-associated and sedimented in fractions 6-10, with the most actively translated transcripts toward the bottom of the gradient. Distribution of mRNA among the gradient fractions is shown by ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 3B). Northern blot analysis revealed that in 3T3/EMP2 cells, the majority of caveolin-1 mRNA was associated with polyribosomal fractions. In 3T3/V control cells, the majority of caveolin-1 mRNA was associated with polyribosomal fractions, whereas a small portion was associated with less dense, polysome-free fractions. These results indicate that EMP2 did not regulate caveolin-1 protein levels by decreasing translation efficiency. As a control, gradient fractions were also analyzed for β-actin mRNA. Both cell lines showed similar high rates of translation for β-actin. EMP2 Alters the Subcellular Distribution of Caveolin-1—To determine whether EMP2 overexpression altered the subcellular distribution of caveolin-1, cells were separated usin"
https://openalex.org/W2068203007,"Cytochrome P450 reductase, which delivers electrons from NADPH to microsomal P450s, consists of a single polypeptide that contains both FAD and FMN. The bacterial P450cin utilizes a similar electron transport system except the FAD/FMN reductase consists of two separate polypeptides where the FMN protein, cindoxin, shuttles electrons between the FAD-containing cindoxin reductase and P450cin. Here we characterize the kinetics and specificity of electron transfer between cindoxin and P450cin as well as discuss the influence of possible binding surface interactions using homology models. Cytochrome P450 reductase, which delivers electrons from NADPH to microsomal P450s, consists of a single polypeptide that contains both FAD and FMN. The bacterial P450cin utilizes a similar electron transport system except the FAD/FMN reductase consists of two separate polypeptides where the FMN protein, cindoxin, shuttles electrons between the FAD-containing cindoxin reductase and P450cin. Here we characterize the kinetics and specificity of electron transfer between cindoxin and P450cin as well as discuss the influence of possible binding surface interactions using homology models. Cytochromes P450 catalyze the monooxygenation of a vast array of organic compounds in the following reaction, R-H+NAD(P)H+H++O2→R-OH+NAD(P)++H2O.Two electrons are required for O2 activation by the P450 heme iron that are delivered from NAD(P)H by P450 redox partners. Until recently, P450s were divided into two classes based on the types of redox partners used. Class I is a three-component system that uses a NAD(P)H-dependent FAD-containing protein to reduce a Fe2S2 ferredoxin that then transfers two electrons, one at a time, to P450. The two-component class II consists of a FAD/FMN P450 reductase that mediates electron transfer from NADPH to P450. Not too long ago mitochondria and prokaryotes were neatly grouped into class I while microsomal P450s were placed in class II. With an increasing genomic data base and a corresponding increase in the characterization of new P450s, it now is clear that a simple two-class categorization is too limited. Indeed, a recent review defines 10 different P450 electron transfer classes (1Hannemann F. Bichet A. Ewen K.M. Bernhardt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For example, P450BM3 is a prokaryotic fatty acid hydroxylase that uses a microsomal-like FAD/FMN reductase with the important exception that the reductase is fused to the C-terminal end of the P450 to give a catalytically self-sufficient P450 (2Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6683-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Narhi L.O. Wen L.P. Fulco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 79: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). P450RhF contains class I P450 cofactors (FMN, Fe4S4, and heme) fused into a single polypeptide (4Roberts G.A. Celik A. Hunter D.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48914-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and CYP119, the first thermophilic P450 to be discovered, is thought to use a ferredoxin and 2-oxoacid-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (5Puchkaev A.V. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).P450cin from Citrobacter braakii is a three-component class I prokaryotic system except its flavin-containing components are class II-like. The P450cin monooxygenase system consists of a FAD reductase that transfers electrons to a FMN protein that then delivers electrons to P450cin. Sequence homologies clearly show that the FMN and FAD proteins are closely related to the FMN and FAD modules of P450 reductase (6Hawkes D.B. Adams G.W. Burlingame A.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27725-27732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, the FMN protein cindoxin (Cdx) 3The abbreviations used are:CdxcindoxinCPRFMNFMN module of human cytochrome P450 reductaseAdxadrenodoxinPdxputidaredoxinSqsemiquinoneHqhydroquinoneOxoxidized 3The abbreviations used are:CdxcindoxinCPRFMNFMN module of human cytochrome P450 reductaseAdxadrenodoxinPdxputidaredoxinSqsemiquinoneHqhydroquinoneOxoxidized exhibits 37% sequence identity to the FMN domain of human microsomal P450 reductase (CPRFMN), whereas the FMN module of P450BM3 shares only 28% sequence identity with the human FMN domain.We recently solved the crystal structure of P450cin (7Meharenna Y.T. Li H. Hawkes D.B. Pearson A.G. De Voss J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9487-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and had anticipated that the presumed electron transfer site on P450cin would resemble that of P450BM3 and other P450s that utilize an FMN module as the redox partner. Instead, we found that the architecture of the proximal docking site is more similar to P450cam, which utilizes a Fe2S2 protein, putidaredoxin (Pdx). To further probe the interaction between Cdx and P450cin we have initiated a series of studies to characterize the electron transfer reaction. Here we report the kinetics and specificity of electron transfer between Cdx and P450cin.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification—Plasmids containing P450cin and Cdx were provided by Dr. James DeVoss. P450cin was expressed and purified as described previously (7Meharenna Y.T. Li H. Hawkes D.B. Pearson A.G. De Voss J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9487-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Adrenodoxin (Adx) and CPR expression plasmids were provided by Drs. Y. Sagara and C. Kasper, respectively. Expression and purification of Adx and Pdx were carried out as described elsewhere (8Sagara Y. Harab T. Ariyasua Y. Andoa F. Tokunagaa N. Horiuchia T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Sevrioukova I.F. Garcia C. Li H. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The FMN domain of human CPR containing residues 1–181 was cloned into EcoRI and KpnI sites of the pProEX expression vector (Invitrogen) with a cleavable N-terminal six-histidine tag and purified using Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography. ϵ454 of 9.8 mm-1 cm-1 was employed to calculate concentration of oxidized CPRFMN.Cdx was purified as follows. Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α harboring the Cdx expression plasmid were used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth (TB) medium in a 2.8-liter flask. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm to a 600-nm absorbance of 1–1.5 followed by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell growth was continued at 27 °C and 70 rpm; 48 h after induction cells were harvested by centrifuging at 6000 rpm and kept frozen at -20 °C. All lysis and purification steps were carried out at 4 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A).Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A and stirred for 1 h with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. Lysis was completed by sonication with a Branson Sonifier 450 using four to six alternations of 20-s pulses and 40-s incubations on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted 3- to 5-fold with buffer A and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer A, two volumes of buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, and finally with four volumes of buffer A containing 180 mm KCl. Cdx was eluted with a gradient of 180–300 mm KCl in buffer A. Yellow-colored fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, and those containing a 16-kDa band were combined and concentrated to 2 ml using an Amicon YM10 concentrator. The resulting sample was loaded onto a S-200-Sepharose gel filtration column and eluted with buffer A. Fractions were checked for purity using SDS-PAGE and by absorption spectra typical of a flavoprotein, with a well separated peak at 280 and a ratio of absorbance at 450:375 nm of 1.2. The extinction coefficient of oxidized Cdx was determined by boiling a small amount of Cdx to release free FMN and estimating the amount of FMN released (ϵ450 = 12.2 mm-1 cm-1). Assuming a one-to-one FMN:protein ratio, the value of ϵ450 nm for Cdx was calculated to be 10.5 mm-1 cm-1.UV-visible Spectroscopy—All spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Varian Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer in a 1.0-ml gas-tight quartz cuvette with a rubber septum. Additions were made using a 50-μl Hamilton gas-tight syringe.Stopped-flow—All solutions were made anaerobic by alternating evacuating and flushing with pure argon. Concentration of the sodium dithionite solutions was determined by titrating cytochrome c solutions and measuring the amount of cytochrome c reduced upon addition of small aliquots of the reductant. Solutions were loaded into gas-tight syringes in an anaerobic glove box. Because the stopped flow instrument was in an aerobic environment, an oxygen-scrubbing system of 1 mm glucose, 1 unit/ml glucose oxidase, and 1 unit/ml catalase was included in the wash buffers and experimental solutions. Absorbance changes were monitored at 450 nm to follow formation of the ferrous-CO complex formation. Kinetic data were analyzed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Inc.). Data were analyzed according to Reaction 1 P450cin(Fe+3)+Cdx(hq)⇆P450cin(Fe+3)-Cdx(hq)P450cin(Fe+3)-Cdx(hq)k→P450cin(Fe+2)-Cdx(sq)REACTION 1 where Cdx(hq) and Cdx(sq) are the hydroquinone (two-electron-reduced) and semiquinone (one-electron-reduced) forms of Cdx, respectively. The dissociation constant, KD, and maximum rate of electron transfer, k, were estimated from double reciprocal plots of 1/kobs rate versus 1/[Cdx] concentration.Homology Model—The amino acid sequence of Cdx was submitted to the online program 3D Jigsaw, which returned a PDB coordinate file with the sequence of Cdx threaded on to the x-ray crystal structure of the FMN binding domain of human cytochrome P450 reductase (PDB code 1B1C). FMN was manually added to the model, and the model was energy-minimized. Flavodoxins and P450 reductase FMN modules have small, compact, and highly homologous structures. As a result, there is a high level of confidence that the Cdx homology model is a good approximation of the correct structure.Spectroelectrochemical Titration—Redox titrations were carried out in a cuvette that was assembled in the anaerobic Coy glove box. The cuvette was sealed with air-tight septa through which the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the gold working electrode, and gas-tight Hamilton syringe were inserted. A small magnetic stir bar was placed at the bottom of the cuvette to mix the reagents. The temperature was maintained at ∼25 °C. The titration buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 7.4) was made anaerobic by flushing it with ultrapure argon while stirring. The final experimental volume was 1.3 ml containing 10–15 μm protein. The following typical redox mediators were used: methyl viologen (-430 mV), benzyl viologen (-374 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-145 mV), and anthraquinone 2-sulfonate (-230 mV) to a final concentration of 2 μm each. All the potentials here are reported against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).The protein and mediator mixtures were deoxygenated under the flow of argon gas for several minutes. The protein was reduced by addition of a small excess of anaerobically prepared sodium dithionite solution (concentration was determined using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ315 = 8.05 mm-1 cm-1). The reduced protein spectrum was recorded to confirm complete reduction. After each addition of a small aliquot of oxidant/reductant, the solution was stirred until equilibration (stabilization of the potential) was reached (∼15–20 min), and then the spectrum (350–800 nm) was recorded. The titration continued until the sample solution was maximally oxidized by ferricyanide (10Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar).The electrochemical potential was monitored using an Orion pH/mV meter (Model SA 720) coupled to a gold electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. The gold electrode was modified using 4,4′-dithiodipyridine. The electrode system was calibrated using the ferrous-ferric ammonium sulfate couple (+675 mV) (11Light T.S. Anal. Chem. 1972; 44: 1038-1039Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The observed potential was obtained relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Hence, they were corrected (using the calibration data for the ferrous-ferric ammonium sulfate solution) to values relative to the standard hydrogen electrode by addition of 197 mV to the data obtained using the Ag/AgCl electrode.RESULTSRedox Potential of Cytochrome P450cin—The UV-visible spectrum of the oxidized substrate-free low spin protein has maxima at 416, 535, and 569 nm. The UV-visible spectrum of the oxidized substrate-bound protein has maxima at 391, 510, and 540 nm, which is typical of high spin P450s. The reduced protein has maxima at 408 and 540 nm. Any of these spectral differences could be used to monitor the change in population from the oxidized (Fe3+) to the reduced (Fe2+) state. Because the Soret absorbance in the 390–416-nm range overlapped with the absorbance of the mediators, the Q-bands from 500–570 nm were used to monitor the titrations. The percentage of oxidized/reduced protein was calculated from the spectral data and was plotted against the observed potential. The data were analyzed and titration curves were fitted to the Nernst equation △E=△E°+2.303(RT/nF)\log_{10}(C_{ox})/C_{RED})(Eq. 1) where ΔE is the observed potential and is plotted against the logarithm of the ratio of the concentration of oxidized (COX) and the reduced species (CRED). The intercept of the plot gives ΔE°, the redox potential of the protein, and the slope divided by 59 mV gives n, the number of electrons involved in the reaction at 25 °C. The redox potential of substrate-free P450cin was determined to be -330 + 5mV versus standard hydrogen electrode, while that for the P450cin substrate bound was determined to be -202 + 15 mV, giving a net shift in the redox potential on binding the substrate 1,8-cineole of +128 mV (Fig. 1A). This finding is in contrast to previously reported results (12Aguey-Zinsou K.F. Bernhardt P.V. De Voss J.J. Slessor K.E. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; 13: 418-419Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) where P450cin was bound to an electrode and showed no redox shift upon substrate binding. An increase in redox potential upon substrate binding is observed in many other P450s and is consistent with known structural changes that result from substrate binding. The shift in spin state from low to high is due in part to the displacement by the substrate of the axial water ligand from the heme iron, thus shifting the heme iron from low spin hexacoordinate to high spin pentacoordinate. In addition, substrate binding dehydrates the active site, which further destabilizes the lower redox potential. The change in redox potential also provides control of electron transfer. In some P450s electron transfer to the low spin substrate-free form is thermodynamically unfavorable whereas the increase in redox potential upon substrate binding removes the thermodynamic barrier to electron transfer. This prevents the futile consumption of electrons by the substrate-free enzyme (13Huang Y.Y. Hara T. Sligar S. Coon M.J. Kimura T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1390-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Redox Potentials of Cdx—During the purification of Cdx, blue and green bands were observed during the loading of the cell-free extract on to the DEAE column, indicating the presence of partially reduced Cdx. Moreover, upon reduction of purified Cdx with small amounts of dithionite, the blue, neutral semiquinone form was readily observed with an absorption maximum of 590 nm. When the reduced Cdx is exposed to an aerobic environment, the blue semiquinone is reoxidized to the yellow quinone. The sensitivity of the Cdx semiquinone to oxygen is not shared by full-length CPR or the FMN and FAD domains (16Yasukochi Y. Peterson J.A. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7097-7104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the difference in the stability of the semiquinone, these initial spectral observations suggested that, like P450 reductase, the redox potential of the Sq/Hq couple should be lower than the Ox/Sq couple.The wavelengths used for determining the redox potential of Cdx were 474 and 583 nm, which are close to the absorption maximum of the oxidized flavin and the absorption maximum for the blue semiquinone, respectively. These absorbances were used to calculate the percentage of oxidized FMN that was plotted against the observed potential (Fig. 1B). Data were fit using the Nernst equation where the two one-electron steps in reduction were analyzed separately because only oxidized and semiquinone species were present during most of the first step and only semiquinone and hydroquinone forms were present during most of the second step. Data points in the region of maximal semiquinone accumulation were not included in the Nernst plot as in this region all three redox species could be present (14Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L.

The values of the midpoint potentials obtained are: (a) -93 ± 17 mV for the Ox/Sq couple and (b) -226 ± 5 mV for the Sq/Hq couple. The redox potential of the mixed couple Ox/Red is -167 ± 2 mV. These values are close to those of CPRFMN (Table 1) and suggest that the two-electron-reduced FMN transfers electrons to P450cin because the hydroquinone is a better reducing agent than the semiquinone. Despite these similarities, the Ox/Sq potential for Cdx is lower than that for P450 reductase, which may in part account for the greater air instability of the semiquinone in Cdx.TABLE 1Reduction potentials (mV) for cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) (17Munro A.W.

P450cin shows saturation at ∼12-fold excess Cdx, with a KD = 3 μm and k = 15 s-1 (Fig. 2B). The rate of electron transfer value is comparable with that calculated for other class I and II redox couples (Table 2) (19Hintz M.J. Peterson J.A. J. Biol.

As the salt concentration increased, the rate of P450cin reduction dramatically decreased (Fig. 2C). A full kinetic analysis (Fig. 2C, inset) at 200 mm salt shows that the maximum rate of electron transfer is not salt-dependent but KD increases from 3 to 30 μm in going from 5 to 200 mm salt. This suggests that complementary electrostatic interactions play an important role in the P450cin-Cdx complex formation.FIGURE 2Cdx-to-P450cin electron transfer.

Adx-to-P450cin electron transfer was very slow, with a secondary reaction (data not shown) that quenched absorbance from reduced P450cin at longer time scales and higher Adx concentrations. This made it difficult to make an accurate determination of k and KD from double reciprocal plots (Fig. 3C, inset). For Pdx k is 27-fold lower and KD 45-fold higher than for Cdx, whereas for CPRFMN k is 23-fold slower and KD 6-fold higher (Fig. 3, Table 2).FIGURE 3Representative stopped-flow traces of 0.8 μm P450cin reduction with 40 μm Pdx (A), 28 μm CPRFMN (B), and 12 μm Adx (C).

The energy-minimized model of Cdx, generated using the program 3D Jigsaw, showed minor deviations from the crystal structure of CPRFMN. CPRFMN is longer and has an extra small helix at the N terminus. In addition, the fragment comprising the third helix in CPRFMN is not well structured in the Cdx model. The P450cin-Cdx redox complex was modeled based on the known structure of the P450BM3 complexed with its FMN module (PDB code 1BVY) (23Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). P450cin was first superimposed on P450BM3 by aligning the heme groups. Next, the energy-minimized homology model of Cdx was superimposed on the FMN domain of P450BM3. Fig. 4A shows the hypothetical P450cin-Cdx complex with the superimposed CPRFMN. Even without any energy optimization of the complex, the fit between P450cin and Cdx is good with few steric clashes and good ionic pairing and the FMN within electron transfer distance of 20 Å from the P450cin heme (Fig. 4A). The ionic strength dependence of the Cdx-to-P450cin electron transfer reaction (Fig. 2) indicates that electrostatic interactions are important, similar to other P450s. Not surprisingly, the docking surfaces have complementary electrostatic potentials with P450cin serving as the positively charged partner and Cdx the negatively charged partner.FIGURE 4A, hypothetical model of the P450cin-Cdx complex. P450cin is dark blue, Cdx is cyan, and CPRFMN is red. B, close-up view at the potential interaction site between Cdx Glu-10 and P450cin His-342. C and D, views along the predicted docking surface of Cdx and CPRFMN, respectively. The Cα positions of acidic residues predicted to be directly at the docking interface are represented as green spheres and the rest as red spheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because CPRFMN and Cdx are so similar in structure, a more detailed comparison between these two might provide some insight into why CPRFMN is a poor reductant of P450cin compared with Cdx. Although Cdx and CPRFMN both present electronegative surfaces to their respective redox partners, the distribution of acidic side chains is quite different, as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. The acidic residues that can directly interact with P450 are represented as green spheres. CPRFMN has a larger number of acidic residues on the docking surface. Thus, the optimal electrostatic interactions with P450cin are likely to lead to different orientations in the P450cin-Cdx and P450cin-CPRFMN complexes. One particularly noteworthy difference at the docking interface involves Glu-10 in Cdx (Gln-27 in CPRFMN), predicted to interact with His-342 in P450cin (Fig. 4B). A second potentially important difference is Asp-87 in CPRFMN, which is Gly-66 in Cdx. Gly-66 approaches close to Gln-66 in P450cin. In addition, the sequence in the immediate vicinity of Gly-66 in Cdx is Ala-Gly66-Gly-Gly whereas the corresponding sequence in CPRFMN is Thr-Asp87-Asn-Ala. Thus, CPRFMN might experience steric clashes with P450cin in this region. It thus appears that even though the polypeptide topology is very likely conserved at the docking interface, the distribution of negative charges and specific predicted contact points are sufficiently different to give significantly different docked complexes, which translates into lower k and higher KD for CPRFMN compared with Cdx.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that the Cdx-P450cin electron transfer reaction is specific for Cdx and proceeds at a rate similar to other known P450 systems. The reaction is highly ionic strength-dependent, which also is similar to other P450s and consistent with the electrostatic complementarity of the docking surfaces. The redox potentials of Cdx suggest that the fully reduced hydroquinone is the electron-donating species because the redox potential of the Sq/Hq Cdx couple is lower than that of substrate-bound P450cin (-226 versus -202mV, respectively). Thus, reduction of P450cin by the Cdx Hq is a thermodynamically favorable reaction. This again is similar to microsomal P450 reductase and further illustrates that P450cin is more similar to microsomal P450s with respect to electron transfer than its prokaryotic homologue, P450cam. Given such similarities with microsomal P450s, it was surprising to find that the detailed topography of the expected proximal docking site on P450cin is far more similar to P450cam than microsomal P450s or P450BM3. It thus appears that a similarly shaped docking site can exhibit large differences in specificity. Part of such selectivity is no doubt due to the obvious electrostatic difference but also due to more subtle differences in orientation and other possible allosteric effects and docking-induced structural changes. For example, the P450cam redox partner Pdx is known to have a significant effector role (24Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where binding to the proximal side of the heme leads to perturbations in the distal substrate binding pocket that are thought to be coupled to conformational changes required for oxygen activation (25Nagano S.

It is now well established that these proteins, previously considered as “accessory,” are essential for infection spreading and pathogenesis. Among them, the HIV-1 Vif is a 23-kDa basic protein required for HIV-1 replication in T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and several T-cell lines known as “non-permissive,” but dispensable in many other “permissive” cells (1Gabuzda D.H.

Despite controversial initial results, it is now usually accepted that less than 100 copies of Vif are packaged per virion (2Simon J.H. Miller D.L. Fouchier R.A. Soares M.A. Peden K.W. Malim M.H.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mutations in the NC domain of Pr55Gag significantly reduce Vif packaging. In addition, Vif also associates with the HIV-1 genomic RNA in vitro and in vivo (21Dettenhofer M. Cen S. Carlson B.A. Kleiman L. Yu X.F. J.

Vif binds the viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells, forming a 40S mRNP complex that most likely mediates viral RNA interactions with HIV-1 Pr55Gag (23Zhang H. Pomerantz R.J. Dornadula G. Sun Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8252-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the Vif putative RNA-binding motif (approximately the first 114 residues) abolishes its packaging into virions (22Khan M.A. Aberham C. Kao S. Akari H. Gorelick R. Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The RNA binding properties of Vif and its association with the nucleoprotein complex during virus assembly thus seems to be crucial for efficient virions assembly and subsequent optimization of viral particles morphology (24Hoglund S. Ohagen A. Lawrence K. Gabuzda D. Virology. 1994; 201: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Vif regulates HIV-1 replication and counteracts APOBEC3G/3F antiviral activity, we studied Vif binding to HIV-1 RNA and DNA fragments by fluorescence spectroscopy, using the natural fluorescence of the highly conserved Trp residues contained in the Vif N-terminal region (25Lee T.H. Coligan J.E. Allan J.S. McLane M.F. Groopman J.E. Essex M. Science. 1986; 231: 1546-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to detect the protein/nucleic acid interactions. Our results show that Vif preferentially and cooperatively binds to the 5′ region of HIV-1 genomic RNA, in agreement with our previous biochemical study (26Henriet S. Richer D. Bernacchi S. Decroly E. Vigne R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we characterized two different RNA binding modes, whereas only one was detected by filter binding (26Henriet S. Richer D. Bernacchi S. Decroly E. Vigne R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, we characterized Vif binding to two high-affinity RNA binding sites and determined similar affinity for the corresponding DNA sequences. Taken together, our data suggest that both Vif/RNA and Vif/DNA interactions are important for HIV-1 replication in restrictive cells. Recombinant Vif Expression—Plasmid D10Vif containing a His6 tag fused at the N-terminal domain of Vif lacking the methionine initiation codon was transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli MC10611 cells, and protein purification was performed as previously described (27Yang X.

They were linearized with SalI or PvuII and used as template for in vitro transcription with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as described (28Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C.

After 2 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with RNase-free DNase I (MP Biomedicals), extracted with phenol, and precipitated in ethanol.

RNA and DNA Oligonucleotides—RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper part of the TAR hairpin (TAR1 and TAR2, Fig. 2A) and to nucleotides 539–564 (B1) or 539–546 (B2) (Fig. 2B) of the HIV-1 genomic RNA (HXB2 isolate) were synthesized and purified by reverse-phase HPLC and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). Their DNA counterpart (dTAR1, dTAR2, dB1, dB2), their complementary sequences (dTAR2c, dB2c) (Fig. 2, A and B) and various DNA oligonucleotides (Table 1) were synthesized by Thermo Electron GmbH and purified by reverse-phase HPLC.TABLE 1Primary structure of short DNA single- and double-stranded DNA sequences used in this study Consensus sequences for cytosine deamination by APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G were found to be 5′-TTCWNNT-3′ and 5′-YCCH-3′, respectively (W = A or T, Y = C or T; and H = A, C, or T) (40Liddament M.T.

The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, the emission wavelength was scanned from 310 to 450 nm, the integration time was 0.1 s, and the excitation and emission bandwidths were 2 and 8 nm, respectively. Fluorescence titrations were performed by adding increasing amounts of nucleic acid to 150 nm or 100 nm Vif in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm or 10 mm MgCl2. Determination of Vif/Nucleic Acid Binding Parameters—To determine the binding parameters of Vif to the HIV-1 RNA fragments, we measured the decrease of the fluorescence intensity, I, at a fixed concentration of protein in presence of increasing RNA concentrations. The fluorescence intensity was then converted into the intrinsic fluorescence quenching Qobs in Equation 1, Qobs=I0−II0(Eq. 1) with I0 corresponding to the protein fluorescence intensity in absence of nucleic acid. The number of consecutive nucleotides occluded upon binding of one ligand, n, the observed affinity, Kobs, and the cooperativity parameter, ω, were recovered using the model of McGhee and Von Hippel for cooperative binding (30McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H.

Because the McGhee and Von Hippel model was derived with the simplifying assumption of an infinite lattice of binding sites, we introduced a correction factor taking into account the finite lattice size, N (31Tsodikov O.V.

The correction merely amounts to multiplying Equation 2 by the factor in Equation 3 N−n+1N(Eq. 3) For ω = 1, Equation 2 simplifies to Equation 4, which corresponds to the Scatchard formulation for non-interacting ligands (32Scatchard G.

Fitting of experimental data with those equations was performed with an algorithm written with Mathematica (Wolfram Research). Fluorescence Properties of HIV-1 Vif Protein—HIV-1 Vif contains 8 Trp residues that confer a high intrinsic fluorescence signal to the protein. Interestingly, 7 of 8 Trp residues are located in the Vif N-terminal region, which corresponds to the RNA binding domain (22Khan M.A. Aberham C. Kao S. Akari H. Gorelick R. Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Zhang H. Pomerantz R.J. Dornadula G. Sun Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8252-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because of their high quantum yield and their high sensitivity to changes of the physicochemical environment, Trp residues constitute very sensitive probes for investigating protein/nucleic acid interactions (34Chen Y. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 35Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We started our study by analyzing the spectral fluorescent properties of the Vif Trp residues by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The free Trp amino acid in solution displays a fluorescence emission maximum at 350 nm (36Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, 2nd Ed. (Lakowicz, J. R., ed), Plenum Press, NY. 1999; Crossref Google Scholar). After selective excitation of Trp residues in Vif at 295 nm, the emission spectrum revealed a maximum at 338 nm (Fig. 3). Because Vif emission spectrum constitutes an average of the different Trp residues, this large blue shift of the emission maximum revealed that Trp residues in Vif are mainly located in a nonpolar environment (36Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, 2nd Ed. (Lakowicz, J. R., ed), Plenum Press, NY. 1999; Crossref Google Scholar). Upon nucleic acid binding, the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission of the protein was unchanged (Fig. 3), whereas the fluorescence intensity decreased depending on the nucleic acid sequences and concentration, as described below. Interestingly, high-affinity Vif binding to RNA and DNA was characterized by a global quenching of the fluorescence of 75–85% (Tables 2, 3, and 4, see below), likely corresponding to a quenching of 86–97% of the Trp residues located in the nucleic acid binding site, and implying that these residues behave similarly upon RNA or DNA binding.TABLE 2Vif–HIV-1 RNA fragment binding parameters The maximum extent of fluorescence quenching, Qmax, the binding site size, n, the cooperativity parameter, ω, and the equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Eq. 1 and 2) and were expressed as means for at least three experiments.RNAsGenomic regionMgCl2KdωQmaxmmnm%A1–497252.2 ± 9.163.3 ± 3.40.771056.7 ± 7.467.6 ± 4.10.76B499–996241.8 ± 4.281.2 ± 6.20.761045.1 ± 4.480.1 ± 3.00.77C995–14951053.4 ± 2.264.4 ± 2.60.68E1998–24951069.5 ± 5.858.2 ± 3.80.72F2467–29951081.9 ± 3.258.6 ± 3.90.69G7251–774510152.3 ± 7.428.2 ± 4.80.48H8625–91812125.5 ± 7.017.2 ± 4.90.5210166.8 ± 5.816.7 ± 2.90.47 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Characterization of high-affinity Vif binding sites on HIV-1 RNA Experimental data were fitted with the model derived for non-interacting small ligands to finite lattice (Eq. 4) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”RNAsMgCl2KdQmaxmmnm%TAR29.8 ± 1.80.751011.2 ± 2.30.72TAR 129.8 ± 1.90.831010.6 ± 1.60.80TAR 229.3 ± 1.60.76109.5 ± 2.20.77B1212.3 ± 2.50.811013.9 ± 1.20.78B2211.8 ± 2.00.851012.6 ± 1.90.82 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Characterization of Vif binding to DNA oligonucleotides Spectroscopic data were analyzed with the model derived for non-interacting small ligands to finite lattice (Eq. 4).DNAsKdQmaxnm%dTAR29.5 ± 2.30.75dTAR2c11.8 ± 2.60.76dB211.3 ± 1.90.74dB2c9.7 ± 1.60.78dPPT31.7 ± 2.70.44APOBEC3F site37.8 ± 2.10.50APOBEC3G site34.1 ± 3.80.55Dickerson dodecamer39.7 ± 3.50.39dG1034.5 ± 2.70.58dC1047.8 ± 1.70.40dT1029.3 ± 2.50.53dA1043.1 ± 2.90.43dA10·dT1035.5 ± 2.10.40d(GT)535.4 ± 3.30.50 Open table in a new tab Determination of the Binding Parameters of Vif/RNA Interactions—To identify preferential Vif binding regions on the HIV-1 genome, we synthesized a set of genomic RNA fragments of about 500 nucleotides in length by in vitro transcription (Fig. 1). RNA fragments A–F cover the 5′-third of the genome corresponding to the 5′-UTR and gag and pol coding regions. RNA fragment G contains the Rev-responsive element, which corresponds to the binding site of the auxiliary Rev protein, whereas RNA fragment H includes the polypurine tract (PPT), which constitutes the primer for (+) strand DNA synthesis during reverse transcriptase. To characterize Vif binding to these genomic RNA fragments, reverse titrations were performed by adding small volumes of concentrated RNA solutions to a fixed amount of protein. Protein binding was monitored through the decrease of Vif intrinsic fluorescence resulting from protein/nucleic acid complex formation (Fig. 4). Analysis of the fluorescence titration curves according to cooperative and non-cooperative binding models (Equations 2 and 4, under “Experimental Procedures”) highlighted moderate cooperativity of Vif binding to the different genomic RNA fragments, because the cooperative model (30McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar) gave the best fit of our experimental data. Nevertheless, the McGhee and von Hippel model is based on the assumption of identical binding sites, which most likely represents a simplification of the actual situation because our previous biochemical studies revealed the existence of preferential binding sites (26Henriet S. Richer D. Bernacchi S. Decroly E. Vigne R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, a more complex model including specific and nonspecific binding sites would contain too many independent parameters to obtain a reliable fit and, most likely, would even be intractable. Information about high-affinity Vif binding sites were obtained by making use of short oligonucleotides corresponding to these sites (see below). The binding parameters of Vif deduced from our analysis clearly showed that Vif did not bind equally the different RNA fragments (Table 2). Fluorescence titrations using RNA fragments A and B revealed a decrease of the Vif fluorescence of about 80%. Similarly, the fluorescence quenching was about 70% for RNA fragments C, E, and F, while it was limited to 50% in the case of fragments G and H. Analysis of the equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd, showed that Vif had the strongest affinity for RNA fragments A, B, and C (Kd = 45–55 nm), while it had a 3-fold reduced affinity for RNAs G and H (Kd = 150 to 165 nm). Intermediate equilibrium dissociation constants were obtained with RNA fragments E and F (Kd = 70–80 nm). In addition, binding of Vif to RNAs A, B, and C was rather cooperative (ω = 60 to 80), while RNAs G to H bound Vif with limited cooperativity (ω = 17 to 30). As a negative control, fluorescence titrations were also performed on Escherichia coli total tRNA, which was found to bind Vif poorly in our previous biochemical study (26Henriet S. Richer D. Bernacchi S. Decroly E. Vigne R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed by spectroscopic analysis, which showed a quenching of Vif fluorescence of only 25% (data not shown). The binding stoichiometry of Vif to the RNA fragments was estimated from the intersection of the initial slope of the titration curves with the fluorescence plateau. The number of binding sites was found to be 48 (±3) for RNAs A to F, and 20 (±2) for RNAs G and H, corresponding to 1 Vif/(10 ± 2) nucleotides and 1 Vif/(25 ± 3) nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Finally, to further characterize the Vif/nucleic acid complexes, we tested the influence of the MgCl2 concentration on the binding of Vif to the different RNAs. Decreasing the MgCl2 concentration from 10 to 2 mm had very little effect on the Kd values of RNAs A and B (Table 2), suggesting that these RNA/protein interactions are mainly non-electrostatic. On the contrary, the dependence of the equilibrium dissociation constant on the MgCl2 concentration in the case of RNA H (Table 2) pointed out the contribution of electrostatic interactions. Taken together our results demonstrate that Vif binds preferentially and cooperatively to RNA fragments A to C, which encompass the first 1500 nucleotides of the viral genome. This region overlays with the 5′-UTR of the genomic RNA, which contains numerous secondary structures essential for viral replication, and most of the gag gene (Fig. 1) (28Paillart J.C. Skripkin E.

Characterization of High-affinity Vif Binding Sites on HIV-1 RNA—To precisely map Vif binding sites, we previously performed ladder selection and enzymatic footprinting experiments on RNAs A and B (26Henriet S.

This analysis revealed the existence of a Vif binding site in the transactivation responsive region, TAR, which is a stable stem-loop structure located at 5′-end of the viral genome (38Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In RNA B, protection of G541 and G545 against cleavage by RNase T1 by Vif revealed the presence of a Vif binding site in this single-stranded region. Both sites were protected at low Vif concentration, and thus most likely correspond to high-affinity binding sites (26Henriet S. Richer D. Bernacchi S. Decroly E. Vigne R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we performed a fluorescence study to characterize Vif binding to these sites. To determine the minimal binding sites of Vif, we performed fluorescence titrations on the complete 65-nucleotide long TAR hairpin, and on the shorter TAR1 and TAR2 sequences corresponding to the apical region of TAR (Fig. 2A). Similarly, in RNA B, we selected fragment B1 encompassing nucleotides 539–564, as well as its single-stranded 5′ part, B2 (nucleotides 539–547) (Fig. 2B). Because our analysis of Vif binding to RNA fragments A to F revealed that the occluded binding size is about 10 ± 2 nucleotides, we expected that only one Vif molecule would bind to the shortest RNA oligonucleotides. Accordingly, experimental data on RNA oligonucleotides were best fitted with the model derived for non-interacting ligands to a finite lattice (Equation 4) (32Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). The best fits were obtained by decreasing the effective Vif concentration by 30–35% in comparison with the concentration of protein introduced into the quartz cell before adding nucleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2090145908,"TRPM2 and TRPM8, closely related members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, are cation channels activated by quite different mechanisms. Their transmembrane segments S5 and S6 are highly conserved. To identify common structures in S5 and S6 that govern interaction with the pore, we created a chimera in which the S5-pore-S6 region of TRPM8 was inserted into TRPM2, along with a lysine at each transition site. Currents through this chimera were induced by ADP-ribose (ADPR) in cooperation with Ca2+. In contrast to wild-type TRPM2 channels, currents through the chimera were carried by Cl-, as demonstrated in ion substitution experiments using the cation N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) and the anion glutamate. Extracellular NMDG had no effects. The substitution of either intracellular or extracellular Cl- with glutamate shifted the reversal potential, decreased the current amplitude and induced a voltage-dependent block relieved by depolarization. The lysine in S6 was responsible for the anion selectivity; insertion of a lysine into corresponding sites within S6 of either TRPM2 or TRPM8 created anion channels that were activated by ADPR (TRPM2 I1045K) or by cold temperatures (TRPM8 V976K). The positive charge of the lysine was decisive for the glutamate block because the mutant TRPM2 I1045H displayed cation currents that were blocked at acidic but not alkaline intracellular pH values. We conclude that the distal part of S6 is crucial for the discrimination of charge. Because of the high homology of S6 in the whole TRP family, this new role of S6 may apply to further TRP channels.

Recent data have identified several lipid messengers like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or lysophospholipids (LPLs) as mediators of TRPM8 activation (21Rohacs T. Lopes C.M.B.

In a recent study, the S4-S5 region of TRPM8 has been identified as a voltage-sensitive domain that additionally affects the sensitivity to temperature and menthol (20Voets T. Owsianik G. Jannssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For TRPM2, the analysis of a C-terminal splice variant detected in neutrophil granulocytes has revealed the importance of single amino acid residues of the NUDT9 domain for ADPR-dependent channel gating (5Wehage E.

However, no thorough analysis has been undertaken to gain information of how the S5 and S6 regions interact and communicate with the intervening pore region. Hitherto, studies on functional subdomains within the S5-pore-S6 region of TRP channels have concentrated on the cation selectivity determined by charged residues in the pore loop (24Garcia-Martinez C.

We report that a particular site in the C-terminal end of S6 is essential for the cation versus anion selectivity. By insertion of a lysine into corresponding sites of TRPM2 and TRPM8, channels were created that passed currents in response to the same stimuli as the respective wild-type channels but these currents were no longer carried by cations but by anions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning-For expression in eukaryotic cells, the plasmid constructs pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM2 and pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM8 each containing the full-length open reading frame of the corresponding human TRP channel were used. For the generation of the TRPM2/TRPM8 pore chimeras, we introduced recognition sites for AflII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at corresponding positions of the open reading frame of both channels; one in transmembrane segment S5 and one in S6. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Defined oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The preparation and ligation of the DNA fragments, which have to be exchanged between the two channels was performed as described elsewhere (23Kühn F.J.P. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46431-46437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Every point mutation or deletion as well as the correct orientation of the exchanged S5-pore-S6 segments were verified by DNA sequencing with the Big-DYE-Terminator Kit (Perkin Elmer, Roche Applied Sciences, Branchburry, NJ). To exclude the presence of inadvertent mutations in other regions of the channel, two clones with identical results were tested for each chimera or point mutant. All procedures were performed in accordance to the respective manufacturers' instructions, if not indicated otherwise.Cell Culture and Transfection-Chinese ovary hamster cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Biochrome, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrome). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of <103 cells/mm2 and grown for 24 h. Subsequently, the pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM2 or pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM8 expression constructs were transiently transfected into the CHO cells, using the Trans-Fast transfection reagent (Promega, Mannheim Germany). As controls, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-EGFP vector alone. The transfection procedure was performed as specified by the manufacturer. Patch-clamp measurements were carried out 24 h after transfection in cells visibly positive for EGFP.Electrophysiology-Transfected cells were analyzed with the patch-clamp technique in the conventional whole cell mode, using an EPC 9 equipped with a personal computer with Pulse and X chart software (HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany). The standard bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). For nominally cation-free extracellular conditions, the solution contained 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HCl). In some experiments, the standard extracellular bath solution was modified by replacing 140 mm NaCl with either 140 mm sodium glutamate, 140 mm NaBr, 140 mm NaI, or 140 mm NaF, and the reference electrode in the bath solution was a 140 mm NaCl/2% agar salt bridge. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 CsCl or 145 Cs-glutamate (as indicated), 8 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 Cs-EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). HEPES was replaced with 10 mm MES in experiments in which the pH was 6.0, and 10 mm N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-hydroxy-ethyl)-3-amino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (AMPSO) at pH 8.8. When a high (1 μm) intracellular Ca2+ concentration was desired, the EGTA concentration in the pipette fluid was reduced to 1 mm, and 0.89 mm CaCl2 was added. For the stimulation of TRPM2 currents, ADP-ribose was added to the pipette solution from a stock, yielding a final concentration of 0.1–1.0 mm. Alternatively, TRPM2 currents were evoked by superfusion of the cells with standard bath solution containing hydrogen peroxide (10 mm; diluted from a 30% stock solution). TRPM8 activation was induced by superfusion with standard bath solution containing 200 μm menthol (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10–30 μm icilin (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Alternatively, 1.5 μl menthol (from a 200 mm stock solution in Me2SO) or 1.5 μl of Icilin (from a 10–30 mm stock solution in Me2SO) was added directly to the bath chamber (1–2 ml volume). In some experiments, TRPM8 currents were stimulated or suppressed by superfusion with standard bath solution which was cooled immediately before application to ∼4 °C or warmed to 37 °C in a conventional water bath. If not otherwise stated, cells were held at a potential of -60 mV at room temperature. In some experiments, the holding potential was periodically varied (indicated in the figures). The current-voltage relations were obtained during voltage ramps from -90 to +60 mV and back to -90 mV applied over 400 ms. Changes in the liquid junction potential were not quantified in experiments on shifts in the reversal potential evoked by extracellular anion substitution; instead, a comparison was performed between cation selective TRPM channels and S6-Lys mutants during identical bath exchanges.4,4′-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, Sigma-Aldrich), used to test inhibition of anion currents, was added from a stock solution (10 mm in water or 50 mm in Me2SO) to the pipette solution or the superfusate (final concentration up to 0.5 mm).N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA; Merck, Germany), used to inhibit currents of wild-type TRPM2, TRPM8, or the M2M8P chimera, was added to the superfusate (final concentration 20 μm, diluted from a 50 mm stock solution in Me2SO).The current density represents the maximal current amplitude (pA) divided by the cell capacitance (pF), a measure of the cell surface. In the case of wild-type TRPM8 and M8-S6-Lys, the values were determined shortly after breaking into the cell and in the case of M2-S6-Lys during plateau current levels in the presence of intracellular ADPR (0.6 mm). Values are given as mean ± S.D. with the number (n) of cells studied.RESULTSTypical characteristics of whole cell currents through the wild-type channels TRPM2 and TRPM8 are shown in Fig. 1 with respect to their activation and their cation selectivity, which proved to be consistent with previous reports (3Peier A.M.

CHO cells transiently transfected with TRPM2 developed currents in response to intracellular ADPR (0.1–1.0 mm) that reached the cytosol by diffusion through the patch pipette (Fig. 1A). In standard experiments, Cs+ and glutamate were the main intracellular ions to minimize potential contaminating currents through K+ and Cl- channels (see “Experimental Procedures”). The current-voltage relation of ADPR-induced currents obtained during voltage ramps from -90 to +60 mV showed a reversal potential close to 0 mV, as expected for a nonspecific cation channel (Fig. 1B). Currents in the inward direction were minimized when extracellular Na+ was exchanged by the large impermeable cation NMDG (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that TRPM2 is a cation channel. Furthermore, TRPM2 currents were sensitive to Ca2+ as previously demonstrated (30McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.Z. Perraud A.L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11002-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ in combination with intracellular Ca2+ buffering with EGTA prevented current development in response to ADPR (data not shown).In patch-clamp experiments performed at room temperature on CHO cells transfected with TRPM8, a basal inward current was apparent that could be suppressed by heating of the cells to 37 °C or could be potentiated by cooling to 4 °C (Fig. 1C). The current-voltage relation shows a pronounced outward rectification and a reversal potential close to 0 mV (Fig. 1D). Again, substitution of extracellular Na+ by NMDG minimized currents in the inward direction without significantly affecting currents in the outward direction (not shown). These data confirm that TRPM8 as well is a non-selective cation channel. TRPM8 currents were not only induced by cold (Fig. 1C) but also by menthol (0.2 mm) or icillin (0.02 mm, not shown). The currents through TRPM8 desensitized rapidly and irreversibly, typically within 1–2 min (Fig. 1C).The S5 and S6 segments of TRPM2 and TRPM8 are quite similar, whereas the central pore sequences display little homology (Fig. 2). For the functional characterization of the extended pore domain, we initially exchanged the almost complete S5-pore-S6 segment of TRPM2 and TRPM8. The sequences at the cut-paste limits of the exchanged S5-pore-S6 segments contained single amino acid substitutions at each end where one hydrophobic amino acid residue was changed to a positively charged lysine (see Fig. 2); this was done to enable the use of the chosen restriction enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). The corresponding chimeras M2M8P (TRPM2 containing the S5-pore-S6 segment of TRPM8) and M8M2P (TRPM8 containing the S5-pore-S6 segment of TRPM2) were transiently expressed in CHO cells and characterized with whole cell patch clamp analysis. M8M2P was functionally inactive after stimulation with cold temperatures, menthol, icilin, or ADPR (data not shown). However, cells transfected with the reciprocal chimera M2M8P displayed ADPR-dependent currents (Fig. 3). Infusion of ADPR (0.1–1.0 mm) through the patch pipette into cells kept at a holding potential of -60 mV led to a time-dependent induction of inward currents similar as observed in cells transfected with wild-type TRPM2 (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to currents of wild-type TRPM2, the inward currents through M2M8P spontaneously and rapidly declined to (mean ± S.D.) 8.2 ± 3.0% of the initial maximum (n = 8; Fig. 3A). To quantify the kinetics, we measured the time over which 90% of the decline had occurred which amounted to 13.4 ± 2.9 s. These inward currents could be restored by depolarization to positive holding potentials. The amplitude of inward currents measured at -60 mV immediately after a depolarizing pulse was positively correlated with the strength of the depolarization (Fig. 3A) and also with its duration (Fig. 3B). The current-voltage relation of ADPR-evoked M2M8P currents (Fig. 3C) was obtained during voltage ramps from -90 to +60 mV, starting from a holding potential of -60 mV. The reversal potential was about -50 mV, considerably more negative if compared with wild-type TRPM2 and TRPM8 (see Fig. 1, B and D). The corresponding reversal potential obtained when the ramp was started from a holding potential of +60 mV was about -30 mV (Fig. 3C). As controls, we tested M2M8P-transfected cells in the absence of ADPR (Fig. 3, C, inset and D) as well as cells transfected with vector construct only (data not shown). Both controls were negative.FIGURE 2Design of TRPM2/TRPM8 channel chimeras. The presumed general structure of TRP channels including the exchanged S5-pore-S6 region (gray shading) is illustrated. The corresponding amino acid sequences of the S5-pore-S6 segments of TRPM2 and TRPM8 are shown in single letter code. Residues conserved between both channels are given in bold.

Lückhoff A. Biochem. J. 2006; 371: 1045-1053Crossref Google Scholar), intracellular Ca2+ represents a cofactor of ADPR-dependent activation of TRPM2. Therefore, we compared the ADPR-evoked current development of TRPM2 and M2M8P in the absence (10 mm EGTA) and presence of 1 μm Ca2+ in the pipette solution. Similarly to wild-type TRPM2, currents of M2M8P were more strongly stimulated when ADPR was infused in non-saturating concentrations (0.2 mm) along with 1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4A) than when ADPR was infused at a low Ca2+ concentration (<10 nm). Moreover, similar M2M8P currents as evoked intracellular ADPR were induced by extracellular H2O2 (10 mm; Fig. 4B). Again, these currents declined at a holding potential of -60 mV and were readily restored by short lasting depolarizations to +60 mV.FIGURE 4Activation and inhibition properties of M2M8P are similar to those of wild-type TRPM2. A, currents in the presence of either high (1 μm) or low (<10 nm) concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (as indicated) in cells expressing TRPM2 or M2M8P. Currents are normalized to the cell capacitance as well as to the holding potential (thus yielding conductance) because a holding potential of -20 mV instead of -60 mV was used for the large currents through TRPM2 at high Ca2+. B, whole cell currents in cells expressing M2M8P stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (10 mm). Superfusion with H2O2 was started at the time point indicated by the arrow. Note the characteristic delay before the onset of M2M8P current. The holding potential was intermittently set from -60 to +60 mV to restore the declining current amplitudes. C and D, current-voltage relations of M2M8P (C) and wild-type TRPM2 (D) currents obtained in the absence (control) or presence of the inhibitor ACA (20 μm). Cl- was the only intracellular and extracellular anion in these two experiments; see Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, it has been demonstrated that N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA) is a highly potent and efficient channel blocker of TRPM2, TRPM8, and TRPC6 (32Kraft R. Grimm C. Frenzel H. Harteneck C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 148: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because ACA blocked these channels only from the extracellular side, it has been proposed that it reduces the channel open probability. In our hands, the extracellular application of ACA (20 μm) inhibited ADPR-induced whole cell currents of M2M8P (Fig. 4C) to the same extent as observed for wild-type TRPM2 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the putative interaction of ACA and the external pore domain is not disturbed in the M2M8P channel chimera. The experiments with ACA were performed with a pipette solution containing Cl- as main anion to avoid block by intracellular glutamate (see next two paragraphs). Thus, with respect to channel activation by ADPR or hydrogen peroxide, co-stimulation by Ca2+ and inhibition by ACA, the gating behavior of M2M8P was not noticeably changed in comparison to wild-type TRPM2.The decline of M2M8P current at negative holding potentials and the restitution of inward currents by depolarizing pulses were consistently found when either glutamate or aspartate (not shown) was present in the pipette solution, at concentrations of 90 mm or more, but not at 40 or 70 mm. To analyze the phenomenon which resembles a voltage-dependent block with a slow time course, we first tested conditions with NMDG as main extracellular cation. These experiments revealed a further and more striking difference of M2M8P in comparison to both, TRPM2 and TRPM8. The characteristic current development of M2M8P (see Figs. 3A and 4B) was not changed by NMDG (Fig. 5A); in fact, NMDG did not elicit any obvious effects on inward or outward currents (compare Figs. 3C, 5B). We examined whether these unexpected results could be explained by permeability to NMDG despite the large size of the NMDG cation, because some channels of the TRP family display partial permeability to NMDG (33Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Jones S.W. Applegate M.A. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2006; 15: 359-377Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, there was no notable shift of the reversal potential of currents t"
https://openalex.org/W1973261524,"Campylobacter jejuni contains two globins, a truncated hemoglobin, Ctb, and a single domain hemoglobin, Cgb. The physiological function of Ctb remains unclear, whereas Cgb has been linked to NO detoxification. With resonance Raman scattering, the iron-histidine stretching mode of Cgb was identified at 251 cm(-1). This frequency is unusually high, suggesting an imidazolate character of the proximal histidine as a result of the H-bonding network linking the catalytic triad involving the F8His, H23Glu, and G5Tyr residues. In the CO-complex, two conformers were identified with the nuC-O/nuFe-CO at 529/1914 cm(-1) and 492/1963 cm(-1). The former is assigned to a ""closed"" conformation, in which the heme-bound CO is stabilized by the H-bond(s) donated from the B10Tyr-E7Gln residues, whereas the latter is assigned to an ""open"" conformer, in which the H-bonding interaction is absent. The presence of the two alternative conformations demonstrates the plasticity of the protein matrix. In the O2-complex, the iron-O2 stretching frequency was identified at 554 cm(-1), which is unusually low, indicating that the heme-bound O2 is stabilized by strong H-bond(s) donated by the B10Tyr-E7Gln residues. This scenario is consistent with its low O2 off-rate (0.87 s(-1)). Taken together the data suggest that the NO-detoxifying activity of Cgb is facilitated by the imidazolate character of the proximal F8His and the distal positive polar environment provided by the B10Tyr-E7Gln. They may offer electronic ""push"" and ""pull,"" respectively, for the O-O bond cleavage reaction required for the isomerization of the presumed peroxynitrite intermediate to the product, nitrate."

Identifying the linkage pathway has been limited by the lack of a complete atomic-resolution structure of any fast synaptic receptor.

This structural template provides critical insights into the nature of the binding site, but, of course, the ion channel and its gate are missing from such structures. Second, a refined electron microscopy structure of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor by Unwin and co-workers (Protein Data Bank code 2BG9) has shed light onto the global structure and has suggested molecular determinants of functional mechanisms in Cys-loop receptors (9Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 10Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 11Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The available structural information reinforced previous conclusions on the modular nature of Cys-loop receptors, with the extracellular domain being well defined and primarily composed of β sheets and the transmembrane domain exclusively α helical. A large number of ionic residues are found where these two domains meet, and many studies have suggested that specific ion pair interactions make important contributions to the gating mechanism (12Absalom N.L.

Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have described this region as the “gating interface,” and both experiments and analyses across the Cys-loop superfamily showed that, whereas the overall charging pattern of the gating interface is conserved, specific ion pair interactions are not (16Xiu X.N. Hanek A.P. Wang J.T. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Sala F. Mulet J. Sala S. Gerber S. Criado M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6642-6647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As such, it is risky to conclude that a particular ion pair interaction that may be important in one Cys-loop receptor will be important throughout the superfamily. An especially prominent ion pair interaction at the gating interface of the Torpedo nAChR structure is shown in Fig. 1. The side chains of α subunit residues Glu45 in loop 2 and Arg209 in the pre-M1 segment are in close proximity, and recent studies by Lee et al. (15Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) establish that they form a salt bridge in muscle-type nAChR. These residues align with Glu92 and Arg258 in the GABAC ρ1 subunit (Fig. 1). The GABAC receptor is distinct in several ways from the muscle-type nAChR. The GABAC receptor is homopentameric, inhibitory (anion conducting), and displays kinetics on the seconds time scale. The muscle-type nAChR is heteromeric ((α1)2β1γδ), excitatory (cation conducting), and displays kinetics on the milliseconds time scale. Thus we were interested in whether the ion pair interaction seen in the nAChR is also important in the GABAC receptor. Here we describe studies of this and other potential interactions in the gating interface of the GABAC receptor using both conventional and unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. We find that GABAC receptor ρ1 subunits form the same ion pair interaction as previously identified in the nAChR (15Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Based on kinetic data, we propose that the salt bridge stabilizes the receptor in the resting state and that agonist binding to the receptor leads to the breaking of the salt bridge, triggering the opening of the ion channel. Cloning, Mutagenesis, and mRNA Synthesis—GABAC receptor subunits were derived from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the complete coding sequence for the human ρ1 receptor subunit, kindly provided by Dr. Sarah C. R. Lummis (University of Cambridge, UK). Wild-type receptor coding sequences were then subcloned into the oocyte expression vector plasmid pGEMHE. The 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions from a Xenopus β-globin gene in the vector led to an enhancement of expression by several hundred-fold (18Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Mutations in the cDNA were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were linearized with NheI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and used as template to produce mRNAs using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). The resulting mRNA is stored at -80 °C. Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Stage VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis were employed. Electrophysiology recordings were performed 48–72 h after injection in two-electrode voltage clamp mode using the OpusXpress 6000A (Molecular Devices, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Holding potentials were -60 mV. Drug applications were 40–130 s in duration. Data were sampled at 125 Hz and filtered at 50 Hz. All drugs were diluted to the desired concentration with ND96 buffer. EC50, IC50, and Hill coefficients were calculated by fitting the does-response relation to the Hill equation (19McMenimen K.A. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Petersson E.J. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Maximal currents elicited by GABA, Imax(GABA), and by muscimol, Imax(muscimol), were measured at saturating concentrations on the same oocytes. The relative efficacy (ϵ), defined as the ratio of Imax(muscimol)/Imax(GABA), was calculated for each cell then averaged, and is reported as mean ± S.E. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. For kinetic measurements, drug applications began at a rate of 0.023 ml/s for 28 s and then decreased to 0.0033 ml/s for 102 s. Measurements of on-kinetics, especially at the higher GABA concentrations, are limited by two factors. The most rapid kinetics was limited by the speed of the drug delivery system. Chamber volume was ∼100 μl, so that solution exchange in the entire chamber occurred with a time constant of ∼4 s. However, the drug pipette was situated just a few millimeters from the oocyte, so that solution changes were faster near the oocyte; we estimate that the fastest time constant for solution change near the oocyte was 0.5 s. Additional experiments, conducted at exchange rates up to 0.067 ml/s, established that the derived kinetic parameters are not detectably dependent on the rate of drug application. The slowest on-kinetics was limited by the longest drug application time, 130 s (limited by the 1-ml drug reservoir), which allowed for time constants as long as ∼44 s. Activation rate constants (k = 1/τ) of ∼0.023–2 s-1 are therefore in the measurable range. The rate constants k of the individual activation traces were calculated by fitting the activation phase to a first-order exponential function with a sloping baseline (pCLAMP software, Axon Instruments). Values of k were then averaged and plotted against [GABA]; this plot was fitted as a straight line (Fig. 3, B–E). The apparent bimolecular binding rate constant kact equals the slope of this plot. For the deactivation phase, chambers were perfused at 0.05 ml/s until the current returned to the baseline. The rate constants of the individual deactivation traces were calculated by fitting the deactivation phase to a first-order exponential function. The deactivation rate constant was averaged across all GABA concentrations. In general, it was possible to measure kinetics at GABA concentrations in the range of EC50 to 10 times EC50 (5 times EC50 for wild-type receptor). Kinetic parameters are difficult to obtain for lower GABA concentrations because of the small current size. Unnatural Amino Acid Suppression—Unnatural amino acid, nitrohomoalanine (Nha), was synthesized, conjugated to the dinucleotide deoxycytosine adenosine (dCA), and ligated to truncated 74-nucleotide tRNA as previously described (20Cashin A.L. Torrice M.M. McMenimen K.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the aminoacyl-tRNA was deprotected by photolysis immediately prior to co-injection with mRNA containing an amber (TAG) stop codon at position 92. Negative and positive controls were performed as previously reported (21Cashin A.L. Petersson E.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—To detect surface expression for several mutants, a hemagglutinin epitope tag was incorporated at the N-terminal in the ρ1 subunit (between positions 2 and 3). Control experiments show a negligible effect of this epitope on EC50. 48–72 h after injection, 12 oocytes were incubated in hypotonic solution (5 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaCl) for 10 min, and then the vitelline/plasma membranes were isolated by physical dissection. The pellet and supernatant were mixed with 5 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer, and SDS-PAGE was performed in 15% Tris-Cl ReadyGels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-hemagglutinin antibody and visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Studies of the Human GABAC Receptor ρ1 Subunit—As in other members of the Cys-loop superfamily, the gating interface of the GABAC receptor is rich in charged residues. We have studied three positions in loop 2, which frequently has a larger number of charged residues, both by conventional mutagenesis and unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. The results are given in Table 1. In loop 2, Glu92 is conserved as negatively charged across the entire Cys-loop family, and it aligns with the previously mentioned αGlu45 of the muscle-type nAChR. Its important role in receptor function is confirmed in the GABAC ρ1 subunit, because the charge reversal mutation E92R gave non-functional receptors. Western blot analysis confirms that properly assembled receptors reached the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S1), establishing that the E92R mutation affected receptor function rather than folding, assembly, or trafficking. Previous studies show that introducing a positive charge at this position either lowers the EC50 significantly in nAChR and glycine receptor α1 or raises the EC50 modestly in GABAA α1 subunit, demonstrating an important role in gating for this charged residue (12Absalom N.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Two other anionic residues in loop 2 were also probed. Asp-94 is conserved as negatively charged in GABAA α subunits and nAChR ϵ, δ, and γ subunits, but not throughout the Cys-loop family; Asp-96 is conserved as negatively charged in all inhibitory Cys-loop receptors. In contrast to E92R, both D94R and D96R are minimally perturbing, consistent with previous observations on the remarkable tolerance in general of the gating interface to such charge reversal mutations (16Xiu X.N.

Based on the 2BG9 structure, four positively charged residues could be fairly close to Glu92: Arg257 and Arg258 in pre-M1 and Arg316 and Lys321 in the M2–M3 linker. Only Arg258 is universally conserved as a positively charged group. The nonfunctional E92R mutant is fully rescued by combination with R258E in pre-M1 but not by R257D, R316D, or K321E. The double mutant E92R/R258E shows a modest 4-fold decrease in EC50 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The single charge reversal mutation R258E produced receptors that cannot traffic to the cell surface, indicating the positive charge is involved in receptor expression, folding, and/or assembly (supplemental Fig. S1). Previous work on the corresponding residue in glycine receptor α1 and nAChR α7 receptors show contributions to agonist potency and efficacy (22Vicente-Agullo F. Rovira J.C. Sala S. Sala F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The other three positive sites we studied, Arg257, Arg316, and Lys321, are not critical, because single charge reversal mutations all produced functional receptors with modest shifts in EC50. Therefore, Glu92 and Arg258 satisfy several criteria expected of residues that lie on the “principal pathway” coupling agonist binding to receptor gating: they are located in close proximity to each other at the gating interface, receptor function can be rescued by charge swapping, and they are conserved in all members of the Cys-loop receptors. Unnatural Mutant, E92Nha—To explore more fully the role of Glu92 in gating, we incorporated an unnatural amino acid that is isosteric and isoelectronic to Glu but does not contain a negative charge. The residue is Nha, the nitro analog of Glu (Fig. 2C). Charge neutralization at Glu92 would destroy any ion-pairing interaction with Arg258. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2B, incorporation of Nha at position 92, E92Nha, resulted in an 11-fold decrease in EC50 for GABA. The E92Nha mutant behavior suggests that charge neutralization greatly affects the salt bridge interaction, producing a gain-of-function channel. Conventional Mutant, E92D—Because the side-chain length of Asp is one carbon group shorter than that of Glu (Fig. 2C), one expects this mutation to weaken the electrostatic interaction with Arg258 by moving the two charged groups further apart. Glu92 can be replaced by the Asp residue, producing functional receptors with a 40-fold decrease in EC50 compared with the wild-type receptors. This apparent gain-of-function mutation also has important mechanistic consequences, as discussed below. Kinetics of GABA Responses—Fig. 3A superimposes normalized waveforms of responses to GABA pulses for wild-type, E92R/R258E, E92Nha, and E92D receptors. Kinetic analysis is simplified by the fact that GABAC receptors display little macroscopic desensitization. The very different waveforms indicate interesting variations. To evaluate the kinetic properties of the wild-type and mutant receptors, response waveforms were recorded at various GABA concentrations. Kinetic analysis of the wild-type receptor revealed a GABA concentration-dependent activation rate, with an apparent bimolecular rate constant (kact) of 0.156 μm-1 s-1 (Fig. 3B and Table 2). We consider that this parameter is reliable to ± 15%. As expected from most models, the deactivation phase for the GABAC receptor was well fitted by a single exponential and showed little or no concentration dependence (24Qian H. Dowling J.E. Ripps H. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Qian H. Dowling J.E. Ripps H. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This decay had a rate constant kdeact of 0.038 s-1.TABLE 2A comparison of kinetic parameters for the wild type, E92Nha, E92D, and E92R/R258E receptorskactRT ln(kact,WT/kact,mut)kdeactRT ln(kdeact,WT/kdeact,mut)mm–1 s–1kcal mol–1s–1kcal mol–1wild type0.156 ± 0.0060.038 ± 0.001E92Nha0.28 ± 0.014–0.350.017 ± 0.0010.48E92D0.37 ± 0.024–0.520.0057 ± 0.00011.12E92R/R258E0.079 ± 0.0040.400.010 ± 0.0010.79 Open table in a new tab The single mutants E92Nha and E92D both show increased values for kact and decreased values for kdeact (Fig. 3 (C and D) and Table 2). Both effects are larger for the more disruptive E92D mutant. The double mutant E92R/R258E has distinct kinetic properties (Fig. 3E and Table 2). The activation rate is roughly half that of wild type, and the deactivation rate is significantly decreased to one-fourth of the value for wild-type receptors. The ρ1 GABAC receptor used in this study has a single-channel conductance of <2 pS (26Zhu Y. Ripps H. Qian H. Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 418: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Wotring V.E. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The resulting small currents vitiate systematic kinetic studies using single-channel analysis. Functional Properties of E92R/R258E and Wild-type Receptors—Because the E92R/R258E mutations we are evaluating occur at the gating interface and are quite remote from the agonist binding site (28Lummis S.C.R. Beene D.L. Harrison N.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 993-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we expect changes in EC50 to reflect alteration of gating more than binding. To verify this, we compared several functional characteristics of the two receptors; the results are summarized in Table 3. The reversal potential of GABA currents mediated by the E92R/R258E mutant receptor was the same as for the wild-type receptor; both were close to -26 mV, indicating the currents are mainly carried by chloride, as expected. The GABAC-competitive antagonist, TPMPA ((1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid), reduced the GABA current with an IC50 of 1.7 μm for E92R/R258E, roughly 3-fold different from the wild-type receptor (5.5 μm). To examine the affinity of TPMPA for both receptors, Schild plots were generated (supplemental Fig. S2). Kd values obtained were 2.41 μm and 0.90 μm, for wild-type and mutant receptors, respectively, again a roughly 3-fold shift.TABLE 3Functional comparison of wild-type and E92R/R258E receptors GABA concentration for IC50 for wild-type and E92R/R258E is 4 μm and 1 μm (=EC95), respectively.

Previous work has identified His-157 in the extracellular domain to be involved in Zn2+ block (29Wang T.L. Hackam A. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc ions blocked the E92R/R258E mutant receptor with an IC50 of 46 μm, whereas the IC50 for wild type was 52 μm, indicating that the mutant receptor does not disrupt down-modulation by zinc. The behavior of the open channel blocker, picrotoxin, was also examined. Picrotoxin is considered to bind in the pore region of the receptor (30Wang T.L. Hackam A.S. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11751-11755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Zhang D. Pan Z.H. Zhang X. Brideau A.D. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11756-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The E92R/R258E mutant channel is relatively insensitive to picrotoxin, with an 8-fold increase in IC50. Finally, we measured the relative efficacy (ϵ) of muscimol, a GABAC partial agonist, for wild-type receptors as well as the double mutant receptors (Table 3). The ϵ for the E92R/R258E receptor is substantially increased over that of the wild-type, from 0.61 to 1.09, converting muscimol from a partial agonist to a full agonist. In summary, for the E92R/R258E channel, the current is inhibited by TPMPA, down-modulated by Zn2+, blocked by picrotoxin, and gated by muscimol, confirming the double mutant channel has the general pharmacological properties of the ρ1 receptors. The present work reveals a significant ion pair interaction at the gating interface of the GABAC receptor. Although the single mutant E92R is nonfunctional, and the single mutant R258E does not express on the cell surface, the double mutant E92R/R258E is fully functional, with an EC50 4-fold less than wild type. In addition, the double mutant displays global functional and pharmacological characteristics that are typical for a GABAC ρ1 receptor. As noted earlier, the comparable pair, Glu45–Arg209, has been shown to interact in the muscle-type nAChR (15Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike several other ion pairs of the gating interface that have been ascribed important roles in receptor function (12Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50151-50157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Kash T.L. Dizon M.J.F. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41655-41666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the pair considered here may well be important throughout the Cys-loop superfamily. That the Glu92–Arg258 interaction really is an ion pair is supported by several observations. Note that the typical tool for establishing a pairwise interaction, a mutant cycle analysis (32Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), is not applicable here because the key single mutants do not produce functional receptors. Perhaps the most telling evidence for ion pairing results from the unnatural amino acid Nha. The side chain of Nha is isosteric and isoelectronic to that of glutamate; the only substantive difference is the lack of a negative charge. The Nha mutant shows an 11-fold decrease in EC50, suggesting charge plays an important role. Note that, although unable to form an ion pair, the nitro group of Nha can hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg258. Although the hydrogen bond is expected to be 10- to 20-fold weaker than the analogous interaction with a carboxylate (20Cashin A.L. Torrice M.M. McMenimen K.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this could account for the fact that the Nha receptor is still functional. Apparently, not only is the Glu92–Arg258 interaction important, but it is also significantly geometrically constrained. The charge-conserving E92D mutation produces a larger EC50 shift than the charge-neutralizing Nha mutation. Apparently, the shorter Asp side chain versus Glu significantly compromises the Glu92–Arg258 interaction. Because ion pairs are not usually considered to be especially sensitive to distance, this significant effect suggests a substantial geometric constraint. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Glu92–Arg258 interaction plays a significant role in receptor gating. The double mutant E92R/R258E is functional, and it converts the partial agonist muscimol to a full agonist. Such observations are typically interpreted to mean that the mutation has affected the open probability of the receptor, such that a drug that cannot produce a large Popen for the wild-type receptor, a partial agonist, can do so for the double mutant. The 5-fold drop in EC50 of muscimol seen with the double mutant is completely consistent with this analysis. If we assume that binding of two ligands is required to efficiently gate the channel, the 60% efficacy of muscimol for the wild type indicates that the ratio of opening to closing rates, β/α = θ, for the doubly liganded receptor is 1.5. Increasing this ratio to a value of 30, giving an efficacy of ∼97%, would account for the 5-fold drop in EC50, because this parameter varies as roughly the square root of θ. We interpret the ∼4-fold drop in EC50 for GABA activation to reflect a similar increase in θ for the E92R/R258E mutant. Similar conclusions are reached if we assume binding of three ligands (see below). The double mutant also affects the open channel blocker picrotoxin, raising IC50 by 8-fold. The picrotoxin binding site is in the channel region, far removed from the agonist binding site. In our interpretation of this finding, the double mutant has altered the structure in the gating region, not the agonist binding site. It is true that certain types of open-channel blockers are expected to show varying potency as θ varies, even if the mutation changes the binding site; however, the most straightforward models predict that IC50 for a channel blocker would decrease as θ increases (33Adams D.J. Nonner W. Dwyer T.M. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We believe that the lowered potency for picrotoxin does indicate that the Glu92–Arg258 pair directly influences the binding of picrotoxin at a site within the channel region (30Wang T.L. Hackam A.S. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11751-11755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Zhang D. Pan Z.H. Zhang X. Brideau A.D. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11756-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, modulation of the channel by Zn2+ is not affected by the E92R/R258E mutation, because the Zn2+ binding site is remote from both the agonist binding site and the channel gate. The competitive antagonist TPMPA does show an ∼3-fold enhancement of binding in the double mutant. TPMPA is a larger molecule than GABA, and it may be that, while blocking the binding site, TPMPA can be closer to the Glu92–Arg258 pair, such that it responds to mutations there either directly or through an allosteric effect. As with other structural insights into receptors and receptor models, the image of the nAChR shown in Fig. 1 begs the question as to which state of the receptor we are viewing. Several lines of evidence suggest that, at least for the GABAC receptor, the ion pair probed here is present in the closed state and is broken on going to the open state. We assume the ion pair stabilizes the state in which it is present. Weakening the ion pair, either by charge neutralization (E92Nha) or by disrupting the geometry (E92D) destabilizes that state and lowers EC50. The simplest way to interpret this is that weakening the Glu92–Arg258 interaction destabilizes the closed state, which would thereby lower the barrier to the open state. The homomeric ρ1 receptor displays activation and inactivation kinetics that are anomalously slow among Cys-loop receptor family members, although the actual kinetics appear to vary by up to 3-fold between oocyte and mammalian cell expression systems (34Yang J. Cheng Q. Takahashi A. Goubaeva F. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2155-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 35Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The previously available data do, however, agree in suggesting that the open state of the channel is much more likely to be associated with the presence of three or more bound GABA molecules than with fewer bound agonist molecules. Our interpretation that the highly sensitive E92D and E92Nha mutants have destabilized close states then suggests that the open state of the channel might require fewer bound agonist molecules. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that the Hill coefficients of the dose-response relations decrease from the wild-type value of 2.2 to 1.4 and 1.6 for the highly sensitive mutants. Other explanations are possible, and we recognize that another mutant, R316D, is less sensitive than wild-type but it too has a lower Hill coefficient. The macroscopic rate constants of Table 2 support this view of a destabilized closed state. These numbers are necessarily complex, with kact reflecting a composite of binding and unbinding processes and channel opening (the latter is generally described by the rate constant β). That binding is involved is established by the increase in kact with [GABA]. The requirement for multiple bound agonist molecules leads one to predict that kact should increase more than linearly with [GABA] (33Adams D.J. Nonner W. Dwyer T.M. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this effect is expected to be most pronounced for [GABA] < EC50, and for the usual reasons, our measurements are most precise at larger [GABA]. If we assume that mutations at Glu92/Arg258 influence gating more than binding, as argued above, then differences in kact can be ascribed to differences in β. In contrast, kdeact is independent of [GABA]; so we associate this unimolecular rate constant with the rate constant for channel closing, α. With these assumptions about kinetics, the free energy diagrams of Fig. 4 can be constructed. We assume that the ion pair is completely absent in the open state, and so the open state energy is unaffected by the mutations studied here. Then, the differences in kdeact set the relative positions of the transition states that separate open and closed states. The mutations destabilize the closed state. This destabilization must be more than the destabilization of the transition state by an amount that corresponds to the acceleration of the opening rate. That is, for E92Nha and E92D, the closed state must be destabilized by 0.48 + 0.35 = 0.83 kcal/mol and 1.12 + 0.52 = 1.64 kcal/mol, respectively. This simple model rationalizes the acceleration of kact and the deceleration of kdeact caused by mutations at Glu92. We can also estimate the extent to which the Glu92–Arg258 interaction is present in the transition state for channel opening. For the E92Nha mutant, the value is 0.48/0.83 = 58%; for E92D it is 1.12/1.64 = 68%. The more severe E92D mutation produces an earlier transition state, as would be expected based on the greater destabilization of the starting (closed) state. Presumably, the wild-type receptor would have a later transition state than either mutant, perhaps with ∼50% of the ion pair interaction present. This value is consistent with Auerbach's free energy analyses of residues in this region, which establish Φ values that are intermediate between those of the agonist binding site region and those of the transmembrane region (36Auerbach A. Sci. STKE2003,. 2003; : re11PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In summary, we have established an important ion pair interaction between Glu92 and Arg258 in the gating interface of the GABAC receptor, the second example of this interaction being important in a Cys-loop receptor. Several lines of reasoning and earlier work suggest that the ion pair probed here plays an important role in channel gating. We propose that the Glu92–Arg258 ion pair stabilizes the closed state of the receptor and is completely broken upon going to the open state. Free energy analysis suggests the ion pair is ∼50% broken at the gating transition state, consistent with other models of receptor activation. We thank Michael Torrice for the preparation of Nha.

The basolateral membranes of these cells have a Ca2+-ATPase, which is thought to be responsible for the fine regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. In this paper we show that nanomolar concentrations of ceramide (Cer50 = 3.5 nm), a natural product derived from sphingomyelinase activity in biological membranes, promotes a 50% increase of Ca2+-ATPase activity in purified basolateral membranes. The stimulatory effect of ceramide occurs through specific and direct (cAMP-independent) activation of a protein kinase A (blocked by 10 nm of the specific inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), the 5-22 peptide). The activation of PKA by ceramide results in phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase, as detected by an anti-Ser/Thr specific PKA substrate antibody. It is observed a straight correlation between increase of Ca2+-ATPase activity and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump molecule. Ceramide also stimulates phosphorylation of renal Ca2+-ATPase via protein kinase C, but stimulation of this pathway, which inhibits the Ca2+ pump in kidney cells, is counteracted by the ceramide-triggered PKA-mediated phosphorylation.

Important molecular transport processes take place across the epithelium of kidney proximal tubules.

Other ion pumps are not so numerous, but some, such as the plasma membrane calcium pump, play important roles in the fine regulation of intracellular ion concentrations. Our group has recently shown that Ca2+-ATPase is exclusively located and active in caveolin-cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains or lipid rafts in the kidney BLM (2Tortelote G.G. Valverde R.H. Lemos T. Guilherme A. Einicker-Lamas M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These membranes have also been shown to house different cell signaling systems that are initiated by the activation of either different lipid kinases, with further generation of bioactive molecules (3Einicker-Lamas M.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Rafts are thought to be present in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, where sphingomyelin, the precursor of ceramide (Cer) in a pathway catalyzed by sphingomyelinases, appears to be predominantly located. An important concept is that the assembly of the outer leaflet lipid rafts would alter the inner leaflet, thus enabling the different steps required for signal transduction to be coordinated (for review, see Ref. 10Bollinger C.R. Teichgräber V. Gulbins E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Many studies during the past decade have shown that smaller lipid rafts are merged into large membrane domains when sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed and Cer is generated (Refs. 11Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 12Nurminen T.A. Holopainen J.M. Zhao H. Kimmunen P.K. J. Am. Chem.

Acta. 2005; 1746: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar for review). The generation of Cer molecules and their self-association leads to dramatic changes in plasma membranes with further formation of small Cer-rich microdomains, which are able to fuse spontaneously to others resulting in large domains called platforms (12Nurminen T.A. Holopainen J.M. Zhao H. Kimmunen P.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kimmunen P.K.

Therefore, Cer-enriched microdomains seem to play an important role in facilitating and amplifying signaling processes, via different types of cell surface receptors, resulting in clusters of receptors and other cell signaling machinery that facilitate the effective transduction of different signals (10Bollinger C.R. Teichgräber V. Gulbins E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The importance of Cer in different cell processes is not only related to its physicochemical properties. It can be also considered a cell signaling molecule with different roles in different subcellular compartments (for review, see Ref. 15van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A.H. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Classically, Cer generation occurs either by the activation of sphingomyelin or via de novo synthesis (16Bose R. Verheij M. Haimowitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 17Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In view of its structural analogy with diacylglycerol, it has been suggested that Cer fulfills a second messenger function by binding directly to different intracellular targets (18Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Huwiler A. Kolter T. Pfeilshifter J. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Some of these targets have already been studied, such as different sets of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (20Ruvolo P.P. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although some studies report atypical PKC, principally PKCζ, as the primary ceramide-activated PKC (20Ruvolo P.P. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 21Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35617-35623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), there are some reports of a direct association of Cer with PKCα and PKCδ in kidney cells (22Huwiler A. Fabbro J. Pfeilshifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Colombaioni L. Garcia-Gil M. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 46: 328-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More than 10 years ago it was shown that Cer could also be phosphorylated by a ceramide kinase, resulting in another bioactive sphingolipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), which has a broad spectrum of cellular targets (23Colombaioni L. Garcia-Gil M. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 46: 328-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Futerman A. Hannun Y.A.

J. 2004; 380: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In view of the preferential formation of Cer in the lipid rafts and because the Ca2+-ATPase is exclusively located in cholesterol-caveolin-rich lipid rafts in the BLM (2Tortelote G.G. Valverde R.H. Lemos T. Guilherme A. Einicker-Lamas M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the effects of Cer and C1P on the kidney proximal tubule BLM Ca2+-ATPase and on the cell signaling cascade that could be involved. Materials—Buffers, bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline, CHAPS, and protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. Percoll was from GE Healthcare. Distilled water, deionized using the Milli-Q system of resins (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA), was used to prepare all solutions. 32Pi was obtained from IPEN (São Paulo, Brazil). [γ-32P]ATP was prepared as described by Maia et al. (27Maia J.C.C. Gomes S.L. Juliani M.H. Morel C.M. Genes of Parasites: A Laboratory Manual. Editora Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil1983: 146-167Google Scholar). Ceramide (from bovine brain), C1P, histone H8, protein A-agarose from Staphylococcus aureus in saline suspension, the PKA α-catalytic subunit inhibitor 5-22 peptide (PKAi), and the PKC inhibitor calphostin C were purchased from Sigma. The PKA α-catalytic subunit (from bovine heart) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All of the other reagents were of the highest purity available. The antibody against plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (clone 5f10) was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO); the antibody (C-16) against isoform 1 of Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-Ser/Thr PKA substrate polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond) and the ECLTM system were from Amersham Biosciences. X-OmatTM diagnostic film was from Eastman Kodak Co. Pig kidneys were obtained from a slaughterhouse under the supervision of licensed veterinarians. Isolation of Basolateral Membranes—The kidneys were rapidly removed after the animals had been killed and transported in a chilled solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The external portion of the cortex (cortex corticis) was carefully removed, and purified BLM derived from kidney proximal tubules were prepared using the Percoll gradient method (28Boumendil-Podevin E.F. Podevin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Controls for contamination with other membranes were carried out as previously described (5Coka-Guevara S. Markus R.P. Caruso-Neves C. Lopes A.G. Vieyra A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Vieyra A. Nachbin L. Dios-Abad E. Goldfeld M. Meyer-Fernandes J.R. de Moraes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4247-4255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the basolateral membrane marker Na+K+-ATPase (260.8 ± 1.6 nmol/mg per min) was enriched 5-fold over the initial kidney cortex homogenate. The membranes were stored in 250 mm sucrose in liquid N2, which preserved marker and Ca2+-ATPase activities for at least 5 months. Protein Determination—A 10-μl aliquot (in triplicate) was used for protein assays, which were performed by the Folin phenol method described by Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 5% SDS in the samples, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Determination of Plasma Membrane Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The membranes (0.2 mg/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a medium (1 ml) containing 50 mm 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm ouabain, 20 μm free Ca2+ (0.2 mm EGTA, 238.3 μm CaCl2), and the concentrations of Cer or C1P indicated in the figures or figure legends. After 10 min of sonication (240 W, 25 kHz, 24–25 °C; Unique Sonifier Cleaner, Indaiatuba, São Paulo, Brazil), the samples were supplemented with 120 mm KCl and then with 5 mm ATP. Where indicated, 10 nm PKAi (the 5–22 inhibitor peptide of PKA) or 10 nm calphostin C (the inhibitor of PKC) were added to the preincubation medium. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by adding 1.5 ml of activated charcoal in 0.1 n HCl to each tube. After centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge (2,000 rpm), aliquots of the supernatants (0.5 ml) were transferred to new glass tubes to measure the amount of Pi released using the colorimetric method of Taussky and Shorr (31Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 202: 675-682Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between the activities measured without and with 2 mm EGTA. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using a computer program that took into account the different species involved in the equilibrium between EGTA, Ca2+, the different ATP forms, Mg2+,H+, and K+ (32Sorenson M.M. Coelho H.S. Reuben J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Electrophoresis of BLM proteins, followed by immunodetection of Ca2+-ATPase by the 5f10 or PMCA1 antibodies and of phospho-Ser/Thr residues (in the sequence recognized by PKA), was carried out as described recently (2Tortelote G.G. Valverde R.H. Lemos T. Guilherme A. Einicker-Lamas M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Valverde R.H. Tortelote G.G. Lemos T. Mintz E. Vieyra A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30611-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Ca2+-ATPase—The BLM Ca2+ pump was immunoprecipitated using the following procedure. The BLM of kidney proximal tubules (5 mg/ml) were first incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of 5, 20, and 50 nm Cer, before the addition of the phosphorylation medium (see below) supplemented with 10 mm NaF. After 20 min at 37 °C, the reaction was arrested with 1% CHAPS, and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow the membranes to be solubilized. In the meantime, protein A-agarose was mixed with the 5f10 antibody (equal volumes of each original stock) and gently stirred for 20 min before the addition of an equal volume of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in 0.01% CHAPS. This mixture was then added to the solubilized membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitate and the supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 4 min (4 °C). The immunoprecipitated Ca2+-ATPase samples were washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline, solubilized in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE, electrophoresed in parallel with a supernatant sample, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the 5f10, PMCA1 or phospho-Ser/Thr PKA antibodies. Determination of Protein Kinase A Activity—PKA activity was determined using histone H8 as a substrate for potential kinases present in BLM. Briefly, the [γ-32P]phosphoryl group of radiolabeled ATP was transferred to the histone in an incubation medium consisting of 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.0), histone H8 (1.5 mg/ml), and BLM preparation (0.5 mg/ml) in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (7–10 μCi/μmol). After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml trichloroacetic acid (40% w/v), and the tubes were immediately placed in an ice bath. The content of each tube was filtered through 0.45-μm Millipore filters, which were then washed with 20% trichloroacetic acid and phosphate buffer (2 mm, pH 7.0) to remove the unused [γ-32P]ATP. The radioactivity incorporated into the histone was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 2100; Packard, Downers Grove, IL), and the PKA activity was measured as the difference between radioactivity incorporated in the presence and absence of 10 nm M PKAi, the 5-22 PKA inhibitor peptide. A control with 100 nm cAMP confirmed the association of PKA activity with the BLM. To investigate a possible direct, cAMP-independent effect of Cer on PKA, the same assay was carried out using purified PKA α-catalytic subunit instead of BLM. Determination of Protein Kinase C Activity—We used the same method described for the determination of PKA activity, but PKC activity was measured as the difference between tubes incubated in the absence and presence of 10 nm calphostin C (PKC inhibitor). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 1 pm), a phorbol ester, was also used to confirm the presence of functional PKC in the BLM fractions. Regulatory Phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase—Phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase was also determined as described recently (33Valverde R.H. Tortelote G.G. Lemos T. Mintz E. Vieyra A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30611-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The membranes were preincubated with the reaction medium employed to measure the Ca2+-ATPase activity (no ATP) in the presence of Cer (50 nm), PKAi (10 nm), and calphostin C (10 nm) in the combinations shown in the corresponding figure legends. The phosphorylation reaction in the PKA assays was started by adding 5 mm cold ATP. After 20 min the reaction (0.2 ml; 100 μg of BLM protein) was stopped by adding 50 μl of sample buffer (2.3 g of dithiothreitol, 3 g of SDS, 12 ml of 1.0 m Tris, pH 6.8, 15 ml of 10% glycerol in a 50-ml final volume in water), and 0.1 ml of the solubilized samples were applied to each slot for SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) as described above. The gel proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and phospho-Ser/Thr residues were recognized with the PKA substrate polyclonal antibody as described above. Phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase by PKC was assayed in the same medium employed for the PKA assay, except that [γ-32P]ATP (0.5–1 μCi/μmol) was used as follows. After electrophoresis and transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were exposed overnight to a phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA) to measure the intensity of the 140-kDa [32P]phosphorylated bands recognized by the 5f10 antibody. Phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase by the BLM-resident PKC was quantified by the difference in band intensities in the absence and presence of 10 nm calphostin C. Data Analysis—The means were compared by one-way analysis of variance, taking into account the treatment of experimental groups. The differences were evaluated using the multiple comparative Bonferroni test. In all cases the n values correspond to the results obtained from different BLM preparations, except for the purified PKA α-catalytic subunit assay. Linear regression analysis with errors in both variables was used to study the extent to which stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity in the presence of Cer correlates with Cer-induced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump. Fig. 1 (open circles) shows that increasing concentrations of Cer in the nanomolar range (pA ≈ 8.5) stimulate Ca2+-ATPase activity up to ∼50% over control. We also tested C1P, the phosphorylated derivative of Cer, which was ineffective in modulating Ca2+-ATPase activity (filled circles). The observed effect of Cer could be a consequence of structural changes in the membrane similar to those observed upon sphingomyelinase activation and Cer release (12Nurminen T.A. Holopainen J.M.

Pept. 2005; 127: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the following experiments were conducted to investigate whether the stimulatory effect of Cer on active Ca2+ transport in kidney involves PKA or PKC, two of the renal BLM-resident kinases (6Caruso-Neves C.

The observation (Fig. 2) that Ca2+-ATPase is no longer stimulated by Cer when peptide 5-22 (PKAi), the highly specific inhibitor of PKA, is added simultaneously supports the hypothesis that nanomolar Cer activates this type of protein kinase in kidney membranes and that stimulation of the Ca2+ pump is a consequence of triggering this signaling cascade. The ability of Cer to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase was therefore tested. Fig. 3 shows that Cer induces a 3-fold increase in PKA, saturating in the same concentration range as the effect on Ca2+-ATPase activity. This effect mimics that found with cAMP (hatched column in Fig. 3). However, because the effects of Cer and cAMP are additive (black column), it is clear that they both activate PKA but in different ways. The experiments presented in Fig. 4 show that Cer, in the concentration that promotes half-maximal activation of Ca2+-ATPase, strongly stimulates phosphorylation catalyzed by the purified PKA α-catalytic subunit, supporting the view that Cer activates PKA by a mechanism independent of cAMP.FIGURE 3Ceramide activates PKA in basolateral membranes: additive effect of cAMP. PKAi-inhibited kinase activity was determined in the absence or presence of Cer and cAMP in the combinations shown on the abscissa,as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PKA activity was measured as the difference between total phosphorylation and that measured in the presence of 10 nm PKA inhibitor (5-22 peptide).

Fig. 5 (A and C) shows that addition of 50 nm Cer promotes a PKAi-sensitive increase in the phosphorylation of a 140-kDa band detected by the specific phospho-Ser/Thr PKA antibody. The same 140-kDa band was shown to be Ca2+-ATPase by the specific antibody 5f10 (Fig. 5B). The fact that 10 nm of the PKA inhibitor completely abolishes stimulation of both Ca2+-ATPase and phosphorylation of the pump molecule in the presence of 50 nm Cer (compare Fig. 5 with Fig. 2) reinforces the view that activation of Ca2+ pumping activity requires phosphorylation.FIGURE 6Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is the 140-kDa target for ceramide-stimulated, PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Basolateral membranes were phosphorylated with cold ATP in the absence or presence of the Cer concentrations shown on the abscissa, and Ca2+-ATPase was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 5f10, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated sediments (IP) and supernatants (Sup), immunodetection of Ca2+-ATPase and of a specific phospho-Ser/Thr PKA substrate in Ca2+-ATPase was carried out on the same nitrocellulose membrane, using the 5f10 and phospho-Ser/Thr PKA substrate antibodies, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1991327065,"TIMAP (TGF-β1 inhibited, membrane-associated protein) is a prenylated, endothelial cell-predominant protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) regulatory subunit that localizes to the plasma membrane of filopodia. Here, we determined whether phosphorylation regulates TIMAP-associated PP1c function. Phosphorylation of TIMAP was observed in cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and was reduced by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). In cell-free assays, immunopurified TIMAP was phosphorylated by PKA and, after PKA priming, by GSK-3β. Site-specific Ser to Ala substitution identified amino acid residues Ser333/Ser337 as the likely PKA/GSK-3β phosphorylation site. Substitution of Ala for Val and Phe in the KVSF motif of TIMAP (TIMAPV64A/F66A) abolished PP1c binding and TIMAP-associated PP1c activity. TIMAPV64A/F66A was hyper-phosphorylated in cells, indicating that TIMAP-associated PP1c auto-dephosphorylates TIMAP. Constitutively active GSK-3β stimulated phosphorylation of TIMAPV64A/F66A, but not wild-type TIMAP, suggesting that the PKA/GSK-3β site may be subject to dephosphorylation by TIMAP-associated PP1c. Substitution of Asp or Glu for Ser at amino acid residues 333 and 337 to mimic phosphorylation reduced the PP1c association with TIMAP. Conversely, GSK-3 inhibitors augmented PP1c association with TIMAP-PP1c in cells. The 333/337 phosphomimic mutations also increased TIMAP-associated PP1c activity in vitro and against the non-integrin laminin receptor 1 in cells. Finally, TIMAP mutants with reduced PP1c activity strongly stimulated endothelial cell filopodia formation, an effect mimicked by the GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl. We conclude that TIMAP is a target for PKA-primed GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation. This phosphorylation controls TIMAP association and activity of PP1c, in turn regulating extension of filopodia in endothelial cells.

J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that includes PP2A, PP4-PP7, and calcineurin (PP2B). Ser/Thr phosphatases counteract essentially every signal involving Ser/Thr kinases, and like the kinases their activity is tightly regulated. Because of extreme sequence conservation (>90%) among PP1c isoforms, substrate- and location-specific actions are not inherent in PP1c itself but dictated by more than 50 PP1c regulatory (targeting) subunits (1Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, the myosin phosphatase-targeting (MYPT) subunits regulate muscle and non-muscle cell contraction through dephosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chains (2Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Most PP1c regulatory subunits share the PP1c binding motif RVXF, but their structures are otherwise diverse, serving in each case highly specific and localized functions (1Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit glycogen synthase kinase 3β wild-type transforming growth factor-β1 protein kinase A myosin phosphatase target/regulatory subunit amino acid(s) TGF-β1-inhibited membrane-associated protein laminin receptor 1 glomerular endothelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cell phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP immunoprecipitation 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit glycogen synthase kinase 3β wild-type transforming growth factor-β1 protein kinase A myosin phosphatase target/regulatory subunit amino acid(s) TGF-β1-inhibited membrane-associated protein laminin receptor 1 glomerular endothelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cell phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP immunoprecipitation 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The function of PP1c targeting subunits is regulated by changes in expression, by allosteric effects of substrates, and by phosphorylation (1Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation at or near the RVXF motif of NIPP-1 reduces PP1c binding, and phosphorylation elsewhere in the molecule can increase or decrease PP1c activity (3Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activity of the myosin II phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 is similarly regulated by phosphorylation (2Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 4Hirano K. Hirano M. Kanaide H. J. Smooth Muscle Res. 2004; 40: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We identified TIMAP (TGF-β1-inhibited, membrane-associated protein) as an endothelium-restricted PP1c regulatory subunit subject to TGF-β1-mediated transcriptional repression (5Cao W. Mattagajasingh S.N. Xu H. Kim K. Fierlbeck W. Deng J. Lowenstein C.J. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C327-CC37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TIMAP belongs to the MYPT family of PP1c regulatory subunits based on domain conservation in the N terminus where a PP1c binding motif is immediately followed by several ankyrin repeats (5Cao W. Mattagajasingh S.N. Xu H. Kim K. Fierlbeck W. Deng J. Lowenstein C.J. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C327-CC37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Within the MYPT family of PP1c-targeting subunits, TIMAP most closely resembles the domain structure of MYPT3 (6Skinner J.A. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Ito M. Nakano T. Erdodi F. Hartshorne D.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 259: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Both TIMAP and MYPT3 lack the C-terminal domain that confers myosin-binding activity and phosphorylation-dependent regulation in MYPT1 and its homologs (7Ito M. Nakano T. Erdodi F. Hartshorne D.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 259: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Also, by contrast to other MYPT family members, TIMAP and MYPT3 are prenylated at their C terminus, allowing for interaction with the plasma membrane (5Cao W. Mattagajasingh S.N. Xu H. Kim K.

J. 2001; 356: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and its associated PP1c activity against myosin light chain 2 in cells is stimulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation at Ser353 (9Yong J. Tan I. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31202-31211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Currently, it is not known whether TIMAP can act as a myosin light chain phosphatase-targeting subunit. However, we have previously shown that TIMAP associates with the plasma membrane of endothelial cell filopodia, where it interacts with, and serves to dephosphorylate the non-integrin laminin receptor 1 (LAMR1) (8Kim K.

The LAMR1 also serves as the receptor that binds and internalizes endogenous prion and Doppel proteins (14Gauczynski S. Peyrin J.M. Haïk S. Leucht C. Hundt C. Rieger R. Krasemann S. Deslys J.P.

Biophys. 2004; 428: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought evidence for regulation of TIMAP/PP1c by phosphorylation. We find that TIMAP is phosphorylated by PKA and, after PKA priming, by GSK-3β. Furthermore, phosphorylation by GSK-3β regulates both the association of PP1c with TIMAP and its activity in vitro and in cells. Mutations of TIMAP that reduce its associated PP1c activity markedly change the organization of endothelial cell filopodia. The data indicate that TIMAP function is regulated by PKA/GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and that TIMAP may function in the formation of endothelial cell filopodia. Materials—All chemicals and enzymes were of reagent grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada, unless otherwise specified. Chicken anti-TIMAP antibody was custom-prepared by Avis Laboratories (Tigard, OR) (8Kim K. Li L. Kozlowski K. Suh H.S. Cao W. Ballermann B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-TIMAP antibodies were prepared as previously described (5Cao W. Mattagajasingh S.N. Xu H. Kim K. Fierlbeck W. Deng J. Lowenstein C.J. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C327-CC37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-PP1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Purified, recombinant PP1cα was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Cells and Cell Culture—Primary bovine glomerular endothelial (GEN) cells were prepared as described previously (16Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C182-C189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% calf serum, 2 μg/ml heparin, 8.0 μg/ml bovine brain extract (Cambrex BioScience, Walkersville, MD), and penicillin/streptomycin. To assess GEN filopodia formation, the cells were plated sparsely on laminin-1-coated coverslips after transient transfection with TIMAP mutants and assessed 48 h later. MDCK and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. In some experiments GEN cells were treated with LiCl (5, 10, or 20 mm) for up to 4 h. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The plasma membrane was stained with 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Invitrogen). The density of filopodia was assessed by counting projections from cells that extended >2 μm from their base at the plasma membrane. For each condition and time point, between 25 and 50 cells were counted in each of three replicate wells. Statistical analysis was by analysis of variance. TIMAP Constructs, Mutants, and Transfection—The full-length cDNA of bovine TIMAP (GenBank™ accession number AF362909) was cloned into the pBlueScript SKII(+) (pBS-bTIMAP). A cDNA, TIMAPWT encoding the full open reading frame, was PCR-amplified from pBS-bTIMAP with primers 5′-CGCAGGTACCACCATGGGGCCAGCCACGTGGACCTGCTGACC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTAGGAGATGCGGCAGCAGCCAT-3′, in which KpnI and ECoR I (underlined) are integrated for cloning and one Kozak consensus sequence (bold) is added to enhance expression in mammalian cells. The PCR product was directly cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Fidelity was verified by full insert sequencing. This clone, designated pcDNA3.1-TIMAPWT, was used to generate several TIMAP mutants using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). EGFP epitope-tagged TIMAP mutants were produced similarly, using the pEGFP-TIMAPWT construct previously described (5Cao W. Mattagajasingh S.N. Xu H. Kim K. Fierlbeck W. Deng J. Lowenstein C.J. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C327-CC37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as template. Primers used for specific mutations are listed in Table 1. Briefly, PCR was carried out in a 50-μl reaction using 20 ng of the pcDNA3.1-TIMAPWT template, 100 ng of each primer carrying the mutation, 10 nmol of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of PfuUtral DNA polymerase in polymerase reaction buffer. For PCR, initial denaturation was at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 12 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min. Two microliters of the DpnI-treated PCR reaction was used to transform XL1-Blue supercompetent cells.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and scraped from culture plates into cold immunoprecipitation (IP)-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and Complete protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science). To protect phosphorylated sites, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 nm calyculin A were included in lysis buffer. Cells were homogenized on ice and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with chicken anti-TIMAP antibodies, chicken anti-LAMR1 antibodies (8Kim K. Li L. Kozlowski K. Suh H.S. Cao W. Ballermann B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), or equal amounts of control chicken IgY for 1 h at 4 °C. Goat anti-chicken IgG-coated beads (Aves) were then added followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, washed twice with IP wash buffer I (cold lysis buffer), twice with IP wash buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), and once with IP wash buffer III (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). The beads were then re-suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. The supernatants were fractionated on 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were probed with various antibodies, and detection was achieved with ECL chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare, UK). Metabolic Labeling—Upon reaching 80-90% confluency, cells were washed three times with serum-free, phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), and then incubated in the same phosphate-free medium for 1 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μCi/ml [32P]H3PO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 5 h. During the last 30 min of incubation, 100 nm calyculin A (Upstate, Waltham, MA) was added in some experiments. In experiments examining the dephosphorylation of LAMR1, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, as previously described (8Kim K. Li L. Kozlowski K. Suh H.S. Cao W. Ballermann B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in cold IP-lysis buffer containing complete proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times as described, except that all IP wash buffers also contained 20 nm okadaic acid, and IP wash buffer III contained 0.1% SDS. Beads were then suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, followed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gels were transferred to PDVF membranes, and subjected to autoradiography. Subsequent immunoblotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-TIMAP antibody served to detect loading. In Vitro Dephosphorylation by Recombinant PP1cα—TIMAP immunoprecipitates were prepared from [32P]H3PO4 metabolically labeled GEN cells that had been treated with 100 nm calyculin A during the last 30 min of the labeling period. To preserve TIMAP phosphorylation, cell lysates and TIMAP precipitates were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. They were then washed five times with IP wash buffer without phosphatase inhibitors and divided into four aliquots. The samples were incubated in 500 μl of PP1c reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 1 mm MnCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C, either in buffer alone or with 0.8 unit of recombinant PP1cα in the absence or presence of the PP1c-specific inhibitor-2 (4 μg, New England Biolabs) or 600 nm calyculin A. TIMAP was then eluted from the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to autoradiography and Western blot analyses. In Vitro Kinase Assay—TIMAP was immunoprecipitated from GEN, MDCK, or COS7 cells transfected with TIMAP as described, except that phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from the lysis and wash buffers. The TIMAP immobilized on beads was washed once with the appropriate kinase reaction buffer. The beads were then incubated with 500 units of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs, reaction buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 pH 7.5), 100 ng of GSK-3α (Upstate, reaction buffer: 8 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA), 500 units of GSK-3β (New England Biolabs, reaction buffer: 20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5), 2500 units of PKA catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs, reaction buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2), or 12.5 ng of protein kinase C catalytic fragment (Biomol, reaction buffer: 40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) all in the presence of 200 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity, 800 μCi/μm) at 30 °C for 60 min in a volume of 30 μl. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with IP-lysis buffer I, containing phosphatase inhibitors. TIMAP was eluted in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. For primed GSK-3 in vitro phosphorylation studies, the TIMAP immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2500 units of PKA for 5 h at 30 °C in PKA reaction buffer containing 10 μm unlabeled ATP. The samples were then heated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate PKA, washed once with GSK-3 reaction buffer, and divided into three or four portions, as appropriate. The aliquots were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with buffer alone or GSK-3α or -3β in GSK-3 reaction buffer containing 5 μm ATP and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with cold IP-wash buffer I containing phosphatase inhibitors, and proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel), blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to autoradiography and Western blot analyses. PP1c Activity in Vitro—TIMAP-associated PP1c activity was measured using the small fluorogenic substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which, when cleaved by PP1c, generates fluorescent 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl with excitation/emission maxima at 358/452 nm. TIMAP immunoprecipitates were prepared from the COS7 cells transfected with vector alone, TIMAPWT, or various TIMAP mutants. Each immunoprecipitate was divided into two portions, one to quantify PP1c activity, the other for Western blot analysis. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 50 μm 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate in 100 μl of PP1c reaction buffer for 90 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence was measured at 460 nm every 5 min using a Fluoroskan Ascent fluorometer (ThermoLabsystems, Ramsey, MN). Recombinant PP1cα (0.05 unit) and buffer alone served as a positive or negative control, respectively. Addition of calyculin A (250 nm) to the same samples was used to show specificity. Background, determined from samples prepared identically from vector-transfected cells was subtracted. TIMAP Is Phosphorylated in Living Cells—When endogenous TIMAP was immunoprecipitated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled GEN cells, a 32P-labeled band with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa was observed (Fig. 1A). Similarly, in MDCK cells that lack endogenous TIMAP, 32P was incorporated into TIMAP that was overexpressed, and then immunoprecipitated. That the 32P-labeled ∼65-kDa band represents TIMAP was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal anti-TIMAP antibody (Fig. 1A). Therefore, both endogenous and overexpressed TIMAP are phosphorylated in cells. PKA Phosphorylates TIMAP in Vivo and in Vitro—In silico analysis of the TIMAP aa sequence with NetPhos2.0 (17Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) predicted 32 possible phosphorylation sites (21 Ser, 6 Thr, and 5 Tyr). Two prominent potential phosphorylation clusters were predicted in the intervals from residues 324 to 352 and 505 to 534 of TIMAP. In silico analysis with MacVector 7.2.2 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) suggested that TIMAP may be a substrate for casein kinase II, GSK-3, PKA, and protein kinase C (data not shown). When MDCK cells forced to overexpress TIMAPWT were treated with the PKA inhibitor H89 and/or the GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl during the last 30 min of 32P metabolic labeling, incorporation of 32P into TIMAP was significantly and reproducibly reduced compared with TIMAP from cells not exposed to inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis showed that TIMAP phosphorylation was reduced by 21 ± 2.9, 27 ± 3.4, and 53 ± 2.6 compared with control (mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.01) in the presence of H89, LiCl, or both, respectively. Not shown, the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (200 nm), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (12 μm) had no discernable effect on 32P incorporation by TIMAP in MDCK cells. Hence, PKA and GSK-3 were considered to be candidate kinases for TIMAP phosphorylation. TIMAP was immunopurified from both GEN and MDCK cells to determine whether it can serve as a substrate in vitro for those kinases predicted by in silico analysis. Not shown, when phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from the IP-lysis and wash buffers, the 32P label was lost from TIMAP during the IP process. Therefore, phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from TIMAP immunoprecipitation buffers for the in vitro phosphorylation studies. Shown in Fig. 1C, no phosphorylation of TIMAP was observed in vitro in the absence of added kinase, indicating that no active, TIMAP-directed kinase was co-precipitated with TIMAP. Significant phosphorylation in vitro was observed in the presence of PKA, but not with casein kinase II, protein kinase C, GSK-3α, or GSK-3β (Fig. 1C). The in vitro phosphorylation of immunopurified TIMAP was significantly reduced by the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 1D), in keeping with a specific PKA-mediated phosphorylation. GSK-3β, Not-3α, Phosphorylates TIMAP after a PKA Priming Phosphorylation—For most GSK-3 substrates, efficient phosphorylation by GSK-3 requires a priming phosphorylation by other kinases (18Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The lack of TIMAP phosphorylation by GSK-3α and GSK-3β in vitro (Fig. 1C) could therefore be due to the absence of a priming phosphorylation. Because PKA strongly phosphorylates TIMAP in vitro (Fig. 1C), it seemed plausible that PKA might serve as a priming kinase for GSK-3α or GSK-3β. As shown in Fig. 1E, when immunoprecipitated TIMAP was treated with GSK-3β in vitro, in the presence of [32P]ATP, TIMAP was phosphorylated, as long as this step was preceded by a PKA-priming phosphorylation, done with unlabeled ATP. By contrast, GSK-3α did not phosphorylate PKA-primed TIMAP. Also, no 32P incorporation was observed when TIMAP was incubated with [32P]ATP in buffer lacking GSK-3 kinases, indicating that the phosphorylation observed in the presence of GSK-3β was not due to residual activity of the heat-inactivated PKA (Fig. 1E). Thus, GSK-3β but not GSK-3α can phosphorylate TIMAP in vitro, but only after PKA priming. Identification of One GSK-3β Phosphorylation Site—A potential GSK-3β phosphorylation site (Ser333) was identified by MacVector 7.2.2. The GSK-3 consensus sequence Ser/Thr-X-X-X-Ser/Thr-P (18Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) contained within this region of TIMAP is Ser333-Arg-Arg-Thr-Ser337, where Ser337 would serve as the potential PKA priming site, and Ser333 as the potential GSK-3β phosphorylation site (Fig. 2A). A deletion mutant of TIMAP, lacking residues 324-381, containing this site was created and transfected transiently into COS7 cells. This deletion reduced TIMAP phosphorylation to nearly undetectable levels (Fig. 2B). Single or dual Ser to Ala mutations were then introduced at residues 333 (TIMAPS333A) and 337 (TIMAPS337A) and both 333 and 337 (TIMAPS333A/S337A). Immunoprecipitation of the transiently expressed TIMAPS333A, TIMAPS337A, or TIMAPS333A/S337A from COS7 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate showed that these mutations significantly blunt phosphorylation of TIMAP when compared with TIMAPWT (Fig. 2"
