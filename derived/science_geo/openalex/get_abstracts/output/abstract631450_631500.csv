We examined associations between screen-time on pre-school behavior using data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study.CHILD participant parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at five-years of age. Parents reported their child's total screen-time including gaming and mobile devices. Screen-time was categorized using the recommended threshold of two-hours/day for five-years or one-hour/day for three-years. Multiple linear regression examined associations between screen-time and externalizing behavior (e.g. inattention and aggression). Multiple logistic regression identified characteristics of children at risk for clinically significant externalizing problems (CBCL T-score≥65).Screen-time was available for over 95% of children (2,322/2,427) with CBCL data. Mean screen-time was 1·4 hours/day (95%CI 1·4, 1·5) at five-years and 1·5 hours/day (95%CI: 1·5, 1·6) at three-years. Compared to children with less than 30-minutes/day screen-time, those watching more than two-hours/day (13·7%) had a 2·2-point increase in externalizing T-score (95%CI: 0·9, 3·5, p≤0·001); a five-fold increased odd for reporting clinically significant externalizing problems (95%CI: 1·0, 25·0, p = 0·05); and were 5·9 times more likely to report clinically significant inattention problems (95%CI: 1·6, 21·5, p = 0·01). Children with a DSM-5 ADHD T-score above the 65 clinical cut-off were considered to have significant ADHD type symptoms (n = 24). Children with more than 2-hours of screen-time/day had a 7·7-fold increased risk of meeting criteria for ADHD (95%CI: 1·6, 38·1, p = 0·01). There was no significant association between screen-time and aggressive behaviors (p>0.05).Increased screen-time in pre-school is associated with worse inattention problems."
https://openalex.org/W2936472395,"Understanding the mechanism of small molecules is a critical challenge in chemical biology and drug discovery. Medicinal chemistry is essential for elucidating drug mechanism, enabling variation of small molecule structure to gain structure-activity relationships (SARs). However, the development of complementary approaches that systematically vary target protein structure could provide equally informative SARs for investigating drug mechanism and protein function. Here we explore the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to profile the interactions between lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and chemical inhibitors in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through this approach, termed CRISPR-suppressor scanning, we elucidate drug mechanism of action by showing that LSD1 enzyme activity is not required for AML survival and that LSD1 inhibitors instead function by disrupting interactions between LSD1 and the transcription factor GFI1B on chromatin. Our studies clarify how LSD1 inhibitors mechanistically operate in AML and demonstrate how CRISPR-suppressor scanning can uncover novel aspects of target biology."
https://openalex.org/W2939444766,"Clouds persistently engulf many tropical mountains at elevations cool enough for clouds to form, creating isolated areas with frequent fog and mist. Under these isolated conditions, thousands of unique species have evolved in what are known as tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) and páramo. Páramo comprises a set of alpine ecosystems that occur above TMCF from about 11° N to 9° S along the Americas continental divide. TMCF occur on all continents and island chains with tropical climates and mountains and are increasingly threatened by climate and land-use change. Climate change could impact a primary feature distinguishing these ecosystems, cloud immersion. But where and in what direction cloud immersion of TMCF and páramo will change with climate are fundamental unknowns. Prior studies at a few TMCF sites suggest that cloud immersion will increase in some places while declining in others. Other unknowns include the extent of deforestation in protected and unprotected cloud forest climatic zones, and deforestation extent compared with projected climate change. Here we use a new empirical approach combining relative humidity, frost, and novel application of maximum watershed elevation to project change in TMCF and páramo for Representative greenhouse gas emissions Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Results suggest that in <25–45 yr, 70–86% of páramo will dry or be subject to tree invasion, and cloud immersion declines will shrink or dry 57–80% of Neotropical TMCF, including 100% of TMCF across Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, much of Northern South America, and parts of Southeast Brazil. These estimates rise to 86% of Neotropical TMCF and 98% of páramo in <45–65 yr if greenhouse gas emissions continue rising throughout the 21st century. We also find that TMCF zones are largely forested, but some of the most deforested areas will undergo the least climate change. We project that cloud immersion will increase for only about 1% of all TMCF and in only a few places. Declines in cloud immersion dominate TMCF change across the Neotropics."

https://openalex.org/W2937428609,"Differentiating actions of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) at free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) from other free fatty acid-responsive receptors and from non-receptor-mediated effects has been challenging. Using a novel chemogenetic and knock-in strategy, whereby an engineered variant of FFA2 (FFA2-DREADD) that is unresponsive to natural SCFAs but is instead activated by sorbic acid replaced the wild-type receptor, we determined that activation of FFA2 in differentiated adipocytes and colonic crypt enteroendocrine cells of mouse accounts fully for SCFA-regulated lipolysis and release of the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively. In vivo studies confirmed the specific role of FFA2 in GLP-1 release and also demonstrated a direct role for FFA2 in accelerating gut transit. Thereby, we establish the general principle that such a chemogenetic knock-in strategy can successfully define novel G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) biology and provide both target validation and establish therapeutic potential of a 'hard to target' GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2937136418,"We have recently shown that sperm attachment to bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs) triggers uterine local innate immunity with induction of a pro-inflammatory response in vitro, however details of the mechanism remain unknown. Here, we investigated the involvement of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) pathway in mediating sperm-BEECs inflammatory process. Immunohistochemistry of the uterine tissue revealed that TLR2 and TLR4 proteins were present in the luminal and glandular epithelia of bovine endometrium. Moreover, BEECs monolayers were treated with TLR2 agonist (Pam; 0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) or TLR4 agonist (LPS; 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h, followed by evaluating mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory genes (TNFA, IL-1B, IL-8, and PGES) in BEECs using a real-time PCR. Both Pam and LPS treatments showed a dose-dependent stimulation of mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory genes. To elucidate the functional role of TLR2/4 in sperm-BEECs interaction, BEECs monolayers were incubated with either TLR2 antagonist or TLR4 antibody for 2 h prior to the co-culture with sperm for 3 h. Importantly, pre-incubation of BEECs with TLR2 antagonist or TLR4 antibody prevented the stimulatory effect of sperm on the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in BEECs. Furthermore, sperm increased the phosphorylation levels of TLR2/4 downstream targets (p38MAPK and JNK) in BEECs within 1 h of the co-culture. Treatment of BEECs with TLR2 antagonist prior to sperm addition inhibited JNK phosphorylation, while TLR4 antibody inhibited the phosphorylation of both p38MAPK and JNK. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings strongly suggest that bovine endometrial epithelial cells respond to sperm via TLR2/4 signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2940373590,"People interpret verbal expressions of probabilities (e.g. ‘very likely’) in different ways, yet words are commonly preferred to numbers when communicating uncertainty. Simply providing numerical translations alongside reports or text containing verbal probabilities should encourage consistency, but these guidelines are often ignored. In an online experiment with 924 participants, we compared four different formats for presenting verbal probabilities with the numerical guidelines used in the US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 to see whether any could improve the correspondence between the intended meaning and participants’ interpretation (‘in-context’). This extends previous work in the domain of climate science. The four experimental conditions we tested were: 1. numerical guidelines bracketed in text, e.g. X is very unlikely (05–20%), 2. click to see the full guidelines table in a new window, 3. numerical guidelines appear in a mouse over tool tip, and 4. no guidelines provided (control). Results indicate that correspondence with the ICD 203 standard is substantially improved only when numerical guidelines are bracketed in text. For this condition, average correspondence was 66%, compared with 32% in the control. We also elicited ‘context-free’ numerical judgements from participants for each of the seven verbal probability expressions contained in ICD 203 (i.e., we asked participants what range of numbers they, personally, would assign to those expressions), and constructed ‘evidence-based lexicons’ based on two methods from similar research, ‘membership functions’ and ‘peak values’, that reflect our large sample’s intuitive translations of the terms. Better aligning the intended and assumed meaning of fuzzy words like ‘unlikely’ can reduce communication problems between the reporter and receiver of probabilistic information. In turn, this can improve decision making under uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W2938562409,"The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing responses is a central goal of HIV research. Recently, we elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses against the N terminus of the fusion peptide (FP), a critical component of the HIV-entry machinery. While the consistency of the elicited cross-clade neutralizing responses was good in mice, it was poor in guinea pigs: after seven immunizations comprising either envelope (Env) trimer or FP coupled to a carrier, serum from only one of five animals could neutralize a majority of a cross-clade panel of 19 wild-type strains. Such a low response rate-only 20%-made increasing consistency an imperative. Here, we show that additional Env-trimer immunizations could boost broad FP-directed neutralizing responses in a majority of immunized animals. The first boost involved a heterologous Env trimer developed from the transmitted founder clade C strain of donor CH505, and the second boost involved a cocktail that combined the CH505 trimer with a trimer from the BG505 strain. After boosting, sera from three of five animals neutralized a majority of the 19-strain panel and serum from a fourth animal neutralized 8 strains. We demonstrate that cross-reactive serum neutralization targeted the FP by blocking neutralization with soluble fusion peptide. The FP competition revealed two categories of elicited responses: an autologous response to the BG505 strain of high potency (~10,000 ID50), which was not competed by soluble FP, and a heterologous response of lower potency, which was competed by soluble FP. While the autologous response could increase rapidly in response to Env-trimer boost, the heterologous neutralizing response increased more slowly. Overall, repetitive Env-trimer immunizations appeared to boost low titer FP-carrier primed responses to detectable levels, yielding cross-clade neutralization. The consistent trimer-boosted neutralizing responses described here add to accumulating evidence for the vaccine utility of the FP site of HIV vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2939630849,"Protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa actively move through tissue to initiate and perpetuate infection. The regulation of parasite motility relies on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, but how these kinases are activated remains unknown. Here, using an array of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we show that the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii expresses a large guanylate cyclase (TgGC) protein, which contains several upstream ATPase transporter-like domains. We show that TgGC has a dynamic localization, being concentrated at the apical tip in extracellular parasites, which then relocates to a more cytosolic distribution during intracellular replication. Conditional TgGC knockdown revealed that this protein is essential for acute-stage tachyzoite growth, as TgGC-deficient parasites were defective in motility, host cell attachment, invasion, and subsequent host cell egress. We show that TgGC is critical for a rapid rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] and for secretion of microneme organelles upon stimulation with a cGMP agonist, but these deficiencies can be bypassed by direct activation of signaling by a Ca2+ ionophore. Furthermore, we found that TgGC is required for transducing changes in extracellular pH and [K+] to activate cytosolic [Ca2+] flux. Together, the results of our work implicate TgGC as a putative signal transducer that activates Ca2+ signaling and motility in Toxoplasma.

Together, the results of our work implicate TgGC as a putative signal transducer that activates Ca2+ signaling and motility in Toxoplasma. The phylum Apicomplexa comprises a group of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites of wide medical and agricultural significance. Plasmodium spp. cause malaria, Cryptosporidium spp. induce severe gastrointestinal disease, and Toxoplasma infection leads to toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma is transmitted by ingestion of oocysts shed from an infected cat or consumption of meat harboring cyst forms. Toxoplasma then differentiates in the gut into the acute tachyzoite forms that traverse the intestinal barrier. Toxoplasma disseminates throughout the body, causing flu-like symptoms in healthy adults; however, infection during pregnancy can lead to massive tissue destruction in the developing fetus, resulting in abortion and neurological defects, or severe disease in immunodeficient individuals. Acute stages can then differentiate into chronic bradyzoite forms, which occurs in the central nervous system and muscle, creating a life-long untreatable reservoir for reactivation later in life. Latent infection of the retina can also lead to progressive blindness, which is particularly prevalent in some countries (1Dubey J.P. Lago E.G. Gennari S.M. Su C. Jones J.L. Toxoplasmosis in humans and animals in Brazil: high prevalence, high burden of disease, and epidemiology.Parasitology. 2012; 139 (22776427): 1375-142410.1017/S0031182012000765Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Central to transmission and survival of all apicomplexan species in their hosts is their ability to move through tissue and invade host cells. Parasite movement is driven by a unique form of cellular locomotion termed “gliding motility.” Gliding motility is propelled by an actomyosin-based motor, termed the “glideosome,” which lies underneath the plasma membrane (2Frénal K. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. Soldati-Favre D. Gliding motility powers invasion and egress in Apicomplexa.Nat. Rev. 2017; 15 (28867819): 645-66010.1038/nrmicro.2017.86Google Scholar, 3Tardieux I. Baum J.

The glideosome binds to short cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane adhesins, which then attach to host cell receptors or the extracellular matrix. The current model suggests that the glideosome generates force for motility by dragging transmembrane adhesins through the plane of the membrane to the rear of the parasite, thus driving forward movement (2Frénal K. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. Soldati-Favre D. Gliding motility powers invasion and egress in Apicomplexa.Nat. Rev. 2017; 15 (28867819): 645-66010.1038/nrmicro.2017.86Google Scholar, 3Tardieux I. Baum J.

Upon appropriate environmental cues, Toxoplasma, like all apicomplexan parasites, must activate motility. Environmental cues regulate the release of adhesins from the microneme organelles onto the parasite surface and activate the glideosome. In Toxoplasma, gliding motility and microneme secretion can be stimulated upon exposure to lower extracellular [K+], an acidic (high [H+]) environment, and extracellular phosphatidic acid (ePA) 2The abbreviations used are: ePAextracellular phosphatidic acidPLP-1perforin-like protein 1[Ca2+]cytcytosolic [Ca2+]GCguanylate cyclaseBIPPO5-benzyl-3-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-oneGCaMP6circularly permuted GFP-calmodulin-M13 peptide 6PDEphosphodiesteraseCDPKcalcium-dependent protein kinaseTgT. gondiiPKGprotein kinase GPAphosphatidic acidcKDconditional knockdownHADhaloacid dehalogenaseTMtransmembraneHAhemagglutininIFAimmunofluorescence assayIMCinner membrane complexPMplasma membraneATcanhydrotetracyclineHTRFhomogeneous time-resolved fluorescenceICBintracellular bufferMFImean fluorescence intensityECBextracellular bufferHFFhuman foreskin fibroblastDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleFUDR5-fluorodeoxyuridine.

Changes in [K+] are thought to be a marker of perturbations in the electrochemical gradient, as likely experienced upon host cell damage or when exposed to the extracellular milieu. A drop in vacuolar pH, in contrast, has been proposed to be a signal of host lysosomal fusion but also may be a parasite-induced phenomenon to activate perforin-like protein 1 (PLP-1), which is required for egress (6Roiko M.S.

In Toxoplasma, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling appears to act upstream of Ca2+ signaling and is required to activate motility as well as a range of other developmental transitions (24Brochet M.

In other systems, the magnitude and duration of cGMP signaling are dictated by the balance between production by guanylate cyclases (GCs) and its degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In mammalian cells, GC activation is often coupled with hormone receptors and is classically known as a central mediator of nitric oxide sensing and transduction. cGMP-binding effectors in Apicomplexa appear to be limited to protein kinase G (PKG), and there is a noticeable lack of cGMP-gated ion channels that provide a link with Ca2+ signaling in mammalian systems (26Baker D.A.

In Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, cGMP signaling also regulates phosphoinositide signaling, which is necessary for the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), which is required for microneme secretion (24Brochet M.

Thus, cGMP appears to be important for both induction of Ca2+ signaling and the production of intracellular pools of phospholipid species, both of which are required to activate motility. Despite an emerging understanding of signaling modules and their interconnectedness, it remains a mystery how apicomplexan parasites sense their external environment to activate intracellular signaling. Although apicomplexans appear to be devoid of G protein–coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, they do contain nucleotide cyclases with accessory domains that suggest that production of both cGMP and cyclic AMP (cAMP) might be triggered in cis (26Baker D.A. Drought L.G. Flueck C. Nofal S.D. Patel A. Penzo M. Walker E.M. Cyclic nucleotide signalling in malaria parasites.Open Biol. 2017; 7 (29263246): 17021310.1098/rsob.170213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of particular note is the presence of ATPase-like domains that are predicted to be involved in ionic sensing/transport. In this regard, GC in Plasmodium, which contains such accessory domains, is required for motility of ookinete stages (32Moon R.W. Taylor C.J. Bex C. Schepers R. Goulding D. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Baker D.A. Billker O. A cyclic GMP signalling module that regulates gliding motility in a malaria parasite.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5 (19779564): e100059910.1371/journal.ppat.1000599Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but the importance of such a protein in Toxoplasma or in the disease-causing asexual stages of other apicomplexan species is not fully explored. Here, we functionally characterize a putative GC during lytic-stage growth in Toxoplasma. TgGC is a very large transmembrane protein (∼477 kDa) and contains multiple accessory domains that could act in environmental sensing. We demonstrate that TgGC has a dynamic positioning, localizing to the apical end in actively motile forms, which is redistributed to a more disperse cytosolic localization during intracellular replication. We demonstrate that TgGC is critically required for Toxoplasma egress, attachment, invasion, motility, and microneme secretion and furthermore is needed for production of PA and activation of a rise in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, we determine that TgGC is important for sensing changes in environmental [K+] and pH, thus highlighting the importance of this protein in detecting extracellular signals required for activation of motility. We were interested in determining how Toxoplasma senses its external environment to activate motility. Toxoplasma has one predicted guanylate cyclase (TgGC; TGGT1_254370), with 19 transmembrane domains and a predicted size of 477 kDa (Fig. 1A). TgGC includes multiple predicted accessory domains, including (from N to C terminus) an E1–E2-like Ca2+-ATPase domain, a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase domain adjoined to another ATPase-like region, and a nucleotide cyclase domain split in two by a large insertion (Fig. 1A). Classic P-type ATPases are composed of two sets of TM domains followed by a group of six TM domains. This feature is shared with the N-terminal ATPase domain in TgGC. The C-terminal cyclase domain structurally resembles mammalian membrane-associated adenylyl cyclases, which are composed of two sets of six TM domains and downstream cytosolic cyclase catalytic domains (C1 and C2 domains). The C1 and C2 regions of TgGC are highly conserved but are inverted in order as compared with mammalian adenylyl cyclases. In its C2 domain, the two amino acids (Glu-2987 and Ala-3137) that are characteristic of guanylate cyclases are present, suggesting that this protein is specific for the production of cGMP (33Sunahara R.K.

Orthologues of TgGC have been identified in ciliates and other apicomplexan parasites, which vary somewhat in their domain architecture (35Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Krüger T. Plattner H.

To investigate the function and localization of TgGC, we generated two epitope-tagged lines by genetic modification at the endogenous locus. A Ty tag was introduced to the C terminus of TgGC (TgGC-Ty) (Fig. S1), and in a separate line we appended three tandem HA epitope sequences to the N terminus of TgGC as part of generating a conditional knockdown by promoter replacement (HA-TgGC cKD) (Fig. S1). We then performed Western blots on extracellular parasites, staining with antibodies specific to appended epitope tags (Fig. 1, B and C). We observed several species migrating at ∼65 (most prominent), ∼110, and above 250 kDa in TgGC-Ty (Fig. 1B, panel i), whereas HA-TgGC cKD showed species at ∼50, ∼80, ∼120, and above 250 kDa (Fig. 1B, panel ii).

https://openalex.org/W2938279459,"The androgen receptor (AR) is often activated in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen-ablative therapy because of the activation of cellular pathways that stimulate the AR despite low androgen levels. In many of these tumors, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is activated. Previous studies have shown that PKA can synergize with low levels of androgen to enhance androgen signaling and consequent cell proliferation, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the mechanism by which PKA causes AR stimulation in the presence of low/no androgen is not established yet. Here, using immunofluorescence immunoblotting assays, co-immunoprecipitation, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that PKA activation is necessary for the phosphorylation of heat shock protein (HSP90) that binds to unliganded AR in the cytoplasm, restricting its entry into the nucleus. We also found that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Thr89 residue in HSP90 releases AR from HSP90, enabling AR binding to HSP27 and its migration into the nucleus. Substitution of the Thr89 in HSP90 prevented its phosphorylation by PKA and significantly reduced AR transactivation and cellular proliferation. We further observed that the transcription of AR target genes, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is also lowered in the HSP90 Thr89 variant. These results suggest that using a small-molecule inhibitor against the HSP90 Thr89 residue in conjunction with existing androgen-ablative therapy may be more effective than androgen-ablative therapy alone in the treatment of prostate cancer patients.

Their role in the emergence and progression of prostate cancer was demonstrated by seminal studies of Huggins and Hodges (2Huggins C. Hodges C.V. Studies on prostatic cancer. I.

Since then, endocrine therapies aiming to physically or chemically inhibit androgen signaling, by reducing circulating androgen levels and/or blocking the AR activation, constitute the primary treatment option for prostate cancer patients (3Denis L.J. Griffiths K. Endocrine treatment in prostate cancer.Semin. Surg. Oncol. 2000; 18 (10617897): 52-7410.1002/(SICI)1098-2388(200001/02)18:1%3C52::AID-SSU8%3E3.0.CO;2–6Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although these therapies result in a temporary shrinkage of tumor mass, the cancer inevitably reappears in a more aggressive, androgen-independent form known as androgen-independent (AI) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite decades of intense basic and clinical research, no treatment options are available for AI prostate cancer. androgen receptor androgen response element androgen-independent castration-resistant prostate cancer G protein–coupled receptor protein kinase A regulatory catalytic ligand-binding domain fetal bovine serum 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate PKA-specific siRNA. Studies reveal that despite low circulating androgen levels, the AR is activated and often expressed at higher levels in CRPC patients (4Lonergan P.E. Tindall D.J.

The transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent phenotype is attributed to a complex interplay of signaling molecules that ultimately result in aberrant androgen signaling and proliferation of tumor cells. In the absence of androgens, stimulation of tumor growth may be caused by various growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, interleukin-6, or neuropeptides, such as bombesin- and gastrin-releasing peptides (5Sarwar M. Persson J.L. The protein kinase A (PKA) intracellular pathway and androgen receptor: a novel mechanism underlying the castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer.J. Cancer Sci. Ther. 2011; S5 (003)10.4172/1948-5956.S5-003PubMed Google Scholar). The AI stage is often associated with an increased expression of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediators of diverse cellular responses to extracellular molecules (6Kasbohm E.A. Guo R. Yowell C.W. Bagchi G. Kelly P. Arora P. Casey P.J. Daaka Y. Androgen receptor activation by Gs signaling in prostate cancer cells.J. Biol.

Further, the expression of GPCR ligands, such as follicle-stimulating hormone, endothelin 1, and neuropeptides, is also higher in the prostate tumor. The higher expression of both the GPCRs and their ligands in the tumor samples indicates that probably the receptors are in the “on” state in these cells and somehow contribute to the initiation or progression of the disease. Activated GPCRs mediate their signals via G proteins that belong to four groups: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. Whereas Gq regulates the activity of phospholipases and intracellular Calcium levels, G12 regulates low-molecular weight effectors, such as the Rho GTPases. The Gs and Gi primarily regulate adenylyl cyclases that synthesize cAMP, which in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA) (7Merkle D. Hoffmann R.

Signal. 2011; 23 (20813184): 507-51510.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PKA consists of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic kinase subunits (C) (8Chin K.V.

In the inactive state, the R subunits dimerize and bind to the C subunits, whereas binding of cAMP to the R subunits causes a conformational change, releasing the free and active C subunit that phosphorylates numerous cellular targets. Studies reveal that PKA/cAMP plays a significant role in prostate cell growth and proliferation (7Merkle D. Hoffmann R.

PKA I is overexpressed in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, and in patients with advanced prostate cancer, PKA RI overexpression was observed in 17.5% of the men and correlated significantly with poor patient outcome. Further, PKA RI overexpression predicted distal metastasis and biochemical failure in prostate cancer patients, highlighting a relationship between PKA signaling and progression to CRPC (9Khor L.Y.

The AR is a nuclear receptor that mediates the actions of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Ligand binding to the AR leads to its dissociation from heat shock proteins in the cytosol and translocation into the nucleus, where it binds to specific androgen response elements (AREs) upstream of target genes and modulates their transcription (10Gobinet J. Poujol N. Sultan C. Molecular action of androgens.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 198 (12573810): 15-2410.1016/S0303-7207(02)00364-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Kumar S. Saradhi M.

Yowell C.W. Bagchi G. Kelly P. Arora P. Casey P.J. Daaka Y. Androgen receptor activation by Gs signaling in prostate cancer cells.J. Biol.

Although these studies indicate a definite cross-talk between the two pathways, the exact role of PKA in AR activation is still unexplored. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of PKA is essential for nuclear translocation of AR and is a prerequisite for classical AR signaling. The unstimulated AR is bound to HSP90 and HSP70 in the cytosol, and phosphorylation of HSP90 protein at the Thr89 residue by PKA results in its disassociation from the AR, allowing the AR to bind to HSP27 and migrate into the nucleus. Aberrant activation of AR is the primary cause of transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence observed in patients with advanced prostate cancer (14Sadar M.D. Hussain M. Bruchovsky N. Prostate cancer: molecular biology of early progression to androgen independence.Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1999; 6 (10730903): 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cAMP/PKA pathway can induce AR in the presence of low/no androgens and remains activated in prostate cancer cells (1Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. Activation of the human androgen receptor through a protein kinase A signaling pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8702703): 19900-1990710.1074/jbc.271.33.19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In fact, androgens themselves are reported to activate PKA in prostate cells via a membrane GPCR (15Bagchi G. Wu J. French J. Kim J. Moniri N.H. Daaka Y. Androgens transduce the Gαs-mediated activation of protein kinase A in prostate cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68 (18451148): 3225-323110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether activation of PKA is necessary for nuclear AR transactivation, androgen-induced ARE-regulated reporter activity was monitored in LNCaP cells in the presence and absence of PKA inhibitor H89 (30 μm, isoquinoline) or PKA-specific siRNA (PKA-siRNA) (120 nm) (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of LNCaP cells with H89 or transfection with PKA-siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in testosterone (T)-induced AR activity (Fig. 1A). Similarly, in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, transfected with AR and ARE-luciferase, pretreatment with H89 or transfection with PKA-siRNA resulted in a marked decrease in testosterone-induced reporter activity (Fig. 1B), indicating that PKA activation is critical for optimal AR transactivation. Cells overexpressing scrambled siRNA did not exhibit any change in reporter activity (Fig. 1, A and B). Although PKA activation is necessary for AR activity, the precise role of activated PKA in classical AR signaling needs further investigation. Studies by Kasbohm et al. (6Kasbohm E.A. Guo R. Yowell C.W. Bagchi G. Kelly P. Arora P. Casey P.J. Daaka Y. Androgen receptor activation by Gs signaling in prostate cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (15653681): 11583-1158910.1074/jbc.M414423200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have indicated that PKA activation may regulate the nuclear translocation of AR, whereas others have indicated that PKA activation may enhance the interaction of AR with transcription factors post-translocation (16Kim W. Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Yos9p detects and targets misfolded glycoproteins for ER-associated degradation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19 (16168371): 753-76410.1016/j.molcel.2005.08.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKA activation plays a role in the nuclear translocation of AR, LNCaP cells were transfected with GFP-tagged AR, and translocation was monitored at different time points (0, 5, 15, and 30 min and 1 and 4 h) post-testosterone treatment, in the presence and absence of PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. S1). In the absence of testosterone, GFP-AR was mostly localized in the cytoplasm of the cells, and a time-dependent import of GFP-AR into the nucleus was observed following testosterone treatment, as reported earlier (17Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Dynamics of intracellular movement and nucleocytoplasmic recycling of the ligand-activated androgen receptor in living cells.Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14 (10935541): 1162-117410.1210/mend.14.8.0497Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In fact, greater than 90% of the GFP-AR had translocated completely within 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2 (T) and Fig. S1A). However, prior treatment of these cells with H89 (Fig. 2 (T + H89) and Fig. S1B) or knocking down PKA expression using PKA-siRNA inhibited nuclear import (Fig. 2 (T + siPKA) and Fig. S1C), indicating the need for PKA activation in the nuclear import process of AR. Molecular chaperones such as HSP90 stabilize the AR in the absence of ligand in the cytoplasm (11Kumar S. Saradhi M. Chaturvedi N.K. Tyagi R.K. Intracellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of steroid receptors: an overview.Mol. Cell.

The AR in cytoplasm is maintained in an inactive but responsive state as a part of a large heterocomplex composed of heat shock proteins, co-chaperones, and other proteins (1Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. Activation of the human androgen receptor through a protein kinase A signaling pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8702703): 19900-1990710.1074/jbc.271.33.19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Binding of ligand leads to a conformational change in the AR, causing its dissociation from the large complex and translocation into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the AR binds to androgen response elements and recruits coactivators and other factors in the vicinity of target genes to regulate their transcription (19Zoubeidi A. Zardan A. Beraldi E. Fazli L. Sowery R. Rennie P. Nelson C. Gleave M. Cooperative interactions between androgen receptor (AR) and heat-shock protein 27 facilitate AR transcriptional activity.Cancer Res. 2007; 67 (17974989): 10455-1046510.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Studies reveal that androgen-bound AR dissociates from HSP90 but exhibits increased association with another chaperone called HSP27 (19Zoubeidi A. Zardan A. Beraldi E. Fazli L. Sowery R. Rennie P. Nelson C. Gleave M. Cooperative interactions between androgen receptor (AR) and heat-shock protein 27 facilitate AR transcriptional activity.Cancer Res. 2007; 67 (17974989): 10455-1046510.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PKA-mediated phosphorylation could be necessary for the release of AR from heterocomplex or its subsequent migration into the nucleus. We monitored the relative locations of AR and HSP90 in LNCaP cells and assessed the impact of inhibition of PKA on the localization of the two molecules. LNCaP cells transfected with GFP-AR were treated with 10 nm testosterone for 1 h, and immunofluorescence studies were performed using TRITC-labeled anti-HSP90 antibody. In unstimulated cells, both GFP-AR and HSP90 were localized in the cytoplasm, and GFP-AR moved into the nucleus following testosterone treatment, whereas HSP90 remained in the cytosol (Fig. 3, −T and +T). In LNCaP cells pretreated with H89, T treatment did not induce import of GFP-AR into the nucleus, and both HSP90 and GFP-AR fluorescence were confined to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, T + H89). Similarly, both HSP90 and GFP-AR colocalized predominantly in the cytosol following testosterone treatment in LNCaP cells, overexpressing PKA-siRNA (Fig. 3, siPKA and T + siPKA). Further, the subcellular location of AR and HSP90 in unstimulated (vehicle-treated) and stimulated (testosterone-treated) LNCaP cells and siPKA-transfected LNCaP cells was investigated by Western blotting, post-treatment. In unstimulated LNCaP cells (vehicle-treated), most of the AR and HSP90 was present in the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas in stimulated cells, AR was predominantly present in the nucleus while HSP90 was in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3B, LNCaP, −T, +T). Similar results were obtained in the case of unstimulated and stimulated LNCaP cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (data not shown). In siPKA-transfected LNCaP cells, AR and HSP90 were both predominantly present in the cytoplasm before and after testosterone treatment (Fig. 3B, siPKA-LNCaP, −T, +T). To evaluate whether PKA activation regulates the binding of AR to HSP90, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in LNCaP cells treated with testosterone with or without prior H89 treatment. Untreated cells were used as control. In AR-immunoprecipitated complexes, probing with HSP90 antibody revealed AR and HSP90 interaction in untreated cells and dissociation of AR from HSP90 in testosterone-treated cells (Fig. 4A). In H89-treated cells or cells transfected with PKA-siRNA, AR—HSP90 association was intact following testosterone treatment, and AR was not released from HSP90 (Fig. 4A), clearly demonstrating involvement of the PKA activation step in the release of AR from HSP90. Also, HSP27–AR interaction was increased in testosterone-treated cells compared with control; however, HSP27–AR association was much less in LNCaP cells treated with H89 or transfected with PKA-siRNA (Fig. 4A). Significantly, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, immunoprecipitation with HSP90 antibody and probing with PKA substrate antibody indicated that phospho-HSP90 levels increased after testosterone treatment in LNCaP cells, whereas its levels in H89-treated or PKA-siRNA–transfected cells were the same as in untreated cells, following testosterone treatment (Fig. 4B). From the co-immunoprecipitation studies, it can be concluded that AR—HSP90 interaction is severed following testosterone treatment, due to phosphorylation of HSP90 by testosterone via a PKA-mediated pathway. Also, the inhibition of PKA activation prevents HSP90 phosphorylation and consequent dissociation of AR from HSP90 complex, making AR unsuitable for migration into the nucleus. PKA, being a kinase, could possibly regulate the AR and HSP90 complex formation by phosphorylating the AR, HSP90, or any other protein within the complex. Studies have shown that the only site in AR that is phosphorylated by PKA is Ser650, and mutation of this Ser to Ala, S650A, did not have any significant impact on AR transactivation (6Kasbohm E.A. Guo R. Yowell C.W. Bagchi G. Kelly P. Arora P. Casey P.J. Daaka Y. Androgen receptor activation by Gs signaling in prostate cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (15653681): 11583-1158910.1074/jbc.M414423200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HSP90 is phosphorylated by PKA at a single site, Thr89, in PAEC cells (20Lei H. Venkatakrishnan A. Yu S. Kazlauskas A. Protein kinase A-dependent translocation of HSP90α impairs endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity in high glucose and diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17202141): 9364-937110.1074/jbc.M608985200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutation of this threonine residue inhibits PKA-mediated phosphorylation of HSP90 and prevents the translocation of HSP90 to the surface of these cells (20Lei H. Venkatakrishnan A. Yu S. Kazlauskas A. Protein kinase A-dependent translocation of HSP90α impairs endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity in high glucose and diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17202141): 9364-937110.1074/jbc.M608985200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKA-induced phosphorylation of Thr89 plays a key role in the dissociation of AR–HSP90 complex, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in LNCaP cells transfected with HSP90 T89A (a kind gift from Heitian Lei). In cells overexpressing mutant HSP90, immunoprecipitation with AR antibody, followed by immunoblotting with HSP90 antibody, revealed that a significant percentage of AR remained in complex with HSP90 following testosterone treatment unlike in cells expressing WT HSP90, where complete dissociation of AR and HSP90 was observed (Fig. 4C). Because these cells also contain a small percentage of endogenous WT HSP90, a small percentage of AR is dissociated from the HSP90 complex, reflected in the minor difference in intensity of the AR-bound HSP90 product obtained in treated and untreated cells. In the same cells pretreated with H89 or transfected with PKA-siRNA, most of the AR remained in complex with HSP90 upon testosterone treatment, as in the untreated cells (Fig. 4C). An inverse proportionality is usually observed in the binding of HSP90 and HSP27 to AR (20Lei H. Venkatakrishnan A. Yu S. Kazlauskas A. Protein kinase A-dependent translocation of HSP90α impairs endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity in high glucose and diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17202141): 9364-937110.1074/jbc.M608985200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). HSP27 can bind to AR only when it is released from the HSP90 complex. In keeping with this, in LNCaP cells overexpressing HSP90 T89A, only a small fraction of HSP27 was bound to AR following testosterone treatment, as most of the AR was still in complex with mutated HSP90. AR could probably uncouple only from those complexes that were formed by a few molecules of WT HSP90 present in these cell that could be phosphorylated. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using anti-HSP90 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with PKA substrate antibody, indicated that in cells overexpressing HSP90 T89A, negligible levels of phospho-HSP90 product is obtained compared with cells that express WT HSP90 upon testosterone treatment. (Fig. 4D). To confirm that the observed difference in immunoblots was not due to any difference in affinity of the anti-HSP90 antibody for the WT and mutant HSP90 proteins, Western blotting was performed using lysates from LNCaP cells transfected using HSP90, HSP90 T89A, or vector alone. Results demonstrate that the antibody can detect both WT and mutant HSP90 T89A efficiently (Fig. S3). The migration of AR into the nucleus is possible once it dissociates from the HSP90 heterocomplex. In LNCaP cells overexpressing HSP90 T89A and GFP-AR, the translocation of GFP-AR was monitored by a fluorescence microscope at different time intervals following testosterone treatment. Whereas in LNCaP cells expressing WT HSP90, most of the AR translocated into the nucleus by 1 h (Fig. 5 (HSP90) and Fig. S2A), in cells overexpressing the HSP90 mutant, most of the AR remained in the cytoplasm following testosterone treatment for 4 h (Fig. 5 (HSP90 T89A) and Fig. S2B) or more (data not shown). Also, in these cells, GFP-AR and mutant HSP90 colocalize in the cytoplasm before and after testosterone treatment (10 nm, 1 h; Fig. 6, −T and +T). Cells pretreated with H89 or transfected with PKA-siRNA behaved in the same way as untreated and testosterone-treated cells (Fig. 6, T + H89, siPKA, and T + siPKA). Collectively, these results indicate that phosphorylation of HSP90 by PKA at residue Thr89 is essential for the release of AR from the HSP90 complex and its subsequent migration into the nucleus. In the cells expressing mutant HSP90, most of the AR was in complex with HSP90 and could not be imported into the nucleus. To evaluate the transcription efficiency of AR in cells overexpressing the mutant HSP90, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of testosterone, and ARE-regulated luciferase activity was measured and compared with that in LNCaP cells expressing WT HSP90. In both LNCaP and HEK293 cells, a significant fall in testosterone-induced reporter activity (58.56% and 56.5%, respectively) was observed in cells overexpressing HSP90 T89A as compared with those expressing WT HSP90 (Fig. 7, A and B). In fact, little increase in reporter activity was observed following testosterone treatment in both of these cell lines (Fig. 7, A and B). Androgens play an important role in the survival and maintenance of prostate cells. Androgens also stimulate PKA activation to promote androgen signaling (15Bagchi G. Wu J. French J. Kim J. Moniri N.H. Daaka Y. Androgens transduce the Gαs-mediated activation of protein kinase A in prostate cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68 (18451148): 3225-323110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether activation of PKA is required for the proliferative effects induced by androgens in prostate cells. To confirm this, LNCaP cells were grown in testosterone-deficient (c"

https://openalex.org/W2936978550,"Fracture remains one of the most common traumatic conditions in orthopedic surgery. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to augment fracture repair is promising. Leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR 5 (Lgr5), a transmembrane protein, has been identified as a novel adult stem cell marker in various organs and tissues. However, the roles of Lgr5 in MSCs are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated cellular functions of Lgr5 in MSCs and its potential implications in treating fracture. Lgr5-overexpressing MSCs (MSCLgr5) were established in murine SV40 promoter–driven luciferase reporter MSC line through virus transfection. Results of real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the increased expression of Lgr5 in MSCLgr5. MSCLgr5 exhibited increased osteogenic capacity, which may result from elevated expression of β-catenin and phosphorylated ERK1/2 within the nuclear region of cells. In contrast, inhibition of Lgr5 expression decreased the osteogenic differentiation ability of MSCs, accompanied with increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced expression of β-catenin. Local transplantation of MSCLgr5 at fracture sites accelerated fracture healing via enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis. MSCLgr5 stimulated the tube formation capacity of HUVECs in a Matrigel coculture system in vitro significantly. Taken together, results suggest that Lgr5 is implicated in the cellular processes of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through regulation of Wnt and ERK signaling pathways and mitochondrial dynamics in fusion and fission. Inhibition of Lgr5 expression induced increased mitochondrial fragmentation and suppression of osteogenesis. MSCLgr5 exhibited enhanced therapeutic efficacy for fracture healing, which may serve as a superior cell source for bone tissue repair.—Lin, W., Xu, L., Pan, Q., Lin, S., Feng, L., Wang, B., Chen, S., Li, Y., Wang, H., Li, Y., Wang, Y., Lee, W.

https://openalex.org/W2935988077,"Banni, located in the arid western India, is one of the largest tropical grasslands of the Asian continent. The net primary production in this grassland ecosystem is currently mediated by precipitation during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). However, timing of the grassland expansion and its link to the intensity of monsoonal precipitation remains enigmatic due to the paucity of datasets. The major objective of this study is to understand the changes in monsoonal precipitation and vegetation for the last 4600 cal yr BP using hydrogen and carbon isotopic composition of n-alkanes (δDn-alkane and δ13Cn-alkane) measured from two core sediments (Chachi and Luna) in Banni region. The δ13CC29 and δ13CC31 values for Chachi core sediments vary from −30.9 ‰ to −27.2 ‰ and −34.4 ‰ to −25 ‰ respectively. The δ13Cn-alkane values from the core sediments are converted into %C4 plants based on a binary mixing model using the end-member δ13Cn-alkane values derived from the dominant modern vegetation in the Banni region. The prominent feature of the paleovegetation curve is the marked increase in the δ13Cn-alkane values after 2500 cal yr BP, which suggests proliferation of C4 grasses in this region. Similar changes after 2500 cal yr BP have also been observed in the δDn-alkane values. The δDC29 values are used to calculate δD value of paleoprecipitation that varied from 10 ‰ to −60.2 ‰. A significant increase in the δD values of paleoprecipitation (ca. 25 ‰) indicates a weakened ISM precipitation after ca. 2500 cal yr BP. The regional aridification and frequent fire events may have helped the expansion of C4 plant dominated grassland ecosystem in Banni region. Correlation between paleoclimatic records suggests that the southward migration of intertropical convergence zone and more frequent warm phases of El-Nino Southern Oscillation have triggered the weakening of monsoonal precipitation in the tropical region."

Allergic airway disease, composed of the strongly associated conditions asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, represents a rapidly increasing morbidity and healthcare burden across the world. More than 1 in 12 persons in the United States have asthma, with higher rates seen among children, the impoverished, and women (1Akinbami L.J. Bailey C.M. Johnson C.A. King M.E. Liu X. Moorman J.E. Zahran H.S. Trends in asthma prevalence, health care use, and mortality in the United States, 2001–2010. 2012; 2012 (22617340): 1-8Google Scholar). Despite the epidemic nature of allergic airway disease and an intensive international effort to understand its causes, modern standard management remains entirely palliative, offering no chance of long-term remission or cure (2Tung H.Y. Li E. Landers C. Nguyen A. Kheradmand F. Knight J.M. Corry D.B. Advances and evolving concepts in allergic asthma.Semin. Respir. Crit.

Nonetheless, important advances in our understanding of allergic airway disease pathogenesis have been made. Environmental proteinases are increasingly recognized to be critical drivers of both allergies, the subset of allergic diseases that are driven by IgE-dependent type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, and allergic airway disease that is mediated by both lymphocytes and IgE-dependent immune reactions (3Tung H.Y.

Canonical environmental allergens such as pollens, dust mites, cockroaches and other arthropods, and pet danders are all important sources of active proteinases that alone or combined as part of whole-organism extracts readily induce experimental allergic airway disease in rodents (4Porter P.C.

The pathophysiology of fungus-related allergic airway disease is likely related to several factors, including fungal hypersensitivity, which does not involve actual infection, and true airway infection by fungus that involves the noninvasive growth of fungi in either the upper or lower airways, a unique type of superficial fungal infection termed airway mycosis (11Porter P.C.

We showed previously that proteinase-dependent induction of allergic airway disease requires in part the activation of the coagulation factor fibrinogen, from which fibrinogen cleavage products (FCPs) 4The abbreviations used are: FCPfibrinogen cleavage productFBGfibrinogenPAMproteinase from A. melleusPAIRproteinase-activated immune responseANOVAanalysis of varianceBALFbronchoalveolar lavage fluidBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolBMDMbone marrow–derived macrophageAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluorideFGEfungal germination eventLPSlipopolysaccharideTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. initiate both allergic airway disease and activate innate immune cells such as macrophages to limit the growth of fungi in vitro, termed fungistasis. fibrinogen cleavage product fibrinogen proteinase from A. melleus proteinase-activated immune response analysis of variance bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol bone marrow–derived macrophage 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride fungal germination event lipopolysaccharide N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Both innate fungistatic responses and allergic airway disease are driven by FCPs obligatorily through TLR4 (23Millien V.O. Lu W. Shaw J. Yuan X. Mak G. Roberts L. Song L.Z. Knight J.M. Creighton C.J. Luong A. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. Cleavage of fibrinogen by proteinases elicits allergic responses through Toll-like receptor 4.Science. 2013; 341 (23950537): 792-79610.1126/science.1240342Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but it remains unclear what structural features of FCPs determine their ability to engage this immune receptor. Moreover, multiple ligands, including LPS, interact with TLR4 indirectly through binding partners, raising the possibility that FCPs engage TLR4 through a similar indirect mechanism. The leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD18/CD11b) has previously been shown to bind to fibrinogen and regulate macrophage-dependent innate immunity (28Flick M.J. Du X. Witte D.P. Jirousková M. Soloviev D.A. Busuttil S.J. Plow E.F. Degen J.L. Leukocyte engagement of fibrin(ogen) via the integrin receptor αMβ2/Mac-1 is critical for host inflammatory response in vivo.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113 (15173886): 1596-160610.1172/JCI20741Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mac-1 interacts with TLR4 through an unknown mechanism to promote LPS-dependent inflammation and T cell activation (29Ling G.S. Bennett J. Woollard K.J. Szajna M. Fossati-Jimack L. Taylor P.R. Scott D. Franzoso G. Cook H.T. Botto M. Integrin CD11b positively regulates TLR4-induced signalling pathways in dendritic cells but not in macrophages.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24423728): 303910.1038/ncomms4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Considering these prior observations with our current findings, we reasoned that Mac-1 could facilitate the FCP–TLR4 interaction that promotes antifungal immunity and allergic airway disease. In this study, we have combined proteinase cleavage assays with MS to demonstrate the fundamental structure of FCPs that determines their ability to interact with TLR4. We further demonstrate that FCPs most likely engage TLR4 indirectly through a mechanism involving the integrin Mac-1 (CD18/CD11b). Our prior studies demonstrated that FBG can be cleaved by the endogenous proteinase thrombin to produce FCPs that stimulate fungistatic immunity (23Millien V.O. Lu W. Shaw J. Yuan X. Mak G. Roberts L. Song L.Z. Knight J.M. Creighton C.J. Luong A. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. Cleavage of fibrinogen by proteinases elicits allergic responses through Toll-like receptor 4.Science. 2013; 341 (23950537): 792-79610.1126/science.1240342Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a more clinically relevant source of fibrinogen cleavage could be fungi that, through their secreted proteinases, are likely causes of human asthma and sinusitis (6Porter P. Susarla S.C. Polikepahad S. Qian Y. Hampton J. Kiss A. Vaidya S. Sur S. Ongeri V. Yang T. Delclos G.L. Abramson S. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. Link between allergic asthma and airway mucosal infection suggested by proteinase-secreting household fungi.Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2 (19710638): 504-51710.1038/mi.2009.102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether FCPs can be generated from exogenous fungal proteinases, we first determined how FBG is degraded in the presence of the allergenic proteinase from Aspergillus melleus (PAM) using SDS-PAGE. This analysis confirmed that PAM yields numerous FCPs ranging in size from a few kDa to nearly 250 kDa (Fig. 1A). When added at a constant concentration of 6 μg/ml to FBG diluted to 5 mg/ml, PAM gradually cleaved FBG from 340 to ∼200 kDa, yielding FCPs of many sizes. However, even after 2 h of incubation in these strongly hydrolyzing conditions, PAM yielded only three major FCPs of ∼75, 150, and 200 kDa in size that persisted out to at least 6 h (data not shown). After 24 h, PAM had reduced fibrinogen to fragments no larger than ∼75 kDa (Fig. 1B). We found that similar trends in FBG fragmentation could be observed by modulating the concentration of PAM while keeping the incubation time constant (30 min; Fig. 1C). Thus, an allergenic fungal proteinase rapidly cleaves fibrinogen into FCPs of discrete size that remain relatively stable once formed. We next determined the functional importance of PAM-derived FCPs using a modification of an in vitro assay that quantifies the fungistatic ability of immune cells, i.e. their ability to inhibit fungal growth in vitro (23Millien V.O. Lu W. Shaw J. Yuan X. Mak G. Roberts L. Song L.Z. Knight J.M. Creighton C.J. Luong A. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B.

First, we verified that addition of bovine serum enhances the ability of mouse splenocytes to inhibit the growth of Aspergillus niger in vitro as indicated by a reduction in the number of fungal germination events (Fig. 1D). 5H. Y. Tung, C. T. Landers, J. M. Knight, Y. Wu, W. Lu, P. Porter, S. C. Sun, A. Rodriguez, F. Kheradmand, and D. B. Corry, submitted for publication. We further confirmed that supplementing serum-free cultures of murine splenocytes with 100 nm whole FBG or 100 nm PAM–FCPs resulted in similar fungal inhibition (Fig. 1E). We conducted additional functional experiments to confirm that the ability of PAM–FCPs to promote innate antifungal immunity cannot be accounted for by the residual proteinase remaining in the FCP mixture following their preparation (Fig. 1F). PAM–FCPs were further capable of promoting fungistasis in both murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) and splenocytes in a manner that absolutely depended on expression of TLR4 (Fig. 1, G and H) (23Millien V.O. Lu W. Shaw J. Yuan X. Mak G. Roberts L. Song L.Z. Knight J.M. Creighton C.J. Luong A. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. Cleavage of fibrinogen by proteinases elicits allergic responses through Toll-like receptor 4.Science. 2013; 341 (23950537): 792-79610.1126/science.1240342Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, PAM-derived FCPs are functionally equivalent to thrombin-derived FCPs with respect to induction of in vitro fungistatic activity from diverse immune cells. We further evaluated the difference between whole FBG and FCPs in this assay and whether FCP-dependent fungistasis was cell contact–mediated or the result of secreted anti-microbial soluble products. Naïve mouse splenocytes were primed with fibrinogen, FCPs, or sham, and after 18 h the conditioned supernatants were transferred to separate wells, and fresh media were added to the remaining splenocytes. The ability of primed splenocytes, conditioned media, or sham to inhibit A. niger growth was then determined (Fig. 2A). We conducted additional experiments in which splenocytes were incubated with A. niger spores but were kept separated by a semi-permeable transwell membrane (Fig. 2B). These studies demonstrated that only FCP and not FBG-primed splenocytes mediate fungistasis and that splenocytes inhibit fungal growth through a mechanism that requires contact with the fungus and not secretion of a soluble antifungal substance (Fig. 2, A and B). We further conclude from these experiments that the ability of intact FBG to mediate fungistasis when added to cultures that simultaneously contain splenocytes and fungi (Fig. 1E) is most likely due to fungus-dependent cleavage of FBG to produce FCPs. In contrast to splenocytes, although PAM–FCPs enhanced BMDM fungistatic immunity, these cells secreted a soluble factor that accounted for most of this fungistatic activity (Fig. 2C). Thus, fungal proteinase-derived FCPs, but not fibrinogen, induce fungistatic immunity from diverse cell types through a variety of mechanisms involving either cell contact or the secretion of soluble antifungal factors. We have previously demonstrated that Aspergillus spp. proteinases are potent allergens that strongly induce allergic airway disease in mice, including profound airway hyper-responsiveness and eosinophilia when delivered intranasally (5Kheradmand F.

Although long available from commercial sources, the identity of PAM as a proteinase has not previously been characterized. By SDS-PAGE, PAM consists of at least three dominant protein bands of ∼11, 22, and 33 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). Mass spectrometry (MS) performed on all of these protein bands revealed nearly identical sequence information, indicating that the different bands represented multimers of a single gene product. We observed similar multimerization occurring with the functionally similar allergenic proteinase derived from Aspergillus oryzae (5Kheradmand F. Kiss A. Xu J. Lee S.H. Kolattukudy P.E. Corry D.B. A protease-activated pathway underlying Th cell type 2 activation and allergic lung disease.J.

MS-based sequencing indicated that the A. melleus proteinase is an extracellular alkaline serine proteinase that is substantially similar to the proteinases produced by other Aspergillus species (Fig. 3, C and D). We further conducted proteinase inhibition experiments involving PAM and multiple class-specific proteinase inhibitors that confirmed that PAM is only susceptible to inhibition by the serine class-specific inhibitor AEBSF (Fig. S1). Therefore, PAM is an alkaline serine proteinase, similar to other fungal proteinases (e.g. Asp f13) that have previously been linked to allergic airway disease in mice (18Balenga N.A. Klichinsky M. Xie Z. Chan E.C. Zhao M. Jude J. Laviolette M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Druey K.M. A fungal protease allergen provokes airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma.Nat.

In addition to fungi, allergic airway diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis are linked to many other organisms, including plants (especially pollens), arthropods (e.g. environmental mites), and bacteria, all of which produce proteinases. Therefore, we next examined whether allergenic proteinases derived from nonfungal sources could induce similar fibrinogen-dependent fungistatic immunity in vitro. We found that FCPs produced from PAM, Pronase from the bacterium Streptomyces griseus, an extract derived from the dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae, and ragweed pollen from Ambrosia artemisiifolia (ragweed) induced similar fungistatic activity from splenocytes (Fig. 4A). After normalizing for proteinase activity, FCPs produced from these sources were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions to reveal the individual FBG polypeptide chains (α, β, and γ chains; Fig. 4B). We further included in this analysis additional FCPs derived from the dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and the storage mites Glyciphagus domesticus and Tyrophagus putrescentiae. This analysis revealed that each of the tested proteinases preferentially degraded the fibrinogen α chain (Fig. 4C). Additional analyses of PAM-derived FCPs revealed that whereas the α chain was almost completely degraded immediately upon addition of proteinase, the β and γ chains remained substantially resistant to hydrolysis even after 2 h (Fig. 4D). Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that β- or γ-chain cleavage is also essential, our findings indicate that proteinases derived from diverse organisms cleave FBG in a highly stereotypical manner, with predominantly the α chain being rapidly degraded to reveal the relatively proteinase-resistant β and γ chains. We next sought to determine the FBG region from which functional FCPs derive. Our initial attempts to identify functionally active FCPs from PAM-digested whole FBG were unsuccessful because standard isolation techniques (molecular sieving; column chromatography) inevitably resulted in denatured and inactive FCPs (data not shown). We therefore determined the ability of distinct FBG regions (e.g. D and E domains, Fig. 4B) to yield active FCPs. At a constant 100 nm, PAM-derived FCPs derived from whole fibrinogen and D and E domains all induced significant fungistatic responses from murine splenocytes as compared with sham-activated cells (Fig. 5A). As noted previously, fibrinogen readily induced fungistasis independent of the addition of PAM, likely due to the cleavage induced by fungal proteinases secreted into the culture media. In contrast, whole D and E domains behaved distinctly under the same conditions. Whereas D domains had no intrinsic ability to induce fungistasis, E domains showed a nonsignificant trend to promote fungistasis prior to the addition of PAM, suggesting that E domains might be either partially competent or more readily induced by ambient fungal proteinases to become competent to induce fungistatic responses (Fig. 5A). Thus, multiple domains of FBG, including D and E domains, are capable of inducing fungistatic responses from immune cells following proteolytic activation. Whole FBG is more potent in inducing fungistasis under these conditions that control for equivalent molar additi"

To assess CSP’s roles in the intracellular human pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, we analyzed their expression in varied stress conditions. We found that cold shock protein E (cspE or STM14_0732) is up-regulated during bile salt-induced stress and that an S. Typhimurium strain lacking cspE (ΔcspE) displays dose-dependent sensitivity to bile salts, specifically to deoxycholate. We also found that an uncharacterized gene, yciF (STM14_2092), is up-regulated in response to bile stress in WT but not in the ΔcspE strain. Complementation with WT CspE, but not with a F30V CspE variant, abrogated the bile sensitivity of ΔcspE as did multicopy overexpression of yciF. Northern blotting experiments with rifampicin disclosed that the regulation of yciF expression is, most likely, due to the RNA-stabilizing activity of CspE. Importantly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that purified CspE, but not the F30V variant, directly binds yciF mRNA. We also observed that the extra-cytoplasmic stress-response (ESR) pathway is augmented in the bile-treated ΔcspE strain, as judged by induction of RpoE regulon genes (rpoE, degP, and rybB) and downstream ESR genes (hfq, rne, and PNPase). Moreover, the transcript levels of the porin genes, ompD, ompF, and ompC, were higher in bile salts-stressed ΔcspE and correlated with higher intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent DNA stain bisBenzimide H 33258, indicating greater cell permeability.

Moreover, the transcript levels of the porin genes, ompD, ompF, and ompC, were higher in bile salts-stressed ΔcspE and correlated with higher intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent DNA stain bisBenzimide H 33258, indicating greater cell permeability. In conclusion, our study has identified YciF, a CspE target involved in the regulation of porins and in countering bile stress in S. Typhimurium. Microbes face myriad stresses due to changes in the environment. Consequently, gene regulation plays important roles during their adaptation to different environmental milieu. For example, most bacteria react to a sudden decrease in temperature, i.e. a shift from 30 to 10 °C, by a cold-shock response (1Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Some like it cold: response of microorganisms to cold shock.Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166 (8929274): 293-30010.1007/s002030050386Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This temperature adaptation causes major physiological changes in the cell, including changes in composition and organization of lipids, leading to alterations in membrane fluidity, increase in superhelicity, compaction of DNA by the introduction of negative supercoils, and overall decreased metabolic rate (2Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Cold-shock response and cold-shock proteins.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2 (10322168): 175-18010.1016/S1369-5274(99)80031-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A family of genes involved in this response are the cold shock proteins (CSPs) 3The abbreviations used are: CSPcold shock proteinqRTquantitative RTESRextracytoplasmic stress responseOMPouter membrane proteinssDNAsingle-stranded DNAANOVAanalysis of varianceCFUcolony-forming unitRNPribonucleoproteinPNPasepolynucleotide phosphorylase. consisting of 67–73 amino acids that are evolutionarily conserved across all three domains of life and are implicated to function as RNA chaperones (3Horton A.J.

The cold shock domain–containing proteins are characterized structurally and functionally in several organisms, e.g. Escherichia coli (4Ermolenko D.N. Makhatadze G.I.

Numerous amino acid residues have been identified to be important for nucleotide binding, which largely center around two motifs termed the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) sites, RNP1 (KGFGF) and RNP2 (VFVH) (10Schröder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A.

Not all CSPs are cold-inducible, and some are reported to fulfill noncold stress-related functions. E. coli harbors nine CspA paralogs (CspA–I), of which CspA, CspB, CspG, and CspI are cold-inducible (11Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd., G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J.

Mitani T. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of multicopy suppressors of a mukB mutation in Escherichia coli.Mol.

Growth-phase–dependent expression of cspD, encoding a member of the CspA family in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179 (9260955): 5126-513010.1128/jb.179.16.5126-5130.1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major CSP from E. coli, CspA, has been described as a multifunctional nucleic acid–binding protein and essential for mRNA stabilization after temperature downshift (14Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. CspA, the major cold-shock protein of Escherichia coli, is an RNA chaperone.J. Biol.

In Listeria monocytogenes, CspA enables hemolysis by regulating the production of the pore-forming cytolysin listeriolysin (15Schärer K. Stephan R. Tasara T. Cold shock proteins contribute to the regulation of listeriolysin O production in Listeria monocytogenes.Foodborne Pathog. Dis. 2013; 10 (23952475): 1023-102910.1089/fpd.2013.1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A cold shock–induced RNA-binding protein CspR plays a post-transcriptional function in the Gram-positive opportunistic human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis and has a role in the virulence, organ colonization, and its survival in macrophages (16Michaux C. Martini C. Shioya K. Ahmed Lecheheb S. Budin-Verneuil A. Cosette P. Sanguinetti M. Hartke A. Verneuil N. Giard J.C.

Bacteriol. 2012; 194 (23086208): 6900-690810.1128/JB.01673-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CSPs is fairly similar, e.g. the E. coli–encoded CspE superimposes appropriately with the Salmonella Typhimurium CspE. It includes five anti-parallel β-strands forming a classic OB fold with the characteristic RNP1 and RNP2 motifs conserved on the nucleic acid–interacting surfaces (8Morgan H.P. Wear M.A. McNae I. Gallagher M.P. Walkinshaw M.D. Crystallization and X-ray structure of cold-shock protein E from Salmonella typhimurium.Acta Crystallogr Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst.

The nucleic acid melting ability and transcription anti-terminator activity of CspE is critical for growth at low temperature (17Uppal S. Maurya S.R. Hire R.S. Jawali N. Cyclic AMP receptor protein regulates cspE, an early cold-inducible gene, in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 (21926233): 6142-615110.1128/JB.05728-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It functions as a “housekeeping RNA chaperone” under general stress conditions (18Shenhar Y. Biran D. Ron E.Z. Resistance to environmental stress requires the RNA chaperones CspC and CspE.Environ. Microbiol.

Typhimurium, causes typhoid-like infection in mice and is a well-established model to study the roles of proteins during stress and infection. In high-income countries, nontyphoidal salmonellae mainly cause a self-limiting enterocolitis in immunocompetent individuals (22Hohmann E.L. Nontyphoidal salmonellosis.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32 (11170916): 263-26910.1086/318457Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Up to 5% of patients develop secondary bacteremia, but attributable mortality is low (1–5%) (23Feasey N.A. Dougan G. Kingsley R.A. Heyderman R.S. Gordon M.A. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease: an emerging and neglected tropical disease in Africa.Lancet. 2012; 379 (22587967): 2489-249910.1016/S0140-6736(11)61752-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In sub-Saharan Africa, bacteremia is commonly presented by invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae, in both children and adults, especially in regions of HIV and malaria prevalence. Despite anti-microbial treatments, fatality rates are 22–47% in African adults and children (24Gordon M.A. Graham S.M. Walsh A.L. Wilson L. Phiri A. Molyneux E. Zijlstra E.E. Heyderman R.S. Hart C.A. Molyneux M.E.

Dis. 2008; 46 (18444810): 963-96910.1086/529146Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Another troubling observation is the rise of multidrug-resistant strains in S. Typhimurium. In fact, DT104, is one of the leading causes of animal and human salmonellosis (25Tadesse D.A. Singh A. Zhao S. Bartholomew M. Womack N. Ayers S. Fields P.I. McDermott P.F. Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella in the United States from 1948 to 1995.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2016; 60 (26856840): 2567-257110.1128/AAC.02536-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DT104 is resistant to the commonly used antibiotics, e.g. ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (26Poppe C. Smart N. Khakhria R. Johnson W. Spika J. Prescott J. Salmonella typhimurium DT104: a virulent and drug-resistant pathogen.Can. Vet. J. 1998; 39 (9752592): 559-565PubMed Google Scholar).These aspects reinforce the notion that it is important to study all aspects of investigations with respect to the biology of Salmonella. In S. Typhimurium, six CSPs have been identified: CspA–E and CspH (8Morgan H.P. Wear M.A. McNae I. Gallagher M.P. Walkinshaw M.D. Crystallization and X-ray structure of cold-shock protein E from Salmonella typhimurium.Acta Crystallogr Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst.

A recent study (30Michaux C. Holmqvist E. Vasicek E. Sharan M. Barquist L. Westermann A.J. Gunn J.S. Vogel J. RNA target profiles direct the discovery of virulence functions for the cold-shock proteins CspC and CspE.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Typhimurium SL1344 identified a plethora of downstream targets and physiological functions that CspE and CspC may regulate. In this study, we focus on the role of cold shock protein E (STM14_0732) from S. Typhimurium 14028s in imparting bile resistance. Bile is synthesized by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and plays a major role in dissolution and absorption of fats. In addition, bile demonstrates antimicrobial activity by solubilizing membrane lipids, disrupting membranes, damaging proteins, DNA, and RNA, and leading to the death of bacteria (31Hay A.J. Zhu J. In sickness and in health: the relationships between bacteria and bile in the human gut.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2016; 96 (27565580): 43-6410.1016/bs.aambs.2016.07.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Begley M. Gahan C.G. Hill C. The interaction between bacteria and bile.FEMS Microbiol.

Commensal bacteria are also able to modify bile salts both in the small and large intestine (31Hay A.J. Zhu J. In sickness and in health: the relationships between bacteria and bile in the human gut.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2016; 96 (27565580): 43-6410.1016/bs.aambs.2016.07.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This balance between the bile salt abundance and modification is beneficial to both the host and microbiome, especially in the cases of invading microbes that can be competed out by the commensals. There is an inverse correlation between bile concentration and bacterial colonization; areas of high bile concentration (gallbladder) have low bacterial communities. A striking feature of the chronic residence of Salmonella is the host distal ileum, an area of low bile concentration (33Prouty A.M. Brodsky I.E. Falkow S. Gunn J.S. Bile-salt–mediated induction of antimicrobial and bile resistance in Salmonella typhimurium.Microbiology. 2004; 150 (15073288): 775-78310.1099/mic.0.26769-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and biliary tract or gallbladder, areas of high bile concentration (34Gonzalez-Escobedo G. Gunn J.S. Gallbladder epithelium as a niche for chronic Salmonella carriage.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81 (23732169): 2920-293010.1128/IAI.00258-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To escape the high concentrations of bile, Salmonella either forms biofilms on the gallstone surface (35Prouty A.M. Schwesinger W.H. Gunn J.S. Biofilm formation and interaction with the surfaces of gallstones by Salmonella spp.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70 (11953406): 2640-264910.1128/IAI.70.5.2640-2649.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) or invades the gallbladder epithelium (36Menendez A. Arena E.T. Guttman J.A. Thorson L. Vallance B.A. Vogl W. Finlay B.B. Salmonella infection of gallbladder epithelial cells drives local inflammation and injury in a model of acute typhoid fever.J. Infect. Dis. 2009; 200 (19852670): 1703-171310.1086/646608Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Importantly, the colonization of the gallbladder by Salmonella is thought to be essential for the chronic asymptomatic carrier state, which is observed in 3–5% of infected individuals (34Gonzalez-Escobedo G. Gunn J.S. Gallbladder epithelium as a niche for chronic Salmonella carriage.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81 (23732169): 2920-293010.1128/IAI.00258-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These aspects underscore the importance of bile in the biology of Salmonella. Here, we show the mechanistic regulation of bile resistance controlled by S. Typhimurium–encoded CspE. Furthermore, the identification of YciF (STM14_2092) as a CspE-regulated protein and its role in regulating the outer membrane porins and cell permeability during bile stress are the highlights of this study. Salmonella faces a plethora of stresses within the host: acidic pH in the stomach, detergent-like stress from bile, and osmotic stress in the intestine. We attempted to replicate these stresses in vitro and study the involvement of CSPs in these stresses. The WT strain was grown in a rich media (LB) and subjected to several stress-inducing agents: bile stress (3% bile salts (w/v)), osmotic stress (5% NaCl (w/v)), and acidic pH stress (LB at pH 4.8). Transcript levels of four cold shock genes cspA, cspB, cspC, and cspE were analyzed at the 3rd and 8th h of growth. cspA and cspB did not show any quantifiable changes. cspC transcripts were not detected (Fig. S1A). As a control, we showed that the primers used were able to amplify the genomic copy of cspC (Fig. S1B). However, only cspE seemed consistently and significantly up-regulated at the 3rd and 8th h of growth, under the bile salt stress (Fig. 1A). The observations indicated that bile stress induced the expression of cspE. To better understand its functional role, a single gene deletion of cspE was generated (ΔcspE). The WT and ΔcspE strains did not show any growth differences in LB or other stress conditions studied (Fig. S2). However, with increasing concentrations of bile salts, i.e. 3% (w/v) and above, ΔcspE showed significant growth reduction (Fig. S3A). The growth of WT and ΔcspE in the absence (0%) and presence (3%) of bile salts was monitored in a kinetic manner. The ΔcspE strain showed growth retardation in colony-forming units (CFU), compared with the WT, in the presence of 3% bile salts (Fig. 1B). The specificity was also attributed to the deoxycholate component of bile salts (Fig. S3B). The functional involvement of cspE in imparting bile resistance was determined by using an expression construct of cspE (pcspE–cspE was under the control of the native promoter in the pRS424 plasmid). As seen in Fig. 1C, the bile-sensitive phenotype of ΔcspE was rescued by the complementation of cspE but not by the vector-alone transformed cells. Also, this bile resistance regulation by CspE was not a general CSP-dependent phenotype observed, because multicopy overexpression of another CSP, namely CspA did not show any phenotype suppression effect in ΔcspE (Fig. S4). In S. Typhimurium 14028s, among the CSPs studied, cspE is essential for bile resistance. A previous study using S. Typhimurium SL1344 has shown that both CspC and CspE are responsible for resistance to multiple stress, e.g. bile, polymyxin B sulfate, and H2O2 (30Michaux C. Holmqvist E. Vasicek E. Sharan M. Barquist L. Westermann A.J. Gunn J.S. Vogel J. RNA target profiles direct the discovery of virulence functions for the cold-shock proteins CspC and CspE.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28611217): 6824-682910.1073/pnas.1620772114PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the WT strain (S. Typhimurium 14028s) used in this study, we were unable to detect any cspC transcripts with either qRT or semi qRT-PCR (Fig. S1A). Deletion strains of cspE, cspC, and cspEcspC were generated in the background of both 14028s and SL1344 WT strains. We observed that the ΔcspE in SL1344 background was marginally more resistant to bile stress than that in the 14028s background. However, in our system single deletion of cspC (ΔcspC) did not show any significant effect on bile resistance in either strain (Fig. S5A). Accordingly, the double-deletion strain ΔcspEΔcspC showed a cspE-dependent effect. To further confirm the role of cspC, a cloning and overexpression approach similar to that of cspE was utilized. The cspC gene, unlike cspE, occurs in an operon with an uncharacterized upstream gene, yobF. The full-length cspC operon (pcspC++) was cloned from SL1344 strain (30Michaux C. Holmqvist E. Vasicek E. Sharan M. Barquist L. Westermann A.J. Gunn J.S. Vogel J. RNA target profiles direct the discovery of virulence functions for the cold-shock proteins CspC and CspE.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28611217): 6824-682910.1073/pnas.1620772114PubMed Google Scholar) in the pRS424 vector. Functional complementation assays were performed with the cspC construct, but no phenotypic rescue was seen with respect to the bile sensitivity of ΔcspE (Fig. S5B). Therefore, we conclude that in the S. Typhimurium strain used in this study, CspE is mainly responsible for combating bile stress. It was important to address the possible mediators involved in the CspE-mediated rescue of bile stress. An earlier study of a bile-modulated proteome of S. Typhimurium had identified several novel proteins. Of these, an uncharacterized protein YciF was up-regulated, whereas another protein PagC was down-regulated, by bile (37Prouty A.M. Brodsky I.E. Manos J. Belas R. Falkow S. Gunn J.S. Transcriptional regulation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genes by bile.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 41 (15145463): 177-18510.1016/j.femsim.2004.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, the qRT-PCR data demonstrated a concomitant down-regulation of pagC in WT and ΔcspE with bile salts stress (Fig. S6). Notably, the bile-dependent up-regulation of yciF was observed in the WT strain with bile treatment but was absent in the ΔcspE strain (Fig. 2A). Consequently, we hypothesized that yciF might be a downstream target of CspE. To delineate the role of YciF, the ΔyciF and ΔcspEΔyciF strains were generated, and the growth kinetics of WT, ΔcspE, ΔyciF, and ΔcspEΔyciF in the absence (0%) or presence (3%) of bile salts was performed. In the absence of bile salts, the growth kinetics was indistinguishable for all four strains (Fig. S7). In the presence of 3% bile salts, the WT and ΔyciF strains showed similar growth while the ΔcspE and ΔcspEΔyciF strains showed severe growth attenuation with an approximate 6-h growth delay. To elaborate on the importance of yciF, we utilized the yciF overexpression system (WT/pyciF and ΔcspE/pyciF). Upon yciF overexpression, phenotype suppression was observed in the bile salts–treated ΔcspE (Table 1). These observations indicated two major aspects of YciF. First, the genetic data with the four strains demonstrated that YciF may not be the sole downstream player in the bile regulation pathway of CspE. Second, increases in YciF levels are capable of imparting bile resistance even in the absence of CspE. Most likely, CspE regulates multiple proteins, and this study has identified one target, i.e. YciF, which is important to counter bile stress.Table 1Overexpression of yciF suppresses the bile sensitivity of ΔcspETimeWT/VAWT/pcspEWT/pcspE-F30VWT/pyciFΔcspE/VAΔcspE/pcspEΔcspE/pcspE-F30VΔcspE/pyciFh0% bile salts 05.72 ± 0.595.52 ± 0.486.25 ± 0.075.51 ± 0.535.83 ± 0.285.54 ± 0.116.35 ± 0.075.33 ± 0.29 69.35 ± 0.189.48 ± 0.178.68 ± 0.389.42 ± 0.139.65 ± 0.119.57 ± 0.088.63 ± 0.229.51 ± 0.06 1211.14 ± 0.4411.48 ± 0.1510.55 ± 0.1310.72 ± 0.1510.58 ± 0.0211.36 ± 0.4210.47 ± 0.1610.81 ± 0.423% bile salts 05.69 ± 0.644.59 ± 0.156.47 ± 0.125.1 ± 0.524.06 ± 0.825.15 ± 0.444.01 ± 0.335.73 ± 0.23 68.52 ± 0.238.80 ± 0.268.37 ± 0.187.79 ± 0.514.59 ± 0.73#8.50 ± 0.414a5.1 ± 0.34#7.61 ± 0.2b 1210.55 ± 0.2411 ± 0.2110.56 ± 0.3110.04 ± 0.55.71 ± 0.34#10.71 ± 0.72a5.68 ± 0.47#11.31 ± 0.26a Open table in a new tab To understand the exact mechanism of YciF regulation by CspE and to distinguish between transcriptional regulation and mRNA stability, we utilized a rifampicin-based approach (38Smirnov A. Wang C. Drewry L.L. Vogel J. Molecular mechanism of mRNA repression in trans by a ProQ-dependent small RNA.EMBO J. 2017; 36 (28336682): 1029-104510.15252/embj.201696127Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Overexpression of yciF (under the trc promoter in the pTrc99A plasmid) was utilized. Initial experiments were performed with qRT-PCR, which revealed a reduced level of yciF mRNA in ΔcspE irrespective of rifampicin (Fig. S8). Further confirmation was obtained from Northern hybridization experiments, which demonstrated that in the absence of cspE the cells harbored lesser amounts of yciF mRNA despite using an overexpression system. Furthermore, in the presence of rifampicin, i.e. in the absence of any active transcription, there was hastened decay of the yciF mRNA. It is unlikely that CspE regulates the transcription of yciF. Despite the overexpression of yciF from a heterologous promoter, there is a significantly lesser amount of yciF transcript in the ΔcspE strain (ΔcspE/pyciF), compared with the WT, even in the absence of rifampicin (Fig. 3B). Most likely, CspE regulates YciF by mRNA stabilization and preventing its degradation. To better understand the regulation of YciF by"

To study the biochemistry of eRF3 and PAIP1/2 competition for PABP binding, we quantified the effects of PAIPs on translation termination in the presence or absence of PABP. Our results demonstrated that both PAIP1 and PAIP2 prevented translation termination at the premature termination codon, by controlling PABP activity.

However, after binding the poly(A) tail, PABP became insensitive to suppression by PAIPs and efficiently activated translation termination in the presence of eRF3a.

https://openalex.org/W2939920725,"To evaluate the utility of transect sampling for assessing animal welfare in large chicken flocks, we quantified relationships between environmental inputs, welfare problems detected using transect sampling, and production outcomes. We hypothesised that environmental inputs including environmental complexity (i.e. number of environmental enrichment types provided), space allowance, underfloor heating (presence or absence), and photoperiod regimen (18 h continuous vs 16 h intermittent) would correspond to variations in welfare assessment findings, which would predict production outcomes. We conducted on-farm welfare assessment of Norwegian broiler flocks at approximately 28 days of age. We sampled four transects (rows between feeder and drinker lines) per flock to determine litter quality and the proportions of chickens with compromised welfare as indicated by visual signs of walking difficulties, illness, skin wounds and small bird size. Production outcome measures included mortality, reasons for carcass rejection at slaughter, footpad dermatitis, growth rate, feed conversion and an integrated production index. Greater environmental complexity was associated with a reduction in skin wounds and total welfare problems on the farm, lower mortality, fewer rejections due to wounds and underweight birds, and fewer rejections overall. Higher space allowances within levels of environmental complexity were associated with fewer walking difficulties and welfare problems overall, a reduction in rejections due to wounds, and a higher growth rate and production index. Underfloor heating was associated with a reduction in rejections due to leg deformity, and intermittent light was associated with lower illness and skin wound rates on the farm, and lower mortality. Furthermore, fewer welfare problems and better litter quality on the farm were associated with fewer carcass rejections at slaughter. Thus, data from transect sampling varied with environmental inputs and production outcomes, supporting the validity of transect sampling for practical, animal-based on-farm welfare assessment."

Various splice variants of POSTN have been described; however, their expression pattern and functional implications are not completely understood. This study was undertaken to decipher the differential expression pattern of POSTN and its splice variants in various tissues and cell types. We show that POSTN was more highly expressed in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remnants compared with articular cartilage at the cellular and tissue level. Isoforms 1 and 8 were highly expressed only in articular chondrocytes, suggesting their splice-specific regulation in chondrocytes. To discern the role of total POSTN and full-length human POSTN isoform 1 (hPOSTN-001), we stably transfected human chondrosarcoma 1 (hCh-1) cell line with hPOSTN-001 using a pcDNA3.1-hPOSTN-001 construct. RNA-sequencing analysis of hCh-1 cells identified differentially expressed genes with a known role in chondrocyte function and osteoarthritis. Similar expression of a subset of candidate genes was revealed in ACL progenitor cells and chondrocytes as well as in ACL progenitor cells in which POSTN activity was altered by overexpression and by small interfering RNA gene knockdown. Cells expressing total POSTN, not isoform 1, exhibited increased cell adhesion potential. These findings suggest an important role for POSTN in the knee.-Cai, L., Brophy, R. H., Tycksen, E.

https://openalex.org/W2936752872,"Cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B member 1 (CYP26B1) regulates the concentration of all–trans retinoic acid (RA) and plays a key role in germ cell differentiation by controlling local distribution of RA. The mechanisms regulating Cyp26b1 expression in postnatal Sertoli cells, the main components of the stem cell niche, are so far unknown. During gonad development, expression of Cyp26b1 is maintained by Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) and Sex-Determining Region Y. Box-9 (SOX9), which ensure that RA is degraded and germ cell differentiation is blocked. Here, we show that the NOTCH target Hairy/Enhancer-of-Split Related with YRPW Motif 1 (HEY1), a transcriptional repressor, regulates germ cell differentiation via direct binding to the Cyp26b1 promoter and thus inhibits its expression in Sertoli cells. Further, using in vivo germ cell ablation, we demonstrate that undifferentiated type A spermatogonia are the cells that activate NOTCH signaling in Sertoli cells through their expression of the NOTCH ligand JAGGED-1 (JAG1) at stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, therefore mediating germ cell differentiation by a ligand concentration-dependent process. These data therefore provide more insights into the mechanisms of germ cell differentiation after birth and potentially explain the spatiotemporal RA pulses driving the transition between undifferentiated to differentiating spermatogonia.—Parekh, P.

https://openalex.org/W2937159442,"Vascular hyperpermeability caused by distorted endothelial cell-cell junctions is associated with the no-reflow phenomenon after opening of the occluded vessels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Coronary no-reflow is observed in ∼30% of CAD patients after percutaneous coronary stenting and is associated with a worse prognosis at follow-up and a higher incidence of death. However, limited tools are available to control vascular hyperpermeability and no-reflow. Losartan, an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker acting on the Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1R) subtype, is a prescription drug for treating hypertension. Here we show that in a murine model of ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), losartan blocked vascular hyperpermeability and decreased infarct size, hemorrhages, edema, and inflammation. Mechanistically, losartan-mediated inhibition of vascular hyperpermeability is mediated by the inhibition of phosphorylation of Src and vascular endothelial Cadherin (VE-cadherin), which increases VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)–Src-VE-cadherin complex formation, resulting in increased cell surface VE-cadherin and inhibition of vascular hyperpermeability. On the other hand, hypoxia and reoxygenation increased the phosphorylation levels of Src and VE-cadherin and reduced the formation of the VEGFR2-Src–VE-cadherin complex, which led to reduced cell surface VE-cadherin and increased vascular hyperpermeability; all were inhibited by losartan. These data suggest that losartan may be used for blocking vascular hyperpermeability associated with I/R.—Li, Y., Yao, Y., Li, J., Chen, Q., Zhang, L., Wang, Q. K.

https://openalex.org/W2940255272,"Hedgehog proteins are pivotal morphogens acting through a canonical pathway involving first activation of ligand binding to Patched followed by alleviation of Smoothened receptor inhibition, leading to activation of Gli transcription factors. Noncanonical Hedgehog signaling remains poorly characterized but is thought to be mainly dependent on Smoothened. However, Smoothened inhibitors have yielded only partial success in combating Hedgehog signal transduction–dependent cancer, suggesting that noncanonical Smoothened-independent pathways also are clinically relevant. Moreover, several Smoothened-dependent effects (e.g. neurite projection) do not require transcriptional activation, further suggesting biological importance of noncanonical Smoothened-dependent pathways. We comprehensively characterized the cellular kinome in Hedgehog-challenged murine WT and Smoothened−/− fibroblasts as well as Smoothened agonist–stimulated cells. A peptide assay–based kinome analysis (in which cell lysates are used to phosphorylate specific kinase substrates), along with endocytosis, Lucifer Yellow–based, and immunoblotting assays, identified an elaborate signaling network of both Smoothened-dependent and -independent pathways that mediates actin reorganization through Src-like kinases, activates various proinflammatory signaling cascades, and concomitantly stimulates Wnt and Notch signaling while suppressing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The contribution of noncanonical Smoothened-independent signaling to the overall effects of Hedgehog on cellular physiology appears to be much larger than previously envisioned and may explain the transcriptionally independent effects of Hedgehog signaling on cytoskeleton. The observation that Patched-dependent, Smoothened-independent, noncanonical Hedgehog signaling increases Wnt/Notch signaling provides a possible explanation for the failure of Smoothened antagonists in combating Hedgehog-dependent but Smoothened inhibitor–resistant cancer. Our findings suggest that inhibiting Hedgehog–Patched interaction could result in more effective therapies as compared with conventional Smoothened-directed therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2939915810,"Damage-induced long noncoding RNA (DINO) is a long noncoding RNA that directly interacts with p53 and thereby enhances p53 stability and activity in response to various cellular stresses. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3 (NR2E3) plays a crucial role in maintaining active DINO epigenetic status for its proper induction and subsequent p53 activation. In acetaminophen (APAP)- or carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injuries, NR2E3 knockout (KO) mice exhibited far more severe liver injuries due to impaired DINO induction and p53 activation. Mechanistically, NR2E3 loss both in vivo and in vitro induced epigenetic DINO repression accompanied by reduced DINO chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, compared with the efficient reversal by a typical antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment of APAP-induced liver injury in wild-type mice, the liver injury of NR2E3 KO mice was not effectively reversed, indicating that an intact NR2E3-DINO-p53–signaling axis is essential for NAC-mediated recovery against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. These findings establish that NR2E3 is a critical component in p53 activation and a novel susceptibility factor to drug- or toxicant-induced acute liver injuries.—Khanal, T., Leung, Y.-K., Jiang, W., Timchenko, N., Ho, S.-M., Kim, K.

https://openalex.org/W2937689553,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to be a major public health concern in the United Kingdom (UK). Epidemiological models have shown that narrowing the time between STI diagnosis and treatment may reduce the population burden of infection, and rapid, accurate point-of-care tests (POCTs) have potential for increasing correct treatment and mitigating the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We developed the Precise social science programme to incorporate clinician and patient opinions on potential designs and implementation of new POCTs for multiple STIs and AMR detection. We conducted qualitative research, consisting of informal interviews with clinicians and semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients, in six sexual health clinics in the UK. Interviews with clinicians focused on how the new POCTs would likely be implemented into clinical care; these new clinical pathways were then posed to patients in in-depth interviews. Patient interviews showed acceptability of POCTs, however, willingness to wait in clinic for test results depended on the context of patients’ sexual healthcare seeking. Patients reporting frequent healthcare visits often based their expectations and opinions of services and POCTs on previous visits. Patients’ suggestions for implementation of POCTs included provision of information on service changes and targeting tests to patients concerned they are infected. Our data suggests that patients may accept new POCT pathways if they are given information on these changes prior to attending services and to consider implementing POCTs among patients who are anxious about their infection status and/or who are experiencing symptoms."

Policy and other efforts need to address and acknowledge these differences in order to reduce inequalities in health burden. This paper examines rural health policy makers' perceptions and use of evidence in efforts to reduce the burden of IHD in rural areas.Policy makers and government advisors (n = 21) who worked with, or advised on, rural health policy at local, state and federal government levels, with specific focus on the state of Victoria (n = 9) were identified from publicly available documents and subsequent snowball sample. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in regards to the use of evidence in policy to prevent IHD and thematic analysis undertaken applying two theoretical perspectives: context-based evidence-based policy making and the conceptual framework for understanding rural and remote health.The rural context, particularly low resourcing, was seen as limiting potential for evidence based policy at local government (LG) level. Lower levels of political pressure and education were seen as constraints to evidence-based policy in rural communities. Participants described the potential for policy to have a greater impact on reducing heart disease in rural areas though they felt under-resourced and out of touch with the scientific evidence. Scientific studies were less valued than local anecdote to prioritise specific policy. At all levels (local, state and federal) low self-efficacy in interpreting evidence and perceived lack of relevance inhibited development of evidence informed policy.The rural context constrains the use of scientific evidence in policy making for the prevention of heart disease in rural areas in Australia with multiple factors influencing the capacity for evidenced based health policy. This is similar to findings at the international scale and is for consideration across other developed countries that experience inequalities in IHD disease burden between rural and urban populations."

Here we report foot lesions in 24 huemul from Bernardo O’Higgins National Park, Chile, between 2005 and 2010. Affected deer displayed variably severe clinical signs, including lameness and soft tissue swelling of the limbs proximal to the hoof or in the interdigital space, ulceration of the swollen tissues, and some developed severe proliferative tissue changes that caused various types of abnormal wear, entrapment, and/or displacement of the hooves and/or dewclaws. Animals showed signs of intense pain and reduced mobility followed by loss of body condition and recumbency, which often preceded death. The disease affected both genders and all age categories. Morbidity and mortality reached 80% and 40%, respectively. Diagnostics were restricted to a limited number of cases from which samples were available. Histology revealed severe papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia and superficial dermatitis. Electron microscopy identified viral particles consistent with viruses in the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily. The presence of parapoxvirus DNA was confirmed by a pan-poxvirus PCR assay, showing high identity (98%) with bovine papular stomatitis virus and pseudocowpoxvirus. This is the first report of foot disease in huemul deer in Chile, putatively attributed to poxvirus. Given the high morbidity and mortality observed, this virus might pose a considerable conservation threat to huemul deer in Chilean Patagonia.

The homologues qdpra is essential for pigmentation and phenylalanine metabolism. Qdprb1 is expressed in the proliferative zones of the optic tectum and eye.

Email invitations to join the study were sent to 4525 crowd-funding participants from the US. Those completing a baseline survey were sent a device with follow-up surveys at 3, 12, and 18 months. Of 3872 participants receiving a device, 3473 used it during Week 1, decreasing to 1633 (47 percent) in Week 2. Median time from first use of the device to last use was 17 weeks (IQR: 5–51 weeks) and median uses per week was 1.0 (IQR: 0.6–2.0). Consistent long-term use (defined as remaining in the study at least 26 weeks with at least 3 recordings per week during at least 80% of weeks) was associated with older age, not having children in the household, and frequent use of other medical devices. In the subset of participants answering the 12-month survey (n = 1222), consistent long-term users were more likely to consider the device easy to use and to share results with a healthcare provider. Thirty percent of this subset overall reported improved diet or exercise habits and 25 percent considered medication changes in response to device results. The study shows that even among investors in a device, frequency of device usage fell off rapidly.

https://openalex.org/W2936155254,"Lifespan and healthspan machines can undergo C. elegans image segmentation errors due to changes in lighting conditions, which produce non-uniform images. Most C. elegans monitoring machines use backlight techniques based on the transparency of both the container and media. Backlight illumination obtains high-contrast images with dark C. elegans and a bright background. However, changes in illumination or media transparency conditions can produce non-uniform images, which are currently alleviated by image processing techniques. Besides, these machines should avoid C. elegans exposure to light as much as possible because light stresses worms, and can even affect their lifespan, mainly when using (1) long exposure times, (2) high intensities or (3) wavelengths that come close to ultraviolet. However, if short exposure of worms to light is required for visual monitoring, then light can also be used as a movement stimulus. In this paper, an active backlight method is analysed. The proposed method consists of controlling the light intensities and wavelengths of an illumination dots matrix with PID regulators. These regulators adapt illumination to some changing conditions. The experimental results shows that this method simplifies the image segmentation problem because it is able to automatically compensate not only changes in media transparency throughout assay days, but also changes in ambient conditions, such as smooth condensation on the lid and light derivatives of the illumination source during its lifetime. In addition, the strategic application of wavelengths could be adapted for the requirements of each assay. For instance, a specific control strategy has been proposed to minimise stress to worms and trying to stimulate C. elegans movement in lifespan assays."

Based on the above considerations, this study aimed to verify the possible use of saliva for the detection of IgE and IgG1 in the diagnosis of food allergy. This was a randomized, cross-sectional clinical study with a quantitative approach, developed at a hospital referral center in allergy in the state of Ceará, from January to July 2015. The sample consisted of 36 children of both sexes, aged between 1 and 60 months, with a diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) by the RAST test. Children hospitalized or under immunosuppressive drugs were excluded from the study. Serum and saliva samples of the participants were collected and subsequently subjected to the indirect immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) for the detection of specific serum and salivary immunoglobulins for food: corn, papaya, cow's milk, egg white, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, nuts, kiwi, cacao, fish, shrimp, bananas and tomatoes. For comparison of serum and saliva results, the T-test of independent samples and Mann-Whitney were adopted, for samples with normal and non-normal distribution respectively. A confidence interval of 95% was adopted for significant results. It was observed that 100% (n = 36) of the participants presented cow's milk allergy through the indirect ELISA, detecting IgE or IgG1 in serum and saliva. When serum IgE and IgG1 concentrations were compared, there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in 12 of the 14 foods evaluated. The same amount (n = 12) of non-significant differences (p > 0.05) was observed in the comparison of the 14 foods under IgE and IgG1 contractions in saliva. In the verification of the average values of IgE present in the serum and saliva of the foods, only cow's milk, fish and papaya showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Of the total food evaluated, only the average levels of IgG1 present in serum and saliva showed a significant value (p < 0.05) in banana and tomato. These findings indicate that the detection of IgE and IgG1 in saliva proves to be as efficient as in the serum. The use of the salivary technique for use in the diagnosis of food allergy is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2940397882,"In this study, a modified method of handmade cloning (m-HMC), which had been originally developed in sheep, was used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in the dromedary camel. The unique feature of m-HMC over current SCNT methods lies in the use of a simple device (a finely drawn micropipette made of Pasteur pipette) for chemically-assisted enucleation of oocytes under a stereomicroscope with improved efficiency and ease of operation. Using this system, the throughput of cloned embryo reconstitution was increased over 2-fold compared to the control SCNT method (c-NT). Stepwise measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed that method, steps, and duration of SCNT all influenced oxidative activity of oocytes, but their impact were not similar. Specifically, UV-assisted oocyte enucleation was identified as the major source of ROS production, which explained significantly higher total ROS of reconstituted embryos in c-NT compared to m-HMC. Fusion efficiency (95.3±3.3 vs. 75.4±7.6%) and total efficiency of blastocyst development (22.5±3.0 vs. 14.1±4.3%) were significantly higher in m-HMC compared to c-NT, respectively, and blastocysts of transferable quality were obtained in similar rates (41.9±8.2 vs. 48.0±15.2%, respectively). Significance differences were observed in total cell number (155.3±13.6 vs. 123.6±19.5) and trophectoderm (145±9.5 vs. 114.3±15.2), but not inner cell mass (10.3±4.1 vs. 9.3±5.3) counts between blastocysts developed in c-NT compared to m-HMC, respectively. However, expression of key developmental genes (POU5F1, KLF4, SOX2, MYC, and CDX2) was comparable between blastocysts of both groups. The introduced m-HMC method might be a viable approach for efficient production of dromedary camel clones for research and commercial utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2949856945,"Biomarkers are fundamental to basic and clinical research outcomes by reporting host responses and providing insight into disease pathophysiology. Measuring biomarkers with research-use ELISA kits is universal, yet lack of kit standardization and unexpected lot-to-lot variability presents analytic challenges for long-term projects. During an ongoing two-year project measuring plasma biomarkers in cancer patients, control concentrations for one biomarker (PF) decreased significantly after changes in ELISA kit lots. A comprehensive operations review pointed to standard curve shifts with the new kits, an analytic variable that jeopardized data already collected on hundreds of patient samples. After excluding other reasonable contributors to data variability, a computational solution was developed to provide a uniform platform for data analysis across multiple ELISA kit lots. The solution (ELISAtools) was developed within open-access R software in which variability between kits is treated as a batch effect. A defined best-fit Reference standard curve is modelled, a unique Shift factor ""S"" is calculated for every standard curve and data adjusted accordingly. The averaged S factors for PF ELISA kit lots #1-5 ranged from -0.086 to 0.735, and reduced control inter-assay variability from 62.4% to <9%, within quality control limits. S factors calculated for four other biomarkers provided a quantitative metric to monitor ELISAs over the 10 month study period for quality control purposes. Reproducible biomarker measurements are essential, particularly for long-term projects with valuable patient samples. Use of research-use ELISA kits is ubiquitous and judicious use of this computational solution maximizes biomarker reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W2936383248,"Over the past several decades archaeologists have used the spinal pathology spondylosis deformans as an indicator that archaeological dogs were used to pull or carry loads. This interpretive approach is largely based upon observations of prehistoric dog remains and archaeologist’s interpretations of veterinary literature on recent sled dogs and other draft animals. However, no comparative large-scale studies of the occurrence of spondylosis deformans in wild canids, transport dogs, and dogs never involved in pulling or carrying loads have been published. To evaluate the reliability of spondylosis deformans in archaeological dogs as an indicator of participation in transport activities, 136 modern non-transport dogs, 19 sled dogs, and 241 wolves were systematically analyzed for the occurrence of spondylosis deformans. Our results indicate this pathology is not a reliable skeletal indicator of dog transport because the disease is prevalent in both dogs and wolves, regardless of their occupational histories. Numerous factors correlate with the occurrence and manifestation of this disease in canids, including age, body size, sex, and inbreeding. As such, it remains extremely challenging to identify specific etiologies for spondylosis deformans in archaeological specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2939853458,"The aim of this experiment was to assess if the previously supported relationship between the structure of motor variability and performance changes when the task or organismic constraints encourage individuals to adjust their movement to achieve a goal. Forty-two healthy volunteers (aged 26.05 ± 5.02 years) performed three sets of cyclic pointing movements, 600 cycles each. Every set was performed under different conditions: 1) without a target; 2) with a target; 3) with a target and a financial reward. The amount of performance variability was analysed using the standard deviation of the medial-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes and the bivariate variable error. The structure of the variability was assessed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of the following time series: the coordinate values of the endpoint in ML, AP axes and resultant distance (RD), the hand orientation and the movement time. The performance of the task constrained with a target, or a target and reward, required higher implication to adjust an individual’s movements to achieve the task goal, showing a decrease in dispersions and lower autocorrelation. Under the condition without a target, variability dispersion was positively related to autocorrelation of the movement values from ML axis and RD time series, and negatively related to the values from the hand orientation time series. There was a loss of the relationship between variability structure and performance when the task was constrained by the target and the reward. That could indicate different strategies of the participants to achieve the objective. Considering the results and previous studies, the relationship between variability structure and performance could depend on task constraints such as feedback, difficulty or the skill level of participants and it is mediated by individual constraints such as implication or intentionality."
https://openalex.org/W2940343626,"Antimicrobial resistance happens when microorganisms mutates in manners that render the drugs like antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal, ineffective. The normal mutation process is encouraged by the improper use of antibiotics. Mutations leading to quinolone resistance occur in a highly conserved region of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrAse and topoisomerase IV gene. We analyzed antibiotic resistant genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in gyrA and parC genes in QRDR in 120 E. coli isolates (both diarrheagenic and non-pathogenic) recovered from fresh stool samples collected from children aged less than 5 years from Delhi, India. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to standard clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines. Phylogenetic analysis showed the clonal diversity and phylogenetic relationships among the E. coli isolates. The SNP analysis depicted mutations in gyrA and parC genes in QRDR. The sul1 gene, responsible for sulfonamide resistance, was present in almost half (47.5%) of the isolates across the diseased and healthy samples. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes in E. coli isolates from healthy children indicate the development, dissemination and carriage of antibiotic resistance in their gut. Our observations suggest the implementation of active surveillance and stewardship programs to promote appropriate antibiotic use and minimizing further danger."
https://openalex.org/W2938477558,"Interferon α (IFNα) counteracts viral infections by activating various IFNα-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes encode proteins that block viral transport into the host cell and inhibit viral replication, gene transcription and translation. Due to the existence of 14 different, highly homologous isoforms of mouse IFNα, an IFNα knockout mouse has not yet been established by genetic knockout strategies. An scFv intrabody for holding back IFNα isoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thus counteracting IFNα secretion is reported. The intrabody was constructed from the variable domains of the anti-mouse IFNα rat monoclonal antibody 4EA1 recognizing the 5 isoforms IFNα1, IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα5, IFNα6. A soluble form of the intrabody had a KD of 39 nM to IFNα4. It could be demonstrated that the anti-IFNα intrabody inhibits clearly recombinant IFNα4 secretion by HEK293T cells. In addition, the secretion of IFNα4 was effectively inhibited in stably transfected intrabody expressing RAW 264.7 macrophages and dendritic D1 cells. Colocalization of the intrabody with IFNα4 and the ER marker calnexin in HEK293T cells indicated complex formation of intrabody and IFNα4 inside the ER. Intracellular binding of intrabody and antigen was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Complexes of endogenous IFNα and intrabody could be visualized in the ER of Poly (I:C) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and D1 dendritic cells. Infection of macrophages and dendritic cells with the vesicular stomatitis virus VSV-AV2 is attenuated by IFNα and IFNβ. The intrabody increased virus proliferation in RAW 264.7 macrophages and D1 dendritic cells under IFNβ-neutralizing conditions. To analyze if all IFNα isoforms are recognized by the intrabody was not in the focus of this study. Provided that binding of the intrabody to all isoforms was confirmed, the establishment of transgenic intrabody mice would be promising for studying the function of IFNα during viral infection and autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2938969989,"It is well known that people who read print or braille sometimes make eye or finger movements against the reading direction. The way these regressions are elicited has been studied in detail by manipulating linguistic aspects of the reading material. Actually, it has been shown that reducing the physical intensity or clarity of the visual input signal can also lead to increased regressions during reading. We asked whether the same might be true in the haptic realm while reading braille. We set the height of braille dots at three different levels (high, medium, and low) and asked adult blind, practiced braille readers to read standardized texts without any repetition of content. The results show that setting the braille dot height near the tactile threshold significantly increased the frequency of regressive finger movements. Additionally, at the lowest braille dot height, braille reading speed significantly diminished. These effects did not occur at braille dot heights that were closer to the height of standard braille (medium and high). We tentatively conclude that this effect may be due to a heightened sense of uncertainty elicited by perception near the threshold that seems to be common to the reading process, independent of the sensory input modality. Furthermore, the described effect may be a feature of a brain area that contributes to the reading process mediated by vision as well as touch."
https://openalex.org/W2939230737,"The study of domestic money goes at the heart of debates about independence and equality in intimate relationships. It provides an important window on the individualization of family life and how couples reconcile ideals around egalitarian marriage ideologies with enduring gender inequality in society and the labor market. This study approaches these issues from the prism of couples’ banking arrangements (separate vs. joint accounts), an aspect of financial organization that approximates the executive management of household resources and which has received comparatively little attention. As such, it is amongst the first to deploy large-scale, household panel data (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, n = 15,379 observations from 7,054 couples) and binary and multinomial random-effect logistic regression models to examine trends over time in couples’ banking arrangements and their socio-demographic predictors. Key findings indicate that a large share of couples in Australia favors ‘mixed’ bank account strategies (i.e., holding both joint and separate accounts), but ‘egalitarian’ choices (i.e., dual separate accounts) are prevalent and on the rise. Couples’ bank account choices are influenced in theoretically-meaningful ways by economic resources, transaction costs, relationship history, gender-role attitudes, and family background."
https://openalex.org/W2939771133,"Vital registration data outlining causes of deaths (CoD) are important for a sustainable health system, targeted interventions and other relevant policies. There is data paucity on vital registration systems in developing countries. We assessed the leading causes and proportions of under-five deaths, and particularly those related to pneumococcal infections in Yaoundé, Cameroon, using hospital registration data.A retrospective case-finding observational study design was used to access and identify data on 817 death cases in children under-five years of age recorded in health facilities in Yaoundé, within the period January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2012. Patients' files were randomly selected and needed information including demographic data, date of admission, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, principal and/or underlying causes of death were abstracted into structured case report forms. The International Classification of Diseases and Clinical Modifications 10th revision (ICD-10-CM) codes (ICD10Data.com 2017 edition) were used to classify the different CoD, retrospectively. Ascertainment of CoD was based on medical report and estimates were done using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and descriptive statistics.Of the 817 death records assessed, malaria was the leading CoD and was responsible for 17.5% of cases. Meningitis was the second largest CoD with 11.0%; followed by sepsis (10.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (8.3%), malnutrition (8.3%), gastro-enteritis / diarrhoea (6.2%), anaemia (6.1%) and HIV (3.5%), respectively.The main CoD in this population are either treatable or vaccine-preventable; a trend consistent with previous reports across developing countries. Besides, the health effects from non-communicable infections should not be neglected. Therefore, scaling-up measures to reduce causes of under-five deaths will demand sustainable efforts to enhance both treatment and disease prevention strategies, to avoid a decline in the progress towards reducing under-five deaths by 2/3 from the 1990 baseline."
https://openalex.org/W2953314816,"Recent high-throughput-sequencing of cancer genomes has identified oncogenic mutations in the B-Raf genetic locus as one of the critical events in melanomagenesis. B-Raf encodes a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) protein kinase cascade. In normal cells, the activity of B-Raf is tightly regulated and is required for cell growth and survival. B-Raf gain-of-function mutations in melanoma frequently lead to unrestrained growth, enhanced cell invasion and increased viability of cancer cells. Although it is clear that the invasive phenotypes of B-Raf mutated melanoma cells are stringently dependent on B-Raf-MEK-ERK activation, the downstream effector targets that are required for oncogenic B-Raf-mediated melanomagenesis are not well defined. miRNAs have regulatory functions towards the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis. We observed that miR-10b expression correlates with the presence of the oncogenic B-Raf (B-RafV600E) mutation in melanoma cells. While expression of miR-10b enhances anchorage-independent growth of B-Raf wild-type melanoma cells, miR-10b silencing decreases B-RafV600E cancer cell invasion in vitro. Importantly, the expression of miR-10b is required for B-RafV600E-mediated anchorage independent growth and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that miR-10b is an important mediator of oncogenic B-RafV600E activity in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2937814347,"The principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate plays an important role in many central nervous system disorders. Because glutamate resides predominantly in glutamatergic neurons, its relaxation properties reflect the intracellular environment of glutamatergic neurons. This study developed an improved echo time-independent technique for measuring transverse relaxation time and demonstrated that this radio frequency (RF)-driven longitudinal steady state technique can reliably measure glutamate transverse relaxation in the frontal cortex, where structural and functional abnormalities have been associated with psychiatric symptoms.Bloch and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to improve and optimize the RF-driven, longitudinal, steady-state (MARzss) technique to significantly shorten scan time and increase measurement precision. Optimized four-flip angle measurements at 0°,12°, 24°, and 36° with matched repetition time were used in nine human subjects (6F, 3M; 27-49 years old) at 7 Tesla. Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates for glutamate were measured from a 2 x 2 x 2 cm3 voxel placed in three different brain regions: gray matter-dominated medial prefrontal lobe, white matter-dominated left frontal lobe, and gray matter-dominated occipital lobe.Compared to the original MARzss technique, the scan time per voxel for measuring glutamate transverse relaxation was shortened by more than 50%. In the medial frontal, left frontal, and occipital voxels, the glutamate T2 was found to be 117.5±12.9 ms (mean ± standard deviation, n = 9), 107.3±12.1 (n = 9), and 124.4±16.6 ms (n = 8), respectively.The improvements described in this study make the MARZSS technique a viable tool for reliably measuring glutamate relaxation from human subjects in a typical clinical setting. It is expected that this improved technique can be applied to characterize the intracellular environment of glutamatergic neurons in a variety of brain disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2937543625,"In the carrier-based coverage repair problem, a single mobile robot replaces damaged sensors by picking up spare ones in the region of interest or carrying them from a base station in wireless sensor and robot networks. The objective is to find the shortest path of the robot. The problem is an extension of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Thus, it is also called the one-commodity traveling salesman problem with selective pickup and delivery (1-TSP-SELPD). In order to solve this problem in a larger sensor distribution scenario more efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach in this paper. In the first stage, the mature and effective Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm is used to form a Hamiltonian cycle for all delivery nodes, which is regarded as a heuristic for the second stage. In the second stage, elliptical regions are set for selecting pickup nodes' and an edge-ordered list (candidate edge list, CEL) is constructed to provide major axes for the ellipses. The process of selecting pickup nodes and constructing the CEL is repeated until all the delivery nodes are visited. The final CEL stores a feasible solution. To update it, three operations-expansion, extension, and constriction-are applied to the CEL. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the computing time and achieves better results in higher-dimensional problems, which may facilitate the provision of solutions for more complicated sensor networks and can contribute to the development of effective and efficient algorithms for the one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem (1-PDTSP)."
https://openalex.org/W2937837612,"Corn earworm (CEW), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a major insect pest of corn (Zea mays spp. mays L.). CEW larvae feed on silks, kernels and cobs, causing substantial yield and quality losses both through herbivory and by vectoring pathogens. The long-term goal of this work is to elucidate the genetic and biochemical basis of a potentially novel CEW resistance source discovered in silk tissue of Piura 208, a Peruvian landrace of maize (PI 503849). We developed a quantitative CEW bioassay and tested it on four populations that contrast alleles from Piura 208 with those from GT119, a CEW-susceptible maize inbred line. In replicated analyses of two populations of F1:2 families, corn genotype accounts for 84% and 68% of the variance in CEW larval weights, and up to 60% of the variance in CEW pupation percentage, demonstrating both the success of the quantitative bioassay and the strength of the Piura 208 resistance mechanism. Analyses of two corresponding populations of BC1:2 families revealed substantially diminished effects of corn genotype on CEW weight gain and pupation. This loss of Piura 208-derived CEW resistance during backcrossing suggests complex (multi-genic) inheritance of a threshold-dependent mechanism. Technical factors in bioassay performance were also assessed, often by analyzing the 1,641 CEW larvae that were raised on control diet (meridic with no corn silks added). Minor, but statistically significant impacts on CEW weight gain, pupation, and mortality were attributable to multiple technical factors in the preparation, incubation and evaluation phases of the bioassay, demonstrating the importance of randomization, stratification, replication, and variable-tracking across the many steps of this quantitative CEW bioassay. Overall, these findings indicate that this scaled-up, quantitative CEW bioassay is fundamentally sound and that Piura 208-derived resistance alleles are experimentally tractable for genetic and mechanistic research using this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2939903074,"We aimed to establish a fluorescence intensity-based colony area sweeping method by selecting the area of highest viability among patient-derived cancer cells (PDC) which has high tumor heterogeneity. Five gastric cancer cell lines and PDCs were screened with 24 small molecule compounds using a 3D micropillar/microwell chip. 100 tumor cells per well were immobilized in alginate, treated with the compounds, and then stained and scanned for viable cells. Dose response curves and IC50 values were obtained based on total or selected area intensity based on fluorescence. Unlike homogeneous cell lines, PDC comprised of debris and low-viability cells, which resulted in an inaccurate estimation of cell viability using total fluorescence intensity as determined by high IC50 values. However, the IC50 of these cells was lower and accurate when calculated based on the selected-colony-area method that eliminated the intensity offset associated with the heterogeneous nature of PDC. The selected-colony-area method was optimized to accurately predict drug response in micropillar environment using heterogeneous nature of PDCs."
