Here, we present the discovery of a 36-kilo-base pair DNA fragment from Vibrio splendidus encoding enzymes for alginate transport and metabolism. The genomic integration of this ensemble, together with an engineered system for extracellular alginate depolymerization, generated a microbial platform that can simultaneously degrade, uptake, and metabolize alginate. When further engineered for ethanol synthesis, this platform enables bioethanol production directly from macroalgae via a consolidated process, achieving a titer of 4.7% volume/volume and a yield of 0.281 weight ethanol/weight dry macroalgae (equivalent to ~80% of the maximum theoretical yield from the sugar composition in macroalgae)."

Besides binding G proteins, activated β 2 AR can be phosphorylated and bind arrestin, which redirects signaling to other pathways. Some β 2 AR ligands are “biased” in that they differentially activate G protein or arrestin signaling. Liu et al. (p. 1106 , published online 19 January; see the Perspective by Sprang and Chief Elk ) used 19 F-NMR spectroscopy to examine conformational changes associated with a range of ligands and discovered that biased ligands caused differential shifts in equilibrium between two conformational states—the G protein binding state and the arrestin binding state—and thus provide a basis for rational design of pharmacological ligands."

Using a method to extract small earthquakes that are often obscured by overlapping seismic waves, Kato et al. (p. 705 , published online 19 January) identified over a thousand small repeating earthquakes that migrated slowly toward the hypocenter of the main rupture. Based on the properties of these foreshocks, the plate interface experienced two sequences of slow slip, the second of which probably contributed a substantial amount of stress and may have initiated the nucleation of the main shock."

Here we show the first such experimental demonstration of blind quantum computation where the input, computation, and output all remain unknown to the computer. We exploit the conceptual framework of measurement-based quantum computation that enables a client to delegate a computation to a quantum server. We demonstrate various blind delegated computations, including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch and Grover algorithms. Remarkably, the client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is crucial for future unconditionally secure quantum cloud computing and might become a key ingredient for real-life applications, especially when considering the challenges of making powerful quantum computers widely available."
https://openalex.org/W2012252035,"Benoit Bruneau and colleagues show that Ezh2 stabilizes cardiac gene expression and prevents postnatal heart pathology by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor Six1 in differentiating cardiac progenitors. Their results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation in embryonic progenitor cells can predispose to adult disease. Adult-onset diseases can be associated with in utero events, but mechanisms for this remain unknown1,2. The Polycomb histone methyltransferase Ezh2 stabilizes transcription by depositing repressive marks during development that persist into adulthood3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but its function in postnatal organ homeostasis is unknown. We show that Ezh2 stabilizes cardiac gene expression and prevents cardiac pathology by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor gene Six1, which functions in cardiac progenitor cells but is stably silenced upon cardiac differentiation10. Deletion of Ezh2 in cardiac progenitors caused postnatal myocardial pathology and destabilized cardiac gene expression with activation of Six1-dependent skeletal muscle genes. Six1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and skeletal muscle gene expression. Furthermore, genetically reducing Six1 levels rescued the pathology of Ezh2-deficient hearts. Thus, Ezh2-mediated repression of Six1 in differentiating cardiac progenitors is essential for stable gene expression and homeostasis in the postnatal heart. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation in embryonic progenitor cells is a predisposing factor for adult disease and dysregulated stress responses."

Choi et al. (p. 319 ; see the Perspective by Lu ) were able to observe changes in lysozyme conformation, which changes its electrostatic potential, by using a carbon-nanotube field-effect transistor. Slower hydrolysis steps were compared with faster, but unproductive, hinge motion, and changes in lysozyme activity that occur with pH were shown to arise from differences in the relative amount of time spent in processive versus nonprocessive states."
https://openalex.org/W2076411581,"Julius Gudmundsson and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for circulating levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in 27,758 individuals not known to have thyroid cancer. They follow with thyroid cancer association analyses and identify common variants at three loci newly associated with susceptibility to thyroid cancer. To search for sequence variants conferring risk of nonmedullary thyroid cancer, we focused our analysis on 22 SNPs with a P < 5 × 10−8 in a genome-wide association study on levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in 27,758 Icelanders. Of those, rs965513 has previously been shown to associate with thyroid cancer. The remaining 21 SNPs were genotyped in 561 Icelandic individuals with thyroid cancer (cases) and up to 40,013 controls. Variants suggestively associated with thyroid cancer (P < 0.05) were genotyped in an additional 595 non-Icelandic cases and 2,604 controls. After combining the results, three variants were shown to associate with thyroid cancer: rs966423 on 2q35 (OR = 1.34; Pcombined = 1.3 × 10−9), rs2439302 on 8p12 (OR = 1.36; Pcombined = 2.0 × 10−9) and rs116909374 on 14q13.3 (OR = 2.09; Pcombined = 4.6 × 10−11), a region previously reported to contain an uncorrelated variant conferring risk of thyroid cancer. A strong association (P = 9.1 × 10−91) was observed between rs2439302 on 8p12 and expression of NRG1, which encodes the signaling protein neuregulin 1, in blood."
https://openalex.org/W2127834152,"Natural Killer Controls Cytolytic natural killer (NK) cells participate in both antimicrobial and antitumor immunity. Their responsiveness is tuned through signals received through a variety of inhibitory and activating receptors expressed on their cell surface. Narni-Mancinelli et al. (p. 344 ) now show that signaling through the activating receptor NKp46 paradoxically keeps NK cell responses in check. NK cells from mice with disrupted NKp46 expression were hyperresponsive to stimulation and better protected against viral infection. NK cell responses, which are part of the early response to infection, may thus need to be carefully tuned to ensure optimal initiation of adaptive immunity and formation of protective long-lived memory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093570133,"Too Much Tolerance? In the immune system, loss of tolerance to self can have devastating consequences, such as the development of autoimmune diseases. In some cases, however, we may wish to be able to break tolerance, for example, to activate immune cells to fight tumors. Schietinger et al. (p. 723 , published online 19 January; see the Perspective by Lee and Jameson ) used a combination of genetic mouse models and adoptive immune cell transfers to better understand the mechanisms regulating tolerance in T lymphocytes. In contrast to the prevailing paradigm, the maintenance of T lymphocyte tolerance did not require the continuous presence of antigen. Tolerance was able to be broken when previously tolerized cells were placed in an environment depleted of immune cells. However, when lymphocyte numbers were restored, cells were once again tolerized, even in the absence of antigen. These data, together with gene expression profiling, suggest that tolerance is associated with a specific gene expression program that, although possible to override temporarily, is reimposed by epigenetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2057193931,"α-Synuclein is a protein that is intrinsically disordered in vitro and prone to aggregation, particularly at high temperatures. In this work, we examined the ability of curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, to prevent aggregation of the protein. We found strong binding of curcumin to α-synuclein in the hydrophobic non-amyloid-β component region and complete inhibition of oligomers or fibrils. We also found that the reconfiguration rate within the unfolded protein was significantly increased at high temperatures. We conclude that α-synuclein is prone to aggregation because its reconfiguration rate is slow enough to expose hydrophobic residues on the same time scale that bimolecular association occurs. Curcumin rescues the protein from aggregation by increasing the reconfiguration rate into a faster regime. α-Synuclein is a protein that is intrinsically disordered in vitro and prone to aggregation, particularly at high temperatures.

Curcumin rescues the protein from aggregation by increasing the reconfiguration rate into a faster regime. α-Synuclein aggregation is involved in, and likely the cause of, Parkinson disease (1.Goedert M. α-Synuclein and neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Although α-synuclein is commonly thought of as intrinsically disordered, a recent report demonstrated that, in human cells, it exists in a helical tetramer that does not easily aggregate (2.Bartels T. Choi J.G. Selkoe D.J. α-Synuclein occurs physiologically as a helically folded tetramer that resists aggregation.Nature. 2011; 477: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This suggests that the physiological pathway for aggregation is first unfolding of the tetramer to kinetically trapped monomers and then reassociation to a disordered aggregate and eventually fibrillar Lewy bodies. Therefore, preventing reassociation of the monomers is a useful therapeutic strategy. Many researchers in the past several years have investigated the interaction of potential aggregation inhibitors with oligomers of various sizes and fibrils, but there have been few observations of inhibitors with monomers, primarily because spectroscopic detection is difficult (3.Amer D.A. Irvine G.B. El-Agnaf O.M. Inhibitors of α-synuclein oligomerization and toxicity: a future therapeutic strategy for Parkinson disease and related disorders.Exp.

We have recently investigated the chain dynamics of disordered monomeric α-synuclein under a variety of aggregation conditions and found that the internal reconfiguration rate (or the rate of intramolecular diffusion) is fast under conditions in which aggregation is inhibited and slows when aggregation is more likely (8.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We interpreted these observations with a model in which the first step of aggregation is kinetically controlled by the reconfiguration rate of the disordered monomer. When intramolecular diffusion is fast compared with bimolecular association, aggregation is unlikely because exposed hydrophobes quickly reconfigure, but if intramolecular diffusion slows to the same rate as bimolecular association, aggregation becomes more likely. A logical extension of this model is that aggregation inhibitors prevent bimolecular association by raising the reconfiguration (or the rate of intramolecular diffusion) of the disordered protein. Intramolecular diffusion is the random motion of one part of the protein chain relative to another. To measure intramolecular diffusion, we used the Trp-Cys contact quenching method by which tryptophan is excited to a long-lived triplet state that is quenched on contact with cysteine within the same protein chain. Measurement of this rate of quenching at various temperatures and viscosities allows the extraction of the rate of diffusion between these two points in the chain. In this work, we investigated the effect of the small molecule curcumin on the intramolecular diffusion of α-synuclein. Curcumin, a compound found in the spice turmeric, has been shown to have many medicinal properties and inhibits aggregation of the Alzheimer amyloid-β peptide (9.Yang F. Lim G.P. Begum A.N. Ubeda O.J. Simmons M.R. Ambegaokar S.S. Chen P.P. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M.

Ιn α-synuclein, curcumin has been shown to inhibit fibril formation and increase solubility, but the physical basis of the aggregation inhibition is not known (10.Pandey N. Strider J. Nolan W.C. Yan S.X. Galvin J.E. Curcumin inhibits aggregation of α-synuclein.Acta Neuropathol. 2008; 115: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We found that curcumin strongly bound to the monomer and completely inhibited aggregation, and with curcumin, intramolecular diffusion of α-synuclein was increased by >10-fold at 40 °C compared with the protein alone. The α-synuclein plasmid was a kind gift from Gary Pielak (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Mutants Y39W/A69C and A69C/F94W of α-synuclein were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the T7-7 plasmid and purified as described previously (11.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. Evidence for a partially folded intermediate in α-synuclein fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The purity of the mutants was confirmed by SDS-PAGE to be >95%. The protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 11460 m−1 cm−1. Stock solutions of ∼200 μm were stored at −80 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). 2The abbreviations used are:TCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineTFEtrifluoroethanolThTthioflavin T. An aliquot was thawed and filtered shortly before each experiment. tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine trifluoroethanol thioflavin T. The effect of curcumin on the inhibition of α-synuclein aggregation was measured under two aggregation conditions. First, fibril formation in the absence and presence of curcumin (curcumin/protein molar ratio of 1.5) was initiated by stirring the protein, at a concentration of 48 μm, in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP at 37 °C (11.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. Evidence for a partially folded intermediate in α-synuclein fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Second, soluble oligomer formation in the absence and presence of curcumin (curcumin/protein molar ratio of 1.5) was started by incubating 5 μm α-synuclein in 10% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE), 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 1 mm TCEP at 37 °C (12.Anderson V.L. Ramlall T.F. Rospigliosi C.C. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Identification of a helical intermediate in trifluoroethanol-induced α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18850-18855Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At regular time intervals, individual aliquots of 60 (in one experiment, 10) μl of each sample preincubated without or with curcumin (curcumin/α-synuclein ratio of 1.5:1) were mixed with 440 (in one experiment, 490) μl of 25 μm thioflavin T (ThT) solution and 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the aggregation kinetics were followed by measurements of ThT fluorescence at 480 nm and far-UV CD at 217 nm, respectively. The ThT fluorescence was measured using a Jobin Yvon SPEX FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 440 and 480 nm, respectively. A 10-mm path length quartz cell and an excitation and emission slit width of 5 nm were used. Far-UV CD data were obtained with an Applied Photophysics Chirascan spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Jobin Yvon SPEX FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. The fluorescence spectra were measured at 25 °C with a 1-cm path length cell, exciting at 295 nm. Both excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. CD measurements were carried out with an Applied Photophysics Chirascan spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. Spectra were recorded with a 0.5–4-s adaptive integration time and a 1-nm bandwidth. Each spectrum was the average of four scans. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were taken at protein concentrations of 5 and 25 μm with 0.1- and 1.0-cm path length cells, respectively. Shortly before the experiment, a 300-μl aliquot of the protein with or without the desired concentration of curcumin was diluted 10:1 in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm TCEP, and various sucrose concentrations that had been bubbled with N2O to eliminate oxygen and scavenge solvated electrons created in the UV laser pulse. Triplet lifetime decay kinetics were measured with an instrument similar to one described previously (13.Singh V.R. Kopka M. Chen Y. Wedemeyer W.J. Lapidus L.J. Dynamic similarity of the unfolded states of proteins L and G.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10046-10054Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tryptophan triplet was excited by a 10-ns laser pulse at 289 nm created from the fourth harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum) and a 1-meter Raman cell filled with 450 p.s.i. of D2 gas. The triplet population was probed at 441 nm by a HeCd laser (Kimmon). The probe and a reference beam were measured with silicon detectors and combined in a differential amplifier (DA 1853A, LeCroy) with an additional stage of a 350-MHz preamplifier (SR445A, Stanford Research Systems). The total gain was 50-fold. The temperature and viscosity were controlled as described previously (8.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The variation of solution viscosity was achieved with the addition of different concentrations of sucrose. Measurement of each sample at five temperatures took ∼20 min, so aggregation during this time was minimal. The viscosity of each solvent at each temperature was measured independently using a cone-cup viscometer (Brookfield Engineering). Binding of curcumin was measured using a variety of optical absorption and fluorescence methods (see supplemental “Results” for details). As shown in Fig. 1, curcumin bound strongly to monomeric α-synuclein with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼10−5 m without making any significant alteration in the unfolded state of α-synuclein (supplemental Fig. S1). By measuring binding at various temperatures, we determined the enthalpy (ΔH = −7.9 kcal/mol) and entropy (ΔS = −0.0081 kcal/mol/K) of binding, indicating that binding is enthalpically driven and suggesting that it is due to non-hydrophobic interactions. These observations are similar to previous reports of binding of curcumin to proteins such as α-1-casein (14.Sneharani A.H. Singh S.A. Appu Rao A.G. Interaction of α-synuclein-1-casein with curcumin and its biological implications.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009; 57: 10386-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), β-lactoglobulin (15.Sneharani A.H. Karakkat J.V. Singh S.A. Appu Rao A.G. Interaction of curcumin with beta-lactoglobulin-stability, spectroscopic analysis, and molecular modeling of the complex.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 11130-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and FtsZ (16.Rai D. Singh J.K. Roy N. Panda D. Curcumin inhibits FtsZ assembly: an attractive mechanism for its antibacterial activity.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The binding profiles for the two loops investigated here were the same, indicating that the Trp and Cys mutations do not significantly affect curcumin binding. There was no evidence that curcumin significantly altered the conformational ensemble, but the tryptophan emission at position 94 showed significant quenching and a slight blue shift in the spectrum upon binding curcumin (supplemental Fig. S2). No such effect was observed for the tryptophan at position 39. This suggests an affinity for binding in the non-amyloid-β component region. We investigated the effect of curcumin on the aggregation of mutant A69C/F94W of α-synuclein under two solution conditions. In 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP, α-synuclein at high concentration (48 μm) is known to form fibrils in 6 days upon stirring at 37 °C (11.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. Evidence for a partially folded intermediate in α-synuclein fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), whereas in 10% (v/v) TFE (pH 7.4), α-synuclein at low concentration (5 μm) aggregates into soluble oligomers in 70 min at 25 °C (12.Anderson V.L. Ramlall T.F. Rospigliosi C.C. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Identification of a helical intermediate in trifluoroethanol-induced α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18850-18855Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (a and c) shows the kinetics of mutant A69C/F94W fibrillation and oligomerization, respectively, in the absence and presence of curcumin monitored with ThT fluorescence and far-UV CD at 217 nm. For fibrillation, in the absence of curcumin (closed symbols), sigmoidal kinetics curves were observed with both probes, indicating a nucleation-polymerization reaction. Oligomer formation occurred without a lag phase, showed weak ThT binding, and saturated in 1 h. However, at the highest curcumin concentration tested (curcumin/protein molar ratio of 1.5), no increase in ThT fluorescence or CD values was observed in either case, indicating that both fibrillation and oligomerization are completely prevented. Fig. 2 (b and d) shows the far-UV CD spectra of the reactants and products formed in the absence and presence of curcumin under two aggregation conditions. Under the fibrillation condition, monomeric α-synuclein was characterized by a deep negative minimum at 198 nm. It has been previously shown that, at very low concentration (∼0.5 μm), α-synuclein exists as a monomer between 0 and 60% TFE (12.Anderson V.L. Ramlall T.F. Rospigliosi C.C. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Identification of a helical intermediate in trifluoroethanol-induced α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18850-18855Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and we observed a similar partially folded spectrum with and without curcumin in 10% (v/v) TFE. In the absence of curcumin, monomeric reactants incubated under either condition showed a transition from a monomer to a β-sheet structured aggregate with a negative minimum at 217 nm (Fig. 2, b and d). In the presence of curcumin, the spectra of the products under both aggregation conditions were almost unchanged after incubation. Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin at a molar ratio of 1.5:1 completely prevents the fibrillation and oligomer formation of α-synuclein. We investigated the effect of curcumin on intramolecular contact rates in two α-synuclein mutants, Y39W/A69C and A69C/F94W, by the Trp-Cys contact quenching method. Tryptophan triplet kinetics observed for these mutants exhibited a rapid decay on the microsecond time scale due to quenching of the tryptophan triplet by contact with cysteine and a second decay on the millisecond time scale due to other photophysical processes (17.Lapidus L.J. Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Measuring the rate of intramolecular contact formation in polypeptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the presence of curcumin, similar triplet decay kinetics were observed for these mutants. The observed rate of triplet decay consisted of two processes, intramolecular diffusion and irreversible quenching of the triplet by cysteine on close contact. In equilibrium, intramolecular diffusion brought the Trp and Cys residues within the same polypeptide together with a diffusion-limited forward rate (kD+), where it may be quenched with rate (q) or diffuse away with rate kD−. The observed rate is given by Equation 1 (18.Lapidus L.J. Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Measuring dynamic flexibility of the coil state of a helix-forming peptide.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).kobs=kD+qkD−+q(Eq. 1) If q ≫ kD−, then kobs ∼ kD+, and the observed rate is diffusion-limited. However, cysteine is not a diffusion-limited quencher of free tryptophan in water, so q ∼ kD−, and Equation 1 can be rewritten as Equation 2.1kobs=1kD++1qK=1kD+(T,η)+1kR(T)(Eq. 2) We assume that the reaction-limited rate (kR) depends only on temperature (T), but kD+ depends on both temperature and viscosity of the solvent (η). Therefore, by making measurements at different viscosities for a constant temperature, we can extract both kR and kD+ by fitting a plot of 1/kobs versus η at a given temperature to a line in which the intercept is 1/kR and the slope is 1/ηkD+. This measurement typically assumes that the cysteine is the only significant quencher in the sample (19.Gonnelli M. Strambini G.B. Phosphorescence lifetime of tryptophan in proteins.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13847-13857Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but it is likely that curcumin is also an efficient quencher. Fig. 3 shows the measured kobs of α-synuclein mutant A69C/F94W and N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide in various concentrations of curcumin. The rates for N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide increased significantly with curcumin, indicating that curcumin is a very efficient quencher, but the rates of Trp-94 actually decreased slightly. This suggests that the curcumin is quite tightly associated with the protein and not free to quench Trp through bimolecular diffusion. Furthermore, although the curcumin is probably bound fairly close to Trp-94 based on the fluorescence measurements (supplemental Fig. S2), it is apparently not accessible to efficiently quench the triplet state, suggesting that it is buried in a hydrophobic pocket within the chain. Fig. 4 (a and b) shows plots of exponential decay times (1/kobs) versus viscosity for various temperatures at pH 7.4 in the absence of curcumin and at a curcumin/α-synuclein molar ratio of 1.5:1, respectively. Without curcumin, the intercept decreases, and the slope increases dramatically with temperature. At the highest temperatures, the intercept is consistent with zero, implying that kobs is diffusion-limited. In contrast, in the presence of curcumin, the change in slope is much more gradual, and at no temperature is the observed rate diffusion-limited. This trend is more similar to trends observed in other unfolded peptides and proteins (13.Singh V.R. Kopka M. Chen Y. Wedemeyer W.J. Lapidus L.J.

The reaction-limited (kR) and diffusion-limited (kD+ at the viscosity of water at each temperature) rates are plotted in Fig. 5 for A69C/F94W and in supplemental Fig. S3 for Y39W/A69C at various concentrations of curcumin. The protein concentration was held fixed at 10 μm, and the highest concentration of curcumin was 15 μm, beyond which the curcumin absorbed too much light at 442 nm to measure the Trp triplet absorption accurately. To interpret these rates, we use the Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten theory, which models intramolecular diffusion as diffusion on a one-dimensional potential of mean force determined by the probability of intrachain distances (P(r)) (21.Szabo A. Schulten K. Schulten Z. 1st passage time approach to diffusion controlled reactions.J. Chem. Phys. 1980; 72: 4350-4357Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The measured reaction-limited and diffusion-limited rates are given by Equations 3 and 4 (22.Lapidus L.J. Steinbach P.J. Eaton W.A. Szabo A. Hofrichter J. Effects of chain stiffness on the dynamics of loop formation in polypeptides. Appendix: Testing a 1-dimensional diffusion model for peptide dynamics.J. Phys. Chem.

The distance-dependent quenching rate for the Trp-Cys system drops off very rapidly beyond 4.0 Å, so the reaction-limited rate is mostly determined by the probability of the shortest distances (23.Lapidus L.J. Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Dynamics of intramolecular contact formation in polypeptides: distance dependence of quenching rates in a room-temperature glass.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001; 87: 258101-258104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Very generally, kR and kD+ are both inversely proportional to the average volume of the chain, and kD+ is directly proportional to D. Therefore, in the absence of curcumin, the large increase in kR represents a significant compaction in the size of the protein, and the moderate decrease in kD+ represents a significant slowing in diffusion as temperature is increased. The reconfiguration rate can be defined as the rate to diffuse one part of the chain across the diameter of the protein: kr = 4D/(2RG)2. To determine the diffusion constant, we assume that the probability distribution is given by a Gaussian chain (Equation 5),P(r)=4πr2N(32π〈r2〉)3/2exp(−3r22〈r2〉)(Eq. 5) where 〈r2〉, the average Trp-Cys distance, is an adjustable parameter, and N is a normalization constant such that ∫P(r) = 1. For each measured kR, 〈r2〉 was found such that it matched the measured rate using Equation 3. These distances are plotted in Fig. 5c. Then, the correct P(r) was used in Equation 4 with the measured kD+ to determine D, which is plotted in Fig. 5d. Without any curcumin, D decreased by ∼50-fold from 0 to 40 °C. The addition of curcumin had a small effect on the size of the chain and the diffusion constant at low temperature, but the effect increased dramatically at high temperature. Because the binding curves suggested that curcumin was preferentially binding near Trp-94, we repeated these measurements with mutant Y39W/A69C (supplemental Fig. S3) and found qualitatively similar results, suggesting that curcumin affects the global dynamics of the protein. We have previously shown that α-synuclein, unique among disordered sequences, compacts and diffuses more slowly as temperature is increased (8.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Examining other conditions under which aggregation is enhanced (low pH or the familial mutation A30P), we found a good correlation between the rate of intramolecular diffusion and the rate of aggregation. When diffusion is fast (D ∼ 10−6 cm2 s−1), such as is observed for most intrinsically disordered sequences, the protein reconfigures too fast to make stable bimolecular interactions with another protein chain, but when the reconfiguration rate is about the same as the bimolecular encounter rate, stable interactions are more likely, and aggregation can proceed. This accounts for the dramatic increase in the aggregation rate of α-synuclein at 40 °C compared with 0 °C. In this work, we examined the effect of curcumin binding on the intramolecular diffusion of α-synuclein. There is little difference in D at T = 0 °C, but the difference widens with increasing temperature. At T = 40 °C and an equal molar ratio of curcumin to protein, D is 15 times higher than with no curcumin. This difference widens to 30 times at 1.5:1 curcumin/protein, the highest ratio measurable in our instrument, which suggests that multiple curcumin molecules bound to a single protein further increase D. The Trp fluorescence data suggest that one preferred binding site for curcumin is near position 94. Molecular mechanics simulations of Alzheimer peptides have shown that curcumin preferentially associates with alanine and other aliphatic residues (24.Kumar P. Pillay V. Choonara Y.E. Modi G. Naidoo D. du Toit L.C. In silico theoretical molecular modeling for Alzheimer disease: the nicotine-curcumin paradigm in neuroprotection and neurotherapy.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011; 12: 694-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Between residues 60 and 100, there are 15 aliphatic residues (alanine and valine plus Leu-100), and in particular, there are three alanines in a row at positions 89–91. We propose this as a possible binding site. Having made one or more bonds between the side chains and the curcumin, the aromatic rings of the molecule are then available to interact with any of the nearby hydrophobic residues, creating a hydrophobic cluster of residues close in sequence. Thus, it appears that one or more curcumin molecules bound to α-synuclein rescue the protein from the slow diffusion regime that promotes aggregation. Because the reaction-limited rates are correlated with temperature and the diffusion-limited rates are inversely correlated, by extension, the chain volume and diffusion coefficient are inversely correlated. We conclude that curcumin disrupts long-range interactions within the chain, allowing it to more quickly reconfigure. Fig. 6 shows a schematic of this behavior. Typically, α-synuclein is a fairly compact disordered protein with many long-range interactions within the chain (gray circles). This makes reconfiguration fairly slow (upper row) and allows exposed hydrophobes to associate with other chains, making oligomers, which eventually rearrange into larger fibrillar species. With the addition of curcumin (middle row), the chains become less compact, and intramolecular interactions are more short-range, allowing faster reconfiguration. Faster reconfiguration allows the chains to escape from bimolecular association (lower row) and prevents further aggregation steps. Future work should investigate whether this property is common in aggregation inhibitors. For example, as a control experiment, we measured intramolecular diffusion of the protein in the presence of N-acetylleucine, a hydrophobic amino acid, and found that the diffusion coefficient was unchanged (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that the ability of curcumin to affect reconfiguration is somewhat unique. This assay yields unique information about the mechanism of aggregation inhibition at the first step of the process. More common assays, such as ThT fluorescence, are not sensitive to monomer/monomer interactions, which are the preferred step for an inhibitor to act on. One potential danger with inhibiting a later step of the aggregation pathway is that accumulation of a toxic intermediate could make toxicity worse (25.Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Therefore, this measurement should become a common assay in the development of new Parkinson drug candidates that prevent aggregation at the first step.

Although monolignol p-coumarate-derived units may comprise up to 40% of the lignin in some grass tissues, the p-coumarate moiety from such conjugates does not enter into the radical coupling (polymerization) reactions of lignification. With a greater understanding of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates, grass lignins could be engineered to contain fewer pendent p-coumarate groups and more monolignol conjugates that improve lignin cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2101058052,"Intrauterine exposures mediated by maternal diet may affect risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence, primarily from animal studies and observational data in humans, suggests that the epigenome can be altered by maternal diet during the periconceptional period and that these programming events may underlie later disease risk. A randomized controlled trial of periconceptional micronutrient supplementation in The Gambia, where seasonal nutritional variations affect fetal growth and postnatal outcomes, provided a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. Specifically, we targeted imprinted genes, which play important roles in allocation of maternal resources while being epigenetically regulated. DNA methylation at 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was analyzed in cord blood samples from 58 offspring of women participating in a doubleblind randomized-controlled trial of pre- and periconceptional micronutrient supplementation (including folate, zinc, and vitamins A, B, C, and D). We observed sex-specific effects of micronutrient supplementation, reducing methylation levels at two of the DMRs analyzed, IGF2R in girls and GTL2-2 in boys. This pilot study is the first to analyze DNA methylation in the context of a randomized controlled trial, and it provides suggestive evidence that periconceptional maternal nutrition alters offspring methylation at imprinted loci.—Cooper, W.

Antidotes for the toxin are not available, and treatment with antibiotics is contraindicated because it increases the risk of toxin release (from dead bacteria) and leads to severe forms of the disease. Manganese is an essential nutrient and its toxicology in humans is well studied; it inhibits the normal trafficking of Shiga toxin in tissue culture cells. Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (p. 332 ) found that levels of Mn 2+ that caused no deleterious effects to normal cellular processes nevertheless altered intracellular trafficking of Shiga toxin so that it was degraded in lysosomes. This conferred very high levels of protection of cultured cells against toxin-induced death and made mice completely resistant to Shiga toxin–induced paralysis and death."
https://openalex.org/W2008886404,"Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic, is widely used in cancer treatment. Doxorubicin produces genotoxic stress and p53 activation in both carcinoma and non-carcinoma cells. Although its side effects in non-carcinoma cells, especially in heart tissue, are well known, the molecular targets of doxorubicin are poorly characterized. Here, we report that doxorubicin inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) resulting in SIRT1 dysfunction and p53 accumulation. Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or H9C2 cardiomyocyte were exposed to doxorubicin at different doses and durations. Cell death and p53, SIRT1, and AMPK levels were examined by Western blot. In MEFs, doxorubicin inhibited AMPK activation, increased cell death, and induced robust p53 accumulation. Genetic deletion of AMPKα1 reduced NAD(+) levels and SIRT1 activity and significantly increased the levels of p53 and cell death. Pre-activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside or transfection with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active AMPK (AMPK-CA) markedly reduced the effects of doxorubicin in MEFs from Ampkα1 knock-out mice. Conversely, pre-inhibition of Ampk further sensitized MEFs to doxorubicin-induced cell death. Genetic knockdown of p53 protected both wild-type and Ampkα1(-/-) MEFs from doxorubicin-induced cell death. p53 accumulation in Ampkα1(-/-) MEFs was reversed by SIRT1 activation by resveratrol. Taken together, these data suggest that AMPK inhibition by doxorubicin causes p53 accumulation and SIRT1 dysfunction in MEFs and further suggest that pharmacological activation of AMPK might alleviate the side effects of doxorubicin."
https://openalex.org/W2115115666,"Pregnancy at high altitude is associated with a reduction in birth weight of ∼100 g/1000 m of ascent. The underlying mechanisms are unclear but may involve alteration in energy-demanding activities, such as protein synthesis. To test this hypothesis, both in vivo and in vitro approaches were used. Placental tissues from pregnant women residing at 3100 m were studied, and placental cells were incubated under hypoxia. In the 3100-m placentas, we observed dilation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit α (P-eIF2α), reduced AKT phosphorylation, and reduced P-4E-BP1 but increased 4E-BP1 protein compared to sea level controls. These findings suggest the presence of ER stress and protein synthesis inhibition. Hypoxia (1% O(2)) reduced proliferation of trophoblast-like JEG-3 cells, BeWo cells, and placental fibroblasts by ∼40, ∼60, and ∼18%, respectively. Sublethal dosage of salubrinal, an eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor, increased P-eIF2α and reduced BeWo cell and placental fibroblast proliferation by ∼50%. Administration of the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 also reduced JEG-3 proliferation. Our results demonstrate that exposure to chronic hypobaric hypoxia causes mild placental ER stress, which, in turn, modulates protein synthesis and slows proliferation. These effects may account for the reduced placental villous volume, and contribute to the low birth weight that typifies high-altitude populations."

Here, we report the crystal structure of C6, the first and longest of the pore proteins to be recruited by C5b.

Available evidence points instead to an assembly pathway in which each MAC protein attaches and inserts sequentially into the membrane (3Podack E.R. Esser A.F. Biesecker G. Müller-Eberhard H.J.

A recent crystallographic and EM study of the perforin pore supported the β-barrel hypothesis, but the authors proposed that the MACPF domain had a reversed orientation with respect to models of the CDC pore (22Law R.H. Lukoyanova N. Voskoboinik I. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Baran K. Dunstone M.A. D'Angelo M.E. Orlova E.V. Coulibaly F. Verschoor S. Browne K.A. Ciccone A. Kuiper M.J. Bird P.I. Trapani J.A. Saibil H.R. Whisstock J.C. The structural basis for membrane binding and pore formation by lymphocyte perforin.Nature. 2010; 468: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the packing between MACPF domains in the first crystal structure of a full-length MAC protein, the C8αβγ complex, supports a CDC-like organization for the MAC (25Lovelace L.L. Cooper C.L. Sodetz J.M. Lebioda L. Structure of human C8 protein provides mechanistic insight into membrane pore formation by complement.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17585-17592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). C6 is the longest of the MAC proteins. In its monomeric form, it is a single chain plasma glycoprotein of Mr ∼106,000, consisting of 913 residues folded as nine auxiliary/regulatory domains complementing the MACPF core. Although the precise functions of the auxiliary domains are unclear, their importance in MAC assembly is supported by several studies. For example, two independent studies (using deletion mutants) demonstrated that the N-terminal modules of C8α (TS2 and LR) are strictly required for MACPF formation and hemolytic activity, although deletion of the C-terminal TS3 domain greatly reduced activity (26Scibek J.J. Plumb M.E. Sodetz J.M. Binding of human complement C8 to C9.

A study on C9 provided evidence for regulatory roles for the N terminus and TS2 domain; thus, short deletions at the N terminus promoted MACPF formation, and deletions or mutations within the TS2 domain caused nonproductive C9 self-polymerization (28Taylor K.M. Trimby A.R. Campbell A.K. Mutation of recombinant complement component C9 reveals the significance of the N-terminal region for polymerization.Immunology. 1997; 91: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of full-length C6 at 2.85 Å resolution. Comparisons with complement C8 and perforin, as well as with the broader family of CDCs, led us to propose an atomic model of initiation, regulation, and propagation of assembly of the MAC, in which the key process is the sequential template-driven opening of the MACPF β-sheet of each new component as it is recruited to the growing pore. In this model, the auxiliary domains play critical roles in the initial assembly of the C5b-8 initiation complex, in driving and regulating sheet opening, and in stabilizing the final pore. Complement C6 was purified from human plasma by a modification of a published procedure (29DiScipio R.G. Sweeney S.P. The fractionation of human plasma proteins. II. The purification of human complement proteins C3, C3u, and C5 by application of affinity chromatography.Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The steps included barium citrate depletion of the vitamin K proteins, 4–12% polyethylene glycol precipitation, DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography, euglobulin precipitation, gel filtration on Sephacryl-300, dextran sulfate-Sepharose column chromatography, and rabbit anti-contaminant IgG-Sepharose 6B. Small crystals of C6 were prepared in batch by incubating protein at 11 mg/ml in 5 mm MES, pH 5.8, 80 mm NaCl, and 10 μm CdCl2 at 1 °C for 2 weeks and then at 6 °C for 3–4 weeks, resulting in large (∼300 μm) rhombic bipyramidal crystals. They were cryoprotected by addition of pure glycerol to the crystallization liquor to a final concentration of 28% v/v. Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking crystals in mother liquor and heavy atoms at concentration/times as follows: Ta6Br12 (data set 1, 1.0 mm/4 h; data set 2, 0.5 mm/12 h; K2PtCl4 (0.1 mm/4 h); (NH4)2OsCl6 (0.5 mm/2 h); and K2IrCl6 (0.5 mm/2 h). All data were collected at SSRL beamline 9-2. Data were processed using IMOSFLM and CCP4i (30Leslie A.G. The integration of macromolecular diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 31Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. A graphical user interface to the CCP4 program suite.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Several native data sets were collected to obtain the highest isomorphism with the heavy atom derivatives. Initial phases were calculated using a 3.5 Å native data set (Nat-2) and five derivatives (Table 1). The best diffracting crystals (Nat-2), which were less isomorphous, were used for the final model refinement. Data extended to 2.85 Å in the nest directions but were truncated ellipsoidally (32Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D. Toward the structural genomics of complexes.

Heavy atom sites were determined by SOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. SOLVE and RESOLVE: automated structure solution and density modification.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and refined with SHARP (34Bricogne G.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Initial phasing power was poor above 4 Å, but the high solvent content of the crystals (64%) allowed SHARP to extend the phases to 3.5 Å using density modification.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsNat-1Nat-2Ta6Br12-1Ta6Br12-2K2PtCl4(NH4)2OsCl6K2IrCl6Data collection Wavelength (Å)0.9911.0781.1231.2551.0680.9911.105 Resolution (Å)49/2.8520-3.520-3.920-3.520-3.820-3.520-3.9 Space groupP21212P21212P21212P21212P21212P21212P21212 Cell dimensions (Å)a = 146.8146.5146.8146.4147.6146.1144.8b = 180.2181.0181.5179.7179.6180.3179.7c = 60.560.560.360.760.060.559.9 RMERGEaRMERGE = Σ|Ih − 〈Ih〉|/ΣIh, where 〈Ih〉 is the average intensity over symmetry equivalent reflection.

Open table in a new tab The initial map quality was reasonable for this resolution but did not permit automated chain tracing. Structural homologs were therefore identified for each domain using FFAS (35Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Li Z. Li W. Godzik A. FFAS03. A server for profile-profile sequence alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W284-W288Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and three-dimensional models were built by omitting insertions and substituting nonidentical amino acids with serines. The following structures were used as templates (PDB entry/% identity): MACPF-C8β (2RD7/25%); TS1–TS3 (1LSL/29–45%); LR (1CR8/50%); CCP1 (1HO4/30%); CCP2 (3KXV/25%), and FIM1–FIM2 (2WCY/30%). The MACPF domain, TS1 domain, and CCPs were readily located in the 3.5-Å experimental map using real space molecular replacement with FFFEAR (36Cowtan K. Modified phased translation functions and their application to molecular-fragment location.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and a distinct conformation for the MACPF was immediately apparent. These domains fixed the topology of the molecule, enabling the remaining domains to be identified in the experimental map. Because of the low sequence identity of many templates (sometimes with distinct disulfide linkages), the domains were built manually, using the templates as guides. Side chains were built first in the well resolved fragments and then in the less ordered domains as refinement progressed. Rigid-body refinement of domains was followed by torsion angle refinement using simulated annealing and refinement of individual B-factors using CNS (37Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The model was then refined in PHENIX (38Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkoczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hun L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. PHENIX. A comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 2123-2221Crossref Scopus (16817) Google Scholar) using the 2.85-Å (Nat-1) data set with experimental phase restraints removed (ML mode). Reciprocal space refinement was iterated with manual model building and real space refinement in COOT (39Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17674) Google Scholar). The final cycles included the refinement of nine translation/libration/screw (TLS) groups (assigned to individual protein domains), bulk solvent/scale corrections, and individual atomic coordinates and B-factors. Final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Stereochemical quality was validated with PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacAuthor M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK. A program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were prepared with PyMOL and CHIMERA (41Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera. A visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29004) Google Scholar). Residue B-factors are shown schematically in supplemental Fig. 1. Some domains had limited intramolecular or crystal lattice interactions, leading to high B-factors (100–200 Å2). Electron density for the last FIM domain (residues 834–913) was diffuse and fragmented, but rigid-body refinement of a homology-based model reduced the RFREE by 0.38%, supporting its presence at that location. Electron density is absent for interdomain linker residues 243–259, 591–600, 605–619, and 744–755. For illustrative purposes only, these fragments were built as extended coils to show the domain topology. The map revealed seven glycosylation sites (N-glycosylation of Asn-303, O-glycosylation of Thr-17 and Thr-371, and α1-Cδ-linked mannosylation (42Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. The four terminal components of the complement system are C-mannosylated on multiple tryptophan residues.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) of Trp-8, Trp-11, Trp-547, and Trp-550). The sugar moieties at Asn-303 were built as β1-OG1- and β1–4-linked N-acetylglucosamine. Two sugar moieties at Thr-17 were built as α1-OG1-linked fucose and β1–3-linked glucose by analogy with other thrombospondin-like repeat domains (e.g. PDB entry 3GHN). There is no information about glycosylation at Thr-371, but based on the density it was built as OG1-α1-linked fucose. N-Glycosylation is predicted at Asn-834 (43DiScipio R.G. Hugli T.E.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18041-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we could not validate this because of the disorder in this region (FIM2). The LR module Ca2+-binding site is occupied by Cd2+, as judged by its 2Fo − Fc peak height and a strong anomalous peak in an anomalous difference Fourier. The ionic radii of Cd2+ and Ca2+ are very similar. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for C6 are deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 3T5O. The crystal structure of C6 was solved by a combination of experimental phasing and molecular replacement at ∼3 Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures,” Table 1, and supplemental Fig. 1). Interpretable electron density exists for all domains except for FIM2 (see below) and some interdomain linkers. The nine auxiliary domains are generally small and rigid, ranging in size from 35 to 75 residues and containing 2–5 disulfide bonds. In contrast, the large MACPF domain contains only one intradomain disulfide bond. C6 has the overall shape of a seahorse, a rather flat molecule with a head-to-tail distance of 215 Å (Fig. 1). The MACPF domain (residues 160–501) itself is only 75 Å tall, and the additional height of C6 is accounted for by auxiliary domains as follows: in particular, four C-terminal domains (complement control protein (“CCP”) modules and factor I modules (“FIMs”) that extend from the upper body of the MACPF core. These auxiliary domains are found only in C6 and C7 among the late acting components of complement (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). The overall shape is consistent with EM images of C6 and C7, although a more compact conformat"

However, basic mechanisms of probiosis are not well understood, and most investigations have been performed in germ-free or microbiome-depleted animals. We sought to functionally characterize probiotic-host interactions in the context of normal early development. Outbred CD1 neonatal mice were orally gavaged with one of two strains of human-derived Lactobacillus reuteri or an equal volume of vehicle. Transcriptome analysis was performed on enterocyte RNA isolated by laser-capture microdissection. Enterocyte migration and proliferation were assessed by labeling cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and fecal microbial community composition was determined by 16S metagenomic sequencing. Probiotic ingestion altered gene expression in multiple canonical pathways involving cell motility. L. reuteri strain DSM 17938 dramatically increased enterocyte migration (3-fold), proliferation (34%), and crypt height (29%) compared to vehicle-treated mice, whereas strain ATCC PTA 6475 increased cell migration (2-fold) without affecting crypt proliferative activity. In addition, both probiotic strains increased the phylogenetic diversity and evenness between taxa of the fecal microbiome 24 h after a single probiotic gavage. These experiments identify two targets of probiosis in early development, the intestinal epithelium and the gut microbiome, and suggest novel mechanisms for probiotic strain-specific effects."

In addition to Aβ peptides starting with aspartate as the first amino acid (Aβ1), several N-terminal truncated and modified Aβ species have also been described.

Mass spectrometric analysis of AD brain tissue showed that an N-terminal truncated isoform of Aβ starting with pyroglutamate (AβpE3) is frequently present, thus explaining, at least partially, the initial difficulties in sequencing Aβ peptides purified from human brain tissue (16.Sevalle J.

Also, aminopeptidase A may be responsible in part for the N-terminal truncation of full-length Aβ peptides (16.Sevalle J. Amoyel A. Robert P. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Checler F.

The enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) was later identified and discovered to also catalyze not only glutamine but is responsible for N-terminal glutamate conversion generating AβpE3 or AβpE11 from their glutamate precursors (17.Cynis H. Schilling S. Bodnár M. Hoffmann T. Heiser U. Saido T.C. Demuth H.U. Inhibition of glutaminyl cyclase alters pyroglutamate formation in mammalian cells.Biochim. Biophys.

Med. 2008; 14: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), lowers AβpE3 levels, decreases plaque load, and ameliorates behavioral deficits in different AD mouse models. Conversely, crossing 5XFAD mice with transgenic mice expressing human QC (hQC) significantly increases levels of soluble AβpE3–42 peptides, raises plaque load, and intensifies motor and working memory impairment (21.Jawhar S. Wirths O. Schilling S. Graubner S. Demuth H.U. Bayer T.A. Overexpression of glutaminyl cyclase, the enzyme responsible for pyroglutamate Aβ formation, induces behavioral deficits, and glutaminyl cyclase knock-out rescues the behavioral phenotype in 5XFAD mice.J.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how additional AβpE3–42 impacts the progression of AD pathology independent of QC manipulations. To accomplish this, we crossed a novel transgenic mouse model that produces AβpE3–42 (TBA42) to an established AD mouse model (5XFAD). The 5XFAD mouse model expresses mutant human APP695 (Swedish, Florida, and London mutations) together with presenilin-1 (PS1) containing the M146L and L286V mutations. 5XFAD mice develop age-dependent behavioral deficits, axonopathy, neuron loss, and robust plaque pathology (23.Oakley H.

Aging. 2012; 33: 196.e29-196.e40Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the effects of elevated AβpE3–42 on the behavioral phenotype, co-precipitation of other Aβ variants, and plaque load pathology in the resulting transgenic mice (FAD42). Our findings demonstrate that an increase in AβpE3–42 can adversely affect the strong and robust AD phenotype of 5XFAD mice. The generation of the transgenic vector expressing murine thyrotropin-releasing hormone-Aβ (mTRH-Aβ3–42) under the control of the murine Thy1.2 regulatory sequence was described previously (17.Cynis H.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12790-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The glutamate at position three of the Aβ amino acid sequence was mutated into glutamine to facilitate enhanced pyroglutamate formation. The mice thus express unmodified Aβ3Q-42 (designated as Aβ3–42), which can be readily converted to AβpE3–42 by QC. TBA42 mice were generated by male pronuclear injection of fertilized C57BL/6J oocytes. The resulting offspring were screened for transgene integration by PCR analysis. Three founder animals (TBA41, TBA42, and TBA45) were identified and subsequently bred to C57BL/6J mice to establish independent lines. Transgene expression was assessed in the F1 generation of each line using RT-PCR. The line with the highest transgene mRNA expression was selected for further breeding (named truncated beta-amyloid 42; TBA42). 5XFAD mice were described previously (23.Oakley H. Cole S.L. Logan S. Maus E. Shao P. Craft J. Guillozet-Bongaarts A. Ohno M. Disterhoft J. Van Eldik L. Berry R. Vassar R.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10129-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). The APP695 and PS1 transgenes co-segregate and are both under the control of the murine Thy1.2 regulatory sequence. All 5XFAD mice were back-crossed for >10 generations onto a C57BL/6J genetic background. FAD42 mice were generated by breeding transgene positive 5XFAD mice to transgene positive TBA42 mice. Wild-type, transgenic offspring were identified subsequently using PCR. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the German guidelines for animal care and approved by the local legal authorities. Only female mice were used in this study. Mice were group-housed with an average of four individuals per cage and kept on a 12 h/12 h inverted light cycle (lights off at 8:00 AM). Free access to food and water was provided. Behavioral testing was performed during the dark phase under red lighting. The balance beam, cross-maze, and elevated plus maze (EPM) were performed as described previously (24.Jawhar S. Trawicka A. Jenneckens C. Bayer T.A. Wirths O. Motor deficits, neuron loss, and reduced anxiety coinciding with axonal degeneration and intraneuronal Aβ aggregation in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Neurobiol.

For the cross-maze, spontaneous alternation rates were calculated as the percentage of actual alternations made relative to the total number of possible alternations. Anxiety was measured in the EPM by determining the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the apparatus during a 5-min period. All EPM data were collected using the ANY-maze video tracking system (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Mouse tissue was processed as described previously (26.Wirths O. Bethge T. Marcello A. Harmeier A. Jawhar S. Lucassen P.J. Multhaup G. Brody D.L. Esparza T. Ingelsson M. Kalimo H. Lannfelt L. Bayer T.A. Pyroglutamate Aβ pathology in APP/PS1KI mice, sporadic and familial Alzheimer disease cases.J. Neural Transm. 2010; 117: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, 4-μm paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a series of ethanol baths. Sections were pretreated with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS to block endogenous peroxidases. Antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling sections in 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6.0), followed by a 3-min incubation in 88% formic acid (FA). Nonspecific antigens were blocked using a solution of 10% FCS and 4% skim milk powder in PBS. Sections were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at room temperature, washed, and then incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibody solution. Staining was visualized using the Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Microscopy was performed on an Olympus BX-51 microscope equipped with a DP-50 camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). The following anti-Aβ antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation (IP), as indicated: 4G8 (Aβ epitope 17–24; Covance, Princeton, NJ), 6E10 (Aβ epitope 4–9; Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA), G2–11 (Aβ epitope at the C terminus of Aβ42 (27.Ida N.

Neural Transm. 2010; 117: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (mouse monoclonal, Synaptic Systems) was used for immunohistochemistry. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse and swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were used as secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Homogenization of brain tissue was performed as described previously (28.Portelius E. Zhang B. Gustavsson M.K. Brinkmalm G. Westman-Brinkmalm A. Zetterberg H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Blennow K. Effects of gamma-secretase inhibition on the amyloid beta isoform pattern in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Neurodeg. Dis. 2009; 6: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the brains (∼50 mg) were homogenized (Pellet Pestle®, Sigma-Aldrich®) on ice in TBS (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The extraction ratio (brain tissue:TBS) was 1:5 (weight/volume). FA was added to the sample (final concentration, 70%) followed by sonication (power, 15; Amplit.microns; TUne, “middle”) and centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The FA-soluble Aβ extract was dried and dissolved in FA and finally neutralized using 0.5 m Tris. IP using the KingFisher magnetic particle processor (Thermo Scientific) and mass spectrometric analysis using MALDI TOF/TOF MS were performed as described previously (29.Portelius E. Tran A.J. Andreasson U. Persson R. Brinkmalm G. Zetterberg H. Blennow K. Westman-Brinkmalm A. Characterization of amyloid beta peptides in cerebrospinal fluid by an automated immunoprecipitation procedure followed by mass spectrometry.J. Prot. Res. 2007; 6: 4433-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (4 μl, 1 mg/ml) of the Aβ-specific antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 was separately added to 50 μl of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The washed beads with bound antibody (50 μl of 6E10 and 50 μl of 4G8) were combined and used for IP of the neutralized FA fraction. IP of brain tissue with the antibody 1–57 was conducted as described above. The beads/FA fraction was transferred to a KingFisher magnetic particle processor for automatic washing and elution of the Aβ isoforms. The collected supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and redissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% FA in 20% acetonitrile. MS measurements were performed using a Bruker Daltonics UltraFlex MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Mice were sacrificed using cervical dislocation. Brains were dissected rapidly on ice, the olfactory bulb and cerebellum were removed, and the hemispheres were separated. Brains were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until use. Frozen brains (n = 3–4 per group) were homogenized on ice in TBS (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)) using a Dounce homogenizer. The extraction ratio (brain tissue:TBS) was 1:8 (weight/volume). Samples were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (TBS fractions) were removed, and the remaining pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of 2% SDS with complete protease inhibitor, sonicated, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (SDS fractions) were treated with 1 μl of Benzonase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C on rotary wheel. All fractions were stored at −80 °C until use. ELISA measurements of Aβx–42 and AβpE3 in the TBS and SDS fractions were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBL Intl., Hamburg, Germany). Aβ levels were normalized to brain wet weight. Extracellular Aβ plaque load was calculated from serial images of the cortex (100× magnification) taken from sagittal sections spaced a minimum of 20 μm apart. Four sections were evaluated per animal (n = 5–7 per group). Using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.41), images were converted into an eight-bit black-and-white format. Image thresholds were set to a fixed value to define the total plaque area. Thresholds were selected to maximize the plaque area detected while minimizing the contribution of intracellular Aβ accumulations. Plaque load was calculated as the percentage area occupied by Aβ immunostaining. Statistical differences were evaluated using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests or unpaired t test, as indicated. All data are given as means ± S.E. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To study the role of AβpE3–42 in AD more precisely, we generated the TBA42 transgenic mouse model. The TBA42 transgene was designed to preferentially liberate Aβ3–42 peptides into the neuronal secretory pathway. This allows QC to enzymatically catalyze the conversion of Aβ3–42 to AβpE3–42 (16.Sevalle J. Amoyel A. Robert P. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Checler F.

Intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ peptides was observed in the hippocampus by the age of 3 months (Fig. 1, A and B). At 6 months of age, intraneuronal Aβ was also seen in cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 1, C and D). Interestingly, analysis of 12-month-old TBA42 mice revealed marked gliosis in the hippocampus (Fig. 1, E and F) and additional Aβ in spinal cord motor neurons (Fig. 1, G and H). Signs of gliosis, an indicator of ongoing neurodegeneration, were absent in age-matched WT mice (Fig. 1, E and F). This finding suggests that gliosis is a consequence of the Aβ aggregation in TBA42 mice. Extracellular Aβ deposits were rarely detected in TBA42 mice at all of the ages analyzed. To determine whether functional impairments accompanied the observed brain pathology, we subjected cohorts of 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old TBA42 mice to a battery of behavioral tests. The balance beam was selected to evaluate general motor coordination. Three and 6-month-old mice performed comparably wtih WT animals. However, by the age of 12 months, TBA42 mice showed significant impairment (p < 0.001; Fig. 2A). Similarly, assessment of working memory in the cross-maze demonstrated that only 12-month-old TBA42 mice had noticeable deficits in this task (p < 0.001; Fig. 2B). AD mouse models can show decreases in anxiety in addition to memory deficits (24.Jawhar S. Trawicka A. Jenneckens C. Bay"

https://openalex.org/W2101358807,"Protein localization within cells regulates accessibility for interactions with co-factors and substrates. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) BiP co-factor ERdj4 is up-regulated by ER stress and has been implicated in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of multiple unfolded secretory proteins. Several other ERdj family members tend to interact selectively with nascent proteins, presumably because those ERdj proteins associate with the Sec61 translocon that facilitates entry of nascent proteins into the ER. How ERdj4 selects and targets terminally misfolded proteins for destruction remains poorly understood. In this study, we determined properties of ERdj4 that might aid in this function. ERdj4 was reported to retain its signal sequence and to be resistant to mild detergent extraction, suggesting that it was an integral membrane protein. However, live cell photobleaching analyses of GFP-tagged ERdj4 revealed that the protein exhibits diffusion coefficients uncommonly high for an ER integral membrane protein and more similar to the mobility of a soluble luminal protein. Biochemical characterization established that the ERdj4 signal sequence is cleaved to yield a soluble protein. Importantly, we found that both endogenous and overexpressed ERdj4 associate with the integral membrane protein, Derlin-1. Our findings now directly link ERdj4 to the ERAD machinery and suggest a model in which ERjd4 could help recruit clients from throughout the ER to ERAD sites."
https://openalex.org/W2053577054,"Accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) in the brain is a common pathological feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aggregates of Aβ are neurotoxic and appear to be critically involved in the neurodegeneration during AD pathogenesis. Accumulation of Aβ could be caused by increased production, as indicated by several mutations in the amyloid precursor protein or the γ-secretase components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 that cause familial early-onset AD. However, recent data also indicate a decreased clearance rate of Aβ in AD brains. We recently demonstrated that Aβ undergoes phosphorylation by extracellular or cell surface-localized protein kinase A, leading to increased aggregation. Here, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of monomeric Aβ at Ser-8 also decreases its clearance by microglial cells. By using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-8 inhibited the proteolytic degradation of monomeric Aβ by the insulin-degrading enzyme, a major Aβ-degrading enzyme released from microglial cells. Phosphorylation also decreased the degradation of Aβ by the angiotensin-converting enzyme. In contrast, Aβ degradation by plasmin was largely unaffected by phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation of Aβ could play a dual role in Aβ metabolism. It decreases its proteolytic clearance and also promotes its aggregation. The inhibition of extracellular Aβ phosphorylation, stimulation of protease expression and/or their proteolytic activity could be explored to promote Aβ degradation in AD therapy or prevention."

Males decorate their arenas meticulously with stones, flowers, and found objects. Previous work has shown that these bowers induce forced perspective illusions in the observing females. Now Kelley and Endler (p. 335 ; see the Perspective by Anderson ) show that mating success is based on components of the illusion, rather than the physical nature of the bower. Thus, females choose their mates based on a visual illusion painstakingly constructed and maintained by the displaying male."

In many tissues, lipogenesis is regulated at the transcriptional level by the activity of sterol-response element-binding proteins (SREBP). The role of SREBP activation in the regulation of lipid metabolism in the lung was assessed in mice in which both Insig1 and Insig2 genes, encoding proteins that bind and inhibit SREBPs in the endoplasmic reticulum, were deleted in alveolar type 2 cells. Although deletion of either Insig1 or Insig2 did not alter SREBP activity or lipid homeostasis, deletion of both genes (Insig1/2Δ/Δ mice) activated SREBP1, causing marked accumulation of lipids that consisted primarily of cholesterol esters and triglycerides in type 2 epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Neutral lipids accumulated in type 2 cells in association with the increase in mRNAs regulating fatty acid, cholesterol synthesis, and inflammation.

Precise regulation of alveolar lipid homeostasis is required for lung function. Lack of surfactant phospholipids and proteins causes respiratory distress syndrome in neonates and participates in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in adults. The fibrosing sequellae that often accompany these syndromes can cause chronic respiratory insufficiency. Lack of pulmonary surfactant, related to mutations in genes critical for surfactant synthesis and activity, causes both acute respiratory failure and life-threatening chronic lung disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis (1Whitsett J.A.

Genet. 2003; 113: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Conversely, excess accumulation of surfactant lipids occurs in the lungs of patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a disorder caused by defects in GM-CSF signaling that impair clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages (5Trapnell B.C. Whitsett J.A. Nakata K. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).

The abundance and composition of lung lipids are precisely regulated. Pulmonary surfactant is enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC) 3The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineSREBPsterol-regulatory element-binding proteinSCAPSREBP cleavage-activating proteinBALFbronchoalveolar lavage fluidSP-Csurfactant protein CRXRretinoid X receptor. and phosphatidylglycerol that play important roles in reduction of surface tension. Surfactant PC is relatively enriched in saturated species. Although cholesterol is present in varying quantities in mammalian surfactants, excess cholesterol impairs the surface tension reducing properties of surfactants (8Leonenko Z. Gill S. Baoukina S. Monticelli L. Doehner J. Gunasekara L. Felderer F. Rodenstein M. Eng L.M. Amrein M. An elevated level of cholesterol impairs self-assembly of pulmonary surfactant into a functional film.Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 674-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Triacylglycerols, an important storage form of lung lipids, are normally present in small amounts in alveolar tissues and are thought to serve as substrates for phospholipid synthesis by alveolar type 2 cells during development (9Torday J. Hua J. Slavin R. Metabolism and fate of neutral lipids of fetal lung fibroblast origin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The role of neutral lipid pools in surfactant lipid homeostasis has not been clearly defined in the adult lung. Surfactant lipid composition and abundance are influenced by lung injury, likely mediated by intracellular and extracellular processes that control synthesis and catabolism of lipids present in pulmonary surfactant (10Gregory T.J. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Whitsett J.A. Reed C.R. Fowler 3rd, A.A. Hudson L.D. Maunder R.J. Crim C. Hyers T.M. Surfactant chemical composition and biophysical activity in acute respiratory distress syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1976-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Thus, a complex regulatory system has evolved to precisely control lung lipid content and composition in the alveolus. phosphatidylcholine sterol-regulatory element-binding protein SREBP cleavage-activating protein bronchoalveolar lavage fluid surfactant protein C retinoid X receptor. Lung lipid homeostasis is regulated by multitiered processes influencing 1) the uptake of lipids from the systemic circulation, 2) synthesis and storage of lipids by epithelial and stromal compartments in the alveolus, and 3) secretion, reuptake, reutilization, and catabolism of surfactant lipids, which together precisely control intracellular and extracellular surfactant pools before and after birth. As in other tissues, lipid homeostasis in the lung is influenced, in part, by sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). SREBP1c expression increases before birth in association with increased lipogenesis in type 2 epithelial cells (11Zhang F. Pan T. Nielsen L.D. Mason R.J. Lipogenesis in fetal rat lung. importance of C/EBPα, SREBP-1c, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Scap gene (encoding the SREBP cleavage-activating protein) inhibited SREBP activity in type 2 cells and enhanced neutral lipid accumulation in lung fibroblasts in the fetal and postnatal mouse lung (12Besnard V. Wert S.E. Stahlman M.T. Postle A.D. Xu Y. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Deletion of Scap in alveolar type II cells influences lung lipid homeostasis and identifies a compensatory role for pulmonary lipofibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4018-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), demonstrating important roles for the SREBP pathway in lung lipid homeostasis. SREBP is activated at the post-transcriptional level by SCAP. SCAP serves as a lipid sensor that in the absence of sterols/phospholipids transports SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi where S1P and S2P proteases release a transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment of SREBP. Conversely, SREBP activity is inhibited by insulin-induced gene proteins 1 and 2 that anchor the SCAP-SREBP complex to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in a lipid-dependent manner. Insig1 and Insig2 share structural similarities and have partially redundant functions (13Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Schoenheimer effect explained. Feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis in mice mediated by Insig proteins.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although germ line deletion of Insig1 in the mouse caused death at birth, germ line deletion of Insig2 did not influence survival. Deletion of both Insig genes in hepatic tissues increased transcription of SREBP target genes causing accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides (13Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Schoenheimer effect explained. Feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis in mice mediated by Insig proteins.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the accumulation of lipid droplets in various tissues during substrate excess causes tissue inflammation and is inhibited in part by the recruitment and activation of tissue macrophages (14Lumeng C.N. Saltiel A.R. Inflammatory links between obesity and metabolic disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). This study was designed to further define the roles of SREBP and insulin-induced genes in the regulation of lung lipid homeostasis and to test whether enhanced lipogenesis influenced surfactant homeostasis, lung lipid content, or lung inflammation. Deletion of Insig1 and -2 induced SREBP1 in alveolar type 2 cells, causing neutral lipid accumulation in type II cells and in the alveoli. The accumulation of lung lipids caused inflammation and airspace remodeling with pathological findings similar to those associated with lipid storage disorders, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Insig1flox/flox and Insig2−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). In Insig1flox/flox mice, loxP sites flank exon 1 of the Insig1 gene. The Insig2 gene is disrupted by replacement of exons II and III with a neo cassette eliminating the first 123 of 225 amino acids (13Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Schoenheimer effect explained. Feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis in mice mediated by Insig proteins.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mice were mated with SFTPC-rtTAWT/Tg/(tetO)7CMV-CreWT/Tg to generate the following: 1) single transgenic Insig2−/− mice; 2) triple transgenic SFTPC-rtTAWT/Tg/(tetO)7CMV-CreWT/Tg/Insig1flox/flox, in which Insig1 was deleted from the respiratory epithelium in utero when dams were exposed to doxycycline from E6.5 to E12.5, herein termed Insig1Δ/Δ, which were compared with littermates lacking either SFTPC-rtTA or (tetO)7CMV-Cre; and 3) quadruple transgenic SFTPC-rtTAWT/Tg/(tetO)7CMV-CreWT/Tg/Insig1flox/flox/Insig2−/− mice. Doxycycline-exposed SFTPC-rtTAWT/Tg/(tetO)7CMV-CreWT/Tg/Insig1flox/flox/Insig2−/− mice are termed Insig1/2Δ/Δ mice throughout. In Insig1/2Δ/Δ mice exposed to doxycycline in utero, Insig1 was conditionally deleted in the Insig2−/− background; Insig1/2Δ/Δ mice were compared with Insig1flox/flox/Insig2−/− mouse littermates lacking either SFTPC-rtTA or (tetO)7CMV-Cre. With this system, recombination of the loxP flanked allele is typically obtained in most alveolar type 2 cells (15Perl A.K. Wert S.E. Loudy D.E. Shan Z. Blair P.A. Whitsett J.A.

Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation. Gestation was dated by detection of the vaginal plug, and dams bearing pups carrying the Insig1flox allele were maintained on doxycycline in food (625 mg/kg dry weight; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) from embryonic days 6.5 to 12.5 to delete Insig1 in progenitor cells that form the peripheral lung and to minimize effects of Cre-recombinase (Cre) or reverse tetracycline transactivator that can occur later in gestation. Mice were killed at 2, 6, and 8 months of age for study. Mice were killed by overdose of anesthetic and exsanguinated by sectioning the abdominal aorta. The anterior thoracic wall was removed. The trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were inflated at a pressure of 25 cm of H2O with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min. The trachea was ligated, and the heart and lungs were removed and immersed in the same fixative at 4 °C for 18 h. After three rinses in cold PBS, the right lung and the upper half of the left lung were dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in paraffin; the lower half of the left lung was immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h, immersed in a 2:1 mixture of 30% sucrose and OCT sectioning medium (Sakura, Torrance, CA) for another 24 h, and then embedded in OCT and stored at −80 °C. Five-μm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were prepared for Movat's pentachrome or hematoxylin and eosin stains (Poly Scientific, Bay Shore, NY) and immunohistochemistry studies. Eight-μm-thick frozen sections were prepared for Oil Red O staining, Nile Red staining, and immunofluorescence studies. The left atrium was cut open, and the lungs were rinsed with 10 ml of PBS injected through the right ventricle and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The lungs were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C. Proteins (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with antibodies targeting SREBP1 (sc-8984, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), fatty-acid synthase (FASN) (BD Transduction Laboratories), and GAPDH (A300-641A, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) as a loading control. Band density was analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Frozen lung sections or BALF cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and rinsed three times in distilled water. Slides were immersed for 2 min in absolute propylene glycol and incubated for 1 h (BALF cells) or overnight (lung sections) at room temperature in Oil Red O solution (Poly Scientific). Slides were then immersed in 85% propylene glycol, rinsed twice in distilled water, and counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. To identify lipid-laden lung cells, frozen lung sections were rehydrated in PBS, blocked with 4% normal goat serum, and stained with an anti-pro-SP-C antibody (WRAB-SPC, Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH) followed by an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). Sections were then counterstained for 5 min with 2.5 mg/ml Nile Red in 75% aqueous glycerol and coverslipped. Nile Red fluorescence was analyzed using a 535–580 nm excitation filter and a 591–667 emission filter. With this filter set, fluorescence emitted by Nile Red predominantly reflects neutral lipids over phospholipids. The number of Nile Red-positive cells relative to the number of pro-SP-C-positive cells in five microscopic fields at ×10 magnification was determined. Lungs from 8-week-old mice were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer and 0.1% calcium chloride, pH 7.3. Tissue was postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin (EMbed 812, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin sections were viewed in a Hitachi H7600 transmission electron microscope, and digitized images were collected with an AMT Advantage Plus 2k × 2k digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). Mice were anesthetized; the trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were lavaged twice with 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4. The total number of cells was determined using trypan blue exclusion, and 10,000 cells were plated onto glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Thermo, Waltham, MA) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for differential counting or kept at −20 °C for Oil Red O staining and immunostaining. In other experiments, BALF cells were lysed, and total RNA was extracted. Mouse alveolar type 2 cells were isolated as described previously (17Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Maintenance of the mouse type II cell phenotype in vitro.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lungs were perfused to remove blood, inflated with Dispase (Stem Cell Technologies, British Columbia, Canada) for 45 min, and trimmed manually. The resulting suspension was filtered on 100-, 40-, and 20-μm filters and incubated for 2 h on 100-mm cultures dishes coated with anti-CD45 and anti-CD16/32 antibodies to eliminate leukocytes. Alveolar type 2 cells were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation. Total alveolar type 2 cells from 2-month-old animals were used for mRNA microarray and RT-PCR. Type 2 cells were purified from 6-month-old Insig1/2Δ/Δ mice and subjected to flow cytometry and sorting using the lipid probe Nile Red with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Phospholipid-rich cells were sorted using a 660/20 nm emission filter. Neutral lipid-rich cells were sorted using a 545/35-nm emission filter (18Greenspan P. Fowler S.D. Spectrofluorometric studies of the lipid probe, Nile Red.J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 781-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral lipid-positive cells were gated based on side scatter and intensity of Nile Red fluorescence. Cells were analyzed and sorted by a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Lung homogenates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were used for cytokine protein analyses. IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, keratinocyte chemoattractant, and MIP2 were analyzed using immunoassays (MILLIPLEXTM Map, Millipore, Billerica, MA). RNA was extracted using RNeasy reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Potentially contaminating genomic DNA was removed by exposure to recombinant DNase I (Roche Applied Science). RNAs were retrotranscribed to complementary DNAs using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed by RT-PCR using TaqMan reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was reported relative to that of 18 S RNA as an internal control. Primer sequences and thermal cycling conditions are listed in supplemental Table 1. IL-1B, IL-12B, and TNF-α mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR using StepOne Plus Time PCR (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to 18 S RNA using RNA isolated from alveolar macrophages isolated from control and Insig1/2-deleted mice, n = 8 per group. For microarray analysis, 700 ng of alveolar type 2 cell RNA from Insig1/2Δ/Δ (n = 3) and Insig1flox/flox/Insig2−/− (n = 3) mice were hybridized to the murine genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The RNA quality and quantity assessment, probe preparation, labeling, hybridization, and image scan were carried out in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Affymetrix Core using standard procedures. Data were analyzed using BRB Array Tools software package (linus.nci.nih.gov). Differentially expressed mRNAs were identified using a random variance t test, which permits sharing information among genes about within-class variation without assuming that all genes have the same variance (19Wright G.W. Simon R.M. A random variance model for detection of differential gene expression in small microarray experiments.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). mRNAs were considered differentially expressed with a p value of ≤0.05 and a fold change of ≥1.5. Affymetrix “Present Call” in at least two of three replicates was set as a prerequisite for gene selection. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to gene ontology, promoter analysis, and pathway analysis. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using the publicly available web-based tool David (data base for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). Over-represented transcription factor-binding site analyses were performed using 2 kb of promoter sequences upstream of transcription start sites of differentially expressed genes (Genomatix). Gene ontology categories were considered to be significant when a Fisher's exact test p value was ≤0.01 and gene hits were ≥10. Over-represented functions, diseases, known pathways, as well as potential protein/protein or protein/DNA interactions were identified using ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity). Customized gene networks were constructed by integrating microarray results, literature mining, and experimental observations. Changes in mRNA expression were compared with those obtained in the lungs of Scap-deleted animals (12Besnard V. Wert S.E. Stahlman M.T. Postle A.D. Xu Y. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Deletion of Scap in alveolar type II cells influences lung lipid homeostasis and identifies a compensatory role for pulmonary lipofibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4018-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes in the Insig deletion array were compared with published gene expression data in the L2L data base. To assess PC synthesis, turnover, and secretion, animals were injected intraperitoneally 3 h before sacrifice with 6.7 μmol of [methyl-9-2H]choline chloride (CDN Isotopes, Pointe-Claire, Canada). Mice were anesthetized; the trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were lavaged five times with 1 ml of PBS. Lavaged lungs were homogenized in 2 ml of PBS. For lamellar body isolation, lungs were homogenized in 2 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, and the lamellar body fraction was isolated by sucrose gradient density centrifugation as described previously (20Besnard V. Matsuzaki Y. Clark J. Xu Y. Wert S.E. Ikegami M. Stahlman M.T. Weaver T.E. Hunt A.N. Postle A.D. Whitsett J.A.

Physiol. 2010; 298: L646-L659Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol, as described previously (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar), from lung homogenate, lamellar bodies, and BALF and from isolated alveolar type 2 cells in an independent experiment. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (PC 14:0/14:0, 15 nmol) and a deuterated triglyceride (glyceryl tri(octadecanoate-18,18,18-d3), CDN Isotopes, 10 nmol) were added as internal standards. The dried lipid extract was divided in two portions for separate electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of phospholipids and neutral lipids. PC was analyzed by ESI-MS as described previously (22Postle A.D. Gonzales L.W. Bernhard W. Clark G.T. Godinez M.H. Godinez R.I. Ballard P.L. Lipidomics of cellular and secreted phospholipids from differentiated human fetal type II alveolar epithelial cells.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1322-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), employing precursor ion scans of the m/z 184 phosphocholine headgroup for endogenous PC species and of the corresponding m/z 193 for newly synthesized PC species. A neutral lipid fraction was isolated as the flow-through from 100 mg of aminopropyl (NH2) BondElut columns (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd.) after application of the second portion of the lipid extract dissolved in chloroform. The neutral lipid fraction was dissolved in 250 μl of 50:50 (v/v) chloroform/methanol solution containing 1% NH4OH (0.880) and introduced into the mass spectrometer by direct infusion at 5 μl/min. Neutral lipids were quantified from the ESI+ scan with a series of fatty acid neutral loss scans for 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3, 20:4, 22:5, and 22:6 used to identify the dominant fatty acid profiles of triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and cholesterol ester species. Specific precursor scans at m/z 369+ were used to confirm the identity of cholesterol ester species, whereas neutral loss of m/z 35 fragments identified diacylglycerol species. Lung mechanics were studied in anesthetized and tracheostomized mice using the FlexiVent System (SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), as described previously (23Ikegami M. Falcone A. Whitsett J.A. STAT-3 regulates surfactant phospholipid homeostasis in normal lung and during endotoxin-mediated lung injury.J. Appl.

Dynamic resistance, elastance, and compliance of the airways were measured as well as tissue damping, tissue compliance, and tissue hysteresivity. Data were expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used for comparisons of continuous variables. Association between categorical variables was tested using the χ2 test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Insig1+/+ and Insig2+/− mice were bred to generate littermate Insig2+/+ and Insig2−/− mice. As reported previously (13Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P.

Deletion of Insig2 had no effect on the levels of the 72-kDa activated SREBP1 (aSREBP1) in the lung and did not change mRNAs of known SREBP target genes, including Fasn, Scd1, Ldlr, and Hmgcs1; compensatory increases in Insig1 mRNA were not observed in the lungs of Insig2−/− mice (data not shown). At 2 and 6 months of age, lungs of Insig2−/− mice were morphologically indistinguishable from the lungs of Insig2+/+ mice by light microscopy and Oil Red O staining.

https://openalex.org/W2041035765,"Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a novel gap junction protein shown to have tumor-suppressive properties. To model its in vivo role in the intratumor biomechanical environment, we investigated whether Panx1 channels modulate the dynamic assembly of multicellular C6 glioma aggregates. Treatment with carbenoxolone and probenecid, which directly and specifically block Panx1 channels, respectively, showed that Panx1 is involved in accelerating aggregate assembly. Experiments further showed that exogenous ATP can reverse the inhibitive effects of carbenoxolone and that aggregate compaction is sensitive to the purinergic antagonist suramin. With a close examination of the F-actin microfilament network, these findings show that Panx1 channels act as conduits for ATP release that stimulate the P(2)X(7) purinergic receptor pathway, in turn up-regulating actomyosin function. Using a unique three-dimensional scaffold-free method to quantify multicellular interactions, this study shows that Panx1 is intimately involved in regulating intercellular biomechanical interactions pivotal in the progression of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157519664,"During co-translational membrane insertion of membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains, the bacterial SecYEG complex needs to interact both with the ribosome and the SecA ATPase. Although the binding sites for SecA and the ribosome overlap, it has been suggested that these ligands can interact simultaneously with SecYEG. We used surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to examine the interaction of SecA and ribosomes with the SecYEG complex present in membrane vesicles and the purified SecYEG complex present in a detergent-solubilized state or reconstituted into nanodiscs. Ribosome binding to the SecYEG complex is strongly stimulated when the ribosomes are charged with nascent chains of the monotopic membrane protein FtsQ. This binding is competed by an excess of SecA, indicating that binding of SecA and ribosomes to SecYEG is mutually exclusive."

We sought to characterize the cellular localization of wild type β-arrestin-1 and a series of N domain mutants to determine the structural basis and functional implications of β-arrestin-1 nuclear localization. A seven-residue candidate nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was identified based on sequence analysis. Mutation of the NLS led to a loss of β-arrestin-1 nuclear localization in transfected cells. Exogenous expression of wild type β-arrestin-1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) induced by bradykinin, whereas mutation of the NLS reduced this effect by two-thirds relative to wild type controls. Loss of β-arrestin-1 nuclear localization was accompanied by reduced recruitment of the CREB-binding protein and altered post-translational modification profile of p65/RelA. Further mutational analysis identified Lys157 within the putative NLS as being critical to nuclear localization of β-arrestin-1. Substitution of Lys157 to Ala led to reduced nuclear localization, decreased promoter binding by p65/RelA and decreased IL-1β gene transcription.

Defects in RbgA give rise to a large ribosomal subunit that is immature and migrates at 45 S in sucrose density gradients. Here, we report a detailed biochemical analysis of RbgA and its interaction with the ribosome. We found that RbgA, like most other GTPases, exhibits a very slow kcat (14 h−1) and has a high Km (90 μm). Homology modeling of the RbgA switch I region using the K-loop GTPase MnmE as a template suggested that RbgA requires K+ ions for GTPase activity, which was confirmed experimentally. Interaction with 50 S subunits, but not 45 S intermediates, increased GTPase activity by ∼55-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2002781399,"PRELP is a 58-kDa proteoglycan found in a variety of extracellular matrices, including cartilage and at several basement membranes. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the cartilage tissue is destroyed and fragmented molecules, including PRELP, are released into the synovial fluid where they may interact with components of the complement system. In a previous study, PRELP was found to interact with the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, which was suggested to locally down-regulate complement activation in joints during RA. Here we show that PRELP directly inhibits all pathways of complement by binding C9 and thereby prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). PRELP does not interfere with the interaction between C9 and already formed C5b-8, but inhibits C9 polymerization thereby preventing formation of the lytic pore. The alternative pathway is moreover inhibited already at the level of C3-convertase formation due to an interaction between PRELP and C3. This suggests that PRELP may down-regulate complement attack at basement membranes and on damaged cartilage and therefore limit pathological complement activation in inflammatory disease such as RA. The net outcome of PRELP-mediated complement inhibition will highly depend on the local concentration of other complement modulating molecules as well as on the local concentration of available complement proteins.

Several reports demonstrate that proteins in the extracellular matrix, among others members of the mainly cartilage-resident small leucine-rich repeat protein (SLRP) family, can trigger complement activation, thereby disturbing the balance in the triggering and control of complement leading to pathological activation. This has been proposed to contribute to the disease progression in RA where these molecules that normally are sequestered within the cartilage suddenly become exposed to complement due to tissue degradation. The SLRPs fibromodulin, osteoadherin, and chondroadherin all bind and activate the classical complement pathway initiator C1q, whereas decorin and biglycan bind C1q while inactivating the molecule (1.Groeneveld T.W.

The complement system can be activated through three distinct pathways that merge at the level of the C3-convertase (Fig. 8). The classical pathway is triggered by immune complexes and several endogenous ligands including C-reactive protein (CRP) (5.Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Interaction of C-reactive protein complexes with the complement system. II. Consumption of guinea pig complement by CRP complexes: requirement for human C1q.J. Immunol. 1974; 113: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the lectin pathway is mainly activated by certain sugar residues on pathogenic surfaces. The alternative pathway is triggered by properdin or by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, rendering a molecule capable of participating in the formation of the alternative C3-convertase. Cleavage of C3 by these convertases leads to the formation of C3b, which by associating with the C3-convertase changes its enzymatic specificity to C5. Cleavage of C5 results in release of C5a, which promotes anaphylaxis, whereas C5b forms the base for the assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC), composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and several molecules of C9 (for review, see Ref. 6.Sarma J.V. Ward P.A. The complement system.Cell Tissue Res. 2011; 343: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The main inhibitory regulation of the complement pathways occurs at the C3- and C5-convertases, whereas formation of the MAC is inhibited by CD59, vitronectin (S-protein), and clusterin (apolipoprotein J or SP-40) (7.Davies A.

PRELP (proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein), another member of the SLRP-family, does not activate complement, but locally regulates the complement response by capturing the complement inhibitor C4BP (4.Happonen K.E.

PRELP is an ∼58-kDa extracellular protein that was originally purified as a component of bovine articular cartilage (10.Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E.

Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. Two novel matrix proteins isolated from articular cartilage show wide distributions among connective tissues.J. Biol.

Belonging to the SLRP-family of proteins, PRELP contains 10 characteristic leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine loops in both the N and C termini. It differs from other proteins in this family by its N terminus rich in proline and arginine residues giving the protein basic properties (12.Bengtsson E. Neame P.J. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25639-25644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PRELP has been shown to bind both heparin and heparan sulfate as well as tyrosine sulfate-rich domains of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibromodulin and osteoadherin, both active in complement stimulation. PRELP can also bind to collagen via its leucine-rich repeat domain. Another ligand is perlecan, prominent in basement membranes (13.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegard D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. The amino-terminal part of PRELP binds to heparin and heparan sulfate.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One function may be to bridge the collagen fibers in the matrix to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface (14.Rucci N. Rufo A. Alamanou M. Capulli M. Del Fattore A. Ahrman E. Capece D. Iansante V. Zazzeroni F. Alesse E. Heinegård D. Teti A. The glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of PRELP acts as a cell type-specific NF-κB inhibitor that impairs osteoclastogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and another to act as a molecular anchor between different components of the extracellular matrix. PRELP or fragments of the protein are most likely released from the degrading cartilage in RA as are other components, even though its release or degradation by matrix proteases has not been studied in detail. Because the protein has been implicated in complement regulation and several closely related proteins have shown direct complement activating or inhibiting properties, we set out to investigate whether PRELP displays other complement modulating activities than binding C4BP. Recombinant human PRELP with a His tag was expressed from the pCEP4-BM40-hisEK vector in HEK293 cells and purified as described in Ref. 13.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegard D. Sommarin Y.

Normal human serum (NHS) was prepared from freshly drawn blood of eight healthy volunteers with a permit of the local ethical committee. The pooled blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature and then 1 h on ice. After two centrifugations, the serum fraction was frozen in aliquots and stored at −80 °C. To prepare heat-inactivated serum, the serum was incubated at +56° for 60 min. Synovial fluids were collected from 14 consecutive patients (4 males, 10 females) fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis and seeking care at the Department of Rheumatology at Lund University hospital due to a synovitis in one knee joint. The collection of synovial fluids upon informed patient consent was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden. For the classical pathway, sheep erythrocytes were washed three times with DGVB2+ (2.5 mm veronal buffer pH 7.35, 72 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 2.5% glucose) and suspended to a concentration of 109 cells/ml. Equal volumes of cell suspension and amboceptor (Dade Behring, diluted 1:3000 in DGVB2+) were mixed and incubated for 20 min at +37 °C with gentle shaking. After two washes with DGVB2+, 25 μl erythrocyte-suspension (5 × 108 cells/ml) was added to microtiter plate wells containing 0.1% NHS with increasing amounts of PRELP in a total volume of 150 μl. Erythrocytes suspended in water served as total lysis control. The plate was incubated in 37 °C for 60 min with shaking, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g to pellet intact cells. The degree of erythrocyte lysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 405 nm (Cary 50 MPR microplate reader, Varian). For the alternative pathway, rabbit erythrocytes were washed three times with Mg2+EGTA (2.5 mm veronal buffer pH 7.35, 10 mm EGTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 2.5% glucose) and suspended to a concentration of 0.5 × 109 cells/ml. Cell-suspension (25 μl) was added to microtiter plate wells containing 1.25% NHS in Mg2+EGTA with increasing amounts of PRELP. Erythrocytes suspended in water served as total lysis control. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with shaking, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g to pellet intact cells. The amount of erythrocyte lysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 405 nm. Aggregated human IgG (2.5 μg/ml, classical pathway), mannan (100 μg/ml, lectin pathway) or zymosan (20 μg/ml, alternative pathway) was coated onto microtiter plates in 75 mm sodium-carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 overnight at +4 °C. The plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. NHS diluted in GVB2+ (5 mm veronal buffer pH 7.4, 144 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, and 1% gelatin) was incubated with increasing concentrations of PRELP, BSA, recombinant decorin or C4BP (classical pathway) or D(+)-mannose (lectin pathway) on ice for 30 min after which the mixtures were added to the plate. For the alternative pathway, NHS was diluted in Mg2+EGTA and incubated as above with PRELP, BSA, or factor H before adding to the plate. The plates were incubated at +37 °C and deposited complement components were detected with antibodies against C3d (A0063, Dako), C5 (A306, Quidel) and C9 (A226, Complement Technologies) followed by HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (P0399, P0449, Dako). The plates were developed with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate (Dako) and H2O2 and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Microtiter plates were coated with 0.1% agarose in water and allowed to dry for 36 h at +37 °C. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. In studies of inhibition of convertase assembly, NHS diluted in Mg2+EGTA was incubated with increasing concentrations of PRELP, BSA, or factor H for 15 min on ice after which the mixture was added to the plate. The plates were incubated at +37 °C for 1 h after which deposited properdin (A239, Complement Technologies) and factor B (A235, Complement Technologies) were detected with specific antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. When studying the effect of PRELP on the dissociation of the convertase, NHS diluted in Mg2+EGTA was added to the agarose-coated plate and incubated at +37 °C for 1 h. Following washing, PRELP, BSA or factor H was diluted in Mg2+EGTA and added to the plate after which the plates were incubated at +37 °C for 1 h. Properdin and factor B remaining bound to the plate were then detected as described above. Microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml PRELP in 75 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 overnight at +4 °C. BSA (1%) was coated as a negative control and aggregated human IgG (2 μg/ml, classical pathway) or zymosan (2 μg/ml, alternative pathway) were coated as positive controls. After blocking the wells with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at RT, increasing amounts of NHS diluted in GVB2+ (classical pathway) or Mg2+EGTA (alternative pathway) were added. Deposition of C4b (Q0369, Dako) or factor B (A235, Complement Technologies) was detected with specific antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Microtiter plates were coated with complement proteins at 5 μg/ml in 75 mm sodium-carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at +4 °C. Wells coated with 5 μg/ml A1AT served as a negative control. Blocking was performed with 200 μl quench (3% fish gelatin (Nordic), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 8.0) for 2 h RT. 125-I-labeled PRELP was diluted in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA) and added to the plate at increasing concentrations. The plates were incubated at +37 °C for 4 h. The radioactivity remaining bound to the plate after washing was determined with a γ-counter (Wallac). Alternatively, plates were coated with PRELP or A1AT at 10 μg/ml in the same buffer as above. After blocking with quench, heat-inactivated NHS diluted in binding buffer was added to the plates, and the plates were incubated at +37 °C for 2 h. Bound proteins were detected with specific antibodies against C5 (A306, Quidel), C7 (A308, Quidel), C8 (A225, Complement Technologies), C9 (A226, Complement Technologies) and C3d (A0063, Dako) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako). The plates were developed and measured as above. EDTA-plasma was separated on a Histopaque-gradient using Histopaque-1119 overlaid with Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). The sample was centrifuged at 700 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The granulocyte band was isolated and washed once with 0.5% human serum albumin in PBS and once with PBS, before suspending cells in RPMI containing 25 mm Hepes (HyClone) to a density of ∼30 × 106 cells/ml. The final cell preparation contained in addition to granulocytes some contaminating erythrocytes. The cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (R&D Systems) for 0–30 min at +37 °C after which they were pelleted and 100 μl supernatant was added to Maxisorp plates coated with 10 μg/ml PRELP, A1AT or C3b. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and bound properdin was detected with a polyclonal antibody against human properdin (A239, Complement Technologies). The proportion of neutrophils in the granulocyte preparation was evaluated by staining the cells with anti-CD16 APC (21279166, Immunotools) and anti-CD4 APC (21278046, Immunotools) followed by flow cytometric analysis. The final neutrophil content of the cell preparation was up to 40%. Amboceptor-coated erythrocytes were prepared as described above and suspended in DGVB2+ to a concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml. Cell suspension aliquots (10 μl) were mixed with 0.1% C9-depleted serum (A326, Complement Technologies) and increasing amounts of PRELP, A1AT (negative control), or C4BP (positive control) in a total volume of 150 μl. The cells were incubated at +37 °C for 1 h with shaking after which they were pelleted and washed twice with PBS. The cells were suspended in a polyclonal antibody against C8 (A225, Complement Technologies) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS with 30 mm NaN3 and incubated for 45 min at room temperature followed by two washes with PBS. A FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (F0250, Dako) diluted in the same buffer as above was then added to the cells and allowed to bind for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, the cells were suspended in 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaN3 and analyzed using flow cytometry. Amboceptor-coated erythrocytes were prepared as described above and suspended in DGVB2+ to a concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml. Cell suspension (25 μl) was mixed with 0.1% C9-depleted serum diluted in DGVB2+ and incubated at +37 °C for 1 h with shaking to allow formation of C5b-8 on the erythrocyte surface. The cells were then washed twice with DGVB2+ and suspended in 0.04 μg/ml solution of C9 (corresponding to the amount of C9 in 0.07% NHS) that had been preincubated 30 min on ice with increasing amounts of PRELP, NC4 (positive control) or A1AT (negative control). Cell lysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min at +37 °C after which the cells were pelleted, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 405 nm was measured. NHS (0.25%) diluted in DGVB2+ was incubated for 30 min at +37 °C with increasing amounts of PRELP, NC4 (250 μg/ml, positive control) or A1AT (200 μg/ml, negative control). The reactions were transferred to microtiter plate wells and 30 μl of erythrocyte suspension (109 cells/ml, prepared as described for the classical pathway hemolytic assay) was added to each sample. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking, the cells were washed twice with TBS and pelleted for 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C, followed by washing with 0.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The cell membranes were pelleted for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, suspended in non-reducing sample buffer and analyzed on a 2.5–10% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for C9 (A226, Complement Technologies). The amount of formed C9 polymer was quantified from the membrane with densitometry using the software Science Lab 2003 Image Gauge 4.1 (Fujifilm). The concentration of PRELP in synovial fluid was measured using a competition ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with 0.2 μg/ml PRELP in 75 mm sodium-carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at +4 °C and further protein adsorption was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. A polyclonal PRELP antibody (AF6447, R&D systems) was labeled with 125I using the Chloramine T method. The antibody was diluted in PBS and incubated overnight at room temperature with serial dilutions of PRELP or synovial fluid in PBS. The mixtures were then added to the coated wells and incubated for 2 h at +37 °C. After washing, the amount of bound antibody was measured using a γ-counter. Synovial fluid PRELP concentrations were calculated based on the standard curve generated from the PRELP dilution series. Synovial fluids were depleted from albumin and IgG using AlbuSorb (Biotech Support Group) and protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to instructions provided by the manufacturers. Depleted samples were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Two parts sample was mixed with one part 50% (w/v) TCA and incubated for 3 h on ice. Precipitates were pelleted and washed once with ice-cold acetone. The dried pellets were dissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and separated on 10–15% gradient gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking further direct adsorption with 3% fish gelatin in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 8.0 for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with a 125I-labeled polyclonal anti-PRELP antibody (AF6447, R&D Systems) diluted in blocking buffer. After washing, bound antibody was measured using a PhosphoImager (Fujifilm). The specificity of the signal was evaluated by preincubating the antibody with PRELP in solution prior to incubation with the membrane. To investigate PRELP as an inhibitor of complement, erythrocytes were subjected to complement attack in the presence of increasing amounts of PRELP and the amount of erythrocyte lysis was measured. PRELP caused a dose-dependent inhibition of lysis through the classical pathway (Fig. 1A), but no effect was seen on alternative pathway-induced hemolysis (Fig. 1B). To document at which step the complement cascade is inhibited, microtiter plates were coated with aggregated IgG (classical pathway), mannan (lectin pathway), or zymosan (alternative pathway) as complement activating ligands and NHS preincubated with PRELP was added. Deposition of individual complement components was measured with specific antibodies. PRELP did not inhibit deposition of C3b or C5 through the classical pathway, but strong inhibition was seen at the level of C9-deposition (Fig. 2). As a positive control we used decorin known to bind the stalks of C1q and thus inhibit the classical pathway (1.Groeneveld T.W. Oroszlán M. Owens R.T. Faber-Krol M.C. Bakker A.C. Arlaud G.J. McQuillan D.J. Kishore U. Daha M.R. Roos A. Interactions of the extracellular matrix proteoglycans decorin and biglycan with C1q and collectins.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4715-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or C4BP. Similarly, PRELP did not inhibit C3b- or C5-deposition through the lectin pathway whereas that of C9 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). d(+)mannose, which binds the heads of MBL and inhibits the binding of MBL to immobilized mannan, was used as a positive control for the lectin pathway. PRELP inhibited deposition of C3b and further C5 and C9 through the alternative pathway (Fig. 2). Therefore, it appears that PRELP can inhibit all three pathways at the level of MAC-formation and has an additional inhibitory activity on the early steps of the alternative pathway. Because PRELP had the ability to inhibit deposition of C3b through the alternative pathway, we speculated that PRELP might interfere with the alternative pathway C3-convertase. Plates were coated with agarose as a complement-activating ligand and then incubated with NHS in the presence of increasing amounts of PRELP. To evaluate the amount of formed convertase, deposited properdin, and factor B were measured with specific antibodies. PRELP caused a significant decrease both in the deposition of properdin and factor B (Fig. 3A), even though the effect was not as strong as that of the positive control, factor H. When studying the dissociation of the convertase, NHS alone was first added to the agarose-coated plates after which PRELP was added at increasing concentration. PRELP had only a weak ability to dissociate preformed C3-convertases (Fig. 3B), indicating that the inhibition occurs mainly at the stage of convertase assembly. As PRELP interfered with the assembly and to some extent increased the dissociation of the alternative pathway C3-convertase, we hypothesi"

DAT function in heterologous cells is regulated by subcellular targeting, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking, but the mechanisms regulating neuronal DAT remain poorly understood. Hence, we generated a knock-in mouse expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-tagged DAT to study endogenous transporter trafficking. Introduction of the HA tag into the second extracellular loop of mouse DAT did not perturb its expression level, distribution pattern, or substrate uptake kinetics. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy imaging using fluorescently labeled HA-specific antibody and a quantitative HA-antibody endocytosis assay demonstrated that in axons HA-DAT was primarily located in the plasma membrane and internalized mostly in growth cones and varicosities, where synaptic vesicle markers were also concentrated. Formation of varicosities was frequently preceded or accompanied by highly dynamic filopodia-like membrane protrusions. Remarkably, HA-DAT often concentrated at the tips of these filopodia. This pool of HA-DATs exhibited low lateral membrane mobility. Thus, DAT-containing filopodia may be involved in synaptogenesis in developing DA neurons. Treatment of neurons with amphetamine increased mobility of filopodial HA-DAT and accelerated HA-DAT endocytosis in axons, suggesting that chronic amphetamine may interfere with DA synapse development. Interestingly, phorbol esters did not accelerate endocytosis of axonal DAT.—Rao, A., Richards, T. L., Simmons, D., Zahniser, N. R., Sorkin, A.

https://openalex.org/W2012902336,"Activation of the high affinity IgE-binding receptor (FcϵRI) results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two conserved tyrosines located close to the COOH terminus of the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk. Synthetic peptides representing the last 10 amino acids of the tail of Syk with these two tyrosines either nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated were used to precipitate proteins from mast cell lysates. Proteins specifically precipitated by the phosphorylated peptide were identified by mass spectrometry. These included the adaptor proteins SLP-76, Nck-1, Grb2, and Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (GADS) and the protein phosphatases SHIP-1 and TULA-2 (also known as UBASH3B or STS-1). The presence of these in the precipitates was further confirmed by immunoblotting. Using the peptides as probes in far Western blots showed direct binding of the phosphorylated peptide to Nck-1 and SHIP-1. Immunoprecipitations suggested that there were complexes of these proteins associated with Syk especially after receptor activation; in these complexes are Nck, SHIP-1, SLP-76, Grb2, and TULA-2 (UBASH3B or STS-1). The decreased expression of TULA-2 by treatment of mast cells with siRNA increased the FcϵRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines of Syk and the phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ2. There was parallel enhancement of the receptor-induced degranulation and activation of nuclear factor for T cells or nuclear factor κB, indicating that TULA-2, like SHIP-1, functions as a negative regulator of FcϵRI signaling in mast cells. Therefore, once phosphorylated, the terminal tyrosines of Syk bind complexes of proteins that are positive and negative regulators of signaling in mast cells.

FcϵRI, like other members of the multisubunit immune recognition receptors such as those on T and B cells, have a ligand binding domain with no enzymatic activity but are associated with subunits that have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) sequences within their cytoplasmic domains. Aggregation of FcϵRI results in phosphorylation of the tyrosines of the ITAM in the β and γ subunits of the receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosines then serve as a docking site for the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Syk; this binding results in a conformational change and activation of Syk, which is essential for the downstream propagation of signaling in mast cells (4.Siraganian R.P. de Castro R.O.

The recruitment to the receptor and the activation of Syk results, directly or indirectly, in the phosphorylation of a number of downstream enzymes and adaptor molecules, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), Vav-1, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), Btk, and Gab2 (2.Alvarez-Errico D.

Complexes are formed that are important for signaling; for example, tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT functions as a scaffold providing direct binding sites for growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (GADS), and PLC-γ, and through those proteins, there is association of SLP-76, Nck, and other adaptors. Phospholipase C-γ catalyzes the generation of inositol triphosphate, which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activates store-operated calcium channels for the influx of Ca2+ (8.Vig M.

Syk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk, SLP-76, LAT, and PLC-γ is essential to generate signals for sustained Ca2+ influx. All these events culminate with mast cell degranulation, phosphorylation of MAP kinases, activation of nuclear factor for T cell activation (NFAT) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which turn on cytokine synthesis. The extent of mast cell signaling is also determined by negative regulators; these include the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases as well as lipid or tyrosine phosphatase SHIP-1/2, PTEN, and SHP1/2 that are recruited or activated by inhibitory receptors (9.Siraganian R.P. Mast cell signal transduction from the high-affinity IgE receptor.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Activation of Syk also leads to phosphorylation of a number of its tyrosines (4.Siraganian R.P. de Castro R.O. Barbu E.A. Zhang J.

Regulation and function of syk tyrosine kinase in mast cell signaling and beyond.J. Signal. Transduct. 2011; 2011: 507291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues regulates the activity of Syk and provides binding sites for other molecules. Among these are Tyr residues in the linker region between the SH2 and kinase domains that when phosphorylated provide a binding site for Cbl, a negative regulator of protein-tyrosine kinases. Similarly, the two adjacent tyrosines in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Syk (Tyr-519/Tyr-520) 3The amino acid numbering system is for the rat Syk sequence, NCBI accession number NP_036890. are critical for downstream propagation of signals after immunoreceptor activation (10.Zhang J.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal region of Syk has three evolutionarily conserved tyrosines (Tyr-623, Tyr-624, and Tyr-625 of the rat sequence), the last two of which are also conserved in human ZAP-70 (11.Zeitlmann L.

The last two tyrosines (Tyr-624 and Tyr-625) are phosphorylated in both Syk and ZAP-70 by in vitro autophosphorylation or following receptor stimulation (13.Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Identification of the major sites of autophosphorylation of the murine protein-tyrosine kinase Syk.Biochim. Biophys.

Structural and mutational studies suggest that the COOH-terminal tyrosines play a role in regulating Syk function. The crystal structure of ZAP-70 suggests that this family of kinases has an autoinhibitory state where there are interactions of Tyr in the tail with both the kinase and the inter-SH2 region that keeps the kinase in a closed non-active conformation (15.Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J.

The binding of Syk to the p-ITAM results in a conformational change that exposes the COOH-terminal region (16.Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This leads to the phosphorylation of the two tyrosines (Tyr-624 and Tyr-625), which then keeps the molecule in an open conformation, allowing for further phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues on Syk both by other tyrosine kinases but mostly by autophosphorylation (17.Zhang J.

The mutation of these two tyrosines results in Syk with decreased in vitro kinase activity, and when expressed in mast cells, it is less efficient in FcϵRI signaling with reduced mast cell degranulation, decreased phosphorylation of MAP kinases, and lower activation of NFAT and NFκB (12.de Castro R.O. Zhang J. Jamur M.C. Oliver C. Siraganian R.P. Tyrosines in the carboxyl terminus regulate Syk kinase activity and function.J. Biol.

When B cell signaling is reconstituted in S2 insect cells, Tyr-630 of human Syk (analogous to Tyr-624 of rat Syk) is phosphorylated following B cell receptor activation, and this creates a binding site for SLP-65 (18.Kulathu Y.

In the present study, we investigated whether the two tyrosines in the tail region of Syk that are phosphorylated after receptor activation can be docking sites for other proteins. A synthetic peptide representing the last 10 amino acids of the tail of Syk with these two tyrosines phosphorylated precipitated signaling proteins from mast cell lysates. These included the adaptors known to be important for signaling, including SLP-76, Nck, Grb2, GADS, and the phosphatases SHIP-1 and TULA-2 (also called UBASH3B or STS-1). Part of this interaction was a result of complexes of these proteins forming after receptor activation. Among these proteins, SLP-76, Grb2, and GADS are required for signaling as mast cells deficient in these molecules display severely diminished degranulation and cytokine production following FcϵRI aggregation (19.Pivniouk V.I.

Two biotinylated synthetic peptides containing the last 10 COOH-terminal amino acids of rat Syk were from Bionexus (Oakland, CA); one of these peptides was non-phosphorylated (YYY), whereas the other was phosphorylated (YPP) at tyrosines representing Tyr-624 and Tyr-625 (Fig. 1A). Lysates from 2 × 107 RBL-2H3 cells were prepared as described above in Triton lysis buffer, and the postnuclear supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of neutravidin-coated beads. After gentle rotation at 4 °C for 60 min, the beads were removed by centrifugation (200 × g at 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of neutravidin beads coupled with 1 μm biotinylated YYY peptide. After a 60-min incubation as described above, the supernatant was collected and then incubated for 60 min with 50 μl of neutravidin beads coupled with 1 μm biotinylated YPP peptide. The beads containing the precipitated proteins were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. For Western blotting experiments, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed as described above. In some experiments, these beads were used for two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis as describe below. The two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis was performed by Applied Biomics (Hayward, CA). Briefly, proteins precipitated by the YYY peptide were labeled with Cy3 (green), and proteins precipitated by the YPP peptide were labeled with Cy5 (red). After isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, protein spots were selected that showed preferential binding to the phosphorylated peptide. The spots were picked up and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). Proteins precipitated using the synthetic peptides (YYY and YPP) were eluted from the beads and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the membranes containing the proteins were incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 155 mm NaCl, 4% BSA, 0.6 μg/ml biotin, and 0.015% Tween 20). Separately, 0.2 μg of each biotinylated peptide was incubated with 1.5 μg of HRP-conjugated streptavidin with gentle rotation for 1 h, and then 0.6 μg of biotin (200-fold molar excess) was added to block the HRP-conjugated streptavidin not associated with the biotinylated peptide. The blots were probed with 0.01 μg/ml YYY or YPP biotinylated peptides prebound to HRP-conjugated streptavidin. After that, the membranes were washed several times with Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 155 mm NaCl, and 0.015% Tween 20) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The β-hexosaminidase release was determined in transfected BMMC that were sensitized for 24 h with 0.3 μg/ml antigen-specific IgE (anti-trinitrophenyl mAb TIB-142) as described previously (32.Zhang J.

There are three adjacent tyrosines (623–625 in rat Syk) in the COOH-terminal region of Syk that are highly conserved with the exception of Tyr-623, which is absent in human ZAP-70. The two terminal residues, Tyr-624 and Tyr-625, are autophosphorylated in vitro, and they are phosphorylated in mast cells after FcϵRI activation (13.Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H.

https://openalex.org/W1979085586,"Inhibin is a heterodimeric peptide hormone produced in the ovary that antagonizes activin signaling and FSH synthesis in the pituitary. The inhibin β-subunit interacts with the activin type II receptor (ActRII) to functionally antagonize activin. The inhibin α-subunit mature domain (N terminus) arose relatively early during the evolution of the hormone, and inhibin function is decreased by an antibody directed against the α-subunit N-terminal extension region or by deletion of the N-terminal region. We hypothesized that the α-subunit N-terminal extension region interacts with the activin type I receptor (ALK4) to antagonize activin signaling in the pituitary. Human or chicken free α-subunit inhibited activin signaling in a pituitary gonadotrope-derived cell line (LβT2) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an N-terminal extension deletion mutant did not. An α-subunit N-terminal peptide, but not a control peptide, was able to inhibit activin A signaling and decrease activin-stimulated FSH synthesis. Biotinylated inhibin A, but not activin A, bound ALK4. Soluble ALK4-ECD bioneutralized human free α-subunit in LβT2 cells, but did not affect activin A function. Competitive binding ELISAs with N-terminal mutants and an N-terminal region peptide confirmed that this region is critical for direct interaction of the α-subunit with ALK4. These data expand our understanding of how endocrine inhibin achieves potent antagonism of local, constitutive activin action in the pituitary, through a combined mechanism of competitive binding of both ActRII and ALK4 by each subunit of the inhibin heterodimer, in conjunction with the co-receptor betaglycan, to block activin receptor-ligand binding, complex assembly, and downstream signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1990728896,"The ability to channel excess fatty acids into neutral lipids like triacylglycerol (TAG) is a critical strategy used by cells to maintain lipid homeostasis. Upon activation to acyl-CoA, fatty acids become readily available as substrates for acyltransferases involved in neutral lipid synthesis. Neutral lipids are then packed into organelles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum called lipid particles (LPs). The first acylation step in the de novo pathway for TAG synthesis is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs). Two isoforms, Gat1p/Gpt2p and Gat2p/Sct1p, are present in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous evidence indicated that these enzymes contribute differentially to the synthesis of TAG in actively growing cells. In this work we studied the role of the yeast GPATs in the formation of LPs induced by a surplus of oleic acid. Yeast lacking Gat1p (but not Gat2p) were sensitive to oleate and failed to accumulate LPs induced by this unsaturated fatty acid. It is shown that oleate induces dephosphorylation of Gat1p as well as an increment in its levels. Most importantly, we identified novel Gat1p crescent structures that are formed in the presence of oleate. These structures are connected with the endoplasmic reticulum and are intimately associated with LPs. No such structures were observed for Gat2p. A crucial point of control of lipid fluxes at the GPAT step is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2076894591,"Galectin-8 (Gal8) interacts with β-galactoside-containing glycoproteins and has recently been implicated to play a role in platelet activation. It has been suggested that Gal8 may also interact with platelet coagulation factor V (FV). This indispensable cofactor is stored in α-granules of platelets via a poorly understood endocytic mechanism that only exists in megakaryocytes (platelet precursor cells). In this study, we now assessed the putative role of Gal8 for FV biology. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and a solid phase binding assay revealed that Gal8 binds FV. The data further show that β-galactosides block the interaction between FV and Gal8. These findings indicate that Gal8 specifically interacts with FV in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. Confocal microscopy studies and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that megakaryocytic DAMI cells internalize FV. Flow cytometry showed that these cells express Gal8 on their cell surface. Reducing the functional presence of Gal8 on the cells either by an anti-Gal8 antibody or by siRNA technology markedly impaired the endocytic uptake of FV. Compatible with the apparent role of Gal8 for FV uptake, endocytosis of FV was also affected in the presence of β-galactosides. Strikingly, thrombopoietin-differentiated DAMI cells, which represent a more mature megakaryocytic state, not only lose the capacity to express cell-surface bound Gal8 but also lose the ability to internalize FV. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for the tandem repeat Gal8 in promoting FV endocytosis."

A web of circadian pacemakers.Cell. 2002; 111: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The core of the clock mechanism in almost all organisms studied to date is a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop that relies on positive and negative oscillators (9.King D.P.

In mammals, three basic helix-loop-helix PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain-containing transcription factors, called CLOCK, NPAS2, and BMAL1, constitute the positive elements. CLOCK or NPAS2 heterodimerizes with BMAL1 to form a transcriptionally active complex that binds to E-box elements (CACGTG) present in the promoters of members of the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) gene families (Per1, -2, and -3 and Cry1 and -2). Once the PER and CRY proteins have been translated, they form heterodimers that can then translocate to the nucleus to repress CLOCK (NPAS2)-BMAL1-mediated transcription through direct protein-protein interaction. These interactions then set up the rhythmic oscillations of gene expression that drive the circadian clock. The functions of various clock proteins, including CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, and CRY2, are regulated via phosphorylation by various enzymes, including casein kinase-1 ϵ (CK1ϵ), CK1δ, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), and casein kinase-2 (CK2) (12.Hirayama J.

Virshup D.M. Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). For example, in the Syrian hamster, the tau mutation causing a short period phenotype affects the gene encoding CK1ϵ. CK1ϵ was subsequently demonstrated to phosphorylate PER2 (15.Lowrey P.L. Shimomura K. Antoch M.P. Yamazaki S. Zemenides P.D. Ralph M.R. Menaker M. Takahashi J.S. Positional syntenic cloning and functional characterization of the mammalian circadian mutation tau.Science. 2000; 288: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), and the short period phenotype of tau hamsters was directly linked to their lower rate of CK1ϵ-dependent PER2 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, a defect in CK1ϵ-mediated PER2 phosphorylation has also been implicated in human sleep disorders. For example, familial advanced sleep phase syndrome is associated with a missense mutation in the human PER2 gene, and the corresponding mutated PER2 protein is less effectively phosphorylated by CK1ϵ in vitro than is wild type (WT) PER2 (16.Toh K.L. Jones C.R. He Y. Eide E.J. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. Ptácek L.J. Fu Y.H. An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, CK1ϵ-mediated PER2 phosphorylation has been shown to decrease the stability of PER2 protein by promoting its ubiquitination (17.Akashi M. Tsuchiya Y. Yoshino T. Nishida E.

Notably, changes in PER2 stability have been linked to changes in the period length of circadian rhythms (19.Vanselow K. Vanselow J.T. Westermark P.O. Reischl S. Maier B. Korte T. Herrmann A.

In this study, we present evidence that PER2 may also be regulated by MKK7-JNK-mediated phosphorylation, establishing a role for the stress kinase MKK7 in controlling the mammalian circadian clock. Importantly, we demonstrate that the MKK7-JNK signaling pathway has an effect opposite to that of CK1ϵ-induced PER2 destabilization. Thus, MKK7-JNK signaling may provide a balancing influence on clock protein functions that helps to maintain the normal periodicity of the circadian clock machinery.

MEFs, HeLa cells, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). ES cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 15% FBS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and leukemia inhibitory factor (propagation medium). Cultured cells were transfected with Fugene (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SP600125 and calyculin A were purchased from Calbiochem and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, respectively. To obtain lines of Mkk7flox/flox MEFs stably expressing firefly luciferase from a 1.8-kb Per2 promoter fragment, Mkk7flox/flox MEFs were co-transfected with linearized mouse Per2 promoter-pGL3basic (7 μg) and pcDNA3.1 (1 μg) vectors. After 1 day in standard culture, 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added, and cultures were selected for 2 weeks. Colonies were picked, and their real-time luciferase activities were determined using a Kronos system (ATTO). Two cell lines that showed robust circadian patterns of luciferase activity were selected for further experimentation. Antibodies (Abs) recognizing the following proteins were used in this study: Myc (9E10), JNK (sc-571), JNK (sc-137018), CLOCK, and actin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); ERK, c-Jun, phosphorylated c-Jun, and phosphorylated JNK (Cell Signaling); CK1ϵ (Abcam); mouse PER2 (Alpha Diagnostic International Inc.); HA (Immunology Consultants Laboratory); and FLAG (Sigma).

Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously with some modifications (22.Hirayama J. Sahar S. Grimaldi B. Tamaru T. Takamatsu K. Nakahata Y. Sassone-Corsi P. CLOCK-mediated acetylation of BMAL1 controls circadian function.Nature. 2007; 450: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). 293T cells or MEFs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were incubated with 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. The bead mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with the Abs described in each figure legend plus 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and centrifuged. The supernatant was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting, as described below. Immunoprecipitated materials and total cell extracts obtained as described above were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 2 or 5% nonfat milk and incubated for 10 h at 4 °C with the Abs indicated in each figure legend. The blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary Ab plus peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and developed with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Myc-PER2 was co-expressed with HA-tagged ubiquitin in 293T cells. The cells were lysed in 1% SDS buffer (1% SDS in TBS), boiled for 10 min, and diluted 10-fold in incubation buffer (1% Triton X-100 in TBS) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc. Retroviruses used in this study were produced using the RetroMax expression system (IMGENEX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NLS-CRE was expressed in Mkk7flox/flox MEFs using the pCLNCX-NLS-CRE vector, with pMD.G/vsv-g as the enveloping vector. The high infection efficiency (95–100%) of this system was confirmed by infecting MEFs with pCLNCX vector expressing GFP (data not shown). To investigate whether MKK7 was involved in circadian regulation, we examined cultured cells under conditions that provide a good model of the cell-autonomous circadian oscillation that occurs in mammalian peripheral tissues (24.Tsuchiya Y. Nishida E. Mammalian cultured cells as a model system of peripheral circadian clocks.J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When cultured human and mouse cells are treated with dexamethasone (Dex), a rhythm of circadian gene expression is entrained (24.Tsuchiya Y. Nishida E. Mammalian cultured cells as a model system of peripheral circadian clocks.J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To visualize circadian rhythms in cultured MEFs, we used previously generated mice carrying a conditional Mkk7 allele (Mkk7flox/flox mice) (25.Schramek D. Kotsinas A. Meixner A. Wada T. Elling U. Pospisilik J.A. Neely G.G. Zwick R.H. Sigl V. Forni G. Serrano M. Gorgoulis V.G. Penninger J.M. The stress kinase MKK7 couples oncogenic stress to p53 stability and tumor suppression.Nat.

Nishina H. Stress-activated protein kinase MKK7 regulates axon elongation in the developing cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16872-16883Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to establish cultures of mutant MEFs (Mkk7flox/flox MEFs) in which MKK7 could be genetically inactivated by expression of NLS-CRE (Fig. 1A, left). We then generated two independent lines of Mkk7flox/flox MEFs that stably expressed firefly luciferase from a 1.8-kb DNA fragment containing the mouse Per2 promoter (Per2-Luc/Mkk7flox/flox line 1, Per2-Luc/Mkk7flox/flox line 2). Retroviral transduction of NLS-CRE resulted in genetic inactivation of MKK7 in both cell lines (Fig. 1A, middle and right). When we treated these cells with Dex and monitored real-time Per2 promoter-driven luciferase bioluminescence, we found that NLS-CRE-mediated inactivation of MKK7 significantly lengthened the circadian period of bioluminescence in both Per2-Luc/Mkk7flox/flox line 1 and Per2-Luc/Mkk7flox/flox line 2 MEFs (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, MKK7 influences circadian gene expression in unstressed cells. Because MKK7 is a specific activator of JNK (1.Davis R.J. Signal transduction by the JNK group of MAP kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 2.Chang L. Karin M. Mammalian MAP kinase signaling cascades.Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar), we speculated that the altered circadian periodicity we observed following MKK7 inactivation might be associated with impaired JNK function. We therefore examined the effect of MKK7 inactivation on JNK phosphorylation. Previous reports have established that, even in the absence of external stress, cultured cells exhibit a low level of JNK phosphorylation (5.Pizzio G.A. Hainich E.C. Ferreyra G.A. Coso O.A.

Fukuhara C. c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 modulates the period of mammalian circadian rhythms.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 812-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a result we confirmed in our Mkk7flox/flox MEFs (Fig. 1D, left). When we treated Mkk7flox/flox MEFs with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, JNK phosphorylation was markedly increased. However, when MKK7 was genetically deleted, JNK phosphorylation was significantly reduced both in untreated and calyculin A-treated MEFs (Fig. 1D, right), showing that the stress-independent JNK activation observed in cultured cells depends on the kinase activity of MKK7. We then examined the effect of the kinase inhibitor SP600125 (which blocks JNK activity) on circadian gene expression and found that SP600125 treatment lengthened the circadian period of bioluminescence in both Per2-Luc/Mkk7flox/flox line 1 and 2 MEFs (supplemental Fig. 2). Importantly, the effects of SP600125 on circadian gene expression were strikingly similar to those of MKK7 genetic inactivation (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, our results are consistent with previous studies showing that SP600125 extends the period of circadian transcription in cultured cells and in ex vivo organ culture systems (6.Chansard M. Molyneux P. Nomura K. Harrington M.E. Fukuhara C. c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 modulates the period of mammalian circadian rhythms.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 812-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Yagita K.

Cytochem. 2009; 42: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings provide evidence that the MKK7-JNK signaling pathway is involved in the circadian regulation of gene expression. To identify the MKK7-JNK target(s) involved in regulating the mammalian circadian clock, we overexpressed an MKK7-JNK (WT) fusion protein in 293T or HeLa cells and performed Western blotting (WB). It has been previously demonstrated that expression of this MKK7-JNK (WT) fusion protein, but not of a kinase-negative (KN) version (MKK7-JNK (KN)), results in trans-phosphorylation of JNK by the fused MKK7 and a subsequent marked increase in JNK catalytic activity (21.Rennefahrt U.E. Illert B. Kerkhoff E. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Constitutive JNK activation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts induces a partially transformed phenotype.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29510-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun, a well known JNK target (1.Davis R.J. Signal transduction by the JNK group of MAP kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar), was strongly induced by overexpression of MKK7-JNK (WT) but not by MKK7-JNK (KN) (Fig. 2A). We then examined the effect of MKK-JNK (WT) on the co-expression of a set of Myc-tagged clock proteins. Interestingly, MKK7-JNK (WT) caused a significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Myc-PER2 and Myc-BMAL1 (Fig. 2B) that could be reversed by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). These data indicate that JNK-mediated phosphorylation can induce a mobility shift in clock proteins, implying a concrete interaction between MKK7-JNK signaling and the clock machinery. A particular threonine-proline motif is a consensus site for JNK phosphorylation (28.Gdalyahu A. Ghosh I. Levy T. Sapir T. Sapoznik S. Fishler Y. Azoulai D. Reiner O. DCX, a new mediator of the JNK pathway.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We overexpressed Myc-PER2 or Myc-BMAL1 in the presence or absence of MKK7-JNK (WT) in cultured cells and examined whether these proteins were phosphorylated on this motif. We immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged clock proteins with anti-Myc Ab followed by WB analysis using an Ab specifically recognizing proteins bearing the phosphorylated threonine-proline (pTP) motif. We found that PER2 was modestly phosphorylated on its threonine-proline motif(s) in control cells but that this PER2 phosphorylation was greatly enhanced by MKK7-JNK (WT) (Fig. 2E). However, no band corresponding to BMAL1 phosphorylation was detected in either control or MKK7-JNK (WT)-expressing cells (data not shown). We therefore speculated that PER2 is the more likely circadian target of MKK7-JNK signaling and thus focused our subsequent analyses mainly on PER2. We tested whether JNK could physically interact with clock proteins using co-immunoprecipitation assays. First, we co-expressed FLAG-JNK with Myc-PER2, Myc-BMAL1, or Myc-LacZ (negative control) in 293T cells and subjected lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG Ab. We found that these exogenous forms of PER2 and BMAL1 both co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-JNK (Fig. 3A). To confirm an interaction between PER2 and JNK at the endogenous level, we used anti-PER2 Ab to immunoprecipitate endogenous PER2 from Dex-synchronized WT MEFs at various time points and performed WB to detect endogenous JNK. Indeed, endogenous JNK co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PER2 in a manner that appeared to depend on the abundance of PER2 protein (Fig. 3B). During the course of the above experiments, we realized that MKK7-JNK (WT) expression increased the abundance of PER2 protein, suggesting that MKK7-JNK signaling might affect PER2 stability. To test this possibility, we co-expressed increasing amounts of MKK7-JNK (WT) with Myc-PER2 and Myc-GFP in 293T cells and detected a dose-dependent increase in PER2 protein (Fig. 4A). This PER2 up-regulation was almost entirely dependent on the enzymatic activity of JNK because it was not observed when Myc-PER2 was co-expressed with MKK7-JNK (KN). A more modest increase in Myc-PER2 protein was observed in HeLa cells expressing MKK7-JNK (WT) (data not shown), indicating that this phenomenon varies by cell type. We believe that the MKK7-JNK-induced increase in PER2 protein is not due to an elevation in Per2 mRNA because MKK7-JNK co-expression did not affect levels of Myc-GFP protein (Fig. 4A), whose transcription was controlled by the same CMV promoter as that controlling Per2. We next investigated the effect of MKK7-JNK (WT) on the half-life of PER2 protein. To this end, we co-transfected cultured cells expressing Myc-PER2 plus Myc-GFP with empty vector, MKK7-JNK (WT), or MKK7-JNK (KN) and treated the cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent new protein synthesis. Intriguingly, MKK7-JNK (WT), but not MKK7-JNK (KN), markedly extended the half-life of Myc-PER2 protein (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the PER2 protein stabilization attributable to MKK7-JNK (WT) depends on the kinase activity of JNK. We previously established mouse ES cells bearing disruptions of both the Mkk4 and Mkk7 genes (MKK-DKO ES cells) (29.Nishitai G. Shimizu N. Negishi T. Kishimoto H. Nakagawa K. Kitagawa D. Watanabe T.

Stress induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis independent of SAPK/JNK activation in embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the circadian machinery is not functional in ES cells (30.Yagita K. Horie K. Koinuma S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3846-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we can study this cell type to avoid the effects of time-dependent regulation of clock protein expression and degradation. We confirmed that JNK phosphorylation, and therefore activity, was markedly diminished in MKK-DKO ES cells (Fig. 4D), consistent with our previous report (29.Nishitai G. Shimizu N. Negishi T. Kish"

To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in γ-globin expression, a novel fluorescent-based cellular reporter assay system was developed. Using homologous recombination, two reporter genes, DsRed and EGFP, were inserted into a 183-kb intact human β-globin locus under the control of (G)γ- or (A)γ-globin promoter and β-globin promoter, respectively. The modified constructs were stably transfected into adult murine erythroleukaemic (MEL) cells and human embryonic or fetal erythroleukemic (K562) cells, allowing for rapid and simultaneous analysis of fetal and adult globin gene expression according to their developmental stage-specific expression. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we performed RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of BCL11A in the presence or absence of known fetal hemoglobin inducers and demonstrated functional derepression of a γ-globin-linked reporter in an adult erythroid environment. Our results demonstrate that the cellular assay system represents a promising approach to perform genetic and functional genomic studies to identify and evaluate key factors associated with γ-globin gene suppression."

The primary intermediate DNA structure in these two processes is the Holliday junction. UvrD has been shown to unwind a variety of substrates including partial duplex DNA, nicked DNA, forked DNA structures, blunt duplex DNA and RNA-DNA hybrids. Here, we demonstrate that UvrD also catalyzes the robust unwinding of Holliday junction substrates. To characterize this unwinding reaction we have employed steady-state helicase assays, pre-steady-state rapid quench helicase assays, DNaseI footprinting, and electron microscopy. We conclude that UvrD binds initially to the junction compared with binding one of the blunt ends of the four-way junction to initiate unwinding and resolves the synthetic substrate into two double-stranded fork structures. We suggest that UvrD, along with its mismatch repair partners, MutS and MutL, may utilize its ability to unwind Holliday junctions directly in the prevention of homeologous recombination. UvrD may also be involved in the resolution of stalled replication forks by unwinding the Holliday junction intermediate to allow bypass of the blockage."

We propose that incompatibility (electrostatic repulsion) between this pair of residues misfolds the glycine receptor, and in consequence, the protein is retained in the cytoplasm and prevented from surface expression by the quality control machinery.

The glycine receptor (GlyR) 2The abbreviations used are: GlyRglycine receptornAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptor5HT3R5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptorGABAARtype A γ-aminobutyric acid receptorECDextracellular domainTMDtransmembrane domainERendoplasmic reticulum. is a chloride-permeable ion channel, which, upon activation, inhibits cell membrane excitability. Mutations in the human GlyR cause hereditary hyperekplexia (or startle disease), which is characterized by exaggerated startle reflexes and hypertonia in response to sudden, unexpected auditory or tactile stimuli (1.Harvey R.J. Topf M. Harvey K. Rees M.I. The genetics of hyperekplexia: more than startle!.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Hereditary hyperekplexia-causing mutations impair either the function of the expressed single channels or their surface expression, or both. Whereas the structural basis underlying GlyR single channel properties has been intensively studied, the structural basis underlying alterations in its surface expression has been barely investigated (2.Lynch J.W.

The GlyR, together with several other postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors including the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor (5HT3R), and the type-A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR), belong to the Cys-loop receptor ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, because they share common structural and functional characteristics (2.Lynch J.W.

Functional members of this superfamily exist as pentamers. Each subunit is composed of an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD), a four α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD) bundle and a large intracellular domain. The ECDs incorporate agonist binding sites at subunit interfaces, which are formed by loops A, B, and C from the (+) subunit interface and loops D, E, and F from the (−) subunit interface. The four α-helices (M1–M4) form the channel pore structure, with the five M2 domains directly lining the channel pore. The interface between the ECD and the TMD is termed the transition zone, which is formed by loop 2, the Cys-loop and the pre-M1 linker from the ECD side and the M2-M3 loop from the TMD side (5.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Agonist-mediated channel activation involves a realignment of the transition zone, which in turn leads to a reconfiguration of the M2-M3 loop and the opening of the channel (11.Purohit P. Mitra A.

To ensure efficient channel activation, a precisely structured transition zone is required. A large body of studies has demonstrated that networks of energetic interactions between residues, especially between charged residues, exist throughout the transition zone (16.Cederholm J.M. Schofield P.R. Lewis T.M. Gating mechanisms in Cys-loop receptors.Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 39: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17.Chang Y.C. Wu W. Zhang J.L. Huang Y. Allosteric activation mechanism of the Cys-loop receptors.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These residue interactions have been shown to be essential for the transmission of agonist-induced conformational changes to the channel gate. However, to date, the mechanisms by which residue interactions affect surface expression have barely been investigated. The GlyR is an integral protein, which is synthesized and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), modified in the Golgi complex and eventually shipped into the cell membrane. Integral proteins are under stringent surveillance by the quality control machinery in the ER and, occasionally, in the Golgi complex, which ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins are shipped to the cell membrane, whereas misfolded proteins are retained in the cytoplasm and eventually degraded (18.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 19.Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A.

Here we report that the incompatibility between a pair of residues, in close proximity to each other in the tertiary structure, but from the discrete pre-M1 and Cys-loop domains, prevents surface expression of the GlyR. We propose that this residue incompatibility (electrostatic repulsion) misfolds the GlyR protein, and in consequence, the protein is retained in the cytoplasm and prevented from further surface expression by the quality control machinery. This hypothesis suggests a novel mechanism for explaining mutation-induced reduction in channel surface expression, often present in the cases of hereditary hyperekplexia. The human GlyR α1 subunit cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1zeo+ plasmid vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression in HEK293 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and chimera construction (including insertion of the DYKDDDDK FLAG tag between the Arg-2 and Ser-3 of the GlyR α1 sequence) were performed using the QuickChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) mutagenesis and multiple-template-based sequential PCR protocols, respectively. The multiple-template-based sequential PCR protocol for chimera construction was developed in our laboratory and has recently been described in detail elsewhere (21.Shan Q. Lynch J.W. Chimera construction using multiple-template-based sequential PCRs.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 193: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This procedure does not require the existence of restriction sites, or the purification of intermediate PCR products, and needs only two or three simple PCRs followed by general subcloning steps. Most importantly, the chimera join sites are seamless, i.e. no linker sequence is required, and the success rate for construction is nearly 100%. The joining sites used in our experiment were chosen based on two criteria. First, the site, based on the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (5.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Crystal structure of an ACh-binding protein reveals the ligand-binding domain of nicotinic receptors.Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), should be located near the boundary between the two flanking loops to minimize disturbance on the loop structures. Second, the pair of residues between which a joining site is formed should be conserved between the GlyR α and β subunits, if possible. The join sites used in our experiments were located between the following pairs of residues: α L134-T135 and β I157-T158 for the N terminus of the Cys-loop, α Q155-L156 and β Q178-L179 for the C terminus of the Cys-loop, α T208-C209 and β T232-C233 for the N terminus of the pre-M1 linker, and α G221-Y222 and β G245-F246 for the C terminus of the pre-M1 linker (supplemental Fig. S1). Details of the HEK293 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cell culture and GlyR expression are described elsewhere (22.Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. A single β-subunit M2 domain residue controls the picrotoxin sensitivity of αβ heteromeric glycine receptor chloride channels.J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. In addition, the pEGFP-N1 plasmid vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was co-transfected to facilitate identification of the transfected cells in electrophysiological recordings. An inverted fluorescence microscope was used to visualize cells for electrophysiological experiments. Cells expressing recombinant GlyRs were identified by their green fluorescence. Borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Vitrex, Modulohm, Denmark) and a horizontal pipette puller (P97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were used to pull patch clamp pipettes with tip resistances of 2–3 MΩ when filled with pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. Cells were perfused by an external solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 d-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Cells were voltage-clamped at −40 mV in the whole-cell recording configuration and membrane currents were recorded using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Membrane currents were filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 2 kHz. Stocks of glycine (1 m in the external solution) were maintained at −20 °C. Ivermectin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored as 10 mm stocks at −20 °C. Solutions were applied to cells via a gravity-induced perfusion systems fabricated from polyethylene tubing. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–23 °C). HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs as described above. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. For surface staining, the cells were labeled with the mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1 μg/ml, Cat No. F1804, Sigma-Aldrich) in ice-cold DMEM (with serum) on ice for 30 min and then washed three times in ice-cold PBS. The subsequent steps were performed at room temperature in the following order: cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized using 0.25% Triton 100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked using 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and labeled with the Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (2 μg/ml, Invitrogen) in 3% BSA/PBS in a dark place for 1 h. Cells were finally mounted in a mounting medium and imaged using a confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss). For total staining, the cells were treated at room temperature in an order slightly different from that used for surface staining: The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked. The cells were subsequently labeled with anti-FLAG antibody in 3% BSA/PBS for 2 h, and with Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Finally, the cells were mounted and imaged. All the manipulations and solution ingredients for total staining were the same as for surface staining unless specified above. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean of four or more independent experiments. The empirical Hill equation, fitted by a non-linear least squares algorithm (SigmaPlot 9.0, Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA), was used to calculate the glycine EC50. The GlyR exists in either homomeric α or heteromeric α β form. The β subunit alone cannot form homomeric channels. In an attempt to investigate the structural requirements for GlyR functional surface expression, we constructed several chimeras of α1 and β subunits. One of the chimeras, in which the pre-M1 linker in the α1 GlyR was replaced with the homologous domain from the β subunit (αchPm, Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1) could not induce any current upon application of the agonist glycine at concentrations up to 100 mm (Fig. 1A). This could be due to compromised channel function or blocked surface expression.FIGURE 1Absence of surface expression in the αchPm GlyR. A, sample traces of currents induced by glycine and ivermectin. B, surface and total staining of indicated constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To distinguish these two possibilities, we applied ivermectin to the αchPm GlyR. Ivermectin is a GlyR agonist, which binds to the receptor and gates the channel via a different mechanism from that of glycine (23.Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W.

It has been shown that ivermectin can induce currents in certain GlyRs with mutations that disrupt the glycine-activated channel gating pathway but leave surface expression intact (23.Shan Q.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12556-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We wondered whether this was the case for the αchPm GlyR, as the pre-M1 linker is one of the essential components of the glycine-activated channel gating pathway (11.Purohit P. Mitra A. Auerbach A.

Cis-trans isomerization at a proline opens the pore of a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel.Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a saturating (30 μm) ivermectin concentration induced no current, implying that the αchPm GlyR might not be surface-expressed. To verify this possibility, we directly examined the surface expression by immunofluorescence imaging. To achieve this, we inserted the FLAG tag into the N terminus of the αchPm subunit and labeled the receptor with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, the αchPm GlyR was detected in the cytoplasm but not on the cell surface. In contrast, the α1 GlyR tagged with the FLAG was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface. It is noteworthy that the FLAG tag insertion did not change the receptor and channel properties of the GlyR, as the glycine dose-current response curves of the α1 GlyRs with and without the FLAG tag overlapped (EC50: 33 ± 2 μm, n = 4 without FLAG versus 34 ± 4 μm, n = 4 with FLAG, p > 0.05) (supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate the structural basis on which α1 GlyR surface expression was blocked by the homologous substitution of the pre-M1 linker from the β subunit, we constructed two chimeras of the α1 and β subunits, which we termed αchEn and αchEc, respectively. They were constructed by replacing either the N terminus or the C terminus half, respectively, of the ECD in the α1 subunit, with the homologous sequence from the β subunit (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). Because the N terminus of the β subunit contains motifs that block homomer formation (25.Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Molecular determinants of glycine receptor subunit assembly.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26.Kuhse J. Laube B. Magalei D. Betz H. Assembly of the inhibitory glycine receptor: identification of amino acid sequence motifs governing subunit stoichiometry.Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1), we replaced these motifs with the homologous residues from the α subunit in the αchEn GlyR. This modified construct was able to form a functional homomeric channel (EC50 = 301 ± 26 μm, Imax = 9.6 ± 1.3 nA and n = 4, Fig. 2C), which is consistent with previous reports (25.Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Molecular determinants of glycine receptor subunit assembly.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26.Kuhse J.

Assembly of the inhibitory glycine receptor: identification of amino acid sequence motifs governing subunit stoichiometry.Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). But surprisingly, the αchEc GlyR, which incorporated the pre-M1 linker, the Cys-loop, loops B, F, and C from the β subunit (supplemental Fig. S1), could also form a functional channel (EC50 = 46 ± 8 μm, Imax = 14.6 ± 1.7 nA and n = 4, Fig. 2C), with similar glycine sensitivity to the α1 GlyR (EC50 = 33 ± 2 μm, Imax = 6.6 ± 1.1 nA and n = 4, Fig. 2C). This was in sharp contrast to the absence of surface expression in the αchPm GlyR, which incorporated only the pre-M1 linker from the β subunit. We thus concluded that the Cys-loop, loop B, F, or C of the β subunit restored the surface expression in the αchEc GlyR. We next investigated which of these domains was responsible for the restoration of surface expression in the αchEc GlyR. Based on the primary sequence, loop C is linearly connected to the pre-M1 linker. However, based on the tertiary structures of various Cys-loop receptor superfamily members, the Cys-loop is located physically close to the pre-M1 linker (Fig. 2A) (5.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Considering that functional studies have shown that residues in the pre-M1 linker and Cys-loop interact with each other and that these interactions are essential for channel gating (14.Lee W.Y. Free C.R. Sine S.M. Binding to gating transduction in nicotinic receptors: Cys-loop energetically couples to pre-M1 and M2-M3 regions.J.

Principal pathway coupling agonist binding to channel gating in nicotinic receptors.Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Cys-loop, but not loop C, might be the component that restored the surface expression in the αchEc GlyR. We tested this hypothesis by constructing the chimera αchCyPm GlyR, where the Cys-loop from the β subunit was introduced into the αchPm GlyR (Fig. 2B, supplemental Fig. S1). As hypothesized, glycine-induced currents were indeed detected in this construct (EC50 = 127 ± 8 μm, Imax = 2.6 ± 0.7 nA and n = 4), which indicated receptor and channel properties similar to those of the α1 GlyR (Fig. 2, C–E). We thus concluded that the Cys-loop from the β subunit, when introduced into the αchPm GlyR, restored surface expression. More interestingly, the chimera αchCy GlyR (Fig. 2B), where only the Cys-loop from the β subunit was introduced into the α1 GlyR, also induced currents upon glycine application (EC50 = 623 ± 85 μm, Imax = 8.0 ± 1.8 nA and n = 4) (Fig. 2C). Based on the results of the αchPm and αchCyPm GlyRs, we concluded that an interaction between the pre-M1 linker and Cys-loop controls the surface expression of the GlyR. To identify the structural basis of this interaction at single-residue level, we mapped residues from both domains that are not conserved between the α1 and β subunits onto a structural model of the α1 subunit (Fig. 3, A and B) (29.Chung S.K. Vanbellinghen J.F. Mullins J.G. Robinson A. Hantke J. Hammond C.L. Gilbert D.F. Freilinger M. Ryan M. Kruer M.C. Masri A. Gurses C. Ferrie C. Harvey K. Shiang R. Christodoulou J. Andermann F. Andermann E. Thomas R.H. Harvey R.J. Lynch J.W. Rees M.I. Pathophysiological mechanisms of dominant and recessive GLRA1 mutations in hyperekplexia.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9612-9620Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By observing the physiochemical properties of residues and their proximity to each other in the tertiary structure, our attention was drawn to a pair of residues, residue 143 from the Cys-loop and residue 217 from the pre-M1 linker (Fig. 3, A and C). It was the positive-charged Lys-143 and Arg-217 (α1 subunit numbering) that were in the non-surface-expressed αchPm GlyR, while at least one positive-charged residue was missing in all other constructs with normal surface expression we had examined so far (Fig. 3D). These two residues are physically close to each other in the tertiary structure (Fig. 3C), with their α-carbon atoms separated by 11.6 Å in our model structure. We thus hypothesized that the electrostatic repulsion between the two positive charges was the cause for the absence of surface expression in the αchPm GlyR. If this were the case, substitution of K143T or R217E, either of which would eliminate any electrostatic repulsion, should restore surface expression of the αchPm GlyR, as in the αchCyPm and α1 GlyRs, respectively. As anticipated, both the αchPm K143T and αchPm R217E GlyRs induced current upon glycine application (EC50 = 117 ± 28 μm, Imax = 10.1 ± 4.1 nA, n = 4 and EC50 = 62 ± 13 μm, Imax = 9.9 ± 3.7 nA, n = 4, respectively, Fig. 3, D–F). Moreover, surface expression of both constructs was also confirmed by immunofluorescence imaging (Fig. 3G). We therefore concluded that an electrostatic interaction (electrostatic repulsion) between the Lys-143 residue from the Cys-loop and the Arg-217 residue from the pre-M1 linker blocks surface expression of the αchPm GlyR. In other words, compatibility between this pair of residues from the pre-M1 linker and Cys-loop is essential for surface expression of the GlyR. Here we demonstrate that interaction between a pair of positively charged residues from the Cys-loop and pre-M1 linker blocks surface expression of the GlyR. Because these two residues are in close proximity to each other in the tertiary structure, we propose that electrostatic repulsion between them is responsible for lack of surface expression. It should be noted that, although this seems a likely mechanism, we could not eliminate the possibility that the co-existence of Lys-243 and Arg-217 could cause conformational changes other than electrostatic repu"
