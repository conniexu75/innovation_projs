https://openalex.org/W2138016856,"Purification and partial characterization of the poliovirus RNA-linked protein (VPg) are described. VPg has been freed from the RNA by ribonuclease digestion and phenol extraction. Gel filtration chromatography of VPg-pUp (labeled with 32P) in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 6 M guanidine HCl indicates that it has a molecular weight of about 12,000. VPg is bound to the 5' end of poliovirion RNA by a phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue in the VPg molecule and the 5'-terminal uridine. After acid hydrolysis of [3H]tyrosine-labeled VPg-pU, free tyrosine can be released by venom phosphodiesterase. Acid hydrolysis of VPg-p labeled with either 32P or [3H] tyrosine yields tyrosine-phosphate. There appears to be only 1 tyrosine residue per VPg molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1523592797,"Using rat or chick hepatocyte monolayers, we have studied the effect of tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of protein glycosylation, on the synthesis and secretion of serum proteins. Tunicamycin inhibited glucosamine incorporation into rat liver transferrin and the apoprotein B chain of chick liver very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) by 75 to 90%. In contrasts, amino acid incorporation into these two glycoproteins, as well as into the normally unglycosylated proteins, rat serum albumin and apoprotein A of chick liver VLDL, was decreased by only 10 to 25% in the presence of the antibiotic. Despite the inhibitory effect of tunicamycin on glycosylation, secretion of all four proteins was virtually unimpaired. Thus, the carbohydrate moieties of rat liver transferrin or apoprotein B of chick liver VLDL do not appear to play an essential role in the secretion process."
https://openalex.org/W1607127783,"Certain cells such as CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) and fibroblasts attach to a substrate of type I collagen via proteins that link the cell surface to collagen. Serum contains a glycoprotein, c-CAP (collagen cell attachment protein), that can mediate this adhesion. Previously, we established that alpha1(I)-CB7 (cyanogen bromide peptide 7), which lies within residues 552 to 822 of collagen, contains a major binding site for c-CAP(alpha1(I)-CB7 has been renumbered to account for an additional triplet recently identified at residue 613 (P. P. Fietzek and R. W. Glanville, manuscript in preparation). Now we have examined the ability of various peptides derived by proteolytic digestion of alpha1(I)-CB7 to bind to c-CAP based upon their ability to inhibit cell attachment to collagen. The binding site lies within residues 757 to 791. It is likely that this is the sole binding site in the alpha1(I) chain since cleavage of the bond between residues 775 and 776 in the alpha1(I) chain destroys cell attachment activity."

https://openalex.org/W1659377994,"cAMP receptor proteins present in mammalian brain were identified and characterized with the use of the photoaffinity label 8-azido[32P]cAMP. Cytosol and membrane fractions from various regions of rat, guinea pig, and bovine brain contained two specific cAMP receptor proteins with apparent molecular weights of 47,000 and 52,000 to 55,000. Subcellular fractionation studies showed the highest amounts of these cAMP receptor proteins associated with cytosol fractions and synaptic membrane fractions. For both the cytosol and membrane fractions, the two cAMP receptor proteins represented almost all of the proteins specifically labeled by 8-azidol[32P]cAMP and appeared to be the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1593486323,"Cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase has been purified from spinach leaves to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme is a tetramer of molecular weight about 130,000. At pH 7.5, the Km for fructose 1.6-bisphosphate was 2.5 micron, and for MgCl2 0.13 mM; the enzyme was specific for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Saturation with Mg2+ was achieved with lower concentrations at pH 8 than at pH 7. AMP and high concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibited enzyme activity. Ammonium sulfate relieved the latter inhibition but was itself inhibitory when substrate concentrations were low. Acetylation studies demonstrated that the AMP regulatory site was distinct from the catalytic site. Cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase may contribute to the regulation of sucrose biosynthesis in plant leaves."

https://openalex.org/W1510715764,"Cyclic AMP efflux was measured following hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase in a variety of animal cells including C-6 rat glioma cells, WI-38 human fibroblasts, and avian erythrocytes. Using a variety inhibitors of mitochondrial function and glycolysis, a correlation was noted between cellular ATP levels and the rate of cyclic AMP efflux in all cells examined. A relationship between the efflux rate and the magnitude of the membrane potential was not observed. Pharmacological agents which inhibited cyclic AMP egress in these cells without reducing ATP levels included several prostaglandins (A greater than B greater than E greater than F) and probenecid. The characteristics of the cyclic AMP efflux system resemble those of the organic anion transport system."

https://openalex.org/W94967005,"Reversible interactions of ATP, MgATP, and three cations (Mg”‘, Mn”+, and Zn’+) with human oxyand deoxyhemoglobins have been studied at physiological pH and salt concentration by 31P NMR, EPR, and water proton relaxation techniques. In the absence of hemoglobin a value of 45 f 8 pM was obtained for the dissociation constant of MgATP from the 31P chemical shifts of solutions containing sufficiently low levels of Mg2+ and ATP (0.5 to 5 mM) in the presence of 0.15 M KC1 (pH 7.2, T = 25°C). Although hemoglobin does not change the positions of the 31P NMR peaks of ATP or its Mg”+ complex at pH 7.2, the spectra do provide evidence of interactions under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The presence of deoxyhemoglobin was found to result in appreciable displacement of the apparent equilibrium, Mg”+ + ATP4+ MgATP2-, as measured by phosphorus chemical shifts in favor of ATP thus showing competition between deoxyhemoglobin and Mg2+ for binding ATP. The presence of oxyhemoglobin produces only small changes in the apparent equilibrium as measured by ‘I’P NMR. Both oxyand deoxyhemoglobin significantly broaden the 31P resonances of ATP. A larger broadening of the 31P resonances is observed in the deoxyhemoglobin solutions compared to that in the oxyhemoglobin solutions under similar conditions and reflects the higher affinity of ATP for deoxyhemoglobin. While the affinities of ATP and MgATP for deoxyhemoglobin differ by more than an order of magnitude, our data indicate that their affinities for oxyhemoglobin are comparable. The NMR spectral data are generally consistent with the dissociation constants of Hamasaki and Rose ((1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249,7896). The binding of Mg’+ to human hemoglobin was examined by its effects on the EPR spectra and water proton relaxation enhancement (eg = 9.5) of a solution containing Mn2+ and hemoglobin. It is found that Mg’+ shows little affinity (KDM” = 0.4 -+ 0.1 M) for the four divalent cation sites per tetramer of oxyor deoxyhemoglobin detected here whereas Mn2+ and Zn2+ bind to an appreciable extent (Kn”” = 5 +1 mM; KD~” = 1.3 + 0.4 mM). These results argue against any significant binding of Mg2+ to hemoglobin in red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W2108442115,"The effects of thyroid status on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the rat myocardium were investigated. The potent antagonist [3H]dihydroergokryptine was used to identify alpha-adrenergic receptors in rat heart particulate and sarcolemmal fractions. Administration of triiodothyronine to thyroidectomized rats decreased specific binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors in heart particulate and sarcolemmal fractions by 41% and 45%, respectively. Scatchard analysis revealed that the cardiac sarcolemmal fraction from thyroidectomized rats contained 29.3 fmol/mg of protein, as compared with 17.0 fmol/mg of protein found in the heart preparation of thyroidectomized rats treated with triiodothyronine. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of receptors with dihydroergokryptine were similar (about 1.5 nM) in the heart sarcolemmal fractions derived from these two groups of rats. The results of this study demonstrate that thyroid hormone can regulate the number of cardiac alpha-adrenergic receptors. In addition, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W1504947192,"The presence of a previously unidentified enzyme, tentatively designated 5-methylthioribose kinase, has been demonstrated in cell-free extracts of Enterobacter aerogenes. The enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-methylthioribose. ADP is one of the products of the reaction and, based on functional group analyses, the other product is 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate. A 40-fold purified enzyme preparation has been obtained from a cell-free extract of E. aerogenes. Activity of the partially purified enzyme is totally dependent on the presence of a divalent cation and a sulfhydryl reagent. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is quite narrow, and the Km values for ATP and 5-methylthioribose are 7.4 X 10(-5) M and 8.1 X 10(-6) M, respectively. These results suggest that 5-methylthioribose kinase may be a primary enzyme involved in the recycling of the methylthio group of 5-methylthioribose back into methionine."

https://openalex.org/W2033983482,"INFECTION of mice with viruses can generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which show restricted specificity for target cell lysis. Specific lysis requires that the virus used to prime the target cells must be of the same type as that used to sensitise the CTL, and that both target and CTL cells must express the same major histocompatability complex (MHC) gene product(s). The nature of the viral gene product(s) and their interaction with the MHC gene product(s) have been the subject of recent stud1–5. Previously we used Sendai virus to show that lysable target cells can be obtained using membrane vesicles which contain only the viral glycoproteins, indicating that these may be the specific viral gene products involved in target formation5. Sendai virus contains two glycoproteins—the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HANA) which promotes attachment of virus to cells and the fusion protein (F) which is involved in subsequent virus cell fusion7–9. Both activities are necessary for insertion of these viral glycoproteins into the plasma membrane of the cell10. In this letter we suggest that the insertion of the viral glycoproteins into the cell membrane is an essential step in target cell formation since we can show that virus containing an inactive fusion protein precursor (F0) cannot elicit T cell cytotoxicity unless the fusion activity is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the precursor. Sugamura et al.6 have suggested that it is primarily the F glycoprotein of the Sendai virus envelope which is essential for the formation of the target antigen, as virus lacking the functional activities of F following trypsin digestion was inactive in priming target cells for T cell killing. However, we show that proteolytic inactivation of either of the two glycoproteins (F or HANA) of virus used to prime target cells will abolish the cytotoxic response."

In neonatal mice, therapeutic doses of aminophylline greatly decreased the rate of anoxic survival in vivo and the duration of gasping of the isolated head. The findings suggest caution in the use of this drug and other methylxanthines in hypoxic human newborns."

https://openalex.org/W1584467495,"Abstract Recently, several workers have shown that adrenergic control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism has the characteristics of an alpha-receptor-mediated process. Using the rat liver membrane preparation of Neville (Neville, D. (1968) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 154, 540-552), alpha-adrenergic receptors have been identified using the ligand [3H]dihydroergocryptine. The receptors are saturable and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis yields a KD of 1.8 nM with 1.7 +/- 0.55 pmol of sites/mg of protein. Competition of dihydroergocryptine binding with various pharmacologic agents yields the typical (alpha-adrenergic potency series: (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-isoproterenol. (-)-Isomers are more potent than (+)-isomers. The alpha-blocker phentolamine is 3.4 orders of magnitude more potent than the beta-blocker propranolol. To determine subcellular localization of alpha-adrenergic receptors, livers were fractionated into a crude homogenate, a 1500 X g pellet, and the purified membrane preparation used previously for binding. Specific dihydroergocryptine binding, ouabain-inhibitable (Na,K)-ATPase, and F--stimulated adenylate cyclase activities, were followed in these fractions. Specific binding was enriched, relative to that in the crude homogenate, 2.88-fold in the pellet and 6.28-fold in the membranes. Similarly, (Na,K)-ATPase acticity was enriched 2.6-fold in the pellet and 7.1-fold in the membranes while adenylate cyclase activity was enriched 2.9-fold in the pellet and 3.5-fold in the membranes. It is concluded that hepatic alpha-adrenergic receptors are likely concentrated in the plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1569458124,A two-dimensional electrophoretic method which takes advantage of the migration anomalies experienced by some polypeptides on gels of different porosities has been successfully used to resolve the seven subunit polypeptides of yeast cytochrome c oxidase and the nine polypeptides associated with bovine cytochrome c oxidase. The two-dimensional maps provided by this method reveal clear differences between these two cytochrome c oxidases.
https://openalex.org/W1638374589,A substantial portion of the histone phosphorylating activity of bovine thymus chromatin can be isolated by extraction in 0.2 M NaCl. The specificity of this extract for either free histones or washed chromatin substrates was compared. The salt-extracted kinase enzymes favor H2b as the major acceptor when whole free histone is the substrate and H3 when the substrate is intact chromatin. The H3 kinase activity of bovine thymus tissue has been purified free from other detectable histone kinase activities by ammonium sulfate fractionation and is highly specific for H3 histone when assayed either with chromatin or isolated whole histone. The activity is cAMP-independent. Tryptic peptide mapping of the labeled H3 histone reveals a single site of phosphorylation. This site appears to be identical with the major site of metaphase-associated H3 phosphorylation in hepatoma tissue culture cells. No corresponding H3 phosphorylation has been detected in thymus tissue in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1572579437,"The NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from Candida utilis was isolated from 32P-labeled cells following enzyme inactivation promoted by glutamate starvation and found to exist in a phosphorylated form. Analysis of purified, fully active NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (a form) and inactive NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (b form) for alkalilabile phosphate revealed that the a form contained 0.09 +/- 0.06 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme subunit and b form 1.25 +/- 0.06 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme subunit. Phosphorylation caused a 10-fold reduction in enzyme specific activity. Dephosphorylation (release of 32P) and enzyme reactivation occurred on incubation with cell-free yeast extracts, indicating the presence of a phosphoprotein phosphatase in such preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1626307607,"Abstract We have synthesized phenyl adenine dinucleotide (P1-adenosine-5')-P2-(beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzene-5')-pyrophosphate (PhAD), a novel analog of pyridine nucleotide coenzymes. This compound contains a planar aromatic ring, as does NAD+, but lacks a positive charge. PhAD is an inhibitor of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, competitive with NADH. PhAD is very similar to NAD+ sterically since both compounds have a planar aromatic ring. However, PhAD resembles NADH in binding to the enzyme because the dissociation constants of both compounds show a parallel increase as the pH is raised, whereas those of NAD+ behave in the opposite manner. These observations indicate that the enzyme differentiates between NAD+ and NADH on the basis of the positive charge on the molecule and not the stereochemical orientation of the reduced nicotinamide ring."
https://openalex.org/W1598898641,"The relationship between dephosphorylation and D to I conversion of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase by synthase phosphatase was investigated using synthase preparations containing 1 to 3 mol of 32P/mol of subunit (90,000 g). Dephosphorylation was analyzed in terms of 32P release from the trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-insensitive phosphorylation regions of synthase. With synthase containing 1 to 2 mol of 32P/90,000 g, dephosphorylation of the trypsin-insensitive region correlated closely with D to I conversion and was more rapid than dephosphorylation of the trypsin-sensitive region. Synthase containing 3 mol of 32P/90,000 g was a relatively poor substrate for the phosphatase since dephosphorylation of both regions, as well as D to I conversion, was slow. With this species of synthase, glucose-6-P (0.1 mM) increased the rates of D to I conversion and dephosphorylation of trypsin-insensitive region. It is concluded that dephosphorylation of the trypsin-insensitive region is responsible for the conversion of synthase D to I."

https://openalex.org/W1532393564,"Polysomes prepared from cultured Chinese hamster lung cells direct the synthesis of procollagen alpha chains in an heterologous cell-free system containing the postribosomal supernatant fraction prepared from wheat germ. Total protein synthesis requires both subcellular components and an exogenous energy source, and is inhibited by the antibiotics puromycin and aurin tricarboxylic acid. The ratio of collagenase-digestible to nondigestible material produced depends upon the wheat germ and not the polysome level in the reaction. Under optimal conditions, a significant fraction of the total product migrates on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a single molecular weight collagenase-digestible species corresponding in size to the procollagen alpha chain (Mr approximately equal to 170,000). Approximately one-third of this high molecular weight material represents products whose synthesis results from cell-free mRNA initiation, and no distinct product larger than the 170,000-dalton material is observed. These studies confirm the initial observation that collagen represents one of the major gene products of Chinese hamster lung cells and demonstrate the usefulness of this cell line for the study of mammalian collagen biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1567926238,"Conversion of glucose to fructose and sorbitol is documented in rat hepatoma-derived cultured cells (HTC cells). After addition of 5.5 mM [U-14C]glucose to incubation medium, labeled sorbitol and fructose accumulated intracellularly at a linear rate over a period of 60 min. The sugars were isolated, identified, and quantitated by paper chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, and enzymatic phosphorylation of fructose. Primary culture of adult rat hepatocytes was analyzed similarly and demonstrated no significant accumulation of labeled fructose or sorbitol. The basis for this difference between HTC cells and primary hepatocyte culture was examined both in terms of enzyme activities that mediate the formation of sorbitol and fructose and in terms of the catabolism of these sugars. Both types of culture (as well as extracts of intact rat liver) exhibited enzymatic activities catalyzing the conversion of glucose to sorbitol (aldose reductase) and sorbitol to fructose (sorbitol dehydrogenase). However, the cultures differed strikingly with regard to the catabolism of sorbitol and fructose. The conversion of labeled sorbitol to metabolites in HTC cells was negligible; by contrast, hepatocytes in primary culture utilized the sugars at rates comparable to that of glucose, which may account for the lack of their accumulation in primary culture. The findings suggest that the conversion of glucose to sorbitol and fructose by HTC cells may represent a retained normal liver function, one which is amplified by the inability of HTC cells to dispose of these sugars."
