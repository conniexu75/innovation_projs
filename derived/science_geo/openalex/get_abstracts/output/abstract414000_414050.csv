https://openalex.org/W2062298134,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. The limited capability of heart tissue to regenerate has prompted methodological developments for creating de novo cardiomyocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Beyond uses in cell replacement therapy, patient-specific cardiomyocytes may find applications in drug testing, drug discovery, and disease modeling. Recently, approaches for generating cardiomyocytes have expanded to encompass three major sources of starting cells: human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), adult heart-derived cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), and reprogrammed fibroblasts. We discuss state-of-the-art methods for generating de novo cardiomyocytes from hPSCs and reprogrammed fibroblasts, highlighting potential applications and future challenges."

Here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is critical for TICs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TICs from primary NSCLC tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor LIN28B and GLDC, which are both required for TIC growth and tumorigenesis. Overexpression of GLDC and other glycine/serine enzymes, but not catalytically inactive GLDC, promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. We found that GLDC induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. In the clinic, aberrant activation of GLDC correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients, and aberrant GLDC expression is observed in multiple cancer types. This link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor-initiating cells express high levels of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) GLDC is an oncogene that promotes cellular transformation GLDC activity regulates pyrimidine metabolism in cancer cells GLDC expression predicts mortality in NSCLC patients Despite numerous advances in our knowledge of cancer (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2004Vogelstein B.

Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42734) Google Scholar), our ability to develop clinically effective therapies based on this understanding has met with limited success. Current therapies can control tumor growth initially, but most patients ultimately relapse. One prominent example is lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality with over 1 million deaths each year (Jemal et al., 2011Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30254) Google Scholar). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Although NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to EGFR inhibitors initially, most patients experience a relapse within 1 year (Sequist et al., 2007Sequist L.V. Joshi V.A. Jänne P.A. Muzikansky A. Fidias P. Meyerson M. Haber D.A. Kucherlapati R. Johnson B.E. Lynch T.J. Response to treatment and survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing somatic EGFR mutation testing.Oncologist. 2007; 12: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These findings underscore the urgent need for both combination therapies and also new approaches to treat cancerous tumors. One such approach may be to target tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Data from leukemias, germ cell tumors, and a number of solid tumors support the notion that cancers are maintained by a subpopulation of self-renewing and evolving TICs. This is also popularly known as the cancer stem cell (CSC) model (Reya et al., 2001Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L.

Although the validity of the CSC model is an issue of controversy in melanoma (Quintana et al., 2008Quintana E. Shackleton M. Sabel M.S. Fullen D.R. Johnson T.M. Morrison S.J.

Rasheed Z.A. Karisch R. Wang Q.J. Kowalski J. Susky E. Pereira K. Karamboulas C. Moghal N. Rajeshkumar N.V. et al.Tumor-initiating cells are rare in many human tumors.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently it was proposed that at earlier stages of tumorigenesis, rare TIC clones differentiate into nonmalignant progeny to form the bulk of the tumor, whereas at advanced stages, TIC clones constitute the bulk of the tumor (Boiko et al., 2010Boiko A.D. Razorenova O.V. van de Rijn M. Swetter S.M. Johnson D.L. Ly D.P. Butler P.D. Yang G.P. Joshua B. Kaplan M.J. et al.Human melanoma-initiating cells express neural crest nerve growth factor receptor CD271.Nature. 2010; 466: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Studies with mouse models of lung cancer have also begun to reconcile the connection between the evolving genotype of TIC clones and the surface phenotype of TICs (Curtis et al., 2010Curtis S.J. Sinkevicius K.W. Li D.A. Lau A.N. Roach R.R. Zamponi R. Woolfenden A.E. Kirsch D.G. Wong K.K. Kim C.F. Primary tumor genotype is an important determinant in identification of lung cancer propagating cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus accumulated findings suggest that targeting TICs may be a promising approach for eradicating tumors early. However, progress in the targeting of TICs to improve cancer therapy has been hindered by a lack of understanding of the molecular pathways that are critical to TICs. Recent studies have led to an emerging appreciation of the importance of metabolic reprogramming in cancer (Hsu and Sabatini, 2008Hsu P.P. Sabatini D.M.

Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42734) Google Scholar). Most recently, the embryonic isoform of pyruvate kinase PKM2, in collaboration with phosphoglycerate mutase, was found to regulate the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in cancer cells (Christofk et al., 2008Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C.

Evidence for an alternative glycolytic pathway in rapidly proliferating cells.Science. 2010; 329: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). These findings have led to a resurgence of interest in the Warburg effect—the phenomenon whereby cancer cells, like embryonic cells, preferentially use glycolysis even under aerobic conditions (Warburg, 1956Warburg O. On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9554) Google Scholar). Besides glycolysis, an arm of metabolism that results in sarcosine production has also been implicated in prostate cancer (Sreekumar et al., 2009Sreekumar A. Poisson L.M. Rajendiran T.M. Khan A.P. Cao Q. Yu J.D. Laxman B. Mehra R. Lonigro R.J. Li Y. et al.Metabolomic profiles delineate potential role for sarcosine in prostate cancer progression.Nature. 2009; 457: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). These data suggest that metabolic reprogramming is crucial for tumorigenesis, and much remains to be uncovered. Here we show that glycine metabolism and the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) drive TICs and tumorigenesis in NSCLC. Using CD166 as a surface marker and NOD/SCID Il2rγ−/− mice as xenotransplantation recipients, we isolated lung TICs from a broad range of primary NSCLC tumors (stages I–III). Primary lung TICs express high levels of LIN28B, GLDC, and many other glycine/serine metabolism enzymes. Both LIN28B and GLDC were required for lung TIC proliferation and tumor growth. Overexpression of GLDC alone, and other glycine/serine enzymes, promotes cellular transformation both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomic analysis shows that GLDC overexpression induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism for cancer cell proliferation. In human patients, aberrant upregulation of GLDC is significantly associated with higher mortality from lung cancer, and aberrant GLDC expression is observed in multiple cancer types. Our findings establish a link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis and may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy. To assess the cellular heterogeneity within NSCLC, we obtained freshly resected lung tumors from 36 human patients with a broad range of stage I–III primary NSCLC (Table S1 available online). Patient lung cancer cells were directly transplanted subcutaneously into NOD/SCID Il2rγ−/− mice with Matrigel (Quintana et al., 2008Quintana E. Shackleton M. Sabel M.S. Fullen D.R. Johnson T.M. Morrison S.J. Efficient tumour formation by single human melanoma cells.Nature. 2008; 456: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Using this maximally sensitive assay, we estimated by limiting dilution analysis that lung TICs exist with a low frequency of 1 in 4 × 105 cells in unsorted NSCLC tumor cells (n = 36 patients; Figure 1A ), consistent with published findings (Ishizawa et al., 2010Ishizawa K. Rasheed Z.A. Karisch R. Wang Q.J. Kowalski J. Susky E. Pereira K. Karamboulas C. Moghal N. Rajeshkumar N.V. et al.Tumor-initiating cells are rare in many human tumors.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To profile the surface phenotype of this subpopulation of lung TICs, we fractionated the NSCLC tumors by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Figure S1A ). After excluding hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Lin−), we tested a panel of cell-surface markers, including CD166, CD44, CD133, and EpCAM (Figure 1B). We found that CD166 was the most robust marker for enriching the lung TIC subpopulation, compared to CD133, CD44, or EpCAM, allowing us to reliably enrich lung TICs by nearly 100-fold (Figures 1A and 1B). In 12 out of 12 NSCLC patient tumors (lung adenocarcinoma), the CD166+ Lin− fraction contained cells that consistently initiated lung tumor formation in vivo. In contrast, CD166−Lin− tumor cells generally failed to initiate lung tumor formation even after 8 months of observation, although they also expressed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor-specific marker not expressed in normal adult lung cells (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). Similar results were observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma (Figure S1C). Although CD166 expression varied across the NSCLC tumors we examined, CD166 was consistently higher in lung tumors than in normal adjacent lung tissues (n = 25 patients; Figures S1D and S1E). CD166+ lung TICs demonstrate a capacity for self-renewal and differentiation in vivo. Serial transplantations showed that only the CD166+ fraction was able to self-renew and initiate primary and secondary xenograft tumors (Figures 1A and S1F). Upon transplantation, CD166+ lung TICs differentiated to form xenograft tumors that phenocopy the complex cytoarchitecture of their parental patient tumors, sharing similar histological morphology by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and similar tissue distributions of CD166, cytokeratin, E-cadherin, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and synaptophysin (Figures 1C, S1G, and S1H). Furthermore, we found that transplants with more TICs grow more rapidly, suggesting that lung TIC frequency is correlated with tumor growth rate (Figures 1D and S1I). The self-renewal capacity of CD166+ lung TICs is further corroborated by in vitro assays. We tested the CD166+ fraction for the ability to form tumor spheres, a widely used in vitro technique for assessing self-renewal capacity (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Although both primary CD166+ and CD166− cells remained viable in vitro, only primary CD166+ but not CD166− cells were able to form compact self-renewing spheres (n = 9 patients; Figures 1E, 1F, and S1J). Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we found that the lung tumor spheres retained high levels of CD166 expression but undetectable CD133 expression in contrast (Figures S1K and S1L). When primary lung tumor spheres were dissociated into single cells and transplanted into NOD/SCID Il2rγ−/− mice in vivo, we found that as few as 1–5 single cells consistently initiated tumorigenesis (Figures 1G and S1M). The increased tumor-initiating frequency of lung tumor sphere cells suggests that they are even more highly enriched for lung TICs than the patient tumor CD166+ fraction, and that lung TICs expanded during in vitro culture to form tumor spheres. To test whether CD166 drives tumorigenicity in lung TICs, we knocked down CD166 in two lines of NSCLC patient-derived tumor spheres by retroviral shRNA (Figure S1N). We found that the tumorigenicity of lung TICs in the tumor spheres was not significantly affected by CD166 shRNA, demonstrating that CD166 is an inert cell-surface marker that enriches for lung TICs (Figures S1O–S1Q). To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular basis for the TIC state and its tumorigenic capacity, we sought to obtain a molecular signature for lung TICs. To do this, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis on CD166− Lin− tumor cells, CD166+ Lin− tumor cells, and lung tumor spheres, in increasing order of lung TIC frequency (Figure 2A ). As a negative control, we also profiled CD166+ versus CD166− cells from normal adjacent lung tissues (n = 3 patients; Table S1). This led us to a profile of genes that are upregulated and downregulated in lung TICs, compared to non-TICs (Figure 2B). Lung TIC-associated genes include the oncogenic stem cell factor LIN28B, embryonic lung transcription factors like PEA3 and the trachealess homolog NPAS1 (Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Lin28 promotes transformation and is associated with advanced human malignancies.Nat.

Biol. 2007; 36: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), as well as cell-cycle regulators like CCNB1 and GADD45G (Figure 2C). The highest-ranking genes were validated by qRT-PCR (Figure S2A ). KEGG pathway analysis of the lung TIC-gene profile showed that the top enriched pathways were “cell cycle,” “DNA replication,” “glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism,” “pyrimidine metabolism,” “MAPK signaling pathway,” and “p53 signaling pathway” (Figure 2D). Within the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway, we found that glycine/serine metabolism enzymes like GLDC, glycine C-acetyltransferase (GCAT), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) were all upregulated in lung TICs (Figures 2E and S2B–S2D). In particular, GLDC was one of the most highly upregulated genes in multiple analyses of lung TIC-enriched populations, at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figures 2C and S2C). GLDC is a key component of the highly conserved glycine cleavage system in amino acid metabolism that catalyzes the breakdown of glycine to form CO2, NH3, and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) to fuel one-carbon metabolism (Kume et al., 1991Kume A.

High expression of GLDC and LIN28B in lung TIC-enriched populations, but not in CD166− lung cancer cells and CD166+ normal lung cells, suggests that these two genes drive tumorigenicity in lung TICs. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down GLDC and LIN28B in lung tumor spheres with shRNAs (Figure S3A ) and compared their growth both in vitro and in vivo. We found that both GLDC and LIN28B were necessary for cell proliferation in sphere culture, as well as anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar (Figures 3A and S3B). Importantly, tumorigenicity was also significantly reduced upon knockdown of either GLDC or LIN28B (Figures 3B and S3C). A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells showed similar results (Figures S3D–S3G). Our results suggest that lung TICs and lung tumorigenesis are dependent on GLDC. This led us to ask what oncogenes upregulate GLDC. Because the E2F pathway upregulates many metabolic genes during cell proliferation, we examined the expression of GLDC over the course of the cell cycle in both normal human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and the transformed A549 cells after synchronization by serum starvation. Our results showed that GLDC is insensitive to cell-cycle progression in both normal HLFs and transformed A549 cells, suggesting that GLDC is not regulated by cell-cycle or E2F signals (Figure 3C). We then examined GLDC levels in MCF10A cells after transformation by oncogenic KRASG12D, PIK3CAE545K, and MYCT58A. Our results show that all three oncogenes induce GLDC by ∼20-fold, suggesting that oncogene-induced GLDC transcription is common to the cellular transformation process mediated by oncogenic Ras, PI3K, and Myc (Figure 3D).Figure 3GLDC and LIN28B Are Necessary and Sufficient for Malignant GrowthShow full caption(A) Proliferation curve of tumor sphere (TS) cells with shRNA knockdown of either GLDC (GD-sh) or LIN28B (28B-sh).(B) Quantitative mass analysis of xenograft tumors formed 30 days after transplanting 100,000 tumor sphere cells with either GLDC knockdown (GD-sh) or LIN28B knockdown (28B-sh).(C) Western blot analysis of endogenous GLDC during the cell cycle in synchronized normal human HLFs and transformed A549 cells.

In all panels, error bars represent SEM. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. See also Figure S3. To test whether aberrant GLDC upregulation is sufficient to drive cellular transformation, as has been shown for LIN28B (Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Lin28 promotes transformation and is associated with advanced human malignancies.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), we overexpressed GLDC in NIH/3T3 cells (Figure S3H). We found that GLDC overexpression significantly increased colony formation by 3T3 cells under normal culture conditions (Figures 3E and 3F). To test for cellular transformation in vitro, we cultured the 3T3 cells overexpressing GLDC under anchorage-independent conditions and found that GLDC transforms 3T3 cells readily with a rate exceeding that of LIN28B (Figures 3G and S3I). Upon transplantation into NOD/SCID Il2rγ−/− mice, 3T3 cells overexpressing GLDC consistently formed tumors in 6/6 transplants, and 3T3 cells overexpressing LIN28B formed tumors in 3/6 transplants, whereas 3T3 cells overexpressing the empty control vector never formed tumors (Figures S3J–S3L). To test whether GLDC can also transform normal primary HLF and normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, we overexpressed GLDC in HLF and NHBE cells (Figures S3M and S3O). Both HLF and NHBE cells showed a dramatic increase in cell proliferation upon overexpression of GLDC alone (Figures 3H–3J and S3P). Surprisingly we found that GLDC also transforms HLF and NHBE cells readily in vitro (Figures 3K and S3Q). However, perhaps because primary adult HLF and NHBE cells are not immortalized, GLDC-overexpressing HLF and NHBE cells do not form tumors upon transplantation (Figures S3N and S3R). In contrast, CD166− lung tumor cells, which also could not form tumors in vivo, could now initiate tumorigenesis at a low frequency upon overexpression of GLDC (Figure 3L). Collectively, our results show that GLDC is an oncogene that is both necessary and sufficient to promote tumorigenesis. Although GLDC is a metabolic enzyme, it remained unclear whether GLDC promotes tumorigenesis through a metabolism-dependent or -independent mechanism. To address this question, we engineered a series of four point mutations within or near the evolutionarily conserved catalytic active site of the GLDC enzyme to disrupt its metabolic activity (Figure 4A ). These point mutations comprised three nonlethal GLDC mutations found in human patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (H753P, P769L, G771R; Figures S4A and S4B ) and one mutation K754A that is predicted to abrogate the covalent bond with the criti"
https://openalex.org/W2111256919,"Remyelination is a regenerative process in the central nervous system (CNS) that produces new myelin sheaths from adult stem cells. The decline in remyelination that occurs with advancing age poses a significant barrier to therapy in the CNS, particularly for long-term demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that remyelination of experimentally induced demyelination is enhanced in old mice exposed to a youthful systemic milieu through heterochronic parabiosis. Restored remyelination in old animals involves recruitment to the repairing lesions of blood-derived monocytes from the young parabiotic partner, and preventing this recruitment partially inhibits rejuvenation of remyelination. These data suggest that enhanced remyelinating activity requires both youthful monocytes and other factors, and that remyelination-enhancing therapies targeting endogenous cells can be effective throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W1964069557,"Hair follicle (HF) regeneration begins when communication between quiescent epithelial stem cells (SCs) and underlying mesenchymal dermal papillae (DP) generates sufficient activating cues to overcome repressive BMP signals from surrounding niche cells. Here, we uncover a hitherto unrecognized DP transmitter, TGF-β2, which activates Smad2/3 transiently in HFSCs concomitant with entry into tissue regeneration. This signaling is critical: HFSCs that cannot sense TGF-β exhibit significant delays in HF regeneration, whereas exogenous TGF-β2 stimulates HFSCs in vivo and in vitro. By engineering TGF-β- and BMP-reporter mice, we show that TGF-β2 signaling antagonizes BMP signaling in HFSCs but not through competition for limiting Smad4-coactivator. Rather, our microarray, molecular, and genetic studies unveil Tmeff1 as a direct TGF-β2/Smad2/3 target gene, expressed by activated HFSCs and physiologically relevant in restricting and lowering BMP thresholds in the niche. Connecting BMP activity to an SC's response to TGF-βs may explain why these signaling factors wield such diverse cellular effects."
https://openalex.org/W2017625776,"Polycomb group proteins are essential regulators of cell fate decisions during embryogenesis. In mammals, at least five different Cbx proteins (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, and Cbx8) are known to associate with the core Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here we show that pluripotency and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is regulated by different Cbx-associated PRC1 complexes with unique functions. Maintenance of pluripotency primarily depends on Cbx7, while lineage commitment is orchestrated by Cbx2 and Cbx4. At the molecular level, we have uncovered a Polycomb autoregulatory loop in which Cbx7 represses the expression of prodifferentiation Cbx proteins, thereby maintaining the pluripotent state. We additionally show that the occupancy of Cbx7 on promoters is completely dependent on PRC2 activity but only partially dependent on a functional PRC1 complex. Thus, Cbx proteins confer distinct target selectivity to the PRC1 complex, achieving a balance between the self-renewal and the differentiation of ESCs.

PRC1 complexes assemble with different Cbx subunits during mouse ESC differentiation The subunit composition of PRC1 influences mESC fate decisions The H3K27me3 histone mark is required to recruit Cbx7 to its target genes in mESCs Cbx7-, Cbx2-, or Cbx4-depleted mESCs give rise to teratomas with varied phenotypes Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential regulators of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and early developmental cell fate decisions (Bracken and Helin, 2009Bracken A.P. Helin K. Polycomb group proteins: navigators of lineage pathways led astray in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). They are often misregulated in several types of human cancers, impinging on tumor proliferation, immortalization, and metastasis (Piunti and Pasini, 2011Piunti A. Pasini D. Epigenetic factors in cancer development: polycomb group proteins.Future Oncol. 2011; 7: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several PcGs can be classified primarily into two different complexes, the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). The PRC2 core complex contains the histone methyltransferases Ezh1/2, which, together with Suz12 and Eed, catalyze the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a transcriptionally repressive histone mark (Cao et al., 2002Cao R.

Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in Polycomb-group silencing.Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). The PRC1 complex catalyzes the monoubiquitination of lysine 119 on the histone H2A (H2AK119Ub1) via its associated E3 ligase Ring1A/B, though its repressive function may be independent of this enzymatic activity (Cao et al., 2005Cao R.

The proteins Ring1A/B form a core PRC1 complex through their interactions with one of the orthologs of the Drosophila posterior sex combs (PSC) (Mel-18, Bmi1, or NSPC1), a Polyhomeiotic (PH) ortholog (Phc1, Phc2, or Phc3), and a Polycomb (PC) ortholog (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, or Cbx8) (Morey and Helin, 2010Morey L.

Whereas Bmi1 and Mel-18 stimulate the E3 ligase activities of Ring1A/B, the PC proteins (hereafter referred to as Cbx proteins) are believed to stabilize the association of PRC1 at chromatin by directly interacting with H3K27me3 via their chromodomains (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell.

The current hypothesis for Polycomb-mediated repression suggests that PRC2 and PRC1 act concertedly and sequentially to deposit H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub1, thereby establishing strong transcriptional repression (Faust et al., 1998Faust C.

However, in the absence of PRC2, a functional PRC1 is still recruited to X chromosomes in ESCs, and to paternal heterochromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos (Puschendorf et al., 2008Puschendorf M.

Moreover, PcG functional complexity is further highlighted by the fact that Ring1B knockout mice are early embryonic lethal, whereas Mel-18, Cbx2 (M33), or Bmi1 mutant mice are born but display distinct homeotic phenotypes (Akasaka et al., 2001Akasaka T. van Lohuizen M. van der Lugt N.

Cell. 2010; 38: 662-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), little is known about how each of the five different Cbx subunits contributes to PRC1 target selectivity and activity during early embryogenesis, or whether they exert unique or overlapping functions. Using a large comparative genome-wide chromatin occupancy approach and in vitro and in vivo differentiation assays, we have studied the role of different PRC1-associated Cbx proteins in ESC pluripotency and differentiation. Our results indicate that (1) different Cbx-containing PRC1 complexes, all of which contain the Ring1B subunit, contribute to distinct aspects of early embryonic development; (2) target specificity of PRC1 and PRC2 in the pluripotent state is dictated by Cbx7, but not by any other PRC1-associated Cbx protein; (3) Cbx2 and Cbx4 are required for unique, nonoverlapping aspects of early lineage specification; and (4) Cbx7 represses Cbx2, Cbx4, and Cbx8 in pluripotent cells to prevent premature differentiation, whereas during differentiation, Cbx7 and pluripotency genes are in turn repressed in a PRC1/PRC2-dependent manner to enable lineage specification. In sum, these data underscore the functional complexities of PRC1 and PRC2 and suggest that distinct Cbx proteins confer target specificity during pluripotency and early fate specification. We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in pluripotent murine ESCs, followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) for Ring1B (PRC1), Suz12 (PRC2), and the histone marks H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 (see Table S1 available online). This revealed that the promoters for CBX2, CBX4, CBX8, PHC2, and BMI1 were occupied by the Ring1B and Suz12 proteins and decorated by the H3K27me3 mark, but not enriched for H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 (Figure 1A ). Conversely, the promoters for CBX6, CBX7, PHC1, and MEL-18 contained the transcriptionally active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, with no enrichment for Ring1B, Suz12, or H3K27me3 (Figure 1A). The chromatin organization around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of these genes translated into the expected expression patterns, with the highest transcript levels for Cbx7 and Cbx6 among the Cbx family of genes. Among the PSC and PH family of genes, Mel-18 and PHC1 were expressed at the highest level (Figure 1B). This data suggested that, in pluripotent ESCs, the PRC1 complex might contain Cbx7 and/or Cbx6, the PSC subunit Mel-18, and the PH subunit PHC1. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Ring1B confirmed that it is tightly associated with Mel-18, PHC1, RYBP (an additional PRC1 member used as a control) (Bejarano et al., 2005Bejarano F. González I.

Immunoprecipitation of endogenous PHC1 and Mel-18 confirmed that both proteins are associated with Ring1B and Cbx7, but not with Cbx2/4/6 (Figures 1D and 1E). These results demonstrate that PcG complexes bind to other Polycomb gene promoters, which is suggestive of a Polycomb autoregulatory mechanism, and further, that Cbx7, Mel-18, and PHC1 are the main Cbx, PSC, and PH subunits, respectively, of the PRC1 complex in proliferating mouse ESCs. We performed ChIP-seq for Cbx7 in ESCs, because our results suggested it is the main PRC1-associated Cbx proteins in the pluripotent state. We identified 2,349 Cbx7 target genes, of which 96.7% were co-occupied by Ring1B (Figure 2A ; Table S1). ChIP-qPCR on randomly selected Ring1B target genes identified by ChIP-seq, which were not identified as Cbx7 targets, revealed that Cbx7 was also bound to their promoters (Figure S1A). Therefore, a large set of genes are co-occupied by both Ring1B and Cbx7. We next studied whether the genomic occupancy of Cbx7 and Ring1B overlapped with that of the PRC2 complex and its associated histone mark H3K27me3. We found an overlap of 96.9% between Cbx7 and Suz12 target genes, of which 85.6% were also decorated with H3K27me3 (Figure 2A; Table S1). A similar overlap was observed for Suz12 targets and H3K27me3 (Figure S1B). Only 35% of the genomic regions occupied by Cbx7 showed enrichment for H3K9me3 (Bilodeau et al., 2009Bilodeau S. Kagey M.H. Frampton G.M. Rahl P.B. Young R.A. SetDB1 contributes to repression of genes encoding developmental regulators and maintenance of ES cell state.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and approximately 21% of genes containing H3K9me3 also contained H3K27me3 (Figures S1B and S1C). Importantly, almost the entire list of targets in which Cbx7, Suz12, and H3K27me3 were colocalized were also occupied by Ring1B (Figure 2B), which showed an enrichment predominantly at the TSS (Figure 2C). Analysis of ChIP-seq data at the HOXA cluster confirmed that Cbx7 occupancy overlapped with that of Ring1B and PRC2 (Figure 2D). Moreover, a set of Cbx7 target genes, identified by ChIP-seq, was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 2E). The PRC1/2 complexes are required for repressing genes involved in stem cell differentiation (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the list of genes co-occupied by Cbx7, Ring1B, and PRC2 indicated that they were involved in developmental processes, including factors involved in ectoderm and mesoderm specification (Figure 2F). Interestingly, pathways essential for early developmental processes that are commonly deregulated in cancer, such as Hedgehog, Wnt, TGFb, MAPK, and calcium signaling, were highly represented within the cohort of Cbx7 targets (Figure 2F). As mentioned above, Cbx6, in contrast to the other PRC1-associated Cbx proteins, is transcriptionally active in ESCs, but it does not interact with the PRC1 complex (Figures 1C–1E and Figure S1D). ChIP-seq of Cbx6 in ESCs indicated that it was localized at 819 target genes. Only 5% of genes occupied by Cbx7, Ring1B, Suz12, H3K27me3, or H3K9me3 were co-occupied by Cbx6 (Figure S1E; the validation by ChIP-qPCR of Cbx6 binding to several targets is shown in Figures S1F and S1G). Despite the lack of PRC1/2 binding to Cbx6 target genes, the majority of these were not transcribed in ESCs (Figure S1H). GO analysis indicated that Cbx6 target genes are involved mainly in cellular, metabolic, and protein modification processes (Figure S1I). Intriguingly, Cbx6 binding to chromatin occurs predominantly at TSSs, but spreads up to ±50 kb from the TSS; the significance of this is currently unknown (Figure S1J). Thus, our results indicate that the genome-wide localization of Cbx7, but not Cbx6, is virtually identical to that of Ring1B and PRC2, strongly suggesting that Cbx7 is the main PRC1-interacting Cbx protein in pluripotent ESCs. Moreover, these results show that Cbx6 is predominantly not associated to PRC1, and that its transcriptional repressive function is independent of PRC1 in ESCs. Although it has been hypothesized that PRC1 and PRC2 act redundantly to repress differentiation target genes in the pluripotent state, little is known about the role of PRC1 subunits during the ESC transition from pluripotency to differentiation. ESCs lacking Ring1B or a functional PRC2 complex do not spontaneously differentiate, and they fail to achieve complete differentiation (Leeb et al., 2010Leeb M. Pasini D. Novatchkova M. Jaritz M. Helin K. Wutz A. Polycomb complexes act redundantly to repress genomic repeats and genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Leeb and Wutz, 2007Leeb M. Wutz A. Ring1B is crucial for the regulation of developmental control genes and PRC1 proteins but not X inactivation in embryonic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We thus studied whether Cbx7 contributes to PRC1 stability and target selectivity during ESC self-renewal and differentiation. We generated a control and two stable Cbx7 knockdown ESC lines (shRNA-CTR, shRNA-Cbx7#31, and shRNA-Cbx7#33). Pluripotent markers Oct4 and Nanog were not affected upon Cbx7 depletion (Figure 3A ). Furthermore, alkaline phosphate staining indicated that ESCs did not spontaneously differentiate after depletion of Cbx7 (Figure 3B). These results are similar to those observed for Ring1B mutant ESCs, underscoring the molecular and functional overlap between Ring1B and Cbx7 in ESCs. Depletion of Cbx7 did not disrupt the interaction between endogenous Mel-18 and Ring1B, suggesting that Cbx7 is not essential for the stability of the PRC1 complex in ESCs (Figure 3C). Importantly, Cbx2/4/6 were not incorporated into the PRC1 complex even in the absence of Cbx7, excluding the possibility of compensation by other Cbx proteins in the absence of Cbx7. This allowed us to study the effects of depleting Cbx7 in gene expression in ESCs. A comparative gene expression profile between control and Cbx7-depleted ESCs revealed altered expression of 1,886 genes, of which 833 were upregulated and 1,053 were downregulated (Figure 3D and Table S3). GO analysis of the cohort of upregulated genes scored for pathways involved in development, regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, and cell fate commitment (Figure 3E). Approximately 40% of the upregulated genes (306) were direct Ring1B targets, and 187 of these were also cobound by Cbx7 (Figure 3F), thus indicating that Cbx7 is not required for the stability of PRC1, but that it is necessary for the PRC1-mediated transcriptional repression in ESCs. Interestingly, GO analysis of this subset of Cbx7/Ring1B direct targets (Figure 3F) indicated that they were predominantly involved in ectoderm and mesoderm specification (Figure 3G). Several of these Cbx7/Ring1B direct targets, including Cbx4 and Cbx8, displayed an increased expression in the absence of Cbx7 (Figure 3J). To rule out potential off-target shRNA effects, we generated stable cell lines transfected with a Cbx7-expressing construct resistant to the shRNA#33 (Cbx7#33rescue 1 and 2; Figure 3H). shRNA-resistant Cbx7 was incorporated into the endogenous PRC1 complex (Figure 3I), and it was able to rescue the pattern of expression of several Cbx7 target genes to levels similar to those in control cells (Figure 3J). We next studied whether Cbx7 is required for PRC1 chromatin binding by using our stable Cbx7 knockdown ESC lines. ChIP-qPCR experiments showed that Cbx7 occupancy at promoters was dramatically reduced in shCbx7 cells (Figure 4A ). Similarly, the levels of occupancy of Ring1B and Mel-18 at the promoters for CBX4, CBX8, HOXD9, T (also called Brachyury), and CDX2 was highly reduced after Cbx7 depletion and was restored upon Cbx7 rescue (Figure 4A and Figures S2A and S2B). Accordingly, H2AK119ub levels were also diminished in both shCbx7 cell lines (Figure S2C). The level of occupancy of the PRC2 subunit Suz12 was also significantly compromised, and this reduction correlated with slightly reduced levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 4A). The observed lower binding to promoters of PRC2 was not due to a lowered expression of PRC2 components after Cbx7 depletion (Figure S2D). These results suggest not only that Cbx7 is required for PRC1 binding to chromatin, but also that PRC2 recruitment to chromatin depends on a functional PRC1. We next studied whether Cbx7, in turn, requires functional PRC1 and PRC2 complexes for it to bind to chromatin. Ring1B−/− ESCs lack a functional PRC1 complex and also express lower protein levels of the other PRC1 subunits (Leeb and Wutz, 2007Leeb M. Wutz A. Ring1B is crucial for the regulation of developmental control genes and PRC1 proteins but not X inactivation in embryonic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); in addition, we also observed reduced but detectable levels of Cbx7 protein (Figure 4B). ChIP-seq of Cbx7 in Ring1B−/− cells showed that Cbx7 binds to the entire set of HOX clusters, indicating that its recruitment to target genes did not fully depend on a functional PRC1 complex (Figure 4C). We did observed that Cbx7 binding was highly reduced at some HOX genes, such as HOXA1, HOXB13, and HOXD9, as well as at CBX4 and CBX8; this can probably be attributed to the global decrease in expression of Cbx7 protein in the absence of Ring1B (Figure 4C and Figure S3A). However, in loci where the enrichment of Cbx7 was very high in wild-type ESCs, including the HOXA5/6/7/9 genes and developmental genes, like NRP1, CDX2, and DLK1, Cbx7 recruitment to chromatin was by and large unaffected by the lack of a functional PRC1 complex, with only slight reductions in binding (Figure 4C and Figures S3A and S3B). We next asked whether Cbx7 binding in the absence of Ring1B could be due to a functional interaction with Ring1A, given that Ring1A and Ring1B are functionally linked in ESCs (de Napoles et al., 2004de Napoles M. Mermoud J.E. Wakao R. Tang Y.A. Endoh M. Appanah R. Nesterova T.B. Silva J. Otte A.P.

Polycomb group proteins Ring1A/B are functionally linked to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry to maintain ES cell identity.Development. 2008; 135: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To study whether Cbx7 binding to chromatin in Ring1B mutant cells was Ring1A dependent, we depleted Ring1A in control and Ring1B−/− ESCs. Expression of some, but not all, Ring1B target genes was higher in Ring1B−/− ESCs depleted of Ring1A, as previously described (Figure S3C). Knockdown of Ring1A did not affect the binding of Cbx7 to chromatin in ESCs (Figure S3D). However, depletion of Ring1A in Ring1B−/− ESCs further reduced the binding of Cbx7 to promoters. We next studied the effect of ablating PRC2 function on the recruitment of Cbx7 to chromatin. Our ChIP analysis for Suz12 and H3K27me3 (see Figure S5B) indicated that, for some regions, PRC2 recruitment occurs independently of that of PRC1, as previously suggested (Leeb et al., 2010Leeb M. Pasini D. Novatchkova M. Jaritz M. Helin K. Wutz A. Polycomb complexes act redundantly to repress genomic repeats and genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ChIP-seq of Cbx7 in EED−/− cells, which showed absence of binding for Suz12, Jarid2, and H3K27me3 at the chromatin region (Figure S3E), confirmed that Cbx7 binding to chromatin is completely dependent on H3K27me3, as exemplified with the HOX clusters (Figure 4C). These results also indicate that in ESCs the occupancy of Cbx7 is not linked to H3K9me3. PRC2-depleted cells displayed impaired chromatin binding not only for Cbx7, but also for Ring1B and Mel-18 (Figure S3E). Of note, the protein level of PRC1 subunits is not affected in EED−/− ESCs (Leeb et al., 2010Leeb M. Pasini D. Novatchkova M. Jaritz M. Helin K. Wutz A. Polycomb complexes act redundantly to repress genomic repeats and genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our results therefore suggest that Cbx7 recruitment is fully dependent on a functional PRC2 complex in ESCs. However, although Ring1B requires Cbx7 for its binding to chromatin, Cbx7 can bind to a large proportion of its genomic target regions independently of Ring1B. We next investigated whether Cbx7 plays a role during ESC differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Intriguingly, Cbx7 expression was downregulated during EB formation (Figure 5A ). Because PRC2 is recruited to the promoter region of some pluripotent markers during EB differentiation (Li et al., 2010Li G. Margueron R. Ku M. Chambon P. Bernstein B.E. Reinberg D. Jarid2 and PRC2, partners in regulating gene expression.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the reduced Cbx7 expression was also dependent on PRC2 and PRC1 activities. ChIP-qPCR experiments showed that PRC1 and PRC2 were bound to the promoters of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 in 9-day-old EBs (Figure 5B). In addition, both PRC1 and PRC2 were recruited to the CBX7 promoter, concomitantly with their release from the CBX4 and CBX8 promoters, further confirming the existence of a Polycomb autoregulatory loop that balances ESC pluripotency and differentiation (Figure 5C). We next investigated the effects of depleting Cbx7 during EB formation. The pluripotent markers Oct4 and Nanog were efficiently downregulated in control and Cbx7-depleted EBs to a similar extent (Figure 5A), and Cbx7-depleted cells were able to form EBs with the same efficiency as control cells at day 2 (Figure 5D). However, from day 4 onward, Cbx7-depleted EBs were noticeably smaller and more cavitated than the control EBs (Figure 5D and Figure S4A). We thus performed a gene expression profile analysis on both the control (EB9-shCTR) and Cbx7-depleted (EB9-shCbx7) EBs at day 9. The volcano plot shows that 388 genes were upregulated and 279 were downregulated in EB9-shCbx7 as compared with the EB9-shCTR cells (Figure 5E). GO analysis revealed that both the ectoderm and mesoderm lineages were deregulated in Cbx7-depleted EBs (Figures 5F and 5G), consistent with the microarray analysis performed on proliferating pluripotent control and Cbx7-depleted ESCs (Figure 3G). Mesoderm and endoderm markers were consistently downregulated, whereas some ectoderm markers were upregulated (Figure S4B). Several of the HOX genes that were highly upregulated in proliferating Cbx7-depleted ESCs were also upregulated in EB9-shCbx7 (Figure S4B). Together, these results show that Cbx7 is required for the timely repression of differentiation-specific genes in the pluripotent state, and that the loss of Cbx7 produces an imbalance in the commitment toward the endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal lineages. In addition, we can conclude that the PRC1- and PRC2-dependent repression of"

We identified adult CNS stem cells from human retinal pigment epithelium (RPESCs) RPESCs are multipotent, producing neural and, surprisingly, mesenchymal progeny RPESCs produce stable RPE cells, valuable for transplantation and disease modeling RPESCs can be obtained readily from the elderly, even from 99-year-old donors The RPE is a pigmented, single-layered, polarized epithelium located between the neural retina and the vascular choriocapillaris (Figures 1A–1C ). It supports metabolic and cellular processes of retinal photoreceptors, including diurnal phagocytosis of the photoreceptor outer segments. Degeneration of the RPE, which occurs in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), leads to death of the overlying photoreceptors and neural retina, resulting in vision loss. Because there are currently limited treatments available for these diseases, discovering novel ways to stimulate RPE repair is an important therapeutic goal. During development, the RPE arises from the central nervous system (CNS) neuroepithelium. Bilateral outpocketings at the diencephalon form the optic anlage, and invagination of the optic vesicles produces a bilayered structure, with the inner layer forming the neural retina and the outer layer the RPE. While the neural retinal progenitor cells proliferate further to form the multilayered retina, the RPE becomes postmitotic and differentiates early, around day 32–50 in humans (Mann, 1964Mann I. The Development of Human Eye. Grune & Stratton, New York1964Google Scholar, Rapaport et al., 1995Rapaport D.H. Rakic P. Yasamura D. LaVail M.M.

Neurol. 1995; 363: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), into a polarized, pigmented, single-layered epithelium that remains nonproliferative throughout life. Interestingly, in some organisms, such as amphibians, injury can cause RPE cells to proliferate and regenerate both the RPE and other ocular tissues, including neural retina and even lens, demonstrating an inherent plasticity and ability to transdifferentiate. Plasticity is also seen in embryonic chick and mouse, as RPE can transdifferentiate into neural retina, but this potential is rapidly lost with maturity (reviewed in Lamba et al., 2008Lamba D. Karl M. Reh T. Neural regeneration and cell replacement: a view from the eye.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 538-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Human RPE plasticity is seen in pathological conditions; for example, it proliferates in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and has been suggested to adopt mesenchymal fates in PVR and phthisical eye, although direct evidence that the RPE can generate mesenchymal progeny is lacking. Adult human RPE can express the neuronal marker TuJ1 in vitro, indicating an incipient potential to adopt different fates (Amemiya et al., 2004Amemiya K. Haruta M. Takahashi M. Kosaka M. Eguchi G. Adult human retinal pigment epithelial cells capable of differentiating into neurons.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The basis of adult human RPE proliferative potential and plasticity is not fully understood. Retinal stem cells (RSCs) that can self-renew in vitro and produce retinal neurons and glia have been identified in the anterior ciliary epithelium, the iris pigmented epithelium in adult rodents and humans (Ahmad et al., 2000Ahmad I.

USA. 2009; 106: 6685-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, to date, there has been no evidence for a stem-like cell from the adult human RPE. Here we identify a subpopulation of RPE cells that can be activated to self-renew and that exhibit multipotentiality, producing either stable RPE progeny or neural, osteo, chondro, or adipo-lineage mesenchymal progeny. These observations indicate that RPE has the capacity for self-repair under the correct circumstances and that RPE can proliferate and differentiate pathologically in others, capacities that are relevant to human diseases in which the RPE changes, proliferates, or degenerates, such as RP, PVR, and AMD. To determine whether human RPE contains stem-like cells, RPE was isolated from adult human donor eyes obtained from eye banks (Figures 1A–1L). The anterior portion of the eye, containing the iris pigmented epithelium and the ciliary epithelium, which harbor retinal stem cells, was removed. From the remaining posterior eyecup, the neural retina was removed and the RPE isolated, then dissociated and plated in adherent conditions. Despite being normally nonproliferative in situ, these cells showed robust growth, doubling approximately once per 2 days. Remarkably, RPE cells from 99-year-old donors produced actively growing cultures, and the growth of RPE cells derived from young and elderly donors was similar (data not shown). Proliferation is stimulated by serum, and the cells could be passaged at least 6–8 times. Hence, the adult RPE, normally nonproliferative in situ and dormant for many decades, can be activated to display a robust capacity to divide upon exposure to appropriate growth conditions. After achieving confluency, the resulting primary adherent cells at first plating (P0) slow proliferation and re-establish a cobblestone monolayer, expressing genes characteristic of RPE, at a lower level than native RPE tissue but higher than the long-established human RPE cell line ARPE19 (Figure 1M). In some culture conditions, the morphology of the cells is primarily fusiform, but growth in conditions optimized for cobblestone RPE growth (Blenkinsop et al., 2010Blenkinsop T.A. Salero E. Stern J. Temple S. A protocol for the culture and maintenance of functional retinal pigment epithelial monolayers from adult human eye.in: Walker J.M. Fulcher L. Method in Molecular Biology: Epithelial Cell Culture Protocols. 2nd edition. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2011Google Scholar), which is aided by isolating small RPE sheets by gentle dissociation (Figure 1F), produced cobblestone, polarized monolayers with typical RPE morphology that were stable for several months. We characterized the native RPE and the RPE-derived proliferative cells for the expression of markers associated with early stem cells and reprogramming, including NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, SSEA-4, KLF4, C-MYC, and LIN28. Interestingly, at all stages, high levels of C-MYC and KLF4 were seen in RPE cells compared to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or to fibroblasts or neural retina derived from the same human eye donors (Figure 2). The proliferative RPE-derived cells were positive for the surface marker SSEA4 (Figure 2A) but we did not detect immunostaining for OCT4 and NANOG, and negligible SOX2 (data not shown), findings that were verified by qPCR (Figure 2B). Clonal, nonadherent sphere formation is an indication of stem cell presence within CNS tissue (Reynolds and Rietze, 2005Reynolds B.A. Rietze R.L. Neural stem cells and neurospheres—re-evaluating the relationship.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Adult RPE tissue was isolated, dissociated into single cells, and grown at clonal density in nonadherent conditions in knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium supplemented with FGF2. Primary spheres were visible after 4 days at a frequency of 1.5% of the initial plated cells (Figures 2C–2E), and the sphere cultures could be passaged at least three times, demonstrating self-renewal. However, this approach underestimates the number of cells capable of proliferating, because typically RPE grows more successfully when plated in adherent conditions, probably reflecting the importance of cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion for RPE cell growth. Therefore, we assessed self-renewal potential by cloning single, freshly isolated RPE cells, one cell per well, in adherent conditions in Terasaki wells that each hold approximately 10 μl of medium. The vast majority of single RPE cells did not divide or produced just 2–4 progeny. However, 10.6% of the cells divided and eventually filled the culture well with a confluent cobblestone monolayer. When these clones were passaged and plated again as single cells in Terasaki wells, 26.4% proliferated extensively to fill the entire well with a cobblestone RPE monolayer, demonstrating self-renewal in adherent conditions. To examine their plasticity, RPE cobblestone monolayers (Figure 3A ) were treated for 4 weeks with differentiation media that have been used previously to promote neural, adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteogenic differentiation. The cells successfully differentiated and expressed markers for these cell types, assessed by histochemical stains, immunostaining, and qPCR (Figures 3C and 3D). Such markers were not present prior to differentiation (Figures S1C–S1F). In some cases, at the 4 week time point, the resulting cells maintained a pigmented cobblestone-like morphology, demonstrating a transitional form between the two phenotypes, a classic sign of cells transitioning from one fate to another. The same plasticity was exhibited by RPE grown as fusiform cultures, which are largely depigmented, and at different passages (P2–P5, Figure S2). The fact that both fusiform and cobblestone RPE exhibit this plasticity indicates that the acquisition of these fates does not depend upon cells undergoing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, that both pigmented and nonpigmented cells do so indicates that loss of pigment is not essential for trans-fating to occur. In amphibians in which the RPE is stimulated to transdifferentiate into neural retina, pigment loss accompanies the transition to retinal cells (Ikegami et al., 2002Ikegami Y. Mitsuda S. Araki M. Neural cell differentiation from retinal pigment epithelial cells of the newt: an organ culture model for the urodele retinal regeneration.J. Neurobiol. 2002; 50: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, pigment is diluted upon cell division, even before cells are placed in differentiation medium. For example, Movie S1 shows a freshly isolated human RPE cell dividing in RPE medium and splitting the pigment granules approximately evenly between the two daughter cells. This continues so that actively proliferating RPESCs have little pigment, although it is not a prerequisite for acquiring mesenchymal potential as evinced by examples of differentiated RPE-containing pigment (Figure S2). When the RPE cells were grown in neural differentiation conditions, qPCR analysis showed that they markedly upregulated, by more than 1,000-fold, the neural progenitor marker Nestin and by approximately 90-fold the neuronal marker β-tubulin III. Interestingly, the cells also upregulated markers expressed in the early eye-field and forebrain: LHX2, OTX2, and RX. In contrast, the retinal progenitor markers CHX10 and Rhodopsin were unchanged and PAX6 actually declined. The neural differentiation medium we used was based on a medium that promotes retinal differentiation (Levine et al., 2000Levine E.M. Fuhrmann S. Reh T.A.

Thus it appears that neural differentiation encouraged the acquisition of an anterior/eye field neural progenitor phenotype, and the RPE marker MITF was significantly suppressed, consistent with a fate change. In contrast to this neural and mesenchymal potency, RPE cells subjected to protocols for endoderm differentiation did not display the panel of markers that would indicate successful differentiation into early endoderm (SOX17, FOXA2) or liver cells (AFP is not detected, although low expression of albumin is seen) (Figure S1A). Production of mesenchymal progeny, which are typically mesoderm-associated phenotypes, from a CNS-derived cell was surprising. Although the evidence for transitional forms reduces the likelihood that mesenchymal phenotypes originated from a contaminating cell, the definitive test of multipotency is to take an individual RPE cell, expand it clonally, and test whether its progeny can differentiate into diverse cell types. Therefore, we used the clonal lines described above that were derived from primary human RPE, split these into different culture wells, and exposed them to differentiation media for adipocyte, chondrocyte, and bone differentiation, while maintaining other wells in control (RPE) medium for 4 weeks without passaging. We tested 17 nonadherent clones of which 14 successfully survived the differentiation procedures and all were found to be multipotent, producing RPE and mesenchymal derivatives (Figures 3E–3H). We also tested three of the adherent clonal lines, and again, all were found to produce RPE, adipocyte, chondrocye, and bone lineage progeny. Moreover, this clonogenic experiment is a further demonstration of self-renewal: extensive proliferation from a single cell over a long time period with retention of multipotency has been used to demonstrate stem cells, e.g., in the skin and blood (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C.

To determine whether the RPE plasticity observed in vitro could be replicated in vivo, we implanted GFP-retroviral vector-labeled RPE monolayers into the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), a common in vivo assay system to evaluate tumor formation and to investigate development. After 1 week, we observed the presence of vascularized growths (Figure 4A ) that were dissected, cryo-sectioned, and stained. GFP+ RPE-derived cells showed expression of the early definitive osteogenic differentiation marker Runx2 and of the mesenchymal marker smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 4B), demonstrating that naive RPE can produce mesenchymal derivatives in vivo. It was possible that this plasticity was present in human adult RPE and not seen in other types of RPE cells. To test this, further experiments were performed on RPE cells obtained from a variety of sources (Figure S2). ARPE-19 cells, a transformed human line commonly used as an RPE model, showed clear evidence of differentiation into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic cells (Figure S2). We derived pure RPE cultures from pluripotent and karyotypically normal H9 hESCS (Idelson et al., 2009Idelson M. Alper R. Obolensky A. Ben-Shushan E. Hemo I. Yachimovich-Cohen N. Khaner H. Smith Y. Wiser O. Gropp M. et al.Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into functional retinal pigment epithelium cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 396-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and showed that they also had this capacity (Figure S2), as had fetal human RPE (Figure S2). Finally, bovine RPE behaved similarly, demonstrating that mesenchymal differentiation is a feature of RPE from different mammalian species (Figure S2). Interestingly, when comparing the plasticity across these different sources, we noticed that fetal RPE in general was more resistant to acquiring mesenchymal fates, perhaps reflecting an underlying stability (Figure S3). Particularly noteworthy, the human ESC-derived RPE cells were especially vulnerable to osteogenic culture conditions, a propensity that should be taken into account if these cells are to be used clinically for RPE replacement therapies. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated plasticity of RPE. Placing isolated RPE into a variety of defined culture conditions releases their normal quiescence, stimulates self-renewal, and reveals multipotency, which defines the RPE stem cell (RPESC) phenotype. RPESCs are not pluripotent and are not a typical neural stem cell, but are a new type of stem cell capable of producing both CNS and mesoderm-associated lineages, notably mesenchymal progeny. This is interesting in the light of studies demonstrating that the first wave of mesenchymal stem cells generated in the mouse embryo can emerge from a Sox1+ central neural precursor that initially lacks neural crest markers (Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S. Neuroepithelial cells supply an initial transient wave of MSC differentiation.Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We note that the RPE starting populations for these studies lacked neural crest markers and mesenchymal markers STRO-1, CD90, and CD105 (Figures S1B, S1G–S1L) and yet they share the mesenchymal potential of these cells. It is possible that human RPE, because of their early ontology, as evinced by their early appearance in vivo and in differentiating hESC cultures, retain the ability to produce cells of both neural and mesenchymal lineages, analogous to the early Sox1+ cells in mouse. Prior studies have suggested that RPE could enter mesenchymal differentiation pathways in some eye diseases. For example, in PVR, RPE becomes fusiform and proliferates in the vitreous to produce epiretinal membranes that can cause retinal detachment, thereby disrupting vision (Kampik et al., 1981Kampik A. Kenyon K.R. Michels R.G. Green W.R. de la Cruz Z.C. Epiretinal and vitreous membranes. Comparative study of 56 cases.Arch.

In vitro characteristics of cellular components.Arch. Ophthalmol. 1981; 99: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Intraocular osseous metaplasia associated with PVR has been attributed to metaplastic RPE (Vemuganti et al., 2002Vemuganti G.K. Honavar S.G. Jalali S. Intraocular osseous metaplasia. A clinico-pathological study.Indian J. Ophthalmol. 2002; 50: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). Intraocular bone has been observed in other disorders, including retinal detachment, chronic inflammation, trauma, and phthisis bulbi and in rarer conditions such as incontinentia pigmenti, choroidal osteoma, and choroidal hemangioma (Pe'er, 1988Pe'er J.

Because of the location of these mesenchymal-derived growths and considering that malformed RPE surround the growths, RPE have been suggested as their source (Loeffler et al., 1996Loeffler K.U.

Ophthalmol. 1996; 234: S70-S75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Loewenstein et al., 1997Loewenstein J.I. Hogan R.N. Jakobiec F.A. Osseous metaplasia in a preretinal membrane.Arch.

CRC Press, Boca Raton2002Google Scholar). RPE-surrounding osseous metaplasias in human eyes were found to express the osteogenic markers GDF-5 and BMP-7 as well as the mesenchymal marker TGF-β1, implicating them in bone production (Toyran et al., 2005Toyran S. Lin A.Y. Edward D.P. Expression of growth differentiation factor-5 and bone morphogenic protein-7 in intraocular osseous metaplasia.Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2005; 89: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence our findings, by providing evidence of a mesenchymal potential for human RPE cells, strengthen the notion that these pathologies are RPE derived. In summary, we have shown that RPE can be activated in vitro to a multipotent stem cell, the RPESC, which can be expanded to produce stable RPE or readily differentiated into mesenchymal lineages. It will be important to study the molecular basis of this mesenchymal potential to understand the basis of RPE metaplastic contribution to retinal pathologies. RPESCs can be expanded considerably even from elderly donors and could be valuable to generate stable RPE cells suitable for autologous or allogeneic replacement therapy and for producing in vitro models of RPE disease. Sophisticated protocols of differentiation toward specific neuron cell fates exist (Tucker et al., 2011Tucker B.A. Park I.H. Qi S.D. Klassen H.J. Jiang C. Yao J. Redenti S. Daley G.Q. Young M.J. Transplantation of adult mouse iPS cell-derived photoreceptor precursors restores retinal structure and function in degenerative mice.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18992Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and future studies will explore the extent of RPE differentiation capacity. The fact that RPESCs can be readily stimulated to express features of anterior neural progenitor cells suggests that their potential might be broader than demonstrated here, and it will be worthwhile to investigate whether they can be advanced into other differentiated CNS phenotypes. Human eyes from 22- to 99-year-old donors were obtained from The Eye Bank for Sight Restoration, Inc. (New York, NY), the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) (Philadelphia, PA) (supported by NIH grant 5 U42 RR006042), and the Lions Eye Bank (Albany, NY). The eyes were cut at the ora serrata, the anterior segment was discarded, and the vitreous and retina were removed, exposing the RPE layer. RPE dissection and dissociation was performed as described previously (Burke et al., 1996Burke J.M. Skumatz C.M. Irving P.E. McKay B.S.

Gentle trituration within the eyecup using care to maintain Bruch's membrane yields a suspension of largely single RPE cells with minimal contamination by rod outer segments, blood, or other cell types. The eyecup was rinsed with sterile PBS and incubated with enzyme-free Hanks'-based cell dissociation buffer (GIBCO) for 10 min at 37°C. Gently, the dissociation buffer was removed and the eyecup filled with DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO). Using a double bevel spoon blade (3.0 mm), small sheets (1 mm2) of RPE were removed from the Bruch's membrane by gentle scraping. RPE sheets were plated into matrigel (BD Biosciences)-pretreated tissue culture plates and cultured in RPE medium: MEM-α modified medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (1:100), 1% Na-Pyruvate, 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), supplemented with THT (Taurine, Hydrocortisone, Triiodo-thyronin), and N1 (Sigma-Aldrich) (Maminishkis et al., 2006Maminishkis A.

Dissociated single cells from freshly isolated RPE were plated on ultra-low attachment 6-well plates (Corning, Costar) at 1,000 cells/plate in KSR medium (Knockout DMEM, 20% KO-SR, 10 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin solution [1:100]), with medium changes every 3 days. After 10 days, cultures were assessed for neurosphere number. Neurospheres were defined as free-floating spheres of >40 μm diameter.

https://openalex.org/W2085149748,"Stochastic or Asymmetric Fate Determination? During an adaptive immune response, B lymphocytes rapidly divide and differentiate into effector cell populations, including antibody-secreting plasmablasts and memory B cells. Many also change the class of antibody they secrete, through a process called isotype switching. During this process, some cells die. Whether cells acquire these different fates in a stochastic or programmed manner, however, is unclear. Duffy et al. (p. 338 , published online 5 January) used single-cell tracking to determine the times to division, differentiation into a plasmablast, isotype switching, and death of stimulated B lymphocytes. Statistical analysis and mathematical modeling revealed that these cell-fate decisions appear to be the result of random clocks: Which clock went off first (division, differentiation, or death), determined the fate of the cell. Barnett et al. (p. 342 , published online 15 December) sought to determine whether asymmetrical cell division, which is thought to contribute to effector cell-fate decisions in T cells, may be at work in B lymphocytes. Indeed, factors important for the initiation and maintenance of germinal center B lymphocyte identity, along with an ancestral polarity protein, were asymmetrically distributed and maintained their asymmetry during cell division."

Mammalian genomes encode multiple homologs of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) components, including five orthologs of the Drosophila Polycomb protein (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, and Cbx8). We have identified Cbx7 as the primary Polycomb ortholog of PRC1 complexes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The expression of Cbx7 is downregulated during ESC differentiation, preceding the upregulation of Cbx2, Cbx4, and Cbx8, which are directly repressed by Cbx7. Ectopic expression of Cbx7 inhibits differentiation and X chromosome inactivation and enhances ESC self-renewal. Conversely, Cbx7 knockdown induces differentiation and derepresses lineage-specific markers. In a functional screen, we identified the miR-125 and miR-181 families as regulators of Cbx7 that are induced during ESC differentiation. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs accelerates ESC differentiation via regulation of Cbx7. These observations establish a critical role for Cbx7 and its regulatory miRNAs in determining pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2144686782,"We investigated the role of the chondrocyte primary cilium in mechanotransduction events related to cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis. We generated conditionally immortalized wild-type (WT) and IFT88orpk (ORPK) mutant chondrocytes that lack primary cilia and assessed intracellular Ca2+ signaling, extracellular matrix synthesis, and ATP release in response to physiologically relevant compressive strains in a 3-dimensional chondrocyte culture system. All conditions were compared to unloaded controls. We found that cilia were required for compression-induced Ca2+ signaling mediated by ATP release, and an associated up-regulation of aggrecan mRNA and sulfated glycosaminosglycan secretion. However, chondrocyte cilia were not the initial mechanoreceptors, since both WT and ORPK cells showed mechanically induced ATP release. Rather, we found that primary cilia were required for downstream ATP reception, since ORPK cells did not elicit a Ca2+ response to exogenous ATP even though WT and ORPK cells express similar levels of purine receptors. We suggest that purinergic Ca2+ signaling may be regulated by polycystin-1, since ORPK cells only expressed the C-terminal tail. This is the first study to demonstrate that primary cilia are essential organelles for cartilage mechanotransduction, as well as identifying a novel role for primary cilia not previously reported in any other cell type, namely cilia-mediated control of ATP reception.—Wann, A.

Whereas natural pluripotent cells in the developing embryo exist transiently, ESCs can be maintained in vitro indefinitely, providing an unlimited source of undifferentiated cells. When reintroduced into blastocysts, mouse ESCs engraft into the ICMs and participate, in concert with host embryonic cells, in the development of chimeric fetuses and offspring (Bradley et al., 1984Bradley A.

This unique feature of ESCs has been greatly exploited in the creation of knockout mice and studies of mammalian gene function (Capecchi, 1989Capecchi M.R.

Moreover, live chimeras have been produced by aggregating preimplantation embryos of different species (Fehilly et al., 1984Fehilly C.B. Willadsen S.M. Tucker E.M. Interspecific chimaerism between sheep and goat.Nature. 1984; 307: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The ability of mouse cultured pluripotent cells, including those derived experimentally, to contribute to chimeric tissues of the embryo proper after introduction into preimplantation host embryos has become an ultimate test for pluripotency. However, such a stringent chimera-based pluripotency assay has not been developed for primates, in large part, due to the limited availability of animals and the lack of relevant technological and genotyping expertise. We initially evaluated the ability of rhesus monkey ESCs to contribute to chimeric fetuses upon injection into in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived host blastocysts. To aid in the tracking of injected cells, we transduced ESCs with a lentiviral vector carrying GFP and selected pure populations of cells highly expressing the transgene. Approximately 20–30 disaggregated ESCs were injected into the host blastocyst and placed next to the ICM (Figure S1; Movie S1, ESC injection). To eliminate risks that ESC disaggregation may affect cell survival, some blastocysts were injected with mechanically dispersed cell clumps. To exclude the possibility that GFP-expressing ESCs may have compromised developmental potential, we also injected nontransgenic ESCs. We evaluated several previously characterized rhesus ESC lines including IVF-derived ORMES-22 (XX) and -23 (XY) as well as SCNT-derived CRES-2 (Byrne et al., 2007Byrne J.A. Pedersen D.A. Clepper L.L.

A total of 26 ESC-injected blastocysts were immediately transplanted into seven synchronized recipients. The details of this experiment including host embryo stage, ESC type, and embryo transfer outcomes are presented in Table S1. Four females became pregnant—one carrying quadruplets and three carrying singletons. In addition, three recipients contained gestational sacs without fetuses. The overall pregnancy and implantation rates were 57% (4/7) per recipient animal and 27% (7/26) per embryos transferred, respectively. All pregnancies were terminated at midgestation, and seven fetuses were recovered by caesarean section. Multiple tissues and organs from each fetus were analyzed for the presence of ESC progeny by (1) microsatellite parentage analysis of genomic DNA employing 41 short tandem repeats (STR); (2) mitochondrial (mt)DNA parentage analysis using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP); and (3) direct GFP fluorescence analysis followed by GFP-specific PCR. None of these assays showed a contribution of ESCs in analyzed fetuses (Table 1).Table 1Summary of In Vivo Chimera Studies with Rhesus Monkey ESCs and EmbryosTested CellsHost Embryo StageTotal Offspring GeneratedDeveloped to Separate EmbryoDeveloped to Embryo Proper ChimeraORMES-22blastocyst4nonoORMES-23blastocyst2nonoCRES-2 GFPblastocyst1nonoWhole ICMblastocyst3yesrestrictedaChimerism was restricted to livers, spleens, and placentas.

The failure to generate chimeras may indicate either limited developmental potential of primate ESCs or inability of host blastocysts to incorporate foreign embryonic cells. To address these questions, we tested whether noncultured pluripotent cells residing in the ICM can incorporate into host embryos and form chimeras. Our attempts to enzymatically disaggregate monkey ICMs into single cells prior to injections resulted in poor survival and cell death. Therefore, whole ICMs were immunosurgically isolated from IVF-produced expanded blastocysts and immediately injected into host blastocysts from unrelated monkeys (Figure S1; Movie S1, ICM injection). A total of 44 ICM-injected blastocysts were generated and transferred into 11 recipients (Table S1). Three females were confirmed pregnant based on blood progesterone profiles. However, one recipient carried a single gestational sac without a viable fetus. The second recipient (recipient #10) carried two sacs; one was empty, whereas the second contained two fetuses separated by a thin membrane, indicative of a monochorionic di-amniotic twin pregnancy (Figures 1A and 1B ). The third recipient (recipient #18) carried a single gestational sac with one fetus. The pregnancy and implantation rates with ICM-injected blastocysts were 18% (2/11) and 7% (3/44), respectively (Table S1). All three fetuses were recovered by caesarean section as described above and analyzed for the contribution of transplanted ICMs. Naturally occurring, monochorionic twin pregnancies usually carry monozygotic, genetically identical fetuses due to spontaneous duplication of the embryo during early stages of development (Cunningham and Williams, 2005Cunningham F.G. Williams J.W. Williams Obstetrics.Twenty-Second Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional, New York2005Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, our initial morphological examinations of the monochorionic twin pregnancy revealed that the fetuses were of different genders (ICM-f1—female and ICM-f2—male). Moreover, detailed STR analysis demonstrated that one fetus originated from the host blastocyst, whereas the second fetus was derived from the injected ICMs (Figure 1 and Table S2). Interestingly, we detected chimerism in the livers and spleens of both fetuses, but not in other organs and tissues. For example, analysis of the STR locus for D11S2002 in livers indicated the presence of three different alleles representing both the host blastocyst and injected ICM (Figure 1). In addition, the gender-specific STR marker (AME) confirmed the presence of male cells within the liver of the female fetus ICM-f1. To further validate these results, we analyzed gender using PCR-based size differences in the amplicons of the X- and Y-linked zinc finger protein genes (ZFX and ZFY) (Mitalipov et al., 2007Mitalipov S.M. Zhou Q. Byrne J.A. Ji W.Z. Norgren R.B. Wolf D.P. Reprogramming following somatic cell nuclear transfer in primates is dependent upon nuclear remodeling.Hum. Reprod. 2007; 22: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and confirmed chimerism in livers and spleens. We also genotyped fetal mtDNAs based on the G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the rhDHV1 region (Tachibana et al., 2009Tachibana M. Sparman M. Sritanaudomchai H. Ma H. Clepper L. Woodward J. Li Y. Ramsey C. Kolotushkina O. Mitalipov S. Mitochondrial gene replacement in primate offspring and embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and the ability of the SphI (PaeI) enzyme to digest the G but not the A allele. MtDNA analysis confirmed that ICM-f2 originated from transplanted ICM and chimerism in livers and spleens (Figure 1). The placental sample containing a mixture of several extraembryonic membranes (including chorion and amnion) was contributed by both the host embryo and injected ICM. The fetus associated with the singleton pregnancy (ICM-f3) was male and originated solely from the injected ICM, whereas the placental (trophectoderm) component was female and mainly contributed by the host blastocyst (Figure 2 and Table S2). These results demonstrate that contrary to the mouse and some other species, monkey blastocysts do not readily incorporate ESCs or foreign ICMs and form embryo proper chimeras. However, transplanted ICMs were capable of forming separate viable fetuses while sharing the trophectodermal compartment of the host embryo. The chimerism detected exclusively in livers and spleens of twin fetuses could result from the exchange of blood and hematopoietic progenitors through placental perfusions. We also observed contribution of transplanted ICMs to extraembryonic membranes. This is an expected outcome based on the evidence that mouse ICMs contribute to several vital extraembryonic tissues including amnion and extraembryonic mesoderm of the chorion (Nagy et al., 1990Nagy A. Gócza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Iványi E. Markkula M. Rossant J. Embryonic stem cells alone are able to support fetal development in the mouse.Development. 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that the totipotent blastomeres of cleaving embryos should be capable of incorporating foreign blastomeres and forming chimeras. We focused on the four-cell stage based on the evidence that an isolated single blastomere from this stage embryo can implant and develop into a viable rhesus offspring (Chan et al., 2000Chan A.W. Dominko T. Luetjens C.M. Neuber E. Martinovich C. Hewitson L. Simerly C.R. Schatten G.P. Clonal propagation of primate offspring by embryo splitting.Science. 2000; 287: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate this, we initially attempted to generate chimeric embryos by replacing two blastomeres in the four-cell stage embryo with two blastomeres isolated from different developmentally comparable embryos (Figure S1). We generated 29 chimeric four-cell embryos of which 19 reached the blastocyst stage. Analysis revealed that only 10 of these blastocysts contained total cell counts similar to nonmanipulated controls, indicative of successful aggregation (Table S3). However, remaining embryos either failed to aggregate and formed two separate blastocysts or developed into a single blastocyst with significantly reduced cell numbers, indicating that either transplanted or host blastomeres arrested and failed to contribute to chimeric blastocysts (Figure S2). We also observed blastocysts with two distinct cavities or two ICMs within a single trophectoderm vesicle (Figure S2). Although we did not incorporate markers that would distinguish between donor and host blastomeres, this phenomenon was not seen in control intact embryos or in prior studies of preimplantation embryogenesis (Wolf et al., 2004Wolf D.P. Thormahlen S. Ramsey C. Yeoman R.R. Fanton J. Mitalipov S. Use of assisted reproductive technologies in the propagation of rhesus macaque offspring.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these observations motivated us to carry out further studies whereby we aggregated together whole embryos in order to increase the yield of chimeric blastocysts and eventually offspring. We reasoned that aggregating of three or more whole cleaving embryos together would allow better contact between blastomeres and ensure that at least two of these embryos would develop to blastocysts and contribute to chimeric ICMs (Figure S1). We created a total of 29 aggregates using between three and six individual four-cell stage embryos and cultured to the blastocyst stage (Table S4). Remarkably, all 29 aggregates developed to blastocysts, and cell count analysis suggested that 26 blastocysts (90%) consisted of at least twice the normal cell counts, indicating successful aggregation (Table S5 and Figure S3). To corroborate these observations, we injected GFP-RNA construct into parental oocytes and generated GFP-expressing cleaving embryos. GFP signal was always confined to the RNA-injected oocytes and daughter blastomeres but was not found in aggregated blastomeres from noninjected embryos (Figure S3). We aggregated GFP-tagged embryos with noninjected controls and confirmed successful aggregation of parental embryos into a singe blastocyst. Finally, we selected 14 chimeric blastocysts consisting of high cell counts and transplanted these into five recipient females (Table S1). All five recipients became pregnant, including two with singletons, two with twins, and one female carrying quadruplets. The pregnancy and implantation rates with chimeric blastocysts were 100% (5/5) and 71% (10/14), respectively. These remarkably high pregnancy outcomes were not seen among other treatments in this study or in our prior studies (Wolf et al., 2004Wolf D.P. Thormahlen S. Ramsey C. Yeoman R.R. Fanton J. Mitalipov S. Use of assisted reproductive technologies in the propagation of rhesus macaque offspring.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On average, pregnancy and implantation rates with nonmanipulated rhesus embryos do not exceed 36% and 17%, respectively (Wolf et al., 2004Wolf D.P. Thormahlen S. Ramsey C. Yeoman R.R. Fanton J. Mitalipov S. Use of assisted reproductive technologies in the propagation of rhesus macaque offspring.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). High pregnancy and implantation results observed with chimeric blastocysts suggest that higher cell numbers in embryos are critical for pregnancy initiation. Three pregnancies with chimeric embryos were terminated, and seven fetuses recovered for genetic analysis. Remarkably, all fetuses were of normal size and had no obvious defects or congenital abnormalities. As expected, STR analysis confirmed that all seven fetuses were indeed chimeras (Table S6). Moreover, chimerism was found in all sampled organs and tissues of all fetuses. Some chimeras displayed up to five different alleles within informative individual STR loci, indicating that at least three separate genotypes (embryos) contributed to chimeric tissues (Figure S4; Table S6). Further, the AME marker allows us to determine the gender of fetuses, and three chimeras (EA-f1, 5, and 7) were identified as sex chimeras, indicating that contributing parental embryos were of different genders. Because several chimeras were generated by aggregating embryos from two unrelated females, we also used mtDNA genotyping to confirm presence of two different mtDNA haplotypes in offspring (Figure S4, Figure S5).Figure S5Chimerism in Offspring Confirmed by mtDNA Genotyping, Related to Table 1Show full caption(A) Restriction enzyme recognition of the C/T nucleotide difference between the two females. “C” allele in the egg donor female #14 mtDNA can be digested by EcoNI but not the “T” allele carried by the egg donor female #13.(B) Both mtDNA haplotypes were present in all four fetuses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Restriction enzyme recognition of the C/T nucleotide difference between the two females. “C” allele in the egg donor female #14 mtDNA can be digested by EcoNI but not the “T” allele carried by the egg donor female #13. (B) Both mtDNA haplotypes were present in all four fetuses. The remaining two recipients (#25 and #27) were allowed to carry pregnancies to term and delivered healthy twin (named Roku and Hex) and singleton (Chimero) infants, respectively (Figure 3). All three infants were phenotypic males with no obvious congenital abnormalities. We genotyped cord blood, cord (representing yolk sac and allantois), fetal membrane (representing amnion, chorion, and decidua), and placental (chorio-amniotic placenta) samples and confirmed that all three infants were indeed chimeras (Figure 3). To our knowledge, these infants are the world's first primate chimeras. Although all three offspring were phenotypic males, we reasoned that these infants could also be sex chimeras due to the high probability that some contributing embryos were genetically females (XX). To investigate this, we carried out detailed cytogenetic analyses of blood by G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Indeed, results confirmed that blood samples from Roku contained both male and female cells. Molecular cytogenetic studies revealed the presence of two signals for the rhesus monkey X chromosome in approximately 4% of analyzed cells, whereas remaining cells showed one signal for the X chromosome and one signal for the Y chromosome (Figure S6).Figure S6Cytogenetic Analysis of Blood for Sex Chimerism, Related to Table 1 and Figure 3Show full caption(A) Karyotype analysis by G-banding of rhesus infant chimera (Roku) blood sample detected presence of both male and female cells.

The cytogenetic analysis was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes collected at 3 months of age. We next revisited the question of why monkey blastocysts are unable to incorporate transplanted ICMs or ESCs and form embryo proper chimeras. Mouse chimeras with ESCs are routinely generated using embryonic day (E) 3.5 blastocysts as host embryos. However, the ability to form chimeras sharply declines when more advanced stage host blastocysts are used (Ohta et al., 2008Ohta H. Sakaide Y. Wakayama T. Generation of mice derived from embryonic stem cells using blastocysts of different developmental ages.Reproduction. 2008; 136: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, differentiation of host ICMs into epiblast (EPI) and extraembryonic progenitors is believed to restrict homing of injected ESCs into an ICM (Ohta et al., 2008Ohta H. Sakaide Y. Wakayama T. Generation of mice derived from embryonic stem cells using blastocysts of different developmental ages.Reproduction. 2008; 136: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For example, in peri-implantation mouse blastocysts (E4.5), the ICM differentiates into two restricted lineages, EPI and the primitive endoderm (PE) (Chazaud et al., 2006Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Pawson T. Rossant J. Early lineage segregation between epiblast and primitive endoderm in mouse blastocysts through the Grb2-MAPK pathway.Dev.

Developmental studies indicated that although the ICMs of E3.5 mouse blastocysts can contribute to all tissues except those of trophectodermal origin, chimeric contributions of EPI or PE cells are restricted to their own lineages (Gardner, 1982Gardner R.L.

Mice lacking Langerhans cells (LCs), a signatory epidermal dendritic cell (DC), are protected from cutaneous chemical carcinogenesis, independent of T cell immunity. Investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that LC-deficient skin was relatively resistant to DMBA-induced DNA damage. LCs efficiently metabolized DMBA to DMBA-trans-3,4-diol, an intermediate proximal to oncogenic Hras mutation, and DMBA-treated LC-deficient skin contained significantly fewer Hras mutations. Moreover, DMBA-trans-3,4-diol application bypassed tumor resistance in LC-deficient mice. Additionally, the genotoxic impact of DMBA on human keratinocytes was significantly increased by prior incubation with human-derived LC. Thus, tissue-associated DC can enhance chemical carcinogenesis via PAH metabolism, highlighting the complex relation between immune cells and carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2092708271,"Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon by which tumor cells exhibit resistance to a variety of chemically unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs. The classical form of multidrug resistance is connected to overexpression of membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which acts as an energy dependent drug efflux pump. P-glycoprotein expression is known to be controlled by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Until now processes of P-gp gene up-regulation and resistant cell selection were considered sufficient to explain the emergence of MDR phenotype within a cell population. Recently, however, ""non-genetic"" acquisitions of MDR by cell-to-cell P-gp transfers have been pointed out. In the present study we show that intercellular transfers of functional P-gp occur by two different but complementary modalities through donor-recipient cells interactions in the absence of drug selection pressure. P-glycoprotein and drug efflux activity transfers were followed over 7 days by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in drug-sensitive parental MCF-7 breast cancer cells co-cultured with P-gp overexpressing resistant variants. An early process of remote transfer was established based on the release and binding of P-gp-containing microparticles. Microparticle-mediated transfers were detected after only 4 h of incubation. We also identify an alternative mode of transfer by contact, consisting of cell-to-cell P-gp trafficking by tunneling nanotubes bridging neighboring cells. Our findings supply new mechanistic evidences for the extragenetic emergence of MDR in cancer cells and indicate that new treatment strategies designed to overcome MDR may include inhibition of both microparticles and Tunneling nanotube-mediated intercellular P-gp transfers."
https://openalex.org/W2134567651,"Undernutrition during pregnancy is implicated in the programming of offspring for the development of obesity and diabetes. We hypothesized that maternal programming causes epigenetic changes in fetal hypothalamic pathways regulating metabolism. This study used sheep to examine the effect of moderate maternal undernutrition (60 d before to 30 d after mating) and twinning to investigate changes in the key metabolic regulators proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in fetal hypothalami. Methylation of the fetal hypothalamic POMC promoter was reduced in underfed singleton, fed twin, and underfed twin groups (60, 73, and 63% decrease, respectively). This was associated with reduced DNA methyltransferase activity and altered histone methylation and acetylation. Methylation of the hypothalamic GR promoter was decreased in both twin groups and in maternally underfed singleton fetuses (52, 65, and 55% decrease, respectively). This correlated with changes in histone methylation and acetylation and increased GR mRNA expression in the maternally underfed singleton group. Alterations in GR were hypothalamic specific, with no changes in hippocampi. Unaltered levels of OCT4 promoter methylation indicated gene-specific effects. In conclusion, twinning and periconceptional undernutrition are associated with epigenetic changes in fetal hypothalamic POMC and GR genes, potentially resulting in altered energy balance regulation in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2045197807,"Lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE), cause endothelial activation, and they increase the adhesion of the endothelium to circulating leukocytes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. We observed that in HNE-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, some of the protein-HNE adducts colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that HNE forms covalent adducts with several ER chaperones that assist in protein folding. We also found that at concentrations that did not induce apoptosis or necrosis, HNE activated the unfolded protein response, leading to an increase in XBP-1 splicing, phosphorylation of protein kinase-like ER kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, and the induction of ATF3 and ATF4. This increase in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α phosphorylation was prevented by transfection with protein kinase-like ER kinase siRNA. Treatment with HNE increased the expression of the ER chaperones, GRP78 and HERP. Exposure to HNE led to a depletion of reduced glutathione and an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, glutathione depletion and ROS production by tert-butyl-hydroperoxide did not trigger the unfolded protein response. Pretreatment with a chemical chaperone, phenylbutyric acid, or adenoviral transfection with ATF6 attenuated HNE-induced monocyte adhesion and IL-8 induction. Moreover, phenylbutyric acid and taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid attenuated HNE-induced leukocyte rolling and their firm adhesion to the endothelium in rat cremaster muscle. These data suggest that endothelial activation by HNE is mediated in part by ER stress, induced by mechanisms independent of ROS production or glutathione depletion. The induction of ER stress may be a significant cause of vascular inflammation induced by products of oxidized lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2093226550,"The structural integrity of mitochondrial cristae is crucial for mitochondrial functions; however, the molecular events controlling the structural integrity and biogenesis of mitochondrial cristae remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel mitochondrial protein named CHCM1 (coiled coil helix cristae morphology 1)/CHCHD6. CHCM1/CHCHD6 harbors a coiled coil helix-coiled coil helix domain at its C-terminal end and predominantly localizes to mitochondrial inner membrane. CHCM1/CHCHD6 knockdown causes severe defects in mitochondrial cristae morphology. The mitochondrial cristae in CHCM1/CHCHD6-deficient cells become hollow with loss of structural definitions and reduction in electron-dense matrix. CHCM1/CHCHD6 depletion also leads to reductions in cell growth, ATP production, and oxygen consumption. CHCM1/CHCHD6 through its C-terminal end strongly and directly interacts with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin, which is known to also control mitochondrial cristae morphology. CHCM1/CHCHD6 also interacts with other mitofilin-associated proteins, including DISC1 and CHCHD3. Knockdown of CHCM1/CHCHD6 reduces mitofilin protein levels; conversely, mitofilin knockdown leads to reduction in CHCM1 levels, suggesting coordinate regulation between these proteins. Our results further indicate that genotoxic anticancer drugs that induce DNA damage down-regulate CHCM1/CHCHD6 expression in multiple human cancer cells, whereas mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors do not affect CHCM1/CHCHD6 levels. CHCM1/CHCHD6 knockdown in human cancer cells enhances chemosensitivity to genotoxic anticancer drugs, whereas its overexpression increases resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that CHCM1/CHCHD6 is linked to regulation of mitochondrial cristae morphology, cell growth, ATP production, and oxygen consumption and highlight its potential as a possible target for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2092730586,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles is the largest neurogenic niche of the postnatal brain. New SVZ-generated neurons migrate via the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB) where they functionally integrate into preexisting neuronal circuits. Nonsynaptic GABA signaling was previously shown to inhibit SVZ-derived neurogenesis. Here we identify the endogenous protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) as a positive modulator of SVZ postnatal neurogenesis by regulating GABA activity in transit-amplifying cells. We performed DBI loss- and gain-of-function experiments in vivo at the peak of postnatal OB neuron generation in mice and demonstrate that DBI enhances proliferation by preventing SVZ progenitors to exit the cell cycle. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DBI exerts its effect on SVZ progenitors via its octadecaneuropeptide proteolytic product (ODN) by inhibiting GABA-induced currents. Together our data reveal a regulatory mechanism by which DBI counteracts the inhibitory effect of nonsynaptic GABA signaling on subventricular neuronal proliferation."

We delivered low-intensity PMFs to the posterior cranium of awake, unrestrained mice (wild-type and ephrin-A2A5 -/-) that have disorganized retinocollicular circuitry and associated visuomotor deficits. Control groups of each genotype received sham stimulation. Following daily stimulation for 14 d, we measured biochemical, structural (anterograde tracing), and functional (electrophysiology and behavior) changes in the retinocollicular projection. PMFs induced BDNF, GABA, and nNOS expression in the superior colliculus and retina of wild-type and ephrin-A2A5-/- mice. Furthermore, in ephrin-A2A5-/-mice, PMFs corrected abnormal neuronal responses and selectively removed inaccurate ectopic axon terminals to improve structural and functional organization of their retinocollicular projection and restore normal visual tracking behavior. In contrast, PMFs did not alter the structure or function of the normal projection in wild-type mice. Sham PMF stimulation had no effect on any mice.

https://openalex.org/W2110487761,"Hyperphosphatasia mental retardation syndrome (HPMR), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by mental retardation and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, is caused by mutations in the coding region of the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class V (PIGV) gene, the product of which is a mannosyltransferase essential for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. Mutations found in four families caused amino acid substitutions A341E, A341V, Q256K, and H385P, which drastically decreased expression of the PIGV protein. Hyperphosphatasia resulted from secretion of ALP, a GPI-anchored protein normally expressed on the cell surface, into serum due to PIGV deficiency. In contrast, a previously reported PIGM deficiency, in which there is a defect in the transfer of the first mannose, does not result in hyperphosphatasia. To provide insights into the mechanism of ALP secretion in HPMR patients, we took advantage of CHO cell mutants that are defective in various steps of GPI biosynthesis. Secretion of ALP requires GPI transamidase, which in normal cells, cleaves the C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide and replaces it with GPI. The GPI-anchored protein was secreted substantially into medium from PIGV-, PIGB-, and PIGF-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete GPI bearing mannose was accumulated. In contrast, ALP was degraded in PIGL-, DPM2-, or PIGX-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete shorter GPIs that lacked mannose were accumulated. Our results suggest that GPI transamidase recognizes incomplete GPI bearing mannose and cleaves a hydrophobic signal peptide, resulting in secretion of soluble ALP. These results explain the molecular mechanism of hyperphosphatasia in HPMR."

As anticipated, SFT adopts fully helical conformation stabilized by the multiple engineered salt bridges. The designing of SFT also provide novel inter-helical salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that improve the affinity of SFT to NHR trimer. The extra serine residue and acetyl group stabilize α-helicity of the N-terminal portion of SFT, whereas Thr-119 serves to stabilize the hydrophobic NHR pocket.

Histological and biochemical examinations of ethanol-exposed mice indicated that the Cyp2e1-null mice were more resistant to ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and transaminase leakage than the wild-type mice, suggesting CYP2E1 contributes to ethanol-induced toxicity. Metabolomic analysis of urinary metabolites revealed time- and dose-dependent changes in the chemical composition of urine. Along with ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate, N-acetyltaurine (NAT) was identified as a urinary metabolite that is highly responsive to ethanol exposure and is correlated with the presence of CYP2E1. Subsequent stable isotope labeling analysis using deuterated ethanol determined that NAT is a novel metabolite of ethanol. Among three possible substrates of NAT biosynthesis (taurine, acetyl-CoA, and acetate), the level of taurine was significantly reduced, whereas the levels of acetyl-CoA and acetate were dramatically increased after ethanol exposure. In vitro incubation assays suggested that acetate is the main precursor of NAT, which was further confirmed by the stable isotope labeling analysis using deuterated acetate. The incubations of tissues and cellular fractions with taurine and acetate indicated that the kidney has the highest NAT synthase activity among the tested organs, whereas the cytosol is the main site of NAT biosynthesis inside the cell. Overall, the combination of biochemical and metabolomic analysis revealed NAT is a novel metabolite of ethanol and a potential biomarker of hyperacetatemia."

In this study, we reappraised the transport function of different Buchnera strains, from the aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum, Schizaphis graminum, Baizongia pistaciae and Cinara cedri, using the re-annotation of their transmembrane proteins coupled with an exploration of their metabolic networks. Although metabolic analyses revealed high interdependencies between the host and the bacteria, we demonstrate here that transport in Buchnera is assured by low transporter diversity, when compared to free-living bacteria, being mostly based on a few general transporters, some of which probably have lost their substrate specificity. Moreover, in the four strains studied, an astonishing lack of inner-membrane importers was observed. In Buchnera, the transport function has been shaped by the distinct selective constraints occurring in the Aphididae lineages. Buchnera from A. pisum and S. graminum have a three-membraned system and similar sets of transporters corresponding to most compound classes. Transmission electronic microscopic observations and confocal microscopic analysis of intracellular pH fields revealed that Buchnera does not show any of the typical structures and properties observed in integrated organelles. Buchnera from B. pistaciae seem to possess a unique double membrane system and has, accordingly, lost all of its outer-membrane integral proteins. Lastly, Buchnera from C. cedri revealed an extremely poor repertoire of transporters, with almost no ATP-driven active transport left, despite the clear persistence of the ancestral three-membraned system."
https://openalex.org/W1965306494,"We proposed previously that closure of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane after ethanol exposure leads to suppression of mitochondrial metabolite exchange. Because ureagenesis requires extensive mitochondrial metabolite exchange, we characterized the effect of ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde (AcAld), on total and ureagenic respiration in cultured rat hepatocytes. Ureagenic substrates increased cellular respiration from 15.8 ± 0.9 nmol O2/min/106 cells (base line) to 29.4 ± 1.7 nmol O2/min/106 cells in about 30 min. Ethanol (0–200 mm) suppressed extra respiration after ureagenic substrates (ureagenic respiration) by up to 51% but not base line respiration. Urea formation also declined proportionately. Inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 2E1, and catalase with 4-methylpyrazole, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, and 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole restored ethanol-suppressed ureagenic respiration by 46, 37, and 66%, respectively. By contrast, inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase with phenethyl isothiocyanate increased the inhibitory effect of ethanol on ureagenic respiration by an additional 60%. AcAld, an intermediate product of ethanol oxidation, suppressed ureagenic respiration with an apparent IC50 of 125 μm. AcAld also inhibited entry of 3-kDa rhodamine-conjugated dextran in the mitochondrial intermembrane space of digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes, indicative of VDAC closure. In conclusion, AcAld, derived from ethanol metabolism, suppresses ureagenesis in hepatocytes mediated by closure of VDAC.

In conclusion, AcAld, derived from ethanol metabolism, suppresses ureagenesis in hepatocytes mediated by closure of VDAC. Balanced and coordinated functioning of hepatocytes depends on optimized exchange of metabolites between mitochondria and the cytosol, in particular the continuous exchange of hydrophilic metabolites like ATP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, and respiratory substrates. To enter the mitochondrial matrix, where most mitochondrial metabolism occurs, all metabolites must cross two separate barriers: the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) 4The abbreviations used are: MOMmitochondrial outer membraneMIMmitochondrial inner membraneVDACvoltage dependent anion channelAcAldacetaldehydeKRHKrebs-Ringer-HEPES bufferRhDexrhodamine-conjugated dextranMTGMitoTracker Green FMICBintracellular bufferDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidIMSintermembrane spaceMP4-methylpyrazoleADHalcohol dehydrogenaseDCEtrans-1,2-dichloroethyleneMPTmitochondrial permeability transitionALDHaldehyde dehydrogenaseRhDex3-kDa rhodamine-conjugated dextran. and mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM).

Diverse functions of a “waste” product.Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1998; 25: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The compartmental separation of reactions of the urea cycle requires exchange of ornithine and citrulline, major substrates of the urea cycle, between the mitochondria and cytosol. In addition, ureagenesis is a highly energy-demanding process that requires hydrolysis of four equivalents of ATP (two each in the matrix and cytosol) per mol of urea formed (29.Lanpher B. Brunetti-Pierri N. Lee B. Inborn errors of metabolism. The flux from Mendelian to complex diseases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Overall, ureagenesis requires continuous exchange of hydrophilic metabolites between the cytosol and mitochondria, all of which must go through the VDAC. Thus, if the VDAC were to adopt a more closed state, ureagenesis would likely be one of the first metabolic processes affected. AcAld, the toxic intermediate of ethanol metabolism, is a small neutral compound that does not require carriers or channels to cross mitochondrial membranes and enter the matrix from the cytosol. We proposed recently that the VDAC closes in response to ethanol (6.Lemasters J.J. Holmuhamedov E. Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) as mitochondrial governator. Thinking outside the box.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 9.Holmuhamedov E. Lemasters J.J.

Biophys. 2009; 481: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10.Deleted in proof,Google Scholar, 31.Deleted in proof,Google Scholar). VDAC closure suppresses oxidation of respiratory substrates competing with AcAld to promote selective and more rapid AcAld oxidation. Here, we demonstrate that ethanol dose-dependently suppresses ureagenesis in cultured rat hepatocytes and that AcAld mediates this inhibitory effect apparently by closing the VDAC and decreasing MOM permeability. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with recommendations published in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Academic Press, Washington, DC, 1996 (32.Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Institute of Laboratory Research, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.

Hepatocytes were isolated from 200- to 250-g overnight-fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) by collagenase perfusion as described previously (33.Qian T.

Translocation of iron from lysosomes into mitochondria is a key event during oxidative stress-induced hepatocellular injury.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were resuspended in Waymouth's MB-752/1 growth medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm insulin (Squibb-Novo, Princeton, NJ), 100 nm dexamethasone (LyphoMed, Rosemont, IL), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Viability of cells was typically greater than 90% as determined using a Cellometer Vision cell counter (Nexcelcom Biosciences, Lawrence, MA). The rate of oxygen consumption (respiration) was measured in hepatocytes plated on Seahorse 24-well V7 plates (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA). Prior to plating cells, wells were coated (20 μl/well) with 0.1% type-1 rat tail collagen dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid (Sigma). After drying, wells were rinsed once with 0.5 ml of warm Waymouth's medium. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of isolated hepatocyte suspension were transferred to each well (3 × 104 cells/well at a density of 105 cells/cm2) and allowed to attach for 2 h in humidified 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Subsequently, the wells were supplemented with 0.4 ml of warm complete growth medium, and the hepatocytes were incubated for 16–18 h in humidified 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Rates of oxygen consumption (respiration) were measured in a Seahorse Bioscience XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer using 24-well plate sensor cartridges. The parameters of the measurement cycle were adjusted to avoid anoxia and were set as followings: Mix (4 min, during which the sensor plate moved up and down to equilibrate oxygen), Wait (30 s, during which oxygen sensors descended into wells to form 7-μl measurement chambers above the plated hepatocytes), and Measure (1 min, 10 measurements of oxygen concentration to calculate respiratory rates) (35.Gerencser A.A. Neilson A. Choi S.W. Edman U. Yadava N. Oh R.J. Ferrick D.A. Nicholls D.G. Brand M.D. Quantitative microplate-based respirometry with correction for oxygen diffusion.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 6868-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Respiratory rates were calculated using Seahorse XF-24 software and the Direct ACOS fast algorithm with continuous averaging, as described (35.Gerencser A.A. Neilson A. Choi S.W. Edman U. Yadava N. Oh R.J. Ferrick D.A. Nicholls D.G. Brand M.D. Quantitative microplate-based respirometry with correction for oxygen diffusion.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 6868-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). All incubations and measurements were done at 37 °C. Prior to measurement, hepatocytes were rinsed three times with 0.45 ml of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRH) containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, with KOH) and supplemented with 27 mm NaHCO3 (KRH-NaHCO3). Hepatocytes were incubated for 30 min in a cell culture incubator in 5% CO2/air before transferring to a Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer. Injection ports were filled with 50 μl of KRH-NaHCO3 supplemented with ureagenic substrates with or without ethanol or AcAld (port A) and inhibitors (port B) as specified. Respiratory rates were expressed as μmol O2/min/106 cells or as percentage of base line. Oxygen consumed by hepatocytes during ureagenesis was determined by an area-under-the-curve calculation with subtraction of oxygen consumed in the absence of ureagenic substrates (base-line respiration). Urea in dried aliquots of incubation medium was determined using a QuantiChrom urea assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bioassay System, Hayward CA). Aliquots of incubation medium were placed in airtight vials, and AcAld was measured by ALDH enzymatic assay in reaction buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.05 units/ml ALDH (pH 8.0), 37 °C. After 60 min, NADH produced stoichiometrically by ALDH-dependent oxidation of AcAld was measured spectrophotometrically using an NADH extinction coefficient 6.2 × 103 m/cm (36.Maughan R.J. A simple, rapid method for the determination of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate on a single 20-mul blood sample.Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 122: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Uptake and retention of 3 kDa fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran molecules (RhDex) by mitochondria of permeabilized cultured hepatocytes was monitored using confocal microscopy, as described (9.Holmuhamedov E. Lemasters J.J. Ethanol exposure decreases mitochondrial outer membrane permeability in cultured rat hepatocytes.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 481: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Hepatocytes cultured on glass-bottomed MatTek dishes (3 × 105 cells per dish) were incubated with 500 nm of MTG in Waymouth's media for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air to label mitochondria. The MTG-labeled hepatocytes were then placed on the stage of a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) inside of a temperature-controlled environmental chamber (37 °C). After 2 min, buffer was removed and replaced with intracellular buffer (ICB) 120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10% dextran 100 kDa, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.35), with protease inhibitors (pepstatin, antipain, leupeptin; 1 μg/ml each), oligomycin (5 μg/ml), rotenone (10 μm), and succinate (5 mm) plus digitonin (10 μm) to permeabilize the plasma membrane. After another 2 min, cells were washed once with 2 ml of ICB lacking digitonin and further incubated in 2 ml of ICB containing 3-kDa RhDex (400 μm). After 5 min, ICB/RhDex buffer was replaced with 2 ml of identical buffer supplemented with 4, 4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, 300 μm), a blocker of VDAC. After another 5 min, ICB/RhDex/DIDS was removed, and cells were washed once with 2 ml of ICB/DIDS without RhDex. Images of hepatocytes were then collected after 5 min. In this protocol, RhDex entered the IMS of digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes and was subsequently “locked in” by DIDS. Confocal images of green-fluorescing MTG and red-fluorescing RhDex were collected at each step and analyzed with ImageJ 1.43u using a customized macro algorithm. Briefly, the macro used green MTG fluorescence of mitochondria to create a “mask,” which then was used to measure the intensity of red RhDex fluorescence only in areas inside mitochondria, a procedure excluding cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence outside the mask. Mean intensity of red RhDex fluorescence in MTG-labeled mitochondrial regions was taken as a measure of RhDex content in mitochondria. DIDS, MTG, and 3-kDa RhDex were obtained from Invitrogen; 100% pure digitonin (molecular weight 1229.3) from Calbiochem; BSA (fraction IV), collagen (type I), dextran (100 kDa), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, NAD+, and other analytical grade chemicals from Sigma; HEPES and collagenase D from Roche Applied Science Biochemicals; Waymouth's medium MB-252/1 from Invitrogen; insulin from Squibb-Novo; and dexamethasone sodium phosphate from LyphoMed. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Images shown are representative of three or more experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test or analysis of variance using p < 0.05 as the criterion of significance. Respiration by cultured rat hepatocytes was measured in a Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer and averaged 15.8 ± 0.9 nmol O2/min/106 cells under basal conditions (Fig. 1A). After addition of ureagenic substrates (3 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm L-ornithine, and 5 mm L-lactate), respiration of cells increased to 29.4 ± 1.7 nmol O2/min/106 cells within about 30 min (Fig. 1A). Ureagenic respiration of hepatocytes, defined as the difference between total respiration after addition of ureagenic substrates and basal respiration, increased to 13.6 ± 0.5 nmol O2/min/106 cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate the effect of ethanol on ureagenic respiration, ethanol was added simultaneously with ureagenic substrates. Under these conditions, ethanol dose-dependently suppressed ureagenic respiration (Fig. 1A), and 200 mm ethanol decreased ureagenic respiration to 6.6 ± 1.3 nmol O2/min/106 cells (B). Ethanol added to cultured hepatocytes in the absence of ureagenic substrates had no effect on basal respiration (data not shown). We also measured urea formation during measurements of respiration. In the absence of ureagenic substrates, urea formation was below the limits of detection (< 0.2 nmol urea/106 cells). After addition of ureagenic substrates, urea formation increased to 9.9 ± 1.4 nmol urea/106 cells (Fig. 2A). In these experiments, the total amount of ureagenic respiration averaged 12.1 ± 2.5 nmol O2/106 so that the stoichiometry of urea formed to oxygen atoms consumed was 0.4, which is equivalent to an ATP/O ratio of 1.6, assuming four ATP consumed for each urea formed. Suppression of ureagenic respiration by ethanol led to a proportional inhibition of urea formation so that the ratio of urea formation to ureagenic respiration remained more or less constant (Fig. 2B). Thus, ethanol suppressed both ureagenic respiration and urea formation but did not alter the energetic efficiency of ureagenesis. To assess the role of ethanol metabolism via ADH in ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration, hepatocytes were pretreated before ethanol addition with 4-methylpyrazole (MP, 1 mm), an ADH inhibitor (37.Ronis M.J. Korourian S. Blackburn M.L. Badeaux J. Badger T.M. The role of ethanol metabolism in development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in the rat.Alcohol. 2010; 44: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the absence of ethanol, MP did not alter ureagenic respiration (Fig. 3A, Saline). In contrast, when hepatocytes were subsequently treated with ethanol (100 mm), MP partially protected against ethanol-mediated suppression of ureagenic respiration and attenuated suppression by 46% after 100 mm ethanol (Fig. 3A, Ethanol). To assess the importance of ethanol metabolism via CYP450 2E1 in ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration, hepatocytes were pretreated with trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE, 5 mm), a CYP450 2E1 inhibitor (38.Mathews J.M. Etheridge A.S. Raymer J.H. Black S.R. Pulliam Jr., D.W. Bucher J.R. Selective inhibition of cytochrome P450 2E1 in vivo in vitro with trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), before ethanol addition. DCE did not affect ureagenic respiration in the absence of ethanol (Fig. 3B, Saline). In contrast, after subsequent ethanol addition, DCE partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of 100 mm ethanol on ureagenic respiration and attenuated ethanol-induced suppression by 37% (Fig. 3B, Ethanol). To assess the role of catalase in ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration, hepatocytes were pretreated with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT, 5 mm), a catalase inhibitor (39.Smith P.S. Zhao W. Spitz D.R. Robbins M.E. Inhibiting catalase activity sensitizes 36B10 rat glioma cells to oxidative stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in the absence of ethanol. Like MP and DCE, AT had no effect on ureagenic respiration in the absence of ethanol (Fig. 3C, Saline). Also like MP and DCE, AT partially reversed the inhibitory effect of 100 mm ethanol and attenuated ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration by 66% (Fig. 3C, Ethanol). AcAld, the product of the first step of ethanol oxidation, is further metabolized to acetate predominantly by mitochondrial ALDH2. Our finding that inhibitors of ADH, CYP450 2E1, and catalase abrogated, at least in part, ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration suggested that AcAld might be mediating ureagenic inhibition. Accordingly, we assessed the effect of phenethyl isothiocyanate (10 μm), an inhibitor of ALDH (23.Lindros K.O. Badger T. Ronis M. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Koivusalo M. Phenethyl isothiocyanate, a new dietary liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 79-83PubMed Google Scholar), on ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration. In the absence of ethanol, phenethyl isothiocyanate did not inhibit ureagenic respiration (Fig. 4, Saline), but in the presence of subsequently added ethanol, phenethyl isothiocyanate enhanced inhibition of ureagenic respiration by 47% (Ethanol). Abrogation of ethanol-induced suppression of ureagenic respiration by ADH, CYP450 2E1, and catalase inhibition and enhancement by ALDH inhibition supports the conclusion that AcAld produced during ethanol oxidation mediates suppression of ureagenic respiration. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of directly added AcAld on ureagenic respiration. Because of the high volatility of AcAld, we layered mineral oil (250 μl) over the incubation medium in the Seahorse plates to minimize evaporation of AcAld. Mineral oil did not interfere with measurements of oxygen consumption (data not shown) but substantially decreased the rate of loss of AcAld from > 90% in open wells after 60 min to 40–45% in wells covered with mineral oil (Fig. 5, compare Open with Mineral Oil). The effect of added AcAld on ureagenic respiration was then evaluated using the same protocol as for ethanol, except that the incubation medium bathing hepatocytes in each well of Seahorse plate was covered with 250 μl of mineral oil. In these measurements, AcAld caused dose-dependent inhibition of ureagenic respiration (Fig. 6, A and B). The Ki for inhibition of ureagenic respiration was 125"

We previously reported that the scaffolding protein RanBP9 is markedly increased in AD brains and promotes Aβ generation by scaffolding APP/BACE1/LRP complexes together and accelerating APP endocytosis. Because APP, LRP, and RanBP9 all physically interact with β-integrins, we investigated whether RanBP9 alters integrin-dependent cell adhesion and focal adhesion signaling. Here, we show that RanBP9 overexpression dramatically disrupts integrindependent∗∗∗ cell attachment and spreading in NIH3T3 and hippocampus-derived HT22 cells, concomitant with strongly decreased Pyk2/paxillin signaling and talin/vinculin localization in focal adhesion complexes. Conversely, RanBP9 knockdown robustly promotes cell attachment, spreading, and focal adhesion signaling and assembly. Cell surface biotinylation and endocytosis assays reveal that RanBP9 overexpression and RanBP9 siRNA potently reduces and increases surface β1-integrin and LRP by accelerating and inhibiting their endocytosis, respectively. Primary hippocampal neurons derived from RanBP9-transgenic mice also demonstrate severely reduced levels of surface β1-integrin, LRP, and APP, as well as neurite arborization. Therefore, these data indicate that RanBP9 simultaneously inhibits cell-adhesive processes and enhances Aβ generation by accelerating APP, LRP, and β1-integrin endocytosis.—Woo, J.

https://openalex.org/W2096086492,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved cellular machinery responsible for delivering membrane and secretory proteins to the proper cellular destination. The precise mechanism by which fidelity is achieved by the SRP pathway within the in vivo environment is yet to be understood. Previous studies have focused on the SRP pathway in isolation. Here we describe another important factor that modulates substrate selection by the SRP pathway: the ongoing synthesis of the nascent polypeptide chain by the ribosome. A slower translation elongation rate rescues the targeting defect of substrate proteins bearing mutant, suboptimal signal sequences both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with a kinetic origin of this effect, similar rescue of protein targeting was also observed with mutant SRP receptors or SRP RNAs that specifically compromise the kinetics of SRP-receptor interaction during protein targeting. These data are consistent with a model in which ongoing protein translation is in constant kinetic competition with the targeting of the nascent proteins by the SRP and provides an important factor to regulate the fidelity of substrate selection by the SRP."
https://openalex.org/W2107806293,"Apoptosis is a stochastic, physiological form of cell death that is characterized by unique morphological and biochemical properties. A defining feature of apoptosis in all cells is the apoptotic volume decrease or AVD, which has been considered a passive component of the cell death process.

We utilized this property to explore potential regulatory roles of a RVI response in apoptosis.

Multiple rounds of osmotic stress followed by recovery of cells in normal media resulted in the development of a population of cells that were resistant to osmotic stress induced apoptosis. These cells were also resistant to other apoptotic stimuli that activate via the intrinsic cell death pathway, while remaining sensitive to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. Interestingly, these osmotic stress resistant cells showed no increase in anti-apoptotic proteins, and released cytochrome c from their mitochondria following exposure to intrinsic apoptotic stimuli. The osmotic stress resistant cells developed a RVI response, and inhibition of the RVI restored sensitivity to apoptotic agents.

These results define a critical role of volume regulation mechanisms in apoptotic resistance. The loss of cell volume, or cell shrinkage, is a defining characteristic of apoptosis from the initial description of this physiological mode of cell death (1.Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics.Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). A unique aspect of this apoptotic loss of cell volume is that it occurs within an isotonic environment, which is in stark contrast to cell volume alterations that result from osmotic changes in the extracellular environment. The term apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) 2The abbreviations used are: AVDapoptotic volume decreaseRVIregulatory volume increaseMCVmean cell volumePIpropidium iodideHICChypertonicity-induced cation channelEVelectronic volumeFFAflufenamic acid. has been used to denote this unique characteristic of apoptosis (2.Maeno E.

Resistance to apoptosis has been shown to occur through a variety of mechanisms including increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, along with alterations in other critical apoptotic proteins such as death receptors, caspases, and kinases (11.Hersey P.

Mammalian cells also have other inherent regulatory mechanisms to protect themselves from adverse extracellular conditions and to preserve cell viability (13.Hoffmann E.K. Lambert I.H. Pedersen S.F. Physiology of cell volume regulation in vertebrates.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 193-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The cell volume regulatory mechanisms consisting initially of ionic transporters, channels, and exchangers are activated upon a loss of cell volume to re-establish a near normal cell size, however the role of these proteins in regards to apoptotic resistance is unclear. Our studies take advantage of the fact that T-cells do not have an active inherent regulatory volume increase (RVI) response (14.Roti Roti L.W. Rothstein A.

We employed osmotic stress to physically induced cell shrinkage in a murine immature T-cell line, S49 (devoid of an inherent RVI response). This stressor induced a very rapid and synchronous caspase-dependent apoptosis of the cells. Exposure of the cells to multiple rounds of osmotic stress and recovery resulted in a unique population of cells that were resistant to a variety of intrinsic apoptotic stimuli, while remaining sensitive to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. Interestingly, these osmotic stress-resistant cells gained an inherent RVI response, inhibition of which sensitizes the cells to intrinsic apoptosis. Our work shows that volume regulation mechanisms contribute significantly to apoptotic resistance. S49 Neo cells are S49.1 mouse lymphoma cells stably infected with a recombinant amphotropic retrovirus carrying a G418 antibiotic resistance gene (3.Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Absence of volume regulatory mechanisms contributes to the rapid activation of apoptosis in thymocytes.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (hi-FCS), 4.8 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Standard RPMI 1640 was made hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic by the addition of solid mannitol or diluting with distilled water, respectively, prior to the addition of the supplemental components. All media was examined for maintaining isotonicity using a 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT). The irreversible caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and Fas ligand were purchased through Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA). Dexamethasone was purchased through Steraloids (Wilton, NH), staurosporine and AKT inhibitor VIII through Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and thapsigargin, flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, sodium salicylate, 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)-amiloride (MIA), and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) was purchased through Sigma. Cell volume was determined via electronic sizing using a Cell Lab Quanta flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) equipped with a 488 nm laser. The electronic volume (EV) channel was calibrated using 6 μm 488 nm excitable AlignFlow beads (Molecular Probes). Cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were centrifuged and resuspended in normal or anisotonic RPMI 1640 media and examined as described in the results. An electronic volume gate was used to eliminate cell debris and to exclude portions of cells (apoptotic bodies) that may be formed and released during the apoptosis. The percent change in mean cell volume (MCV) was determined by subtracting the anisotonic value from the normal control value (×100) for each individual time point. Caspase activity for caspase-3/7-like enzymes was accomplished using a CaspaTag in situ assay kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 h prior to cytometric analysis, 300 μl of cells were added to 10 μl of a 30× CaspaTag reagent working stock. Immediately prior to cytometric analysis, the cells were washed in 2 ml of CaspaTag wash buffer, and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. 2 μl of propidium iodide (PI; supplied in the kit) was added to each sample, and the cells were examined using a Becton Dickinson FACSort equipped with CellQuest software. For each sample, 10,000 cells were excited with a 488 nm laser and examined at 530 nm and 585 nm for CaspaTag and PI fluorescence, respectively. Analysis of DNA was accomplished using an ethanol fixation/propidium iodide protocol. Cells were harvested from the culture media and fixed by the slow addition of ∼3 ml of cold 70% ethanol with agitation. The volume was adjusted to 5 ml with cold 70% ethanol and the cells stored at −20 °C for up to 1 week. Fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation from the ethanol, washed once in 1× PBS, and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase in 1× PBS. Stained cells were examined on a FACSort flow cytometer using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Individual cells (7500 per experimental sample) were selected by gating on an area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and aggregates. The percent of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of cells under each experimental condition. Analysis of intracellular sodium and potassium by flow cytometry was accomplished as described previously (16.Bortner C.D. Sifre M.I. Cidlowski J.A. Cationic gradient reversal and cytoskeleton-independent volume regulatory pathways define an early stage of apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7219-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of 2.5 mm CoroNa Green-AM (Na+) or PBFI-AM (K+) (Molecular Probes) stock were added to 1 ml of cells for a final concentration of 5 μm 1 h prior to the time of examination. For intracellular calcium measurements, 1 μl of a 1 mm Fluo-3 (Ca2) (Molecular Probes) stock was added to 1 ml of cells for a final concentration of 1 μm 30 min prior to the time of examination. Incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately prior to flow cytometric examination, PI (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing PBFI-AM (350 nm ex; 425 nm em), CoroNa Green-AM and Fluo-3-AM (488 nm ex; 530 nm em), and PI (488 nm ex; 575 nm em) using a LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and FACSDiVa software. Only cells that did not lose their membrane integrity (PI-negative cells) were included in the analysis for relative intracellular ion concentrations. For atomic absorption studies, two million cells per sample were initially treated under control or hyperosmotic stress for 150 min, a time prior to a major loss of membrane integrity. Cells were harvested and washed twice in ice-cold isotonic (for control cells) or hypertonic (for hyperosmotic cells) magnesium chloride. Samples were then resuspended in 200 μl of a 30% nitric acid solution and incubated overnight at 37 °C under constant agitation. Protein was measured using a Bio-Rad assay. Analysis of the potassium and sodium content was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AA800 flame spectrophotometer. A five-point potassium or sodium standard calibration protocol of known standards was used to optimize the instrument. Samples were diluted 1:250 or 1:25 for potassium and sodium, respectively and measured in triplicate. The spectrophotmeter and protein values were used to calculate the micromolar of ion per mg protein for each sample. S49 (Neo) cells were exposed to RPMI 1640 media containing 500 mm mannitol for 4 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. After this time, the cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, then returned to normal RPMI 1640 media, and incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Over a period of 7–10 days of culture, the surviving cells regenerated to a viable population of cells in the presence of normal RPMI 1640 media. This protocol was repeated to generate cells that were repetitively exposed to 500 mm mannitol for 4 h then recovered for multiple generations. S49 (Neo) or S49 (OS4–15) cells (5 × 106) were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini protease mixture, Roche, IN) by repeated pipetting. The cells were sonicated for 10 s on ice. Samples of each lysate were assayed in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer for protein concentration using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad). Laemmli-loading buffer containing glycerol, SDS, and bromphenol blue was added to each sample at a 1:1 ratio and then boiled for 5 min. The samples were stored at −80 °C until electrophoresis and Western blot analysis for apoptosis associated proteins. Western blotting: whole cell lysates were separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS-0.5% TWEEN-20 (TBS-T) containing 10% nonfat milk for 2 h at room temperature, washed with TBS-T and incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-bcl-2, anti-bcl-XL, anti-bax, anti-bim, anti-caspase 8, anti-caspase 9, anti-caspase 3, and the various kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling), or anti-survivin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). The antibody for AKT recognizes both isoforms of phospho-AKT, but is more selective for AKT1. The next day the blots were washed, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using ECL reagents (GE-Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The blots were then washed with TBS-T reprobed with anti-β actin (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the above protocol except for using anti-mouse secondary antibody. Protein bands were quantitated densitometrically using NIH Image J analysis software and protein levels were normalized to β-actin signal. Average protein levels of at least three experiments were plotted as bar graphs ± S.E. Statistical significance (difference from untreated controls) was determined by Student's t test. Cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins were prepared from S49 (Neo) or S49 (OS4–15) cells by using a cytosolic/mitochondrial subcellular fractionation kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, 5 × 107 cells for each sample were washed with cold PBS, resuspended in cytosol extraction buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were then lysed using a dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step is the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in mitochondrial extraction buffer, vortexed on high for 10 s to generate the mitochondrial fraction. Protein concentration of each fraction was measured as stated previously. Western blotting analysis was also carried out as described previous except the primary antibody used was anti-cytochrome c (BD-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). Purity of fractionation was determined by reprobing with anti-VDAC (Biovision, Mountain View, CA), a mitochondrial protein and equal protein loading was determined by reprobing with anti-β-actin (Millipore, Billerica, MA). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used to evaluate the statistical relevance of control and experimental samples. A p value of at least <0.05 was considered significant. Most mammalian cells have a high permeability to water where an osmotic alteration in their extracellular environment results in a rapid change in cell size. S49 (Neo) cells when challenged with media containing an additional 250 or 500 mm mannitol show a very rapid decrease in cell size (Fig. 1A). The decrease in mean cell volume of 29 and 37% under 250 or 500 mm osmotic stress respectively, was strikingly similar to the initial changes in cell size that occurs during a primary stage of apoptosis (16.Bortner C.D. Sifre M.I. Cidlowski J.A. Cationic gradient reversal and cytoskeleton-independent volume regulatory pathways define an early stage of apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7219-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When exposed to hyperosmotic stress and examined over time, S49 (Neo) cells shrank and remained shrunken throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 1B), reflecting a lack of a RVI as previously observed in other T-cells (17.Grinstein S. Clarke C.A. Rothstein A. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange in lymphocytes by osmotically induced volume changes and by cytoplasmic acidification.J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 619-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18.Grinstein S. Rothstein A. Sarkadi B. Gelfand E.W. Responses of lymphocytes to anisotonic media: volume-regulating behavior.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C204-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when S49 (Neo) cells where exposed to hypoosmotic stress, they swelled and returned to a near normal cell volume within 60 min (Fig. 1B), reflecting an inherent regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response known to occur in most cells. Hyperosmotic stress of lymphoid cells resulted in a very rapid change in viability in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner as determined by flow cytometry, with changes occurring as early as 2–3 h (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the mode of cell death under these conditions, we scrutinized several indices of apoptosis including caspase activity, release of intracellular calcium, and DNA degradation in the presence and absence of z-VAD. Our data support the conclusion that hyperosmotic stress induced cell death in S49 (Neo) cells is apoptosis that occurs in a caspase-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Apoptosis is a stochastic response that occurs one cell at a time. Depending on the cell type and apoptotic stimuli, the onset of cell death may take many hours to days. The rapid occurrence of apoptosis in S49 (Neo) cells following hyperosmotic stress lead us to investigate the synchrony of the process in our model system. This question was addressed by acutely exposing S49 (Neo) cells to hyperosmotic stress, and then returning them to normal media where over time, the initiation of apoptosis was observed. Fig. 3 shows that while a 30-min exposure to hyperosmotic stress had no significant effect on inducing apoptosis, a 60-min hyperosmotic exposure resulted in ∼40% apoptotic cells within 4 h. When S49 (Neo) cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress for 90 or 120 min before being returned to normal media, a striking simultaneous initiation of apoptosis was observed that peaked at 8 h (Fig. 3). These data indicate that unlike other apoptotic stimuli, hyperosmotic stress results in a highly synchronous initiation of apoptosis. The ability of a few cells to survive hyperosmotic conditions was exploited by exposing S49 (Neo) cells to media containing mannitol, and then returning them to normal media for culture as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1. A 4-h hyperosmotic stress results in greater than 95% of the cells undergoing cell death. However, over a period of 7–14 days of recovery in normal media, not all cells died, and the small remaining viable population proliferated. Repeating this process for 15 generations of “kill and recovery” resulted in fewer cells undergoing cell death in response to hyperosmotic stress and the development of a cell line designated S49 (OS 4–15). Microscopic examination of the S49 (OS 4–15) cells showed that they were of an inherent larger cell size when compared with the S49 (Neo) cells (Fig. 4A). Analysis of the mean cell volume for both the S49 (Neo) and S49 (OS 4–15) cells showed an ∼15% increase in cell capacity for the latter cells (Fig. 4A). This increase in cell size led us to examine these cells for changes in their intracellular ions, specifically potassium and sodium. Initially, using 2 fluorescent ionic dyes to simultaneously examine sodium and potassium concentrations in these cells, we observed no significant change in intracellular sodium or potassium between the parental cells and the S49 (OS 4–15) cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly after 4 h of hyperosmotic stress, the S49 (Neo) cells had a reversal in the normal Na+/K+ ratio followed by a decrease in intracellular concentration of both ions previously attributed to the apoptotic volume decrease (Fig. 4B). This reversal of intracellular is similar to our previous studies using different cells and apoptotic agents (16.Bortner C.D. Sifre M.I. Cidlowski J.A. Cationic gradient reversal and cytoskeleton-independent volume regulatory pathways define an early stage of apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7219-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In marked contrast however, the S49 (OS 4–15) cells did not have this ionic response to hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 4B). To confirm the results from our studies with the fluorescent ionic dyes, we examined the intracellular ion concentrations in S49 (Neo) and S49 (OS 4–15) cells under control and hyperosmotic conditions by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. S49 (Neo) cells treated cells with 250-mOsm osmotic stress for 150 min, a time prior to the loss of membrane integrity, showed a significant decrease in intracellular potassium coupled to a significant increase in intracellular sodium (Fig. 4C), similar to the observations made by flow cytometry. Treatment of S49 (OS 4–15) cells did not result in a significant change in intracellular sodium and potassium, suggesting that the response is selective for the S49 (Neo) cells. The loss of intracellular sodium and potassium during cell death are known to play a critical role in the activation of the apoptotic machinery (7.Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A.

The apparent absence of this ionic alteration upon hyperosmotic stress in S49 (OS 4–15) cells led us to examine apoptosis in these cells. Exposure of S49 (OS 4–15) cells to hyperosmotic stress for 4 h did not result in a change in viability (Fig. 5A), in marked contrast to the S49 (Neo) cells that died rapidly after identical treatment. We also examined the ability of the S49 (OS 4–15) cells to undergo cell death in response to other apoptotic stimuli. When S49 (Neo) cells were treated with known apoptotic agents including dexamethasone, staurosporine, thapsigargin, or UV, we observed an increase in the percent of PI-positive cells, caspase activity, and degraded DNA establishing their sensitivity to apoptosis (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when S49 (OS 4–15) cells were examined under the same conditions, apoptosis failed to occur (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, all these cell death agents are known to activate apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondria pathway. Thus, we also examined both S49 (Neo) and S49 (OS 4–15) cells following activation of the extrinsic death receptor pathway with Fas ligand. Treatment with Fas ligand resulted in apoptosis in both osmotic-sensitive and osmotic-resistant cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the apoptotic resistance acquired in the S49 (OS 4–15) cells is specific for the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Clearly the extrinsic apoptotic-signaling pathway remains intact in both of these cell types. Cell life/death decisions are often thought to be based on a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. Thus, we examined the expression of various pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Survivin, Bim, caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8 in both the osmotically sensitive and osmotically resistance lymphoid cells. Analysis of protein expression showed no significant difference in the level of these proteins between the S49 (Neo) and S49 (OS 4–15) cells (Fig. 6A), with the exception of an increased expression in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in the S49 (OS 4–15) cells, suggesting that these apoptotic resistant cells should be more sensitive to a cell death stimulus (Fig. 6A). However, our data suggest that the apoptotic resistance does not appear to be associated with an increase in anti-apoptotic or a decrease in pro-apoptotic protein expression that we have analyzed in our experiments. Additionally, the lack of caspase activity in S49 (OS 4–15) cells under multiple intrinsic apoptotic stimuli lead us to examine if cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria during the intrinsic cell death process. When S49 (Neo) and S49 (OS 4–15) cells were treated with media containing either 250 or 500 mm mannitol for 4 h, and then divided into a cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, cytochrome c release occurred in both cells (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that the resistance of the S49 (OS 4–15) cells likely lies downstream of the mitochondria, and further suggest that the release of cytochrome c is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in these osmotically resistant cells. Because the S49 (OS 4–15) cells were resistant to multiple intrinsic apoptotic stimuli, including osmotic stress (19.Brady S.C. Allan L.A. Clarke P.R.

Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways can be activated by a variety of environmental agents including osmotic pressure. In general, p38 MAPK and JNK are thought to be pro-apoptotic, while ERK 1/2 and the cell survival-promoting protein kinase B (AKT) are thought to"

Here, we report the relationship of IGF1 to GATA4, an essential transcription factor in cardiac hypertrophy and cell survival. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we compared the responses to IGF1 (10 nmol/liter) and phenylephrine (PE, 20 μmol/liter), a known GATA4 activator, in concentrations promoting a similar extent of hypertrophy. IGF1 and PE both increased nuclear accumulation of GATA4 and phosphorylation at Ser(105) (PE, 2.4-fold; IGF1, 1.8-fold; both, p < 0.05) and increased GATA4 DNA binding activity as indicated by ELISA and by chromatin IP of selected promoters. Although IGF1 and PE each activated GATA4 to the same degree, GATA4 knockdown by RNA interference only blocked hypertrophy by PE but not by IGF1. PE induction of a panel of GATA4 target genes (Nppa, Nppb, Tnni3, Myl1, and Acta1) was inhibited by GATA4 knockdown. In contrast, IGF1 regulated only Acta1 in a GATA4-dependent fashion. Consistent with the in vitro findings, Gata4 haploinsufficiency in mice did not alter cardiac structure, hyperdynamic function, or antifibrotic effects induced by myocardial overexpression of the IGF1 receptor. Our data indicate that GATA4 is activated by the IGF1 pathway, but although it is required for responses to pathological stimuli, it is not necessary for the effects of IGF1 on cardiac structure and function."

Therefore, identification of novel PKD substrates is necessary to understand the profound role of this kinase family in signal transduction. Here, we show that rhotekin, an effector of RhoA GTPase, is a novel substrate of PKD. We identified Ser-435 in rhotekin as the potential site targeted by PKD in vivo. Expression of a phosphomimetic S435E rhotekin mutant resulted in an increase of endogenous active RhoA GTPase levels. Phosphorylation of rhotekin by PKD2 modulates the anchoring of the RhoA in the plasma membrane. Consequently, the S435E rhotekin mutant displayed enhanced stress fiber formation when expressed in serum-starved fibroblasts. Our data thus identify a novel role of PKD as a regulator of RhoA activity and actin stress fiber formation through phosphorylation of rhotekin.

https://openalex.org/W2007026737,"Members of the type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) family (e.g. ricin, abrin) are potent cytotoxins showing a strong lethal activity toward eukaryotic cells. Type 2 RIPs contain two polypeptide chains (usually named A, for ""activity"", and B, for ""binding"") linked by a disulfide bond. The intoxication of the cell is a consequence of a reductive process in which the toxic domain is cleaved from the binding domain by oxidoreductases located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The best known example of type 2 RIPs is ricin. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was demonstrated to be involved in the process of ricin reduction; however, when PDI is depleted from cell fraction preparations ricin reduction can still take place, indicating that also other oxidoreductases might be implicated in this process. We have investigated the role of TMX, a transmembrane thioredoxin-related protein member of the PDI family, in the cell intoxication operated by type 2 RIPs ricin and abrin. Overexpressing TMX in A549 cells resulted in a dramatic increase of ricin or abrin cytotoxicity compared with control mock-treated cells. Conversely, no difference in cytotoxicity was observed after treatment of A549 cells or control cells with saporin or Pseudomonas exotoxin A whose intracellular mechanism of activation is not dependent upon reduction (saporin) or only partially dependent upon it (Pseudomonas exotoxin A). Moreover, the silencing of TMX in the prostatic cell line DU145 reduced the sensitivity of the cells to ricin intoxication further confirming a role for this enzyme in intracellular ricin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2082977650,"Cardiac steroids (CS), an important class of naturally occurring compounds, are synthesized in plants and animals. The only established receptor for CS is the ubiquitous Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, a major plasma membrane transporter. The binding of CS to Na(+),K(+)-ATPase causes the inhibition of Na(+) and K(+) transport and elicits cell-specific activation of several intracellular signaling mechanisms. It is well documented that the interaction of CS with Na(+),K(+)-ATPase is responsible for numerous changes in basic cellular physiological properties, such as electrical plasma membrane potential, cell volume, intracellular [Ca(2+)] and pH, endocytosed membrane traffic, and the transport of other solutes. In the present study we show that CS induces the formation of dark structures adjacent to the nucleus in human NT2 and ACHN cells. These structures, which are not surrounded by membranes, are clusters of glycogen and a distorted microtubule network. Formation of these clusters results from a relocation of glycogen and microtubules in the cells, two processes that are independent of one another. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the clusters are mediated by the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and an additional unknown factor. Similar glycogen clusters are induced by hypoxia, suggesting that the CS-induced structural change, described in this study, may be part of a new type of cellular stress response."

Event organizers and architects are often criticised for failing to consider the causes and implications of crush, but the reality is that both the prediction and prevention of such conditions offer a significant technical challenge. Full treatment of physical force within crowd simulations is precise but often computationally expensive; the more common method of human interpretation of results is computationally “cheap” but subjective and time-consuming. This paper describes an alternative method for the analysis of crowd behaviour, which uses information theory to measure crowd disorder. We show how this technique may be easily incorporated into an existing simulation framework, and validate it against an historical event. Our results show that this method offers an effective and efficient route towards automatic detection of the onset of crush."
