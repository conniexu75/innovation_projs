https://openalex.org/W1515427160,"Addition of arachidonic acid and homo-gamma-linolenic acid to a suspension of rabbit peritoneal neutrophils led to the synthesis of 5-L-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and 8-L-hydroxy-9,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, respectively. Both hydroxy acids were found to be the main metabolites of their respective unsaturated C-20 fatty acid precursor, constituting more than 50% of the total substrate conversion. The formation of the two metabolites was not inhibted bb indomethacin, indicating that the enzymes involved were unrelated to the prostaglandin synthetase system. The presence in the two compounds of a hydroxyl group alpha to a pair of conjugated cis/trans double bonds suggested that they were formed by action of lipoxygenease(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1638102173,"It has been shown that prostaglandin (PG) cyclooxygenase is irreversibly self-deactivated during the oxygenation of arachidonic acid (Smith, W. L., and Lands, W.E.M. (1972) Biochemistry II, 3273-3285). Using several experimental approaches and an enzyme preparation which was highly active without artificial stimulation, we have extensively investigated the mechanism of this deactivation process. During the generation of PGH2 from arachidonic acid, oxidizing equivalents were released and the reductive breakdown of PGG2 was found to deactivate the cyclooxygenase. The cyclooxygenase-catalyzed metabolism of both arachidonic acid and PGG2 generated radicals which were scavenged by phenol. Both phenol and methional (scavengers of oxygen-centered radicals) promoted the formation of PGH2 at the expense of PGG2 and increased the initial rate and the extent of reaction prior to deactivation of the cyclooxygenase. Hence, it appears that the cyclooxygenase was irreversibly self-deactivated during the formation of PGH2 from arachidonic acid, due to its oxidation by oxygen-centered radicals formed as a result of the reductive breakdown of the hydroperoxide on PGG2. Some experiments with dithiothereitol and N-ethylmaleimide suggested that the enzyme may contain a disulfide at the active site. A mechanism has been devised which accounts for the self-deactivation phenomenon, the effect of phenol and methional, the disulfide at the active site, and the pathway of substrate oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W1970107317,"The intact interphase genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation after gentle lysis of tissue culture cells in 0.9 M NaCl-0.4% nonidet P40. The non-viscous folded DNA sediments as a single broad 5000S peak in a complex with RNA (a fraction of the nuclear nascent RNA) and protein (all of the four intranuclesome histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The folded DNA is supercoiled and can be relaxed to slower sedimenting forms either by intercalating ethidium or by nicking with DNAase I. Incomplete DNAase treatment gives partially relaxed complexes, indicating that each nick relaxes only a stretch of DNA (defined as a supercoiled DNA loop) without affecting the superhelical content of the rest of the genome. The concentration of superhelices in the Drosophila folded DNA is the same as in the E. coli and SV40 closed circular DNAs-that is, about one negative turn every 200 base pairs (bp) in 0.15 M NaCl at 26 degrees C. The estimated average size of the supercoiled DNA loops, about 85,000 bp, equals the size of the larger Drosophila chromomeres. Ethidium intercalation in 0.9 M NaCl both removes the negative superhelical turns and dissociates the four histones from the DNA. The four histones are dissociated in equimolar concentrations, and the relative proportion of histones displaced from the DNA is a function of ethidium concentration. The histones are completely dissociated from the folded DNA at the ethidium concentration. The histones are completely dissociated from the folded DNA at the ethidium concentration which removes all of the negative superhelices. Thus the data strongly suggest that the rotation of the Watson Crick helix which accompanies ethidium intercalation causes the loss of nucleosomes from the DNA. The results are interpreted in terms of a model for the folded Drosophila genome which has the DNA constrained (by both protein-DNA and RNA- DNA interactions) into independent supercoiled loops containing on the average 400 nucleosomes per loop. Each nucleosome is composed of a histone core with the DNA wound around it in a 360 degrees left-handed toroidal supercoil; each nucleosome toroidal supercoil plus its relaxed internucleosome DNA contains, on the average, 200 bp."

https://openalex.org/W1608303427,"Lipoprotein lipase of high purity has been isolated from bovine milk by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, adsorption to Cgamma-aluminum hydroxide gel, and intervent dilution chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. Chemical analysis shows that the enzyme is a glycoprotein containing 8.3% carbohydrate. The monomer molecular weight, determined under reducing conditions in 6.6 M guanidine HCl by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and analytical gel chromatrgraphy, is 48,300 and 50,800, respectively. Analyses of the sedimentation coefficient (SO20,w=5.40 S) and the diffusion coefficient (DO20,w=48.8 mum2/s) in a buffer of physiological pH and ionic strength yield a molecular weight of 96,900. In solution, the native enzyme thus appears to be a dimer of presumably identical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1509909836,"A soluble lectin which agglutinates trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes was purified from calf heart using affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-Sepharose. Its molecular weight was determined by gel filtration to be approximately 17,000. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the predominant molecular species had a molecular weight of 9,000, suggesting that the lectin is a dimer. Binding studies performed with iodinated lectin revealed that neuraminidase-treated calf erythrocytes contained approximately 5 X 10(6) lectin binding sites per cell. Native calf and rabbit erythrocytes bound the lectin, but human and rat erythrocytes required neuraminidase and trypsin treatment, respectively, for lectin binding to occur. A number of saccharides, glycopeptides, and glycoproteins possess haptene inhibitory activity toward lectin binding to erythrocytes. The most potent of these have either galactose beta leads to galactose beta leads to, galactose beta N-acetylglucosamine beta leads to, or galactose beta leads to N-acetylglucosamine beta leads to sequences at their nonreducing termini. Lactose and galactose beta 1 leads to 3N-acetylgalactosamine are the next best haptenes. Finally, alpha-linked galactose residues and free galactose are very weak haptenes. The presences of a terminal sialic acid residue impairs haptene activity in all instances. Calf heart also contains a membrane-associated lectin which is very similar but not identical with the soluble lectin. A soluble beta-galactoside binding lectin was also isolated from calf lung. It has the same molecular size and subunit structure as the soluble heart lectin and is antigenically identical. In binding studies, the pattern of inhibition by various haptenes was the same for all three lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1482645981,"The in vitro uptake of retinol from its plasma carrier protein, the retinol-binding protein (RBP), to the cells of the monkey's small intestine has been studied. [3H]Retinol was readily delivered from the RBP to the cells without a concomitant cellular uptake of the RBP. The [3H]retinol accumulation in the cells was dependent on the temperature and was virtually abolished at 0 degrees. Several metabolic inhibitors could not impede the uptake process. The cellular [3H]retinol accumulation was linear for about 45 min and exhibited characteristic saturation kinetics. The uptake of [3H]retinol by the cells could be inhibited by RBP containing unlabeled retinol, vitamin A-depleted RBP, and Fab' fragments against RBP. In contrast, free, unlabeled retinol and the metabolite form of RBP, lacking retinol and affinity for prealbumin, were inactive. It is therefore suggested that there is a receptor for vitamin A on the cell surface which recognizes the protein part of the protein-ligand complex."
https://openalex.org/W1601459965,"Evidence is presented to support the identification of a unique membrane binding protein in a variety of subcellular organelles including the Golgi complex, the lysosomes, the smooth microsomes, and the external plasma membranes prepared from rat liver homogenates. The binding protein, specific for desialylated serum glycoproteins, was isolated from each of the above components and purified by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose 4B to which asialoorosomucoid had been covalently linked. In each case, the final preparation exhibited an apparently complete identity of binding properties as well as similar subunit structure and immunological specificity. In contrast to the binding role previously ascribed to the plasma membranes as a prelude to transport and catabolism, the function of this activity in intracellular processes is currently unknown."

It can be activated by incubating it with a trypsin-sensitive, oxygen-labile component (activating factor) plus adenosine triphosphate and a divalent metal ion. After activation, the iron protein retains its nitrogenase activity when the activating factor is removed."
https://openalex.org/W1519748854,"[3H]Dihydroergocryptine, a potent alpha-adrenergic antagonist, was used to label smooth muscle membrane binding sites which have the characteristics expected of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Binding of [3H]dihydroergocryptine to rabbit uterine membranes was rapid and reversible with rate constants of 1.26 X 10(7) M-1 min-1 and 0.034 min-1 for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. [3H]Dihydroergocryptine binding was of high affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 8 to 10 nM. Binding was saturable with 0.14 to 0.17 pmol of [3H]dihydroergocryptine bound/mg of protein at maximal occupancy of the sites. No cooperative interactions among the sites were detected. The specificity of the binding sites for a large number of adrenergic agonists and antagonists was identical with the specificity of alpha-adrenergic responses to these agents. The alpha-adrenergic agonist (-)-epinephrine competed for binding with a KD of 0.23 muM. The order of potencies for several adrenergic agonists in competing for the binding sites was (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-phenylephrine greater than (-)-isoproterenol in agreement with their alpha-adrenergic potencies. A series of 19 phenylethylamine adrenergic agonists competed for binding in a manner paralleling their potencies as alpha-adrenergic agonists. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists such as phentolamine (KD = 15 nM) and phenoxybenzamine (KD = 18 nM) potently competed for the binding sites. In contrast, beta-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol (KD = 27,000 nM) and practolol (KD greater than 10(6) nM) did not have high affinity for the binding sites. A series of ergot alkaloids competed for [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding in a manner which paralleled their potencies as alpha-adrenergic agents. Competition for binding sites by alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists was a stereospecific process. The (-)-stereoi somers of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and ergotamine were at least 20- to 50-fold more potent than the corresponding (+)-stereoisomers. Compounds devoid of significant alpha-adrenergic activity, such as pyrocatechol, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, normetanephrine, and D-lysergic acid, did not effectively compete for [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These rabbit uterine binding sites for [3H]dihydroergocryptine appear to have characteristics indistinguishable from those of the physiologically active alpha-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2085876270,"The larval salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster, which are widely used for cytogenic studies, are also useful for studying the regulation of specific protein synthesis during differentiation. These glands synthesize and secrete massive amounts of a glue which attaches the pupae to the substrate during metamorphosis. We find six major proteins in this glue. They show wide quantitative and qualitative variation among wild-type strains of D. melanogaster. Four of the proteins are glycosylated, and one of these is further modified so that its mobility on SDS polyacrylamide gels is greater than the mobility of its unmodified precursor. The glue proteins begin to be made at about 106 hr after egg deposition. The synthesis of four of the proteins begins coordinately, while one protein begins to be made slightly earlier and one slightly later. The proteins are synthesized for approximately 14 hr until puparium formation, when the glue is released from the salivary glands. Synthesis of five of the glue proteins stops abruptly within a few minutes after the glue is released. The sixth protein continues to be synthesized for at least 30 min after glue release."

https://openalex.org/W2090297735,"Covalently closed small circular DNA isolated from Drosophila melanogaster is described. The small circular DNA is found in blastema stage eggs and in Schneider's cell culture line 2 and a cloned subline of line 2. It is heterogeneous in size, although the size distributions and mean sizes differ for each source. The small circular DNA from Schneider's line 2 cells ranges from 0.09-7.3 μm, with a mean contour length of 1.1 μm. This DNA has a buoyant density of 1.703 g/cc and appears to be present predominantly in the nuclear fraction of detergent-disrupted cells. The restriction enzyme EcoRI cleaves approximately 40% of the small circular DNA with a bias toward the larger size classes. Both logarithmic and stationary phase cells contain approximately 3–40 average sized small circular DNA molecules per cell, representing a maximum of 0.03% of the total cellular DNA. Exposure to cycloheximide or puromycin for 14 hr results in a 30 fold increase in the number of small circles per cell, but reduces the mean length of the circular DNA to 0.3 μm. The drug-amplified DNA has a buoyant density in the range of 1.698-1.703 g/cc. No amplification was seen in cells treated with either inhibitor for 3.5 hr. Ethidium bromide, cytosine arabinoside, β-ecdysone, and insulin all had no significant effect on the amount per cell of either small circular DNA or mitochondrial DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1528030919,"ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has been isolated in homogeneous form from an Escherichia coli B mutant, AC70R1, derepressed in the synthesis of glycogen synthetic enzymes. The enzyme has been found to be identical with the wild type enzyme with respect to kinetic properties, molecular weight, and immunological reactivity. The AC70R1 enzyme is composed of four identical subunits of molecular weight of approximately 50,000. This is based on the findings that: (a) gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions shows only one component; (b) tryptic mapping shows only enough peptides to account for a single polypeptide subunit; (c) digestion with carboxypeptidase B releases stoichiometric amounts of arginine; and (d) NH2-terminal sequencing shows a single sequence for the first 27 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1529935442,"Glucuronidase present in lysosomes of mouse liver occurs as the free tetramer, whereas glucuronidase present in endoplasmic reticulum occurs in macromolecular complexes containing one to four molecules of the protein egasyn. Earlier genetic and biochemical studies suggest that these complexes, or M forms, function to stabilize the membrane binding of glucoronidase. The detergent Triton X-100 extracts glucuronidase-egasyn complexes intact and they dissociate in the presence of the detergent deoxycholate or upon heating. We have now purfied egasyn by releasing it from antiglucuronidase immunoprecipitates of M forms under relatively mild conditions, such as treatment with deoxycholate or heating at 50 degrees. Isolated egasyn is a glycoprotein of molecular weight about 64,000 and is not unusually hydrophobic in amino acid composition. Monospecific antibody to egasyn was raised. This antibody showed no cross-reactivity with purified beta-glucuronidase and antibody to glucuronidase failed to react with purified egasyn; however, both antibodies bound to egasyn-glucuronidase complexes. A procedure for the radioimmunoassay of egasyn was developed utilizing egasyn labeled with iodine 125. Most of the antigenic sites of egasyn in homogenates of normal liver are masked after extraction with Triton X-100 and only become immunoreactive after exposure to deoxycholate. After unmasking, mouse liver proved to contain about 56 mug of egasyn/g, nearly all of which is localized to the microsomal fraction. Of this total only about 10% was complexed with glucuronidase, suggesting theat the bulk of the egasyn present may be complexed with other proteins. Mice of the inbred strain YBR, which carry the EgO mutation resulting in the absence of microsomal glucuronidase, lacked immunoreactive egasyn, suggesting that the primary defect in this strain lies in the unavailabililty of agasyn to form complexes. There is now considerable evidence in support of the concept that the microsomal forms of glucuronidase exist in membranes complexed with egasyn and that formation of these complexes is required for maintenance of glucuronidase in membranes. Egasyn may represent one of a class of membrane anchor proteins that each stabilize the membrane binding of a charcteristic set of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996509463,"In norpA mutants of Drosophila melanogaster the phototransduction process is either partially or completely blocked. By using a temperature-sensitive allele, we have found that the norpA mutation has little or no effect on either the rhodopsin-metarhodopsin transition or the machinery of quantum bump production. Thus, the norpA lesion appears to be localized in the intermediate process of phototransduction. Because a temperature-sensitive allele of norpA has been isolated, the norpA gene probably encodes a protein involved in the process."

https://openalex.org/W2047108779,"Long-term administration of [D-Leu6, des-Gly-NH210, Pro-ethylamide9]-GnRH, an analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone, caused regression of neoplastic tissue in a rat bearing a spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma and in rats in which tumors had been induced by treatment with dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA). During two separate treatment periods with the analog, the tumor in the single animal regressed although it had previously grown spontaneously. After a third period of growth, ovariectomy also induced regression, suggesting endocrine dependency of the tumor. These observations were confirmed in the DMBA-induced tumor system, where tumor regression in the analog-treated rats was comparable to that observed in the ovariectomized rats, and in both cases the tumor regression was significant when compared to untreated controls."

https://openalex.org/W1608038716,"Glutaraldehyde cross-linked crystals of muscle phosphorylase a and b (alpha-1,4-glucan:orthophosphate glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.1) in the tetragonal form have been shown to be catalytically active in the direction of saccharide synthesis. Precession x-ray photographs at 5.5 A resolution of a single crystal of cross-linked phosphorylase b at the hol zone indicate little change in the diffraction pattern when compared to non-cross-linked phosphorylase b under similar conditions. Non-cross-linked crystals crack and dissolve in the presence of both substrates, maltopheptaose and glucose 1-phosphate, although they are stable in the presence of each individually. These phenomena are prevented by treatment with glutaraldehyde, which causes a marked increase in mechanical stability and completely suppresses solubilization of the enzyme under our assay conditions. Diffusion of substrates into cross-linked microcrystals does not appear to be rate-limiting and assays of such crystals are linear with respect to both time and enzyme concentration. Kinetic constants for both substrates are reported. The maximal velocities of phosphorlyase a are larger than those of phosphorylase b in both the soluble and crystalline states under our assay conditions, with the above substrates. It appears that crystallization (and cross-linking) reduces maximal velocities by about 11- to 50-fold in the case of phosphorylase b and 50- to 100-fold for phosphorylase a. Little or no differences were found between the Km values for maltoheptaose or glucose 1-phosphate in the soluble or crystalline states. Kinetic data suggest that substrate binding sites are similar in both states. Although loss of catalytic efficiency points to differences in the active site of the enzyme caused by crystallization, another explanation is that the crystal is restricting a conformational change that is an essential part of the catalytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1534164522,"p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas fluorescens catalyzes in vivo the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate by molecular oxygen to form 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate. p-Mercaptobenzoate is also a substrate of the enzyme, but instead of being converted to the expected product, 3-hydroxy-4-mercaptobenzoate, the disulfide, 4,4'-dithiobisbenzoate, is formed. To find what mechanistic information this unusual reaction provided, steady state kinetic analyses, combined with rapid reaction studies of the changes in the enzyme-bound FAD, were carried out with the separate half-reactions involved in catalysis. Most of the kinetic measurements were made with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer designed for working anaerobically and connected on line to a minicomputer. Initial rate studies, upon varying systematically the concentrations of p-mercaptobenzoate, NADPH, and oxygen showed that the enzyme interacted with the substrates in the same manner as it does with p-hydroxybenzoate in place of the mercaptan. That is, a ternary complex is formed between enzyme, mercaptobenzoate, and NDAPH, followed by reaction and release of NADP+. Then a second ternary complex is formed between enzyme, mercaptobenzoate, and oxygen followed by reaction, liberation of product, and return to the resting state of the enzyme. Rapid reaction studies showed that the first half-reaction was analagous to that with the natural substrate. The enzyme-flavin is reduced to the 1,5-dihydroflavin by NADPH, and the rate of reaction is dramatically enhanced in the presence of mercaptobenzoate. The rate enhancement with this enzyme correlates well with the presence of a dianion form of the substrate on the enzyme. Examination of the second half-reaction showed that the reduced flavin on the enzyme formed transient intermediates upon reaction with oxygen, which were analogous to the intermediates in reactions where the enzyme forms an hydroxylated product. The oxidation of p-mercaptobenzoate by H2O2 in free solution resulted in the same disulfide as formed in the enzymatic reaction, only orders of magnitude slower. A sulfenic acid was probably the initial oxidation product from p-mercaptobenzoate, and this reacted very fast, and nonenzymatically, with mercaptobenzoate to form the disulfide and H20. The significance of the enzyme reaction with oxygen when complexed with p-mercaptobenzoate is discussed in relation to the mechanism of hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1875128001,"1. Electric generation by bacteriochlorophyll reaction center complexes from Rhodospirillum rubrum and by photosystem I complexes from pea chloroplasts has been studied. 2. The methods for the proteoliposome reconstitution from azolectin and bacteriochlorophyll- or plant chlorophyll-containing protein complexes have been elaborated. Light-dependent electric responses of the proteoliposomes were detected using (a) phenyldicarbaundecarborane anion (PCB-) probe and (b) direct measurement by a voltmeter in the proteoliposome-planar phospholipid membrane system. 3. Both PCB- and direct measurements demonstrated that bacteriochlorophyll proteoliposomes are competent in light-dependent electric generation (plus outside proteoliposomes). The photoelectric effect was shown to increase on addition of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), CoQ6, and vitamin K3, and to decrease on addition of ferricyanide, o-phenanthroline and a protonophorous uncoupler. Estimation of the photoelectromotive force of the bacteriochlorophyll proteoliposome-planar membrane system gave a value of about 0.2 V. The action spectrum of the photoelectric effect was similar to the absorption spectrum of the bacteriochlorophyll complex. 4. Reconstitution of proteoliposomes containing bacteriochlorophyll centers and bacteriorhodopsin resulted in the system generating an electric field whose direction can be changed by varying the spectral composition of the light: the red light, exciting bacteriochlorophyll, induces negative, and the green light, exciting bacteriorhodopsin, induces positive charging of the proteoliposome interior. 5. Association of isolated R. rubrum chromatophores with planar phospholipid membrane was found to give a system demonstrating light-induced electric generation as high as 215 mV in the presence of napthoquinone, TMPD (or phenazine methosulfate, PMS), and ascorbate. Under the same conditions, addition of inorganic pyrophosphate or ATP results in formation of an electric field of the same direction as that induced by light. 6. Proteoliposomes with plant chlorophyll complexes of photosystem I demonstrated light-induced PCB- responses indicating formation of the electric field with plus inside vesicles. The effect required PMS addition. A protonophorous uncoupler and o-phenanthroline were inhibitory. Electric responses in the chlorophyll proteoliposome-planar membrane system were very small (not higher than 10 mV)."

https://openalex.org/W1586657882,"A proteolytic enzyme with high activity on the specific, low molecular weight dormant spore proteins (termed A and B proteins) degraded during spore germination has been purified approximately 1000-fold from Bacillus megaterium spores. This enzyme accounts for greater than 85% of the proteolytic activity toward the A and B proteins in crude spore extracts. The protease has a pH optimum of approximately 7.5, is inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA (10 mM), and is inhibited approximately 70% by NaCl (1 M). The enzyme is unstable and requires glycerol, divalent cations, and high enzyme concentrations for maximum stability. The protease shows a high degree of specificity for the A and B proteins, since high levels of enzyme catalyze no detectable bond cleavage on a variety of amide, ester, peptide, or other protein substrates. The enzyme is an endoprotease and digestion of the A and B proteins in vitro generates a number of peptide fragments at least one of which appears identical with a fragment isolated from lysates of spores carrying out hydrolysis of endogenous A and B proteins. In vitro, the peptide products can be rapidly degraded to amino acids by an aminopeptidase which has also been partially purified from spores. Although high levels of the protease are present in extracts of dormant spores, and of spores germinated for a few minutes, the enzyme is undetectable in log phase and early stationary phase cells. Furthermore, the protease disappears rapidly (t1/2 approximately 30 min) and completely (greater than 90%) as the process of germination proceeds."

https://openalex.org/W1605057695,"A rapid and highly specific method for the isolation of human platelet tubulin by immunosorption was developed. Platelet tubulin isolated by successive cycles of polymerization was used as antigen. Densitometric quantification of the antigen subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed 96% tubulin of molecular weight 55,000 and 4% high molecular weight proteins (mr = 240,000 to 250,000) which co-purified with platelet micrtobule protein. Platelet tubulin bound 0.57 mumol of colchicine/100 mg of protein. Monospecific antibody of human platelet tubulin was prepared in rabbits. After absorption with tubulin co-purifying high molecular weight proteins, and serum proteins, the rabbit anti-tubulin serum gave a single precipitin line on double immunodiffusion against platelet tubulin and the high speed supernatant of a platelet sonicate (platelet extract). The antiserum precipitated the colchicine-binding activity of platelet extracts. The gamma-globulin fraction of the absorbed antiserum was linked to an agarose matrix. Platelet extracts applied to such immunosorptive columns showed the disappearance of a single protein which was eluted with 0.5 g/liter of Triton X-100 and identified as platelet tubulin. Its colchicine-binding activity was retained in full. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the ability of platelet tubulin to polymerize and form tubules was not impaired in the presence of 0.5 g/liter of Triton X-100. This simple isolation procedure of platelet tubulin has great advantages in terms of purity and yield and can readily be adapted for use with other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1007786529,"The ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis synthesizes a wide variety of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Variations in growth temperature or the addition of sterols such as cholesterol or ergosterol alter the proportions of a number of unsaturated fatty acids. The pattern of substitution is complex when examined on the basis of individual fatty acids. A straightforward explanation is possible, however, if biosynthetic groupings are considered. Stearic acid gives rise to oleic, linoleic, and gamma-linolenic acids as shown by others. The environmental parameters influence the amounts of the unsaturated derivatives of stearic acid as a group and result in an increase or decrease in all members of this biosynthetic family in a fashion that depends on a particular set of conditions. The replacement of the stearate derivatives by unsaturated components that are derived from palmitic acid has been demonstrated. The addition of radiolabeled palmitic, palmitoleic, or stearic acids to the cells when coupled with radioisotope distribution measurements, isolation, and characterization of the acids, and the refeeding of key intermediates substantiates a second biosynthetic scheme for the synthesis of unsaturated acids in this ciliate. This novel pathway yields an unusual fatty acid, 18:2 delta6,11, as a major terminal product. Plamitic acid is the precursor for the members of both sequences. Palmitoleic acid can be desaturated further to produce two hexadecadienoates and a hexadecatrienoate. Further, palmitoleic acid (16:1 delta9) is elongated to cis-vaccenic acid (18:1 delta11) which is then desaturated to 18:2 delta6,11. Linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids were essentially unlabeled when [14C]palmitoleic acid was provided. Refeeding radiolabeled 18:2 delta6,11 to the cells revealed the extensive incorporation of this acid into the polar lipids and the absence of additional metabolites. [14C]Stearic acid addition to the cells results in extensive labeling of linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, but not of 18:2 delta6,11. These observations confirm the existence of alternative and separate pathways for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1607822934,"Initiation factor IF2 bound to the 70 S initiation complex with 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate was treated with the cross-linking reagent, dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate. Covalent cross-linking of the factor to ribosomes was demonstrated by stabilization of initiation factor IF2-70S complexes during centrifugation at high salt concentrations. Specific cross-linking of the factor to the 50 S proteins L7/L12 was shown by: (a) co-precipitation of the 50 S proteins L7/L12 by antibodies made against initiation factor IF2 and (b) the appearance of radioactive bands containing [32P]phosphoryl initiation factor IF2 in regions of elevated molecular weight following polyacrylamide/dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. One major band had an apparent molecular weight of 132,000, consistent with its being a dimer containing one copy of L7/L12 (13,000) and initiation factor IF2 (120,000). This cross-linked species was shown to contain [32P]phosphoryl initiation factor IF2 and 35S-labeled L7/L12 in separate experiments. It is concluded that L7/L12, which were shown previously to be required for the binding of the factor, are located at or near the initiation factor IF2 binding site on the 70 S initiation complex."

https://openalex.org/W1548068840,We have identified a protein extractable from Bacillus megaterium membranes by LiCl as the enzyme in peptidoglycan synthesis which catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetyl-D-muramyl-L-analyl-D-gamma-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine-P-P-lipid. This identification demonstrates the isolation and characterization of a membrane-associated enzyme involved in a complex series of reactions without the ready availability of a substrate for the enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W2073855226,"A quantitative comparison is made between the psychophysical flicker response of man and similar data obtained electrophysiologically from the cones of macaque monkeys. When the psychophysical data are obtained from an eye that is strongly light-adapted, there is excellent agreement between the two sets of data at high frequencies. Under this condition, both kinds of data fit a distributed-parameter model, whose time constant also agrees with that derived from studies of the phosphenes elicited by electrical stimulation of the human eye. On the other hand, psychophysical data obtained with fully modulated stimuli (which minimally adapt the eye) yield a longer time constant for the same model. These results imply that the psychophysical flicker thresholds are normally controlled by a distributed filtering process that is proximal to the receptor stage. This slower, psychophysical process is evidently desensitized by intense adapting lights, so that the faster one that governs the electrophysiological responses can be detected."
https://openalex.org/W1497593504,"The cells of Escherichia coli strain CP 78 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the total radioactive RNA was prepared from the cells. The mRNA that codes for a structural lipoprotein in the outer membrane was purified from the total RNA by three successive electrophoreses on polyacrylamide slab gels, twice at pH 8.3 and once at pH 3.5 in 7 M urea. Approximately 0.002% of the total radioactive phosphate used was incorporated into the fraction containing the most purified mRNA. The two-dimensional fingerprint of the T1 ribonuclease digest of the 32P-labeled mRNA showed that the purity of the mRNA was as high as 90%. A preliminary sequence analysis was carried out on the T1 ribonuclease oligonucleotides which had been separated by the fingerprinting procedure. By using the established amino acid sequence of the lipoprotein and the genetic code, three relatively long oligonucleotides were assigned to code for three different parts of the lipoprotein. From these data, the present RNA fraction was identified as the lipoprotein mRNA. From the analysis of the T1 ribonuclease oligonucleotides, the mRNA was estimated to be 360 +/- 10 nucleotides in length. Although the length of the mRNA was enough to code for 2 lipoprotein molecules, T1 ribonuclease digestion of the mRNA yielded only 1 mol/mol of mRNA of the individual oligonucleotides assigned to parts of the amino acid sequence of the lipoprotein. This suggests that the mRNA codes for only 1 molecule of the lipoprotein. It was also found that the mRNA has no polyadenylate sequence at the 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W2114404262,"Anthranilate synthase from Euglena gracilis strain Z was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme migrated as a single symmetrical peak on sucrose density gradients with a sedimentation constant of about 5.0 S. The molecular weight determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 was 80,000 +/- 2,500. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pure enzyme after sodium dodecyl sulfate denaturation gave a single band at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 79,000 +/- 2,000. These results suggest that Euglena antranilate synthase is composed of a single polypeptide chain of about 80,000 that possesses both ammonia- and glutamine-dependent activity. All other known glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthases are heterodimers or heterotetramers with the chorismic acid and glutamine binding sites on distinct polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1548988119,"Using a membrane filter assay, we have studied the binding reaction between the ATP-dependent DNase from Hemophilus influenzae and duplex DNA under conditions where the degradative reaction is not allowed to proceed. Experiments with three forms of SV40 DNA. Complex formation between enzyme and DNA requires neither DNA or enzyme concentration is fixed while the other is varied reveal that binding is noncooperative and that there are two binding sites per linear DNA molecule. These binding sites probably correspond to the two termini of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1530853691,"Antisera reactive with the subunits of transcarboxylase were produced by injecting rabbits with the 12 SH and 5 SE subunits prepared from trypsin-treated enzyme and with the 12 SH subunit prepared from native transcarboxylase by avidin-Sepharose chromatography. Biotinyl peptides (46 and 65 amino acid residues), released from the enzyme by brief trypsin treatment, formed complexes with avidin and this noncovalent conjugate was used as an antigen to prepare antibodies reactive with the 1.3 SE biotin carboxyl carrier protein. All of these antisera were capable of inhibiting and precipitating intact transcarboxylase. In competitive binding experiments utilizing enzyme inhibition to detect antibody binding, it was found that only the 5 SE subunit was capable of preventing the anti-5 SE sera from inhibiting the enzyme. This technique is useful as a rapid, specific assay for the 5 SE subunit. Both the 5 SE and 12 SH subunits were capable of preventing the anti-12 SH sera from inhibiting the enzyme. To further study this apparent cross-reactivity, the antisera were tested for their capacity to inhibit the partial reactions of transcarboxylase as catalyzed by the isolated subunits. These studies revealed that the anit-12 SH serum inhibits the partial reaction catalyzed by the 12 SH subunit, but preincubation with the 5 SE subunit does not relieve this inhibition, confirming that specific antibody against the 12 SH subunit was formed. These studies also showed that the anti-12 SH serum could inhibit the 5 SE partial reaction, apparently demonstrating cross-reactivity with the 5 SE subunits of the intact enzyme. A panel of immunologic methods was used to characterize the cross-reactivity and quantitate any cross-contamination of the subunit preparations. Passive hemagglutination-hemagglutination inhibition, double immunodiffusion in gels, and competitive precipitation of radioactive antigen all demonstrated cross-reactivity between the isolated subunits and the antisera. Although the subunit preparations apparently are cross-contaminated to a minor extent, this seems insufficient to account for the quantitative aspects of the immunologic cross-reactivity of the subunits with the antisera. Structural homology between the subunits of transcarboxylase is considered to be responsible for the observed cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1544471456,"The sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity of apolipoprotein AI (apo-A-I) from high density lipoproteins of rhesus monkey plasma were studied in aqueous solutions of 0.02 M EDTA, pH 8.6, as a function of protein concentration. The sedimentation equilibrium results showed that, in the concentration range between 9 and 36 muM (0.25 to 1.0 g/liter), apo-A-I behaved as a single species of molecular weight 28,200. This molecular weight corresponds to that of the monomeric form as previously estimated from electrophoretic and chemical data. As the apo-A-I concentration was increased above 36 muM, the log c versus r2 plots from sedimentation equilibrium experiments became curvilinear, suggesting self-association. An analysis of these data generated nonlinear, nonoverlapping molecular weight versus concentration plots pointing at the existence of a heterogeneous population of apo-A-I. By sedimentation velocity studies apo-A-I at concentrations between 68 and 330 muM exhibited two distinct components, with S0/20,w = 1.9 and S0/20,w = 3.9. When separated by gel permeation chromatography, these two components had an identical amino acid composition and retained similar S20,w values as before column fractionation. The slow component had a diffusion coefficient of 8.27 X 10(-7) cm2/s and, assessed by the criteria of sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, remained monomeric even at concentrations of 125 muM. The fast component, when analyzed by low speed sedimentation equilibrium, behaved as a self-associating system which could best be fitted into a monomer-hexamer model in a rapid equilibrium. The equilibrium constant for this association was found to be 9.5 X 10(23) M(-5). Thus, rhesus apo-A-I, dissolved in 0.02 M EDTA, pH 8.6, consisted of two distinct species, one monomeric over a relatively wide range of concentrations, the other readily self-associating. Their structural relationship remains to be established. This ultracentrifugal behavior of rhesus apo-A-I differs markedly from that reported for human apo-AI (Vitello, L. B., and Scanu, A. M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1131-1136)."
