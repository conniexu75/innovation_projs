https://openalex.org/W1586971678,"Abstract Proteinpolysaccharide complex from bovine nasal cartilage exhibits a bimodal distribution of sedimentation coefficients when analyzed in the ultracentrifuge in associative solvents such as 0.5 m guanidinium chloride. The faster sedimenting mode disaggregates in dissociative solvents such as 4 m guanidinium chloride, giving a unimodal centrifugal pattern. Proteinpolysaccharide complex is separated into two fractions by equilibrium centrifugation in a cesium chloride gradient formed in the presence of 4 m guanidinium chloride: a glycoprotein fraction, recovered in the top of the gradient, contains 30% of the absorbance at 280 mµ of proteinpolysaccharide complex but less than 3% of the weight, while proteoglycan subunit, recovered in the bottom, contains more than 95% of the hexuronate. The subunit no longer aggregates in associative solvents, but is capable of aggregating when recombined with the glycoprotein fraction. The amount and type of aggregate formed when dissociative extracts are brought to associative conditions are determined by the pH of the extraction solvent; recovery of aggregate is maximal when extraction and reaggregation are carried out at pH 5.8. The aggregate dissociates completely when exposed to a solvent pH of 3.5 or less; disaggregation also occurs if the solvent is 2 m or greater in guanidinium chloride. The viscosities of proteinpolysaccharide complex solutions increase with increasing relative content of aggregate. Reduction and alkylation of isolated proteoglycan subunit and of the glycoprotein fraction suggest that disulfide bonds in both are required for aggregation, but that those in the former are more sensitive to reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2084085422,"Human blood lymphocytes stimulated with nonviral antigens in vitro produce an antiviral substance with the biological and biochemical characteristics of interferon. The induced response was specific for cells obtained from immune donors. Cells from nonimmune donors did not produce interferon on exposure to these substances. The quantity of interferon produced by antigen stimulation was related to concentration of antigen over a relatively narrow range; with higher concentrations induction was decreased. Interferon production was maximum during days 4 to 7 in culture. In contrast, phytohemagglutinin-induced interferon was primarily produced during the first 4 days in culture."

https://openalex.org/W1499490708,"Abstract 1. Livers from normal and alloxan diabetic rats were perfused in vitro with a medium in which the concentration of free fatty acid was maintained at relatively constant levels by the infusion of a complex of oleic acid and bovine serum albumin. Concentrations of free fatty acid up to 3.5 mm in the cell-free perfusate were attained. 2. Throughout the range of concentration of free fatty acid which might be expected in the blood under normal and pathological conditions in vivo, the uptake of free fatty acid by the liver in vitro was proportional to the concentration in the medium; rates of uptake of free fatty acid approached saturation only at concentrations of free fatty acid in excess of those encountered in vivo. 3. The accumulation of triglyceride in livers from normal and most probably also in livers from alloxan diabetic rats was proportional to the concentration of free fatty acid in the medium. In contrast to triglyceride, the concentrations of total phospholipid, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and free fatty acid in the livers from normal and alloxan diabetic animals was independent of the concentration of free fatty acid in the perfusate. 4. Ketogenesis by livers from normal rats was dependent on the concentration of oleate in the medium; the maximal rates of production of ketone bodies were observed at 1.7 mm oleate. The rate of ketogenesis by livers from normal rats never equaled that by livers from alloxan diabetic animals, regardless of the concentration of free fatty acid in the medium. Although ketogenesis by livers from diabetic rats was responsive to the presence of oleate in the medium, similar and rapid rates of production of ketone bodies were observed over the entire range of concentration of free fatty acid. When livers from normal animals were exposed to high concentrations of oleate and the free fatty acid was withdrawn subsequently, the rates of ketogenesis diminished rapidly even though the concentration of triglyceride was elevated in the liver; glucagon, infused for 3 hours after oleate had been discontinued, could sustain the high rate of ketogenesis only for the short period during which free fatty acid remained in the medium. These observations force us to consider that, unlike free fatty acid, triglyceride fatty acid which accumulates in the livers of normal, fed rats is oxidized slowly, and that glucagon may not exert a major ketogenic action by stimulation of a hepatic triglyceride lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1504311383,"Abstract The phagocytosis-associated stimulation of glucose-1-14C oxidation by rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes is markedly inhibited by 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, which does not appreciably affect resting cell glucose-1-14C oxidation, glucose uptake, or lactic acid production. One millimolar KCN, 1 mm sodium azide, and 50 mm 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole increase the particle-stimulated activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt. Hydrogen peroxide, either generated enzymatically by d-amino acid oxidase plus d-alanine or added directly, stimulates leukocyte direct oxidation of glucose, and this stimulation is enhanced by KCN and sodium azide and inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Hydrogen peroxide-dependent irreversible inhibition of catalase by 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole is increased in rat leukocytes following polystyrene ingestion. Rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes contain a KCN-insensitive glutathione peroxidase and a NADPH-specific glutathione reductase. Fortified 105,000 x g supernatants of rat leukocytes rapidly reduce oxidized glutathione or glutathione which has been oxidized by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and exhibit a concomitant increase of glucose-1-14C oxidation. The data indicate that both phagocytosis and hydrogen peroxide stimulate rat leukocyte hexose monophosphate shunt activity, and similar effects of inhibitors on these two processes suggests that endogenously generated hydrogen peroxide may stimulate the direct oxidation of glucose in phagocytizing cells."

https://openalex.org/W1584684324,"Abstract Crystalline hexokinase prepared by the method of Darrow and Colowick consists largely of enzyme which has been modified in its chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior by yeast protease which is present during the isolation procedure. This proteolytic modification can be prevented by removal of the protease by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose; it can also be largely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Preparations made by the diethylaminoethyl cellulose method contain two forms of the enzyme (P-I and P-II), both of which are more basic by chromatography and electrophoresis than is protease-modified enzyme (S forms). Form P-II shows the same catalytic activity as the Darrow-Colowick preparation, but Form P-I is less active. The two forms are equally susceptible to modification by trypsin. Forms P-I and P-II exist mainly as tetramers of molecular weight about 100,000 at low ionic strength in the neutral pH region, as measured by ultracentrifuge, light scattering, or gel filtration. They tend to dissociate, without loss of catalytic activity, to dimers as the ionic strength, temperature, or pH is raised or when glucose is added in the presence of phosphate. They can be converted to S forms by trypsin or yeast protease only when glucose or salts are present, suggesting that the enzyme must be in the dimer state in order for modification to occur. The protease-modified enzyme tends to exist mainly as a dimer of molecular weight around 50,000 at neutral pH. Thus, modification by trypsin seems to remove some groups which normally play a role in the association of dimer molecules to form the tetramer structure. Mercaptoethanol causes a striking decrease in sedimentation rate when added to the enzyme at pH 9.0. This may be correlated with the recent finding that mercaptoethanol can cause inactivation of the enzyme at this pH."

https://openalex.org/W1509085890,"Abstract Ornithine aminotransferase was crystallized from rat liver and several properties of the enzyme were studied, including amino acid composition, thiol content, absorbance spectrum, isoelectric point, molecular weight, and appearance under the electron microscope. The half-cystine and thiol contents of the enzyme were equal (0.12 µmole per mg of enzyme), indicating the absence of disulfide bonds in the molecule. One-fourth of the thiol groups in the native enzyme was reactive. The addition of denaturing agents activated the remaining thiol groups, which presumably had been protected in the interior of the molecule. These results indicate that the enzyme must contain at least four thiol groups (cysteine residues). The empirical weight of the enzyme, therefore, was estimated to be 33,000. A value of 33,300 was obtained when the empirical weight was calculated from the total amino acid composition of the enzyme. The minimal-molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation was 132,000, indicating that the enzyme may be composed of four 33,000 molecular weight subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 5.38, indicating that the enzyme is an acidic protein. Crystals of the enzyme were examined by light and electron microscopy. Individual protein molecules were visualized in crystals negatively stained with phosphotungstate. The approximate dimensions of these molecules indicate that they are probably the subunits of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1997131342,"Mice of the RIII and C57BL strains were treated with rabbit antiserum to thymus (ATS), and cells of their lymph nodes were analyzed serologi-cally at intervals after treatment. While lymph-node cells of untreated mice were sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of isoantibodies against the theta antigen, lymph-node cells of ATS-treated mice showed a significantly reduced sensitivity. Three days after ATS treatment lymph-node cells of most mice were completely refractory to the cytotoxic effect of theta antibodies. Administration of normal rabbit serum elicited only a slight reduction of the sensitivity of lymph-node cells to the cytotoxic effect of theta antibodies. The results support the hypothesis that ATS treatment selectively affects a population of thymus-dependent circulating lymphocytes."

Over the temperature range 1.4-201° K the oxidized plant proteins are either totally diamagnetic or exhibit trace paramagnetism. The reduced proteins are strongly paramagnetic with a susceptibility appropriate for a single unpaired electron per molecule of protein. The protein from Chromatium is strongly paramagnetic in the oxidized state, again with 1 unpaired electron per molecule of protein. The reduced protein is essentially diamagnetic."
https://openalex.org/W1664124560,"Abstract Multiple hemoglobins exist in hemolysates of red cells from both tadpole and adult of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. The proportions and amino acid compositions of the hemoglobin components show considerable variability in hemolysates from different tadpole populations. Amino acid analyses of the polypeptide chains from the major hemoglobin components do not suggest the presence of any chain common to both tadpole and adult bullfrog. Component C (but not B) from the adult polymerizes to form octamers and larger aggregates by disulfide linkage between tetramers. All cysteinyl residues of Component B are reactive to iodoacetamide. Neither reaction with iodoacetamide nor polymerization significantly affect the oxygen equilibrium of frog hemoglobin. Component B has twice the Bohr effect of Component C and a much lower oxygen affinity, particularly at low pH. The oxygen equilibria of mixtures show that Components B and C interact with one another."
https://openalex.org/W1968709532,"Autumnal mass migrations of spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, involve diurnal movements of thousands of individuals in single-file queues. Initiation, posture, and alignment of a queue can be effected entirely by tactile cues received through antennular inner rami, pereiopods, and antennae. Since spiny lobsters queue when deprived of shelter, this behavior may serve a defensive function. Specimens captured while migrating maintain the queue indoors for up to several weeks, whereas at other times the queue lasts only a few hours. Hence, the migratory behavior probably depends in part upon environmentally induced neurohormonal changes."
https://openalex.org/W1531198678,"The protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis was incubated in a growth medium containing added unlabeled cholesterol or 26-14C-cholesterol with the following consequences: (a) the biosynthesis of tetrahymanol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol produced in the organism by squalene cyclization, was inhibited, and (b) the cholesterol was accumulated by the cells and converted metabolically to a mixture of other sterols containing Δ5,7,22-cholestatrien-3β-ol(7,22-bisdehydrocholesterol) as the major component, together with 22-dehydrocholesterol and possibly a small amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol. These three sterols, along with unconverted cholesterol, were obtained in the unsaponifiable lipid fraction from the cells, and were separated from one another by silicic acid-silver nitrate column chromatography of the corresponding acetylated derivatives. The 22-dehydrocholesterol and the recovered cholesterol were rigorously identified by comparisons of various chromatographic, spectral, and other properties of the alcohols and their acetates with those of authentic samples. The tentative identification of the 7-dehydrocholesterol was based on chromatographic comparisons of the acetate derivative with authentic material. The structure of the 7,22-bisdehydrocholesterol, a previously unknown compound, was established on the basis of ultraviolet, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral data for both the free sterol and its acetate derivative, and also by chemical conversions of the acetate to known compounds. Thus, hydrogenation of the 7,22-bisdehydrocholesteryl acetate with a Raney nickel catalyst gave lathosteryl acetate, and periodate-permanganate oxidation of the triene acetate gave isovaleric acid. It is suggested that the conversion of cholesterol to 7,22-bisdehydrocholesterol in the cells proceeds by way of either 7-dehydrocholesterol or 22-dehydrocholesterol as intermediate."

A procedure was used which differs significantly from those employed by others who have isolated this enzyme from animal tissues. The purified enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of 5.5 µmoles of acetyl-CoA per min per mg of protein under optimum assay conditions. Apparent Km values were determined for acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, bicarbonate, and ATP (which gave two values). The effects of varying the concentrations of citrate or Mg++ yielded sigmoid saturation curves. Phospholipids were found to stimulate the enzyme."

The enzyme hydrolyzed glyceryl 1-monodecanoate at a rapid rate; the Km is 1.61 x 10-3 m. The hydrolysis rates of corresponding di- and triglycerides were one-third and one-hundredth of that of glycerol 1-monodecanoate, respectively. The enzyme showed little hydrolytic activity on long chain mono-, and di- and triglycerides. p-Nitrophenyl esters of short chain fatty acids were hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. Diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, at a concentration of 1 x 10-4 m, inhibited the enzyme activity completely; thus the enzyme was tentatively classified as the B-type described by Aldridge."

https://openalex.org/W2056344242,Freeze-etched neuropil of the cat subfornical organ was examined with the electron microscope for synaptic vesicles. Round vesicles were found exclusively in both unfixed and aldehyde-fixed specimens. Range of diameters and histograms failed to differ significantly between freeze-etched and conventionally prepared material. The mode of distribution of diameters was approximately 500 angstroms. Round stomata (approximately 350 angstroms in diameter) were found at the outer surface of the plasmalemma of nerve terminals; they are interpreted as pinocytotic vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1747782241,"Abstract An apoenzyme, free of flavin mononucleotide, can be prepared by several different methods from cytochrome b2, l(+)-lactate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.2.3) of bakers' yeast. This material shows a complex circular dichroism (CD) spectrum which is strongly dependent on the oxidation state of the heme group. The numerous CD extrema in the region of absorption by the heme group result from interactions of the normally optically inactive protoheme with the protein environment. The CD spectrum below 250 mµ, which is of the type usually ascribed to the α-helical structure, is completely independent of the oxidation state of the heme group. Freshly prepared apoenzyme, on treatment with excess FMN and l-lactate, recovers about 80% of the original enzymic activity and has a CD spectrum very nearly identical with that of the original enzyme. FMN has no effect on the CD extrema below 250 mµ. Aging of the apoenzyme leads to denatured material with impaired ability to yield active enzyme on treatment with FMN and l-lactate. Even completely inactive material has an essentially unchanged CD spectrum above 250 mµ but a significantly altered one below this wave length. It has been found that both inactivated enzyme and inactivated apoenzyme can be partially reactivated by treatment with p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate followed by mercaptoethanol. If partially reactivated apoenzyme is treated with FMN and l-lactate, the resultant material has a CD spectrum above 250 mµ which approaches fairly closely to that of the native enzyme, while the spectrum below 250 mµ remains unaffected by the reactivation. The various observations reported in this and in previous papers suggest that a direct heme-FMN interaction is responsible for the catalytic and optical properties of cytochrome b2."

https://openalex.org/W1562277735,Abstract A well supported mechanism for succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase (EC 2.8.3.5) involving an enzyme-CoA intermediate requires the participation of an oxygen atom of the enzyme or of the CoA moiety. Measurements of loss of 18O from acetoacetate show that CoA oxygens do not participate. An oxygen-containing group on the enzyme is reversibly labeled from succinate-18O in the presence of acetoacetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA. The 18O-labeled enzyme does not contain succinyl or CoA moieties. A binding of acetoacetate-14C to the enzyme preparation does not appear to reflect an anhydride precursor to the enzyme-CoA form.
