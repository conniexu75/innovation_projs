https://openalex.org/W2011238950,Discrimination of synthetic speech sounds was studied in 1- and 4-month-old infants. The speech sounds varied along an acoustic dimension previously shown to cue phonemic distinctions among the voiced and voiceless stop consonants in adults. Discriminability was measured by an increase in conditioned response rate to a second speech sound after habituation to the first speech sound. Recovery from habituation was greater for a given acoustic difference when the two stimuli were from different adult phonemic categories than when they were from the same category. The discontinuity in discrimination at the region of the adult phonemic boundary was taken as evidence for categorical perception.
https://openalex.org/W2060852353,"Six reasonable models of trophic exploitation in a two-species ecosystem whose exploiters compete only by depleting each other's resource supply are presented. In each case, increasing the supply of limiting nutrients or energy tends to destroy the steady state. Thus man must be very careful in attempting to enrich an ecosystem in order to increase its food yield. There is a real chance that such activity may result in decimation of the food species that are wanted in greater abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2053631137,"Subjects learned and recognized patterns which were marginally visible, requiring them to fixate directly each feature to which they wished to attend. Fixed ""scanpaths,"" specific to subject and pattern, appeared in their saccadic eye movements, both intermittently during learning and in initial eye movements during recognition. A proposed theory of pattern perception explains these results."
https://openalex.org/W1964965259,"Three groups of two subjects each were kept in underground chambers, first for 4 days in an artificial light-dark cycle, and thereafter for 4 days in complete darkness. They lived on a rigorous time schedule. Physiological as well as psychological functions were measured at 3-hour intervals. There were no differences in the results between the two sections of the experiment. Social cues are sufficient to entrain human circadian rhythms, and absence of light has no immediate effect on the functions measured."
https://openalex.org/W1989332521,Colony-forming cells have been found in the peripheral blood of man and have been grown in vitro by use of a soft agar gel technique. It has been possible to collect these cells with a blood-cell separator in numbers similar to those found in the peripheral circulation. Repeat leukapheresis of the same donor does not reduce the number of circulating colony-forming cells.
https://openalex.org/W1998757082,"Antibodies to prostaglandin were obtained by immunization of rabbits with PGA(1), PGA(2), and PGE(1), protein conjugates of prostaglandins. The antibodies demonstrated specificity toward both the cyclopentane ring and the aliphatic side chains. With the use of these antibodies a highly sensitive radio-immunoassay capable of measuring less than picomolar amounts of PGA1, PGA2, and PGE1 has been developed."
https://openalex.org/W2026723997,"In wild-type Drosophila melanogaster females there are about 250 ribosomal RNA genes in each nucleolus organizer region of the two X chromosomes. When this same nucleolus organizer region is present in flies in only a single dose, the number of ribosomal RNA genes increases to approximately 400. This increase is most easily explained by disproportionate replication of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2038241495,"It was demonstrated, by use of extracorporeal cross-circulation, that a humoral factor responsible for liver regeneration does not arise from the liver remnant. While intact livers of normal rats incorporated [methyl-(3)H]- thymidine in proportion to the amount of liver removed in the partner, the greatest response occurred after a total hepatectomy. Evidence from portacaval-shunted,partially hepatectomized animals connected to normal members indicates that the factor is in portal blood and that the onset of regeneration is the result of a quantitative imbalance between the available portal blood factor and the number of liver cells present."
https://openalex.org/W2061083625,Random-dot stereograms when used as adaptation stimuli can influence the perceived depth of similar test stimuli. Adaptation for 1 minute is sufficient to evoke this three-dimensional aftereffect for several seconds. This aftereffect must occur after stereopsis because prior to stereopsis no relevant monocular cues exist in these adaptation and test stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2034399264,"In distinct contrast to the restricted movements of coastal stocks of lobsters (Homarus americanus), those inhabiting the outer continental shelf undertake extensive seasonal migrations. Of 5710 tagged lobsters released on the outer continental shelf off New England from April 1968 to June 1969, 400 had been recaptured by April 1970. The distribution of the recoveries demonstrated shoalward migration in spring and summer and a return to the edge of the shelf in fall and winter. Deep-sea lobsters have a faster rate of growth than coastal lobsters; growth increments at molting and the frequency of molting are greater."
https://openalex.org/W2132988585,"There are three processes weakly concentration-dependent that keep changes in concentration of atmospheric pressure from being a random walk-inhibition of net photosynthesis by oxygen, the passage of hydrogen through the oxidizing part of the atmosphere before it escapes from the earth, and burial of reduced carbon in anaerobic water. A stronger regulator seems desirable but remains to be found. The cause of the initial rise in oxygen concentration presents a serious and unresolved quantitative problem."

https://openalex.org/W2029794673,"During the course of development of muscle cells in certain tunicates, a sign of regenerative membrane response appears in the gastrula stage. In the early tadpole larva, the action potential consists of a spike followed by a plateau. The latter-disappears in fully differentiated cells, conceivably in association with the establishment of delayed rectification."

https://openalex.org/W2061634006,"The amount of acceptance of each amino acid per absorbancy unit of rabbit reticulocyte transfer RNA was determined. The results were compared with the amino acid composition of rabbit hemoglobin and with a similar determination of the transfer RNA content of rabbit liver. The histidine and isoleucine transfer RNA content of reticulocytes is specialized for the synthesis of hemoglobin, in which histidine is unusually common and isoleucine unusually scarce compared to most proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2027349105,The frequency of carriers of the P(a)and P(c) alleles of the gene for acid phosphatase in the erythrocyte is significantly higher in male subjects deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and having hemolytic clinical favism than it is in the general population. This observation seems to indicate that alleles (P(a) and P(c)) of a gene polymorphic in all human populations affect the fitness of the involved phenotypes in special genotypic and nongenotypic conditions.
https://openalex.org/W2012031011,"In frog sartorius muscles immersed for 2 hours at 26 degrees C in normal Ringer solution, the intrafiber potassium concentration, C(K)(in millimoles per liter), was 123 +/- 2 (mean value plus or minus standard error), and the potassium activity, a(K) (in millimoles per liter), was 90 +/- 1.0. The corresponding sodium concentration and activity were 20 +/- 1 and 6.5 +/- 0.4, respectively. After overnight immersion in K+-free Ringer solution the values were: CK, 97 +/- 2; aK, 81.5 +/- 1.6; CNa, 47 +/- 2; and aNa, 11.2 +/- 0.6. The changes in aK and aNa during storage were not consistent with an exchange between predominantly ""free"" fiber K+ and external Na+. These results suggest that the Na+ taken up during overnight immersion largely replaced adsorbed or sequestered K+ in the fibers."

https://openalex.org/W2038515700,"Microsomal oxidase activity is increased up to sixfold in dieldrin-resistant houseflies exposed to sublethal doses of dieldrin. The net increase in enzyme activity is greater in a strain initially high in oxidase activity than in a strain low in this respect, and this tendency is carried into the F(1) hybrids of the strains."
https://openalex.org/W2089189838,The transition from granular to homogeneous chloroplasts in vivo in Egeria densa caused by environmental conditions was paralleled by a decrease in photosynthetic enhancement from 30 percent to nearly zero. The drop in enhancement can be explained either by a change in the partitioning of light energy between the two photosystems or a change to a single photosystem.

https://openalex.org/W1979125992,"A genetically determined malfunction of energy conservation reduces assimilation of substrate to half or less its normal level while leaving oxidative processes apparently unchanged. This metabolic defect, which differs in many ways from any previously described, is related to the function of the B incompatibility factor and occurs both in the common A heterokaryon (A = B not equal)-in which two compatible, wild B factors interact-and in mutant-B homokaryons."
https://openalex.org/W1994172583,"The passive transfer of allergic encephalomyelitis can be produced in a single day. In work described, the procedure was made to coincide with a transient drug-induced deficiency of lymphocytes. As a result, the lesions of this autoimmune disease contained a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes instead of the usual mononuclear cells. Not only is this a new histologic form of the disease, but the ready recognition of polymorphonuclears as reactive cells provides a powerful new tool for investigating the roles of immunologically specific effector cells and nonspecific reactive cells in production of tissue damage."

When these cleaned cells are viewed with a scanning electron microscope, organelle outlines can be seen through the thinned pellicle. To view organelles directly, fixed Euglena cells are gently broken first or first frozen and then broken as part of their preparation for scanning electron microscopy. Subsequent viewing at magnifications of x 5,000 to x 21,000 reveals organelles, storage granules, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear pores, while retaining great depth of focus."
https://openalex.org/W2015011414,The death of an estimated 500000 people in Pakistan in November 1970 was attributed to a cyclone but one could say just as reasonably that they were killed by overpopulation since if Pakistan were not overcrowded men would not live on the Gangetic delta. Likewise deaths now attributed to diseases whose antecedent is malnutrition and deaths from respiratory diseases in industrial cities might also be ascribed to overpopulation. But to identify overpopulation as the cause would lead to a threatening question: How can population be controlled without recourse to repugnant measures? It is more comforting to blame these deaths on Fate.

https://openalex.org/W2061736817,In response to an article by N.T. Adler and S.R. Zoloth (Science 168: 1481. 1970) in which postcopulatory genital stimulation was postulated as a contraceptive in the rat P. Dziuk states that this suggestion was not substantiated. He indicates that removal of the vaginal plug itself did not inhibit pregnancy but that it may have resulted in loss of sperm from the uterus. Adler and Zoloth respond by suggesting that Dziuks disagreement is semantic in relation to the definition of pregnancy and the functional role of behavior in pregnancy regulation. Adler and Zoloth concluded that cervical stimulation after ejaculation disrupts the pregnancy; the loss of function of the vaginal plug apparently resulted in interference with sperm transport. Immediate permanent ingress of sperm did not automatically follow ejaculation and deposition of a plug. Double-mating experiments seemed to support Adler and Zoloths conclusion that postejaculatory cervical stimulation is contraceptive in rats and inhibits the effects of a previous ejaculation.
https://openalex.org/W2006843093,Proton magnetic resonance spectra of aqueous gelatin were analyzed with respect to composition and molecular interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2006475676,"If parthenogenesis occurred in bisexual organisms, it would produce an excess of females and depress the sex ratio. The phenotypes of female mice, from matings that produce an excess of females, were examined for evidence of the presence of marker genes of paternal origin. All proved to be hybrids of the maternal and paternal strains, thus excluding parthenogenesis as the cause of the low sex ratio."
