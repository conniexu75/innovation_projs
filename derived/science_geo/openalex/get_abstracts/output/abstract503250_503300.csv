https://openalex.org/W2035684909,"Background Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is a leading risk factor for chronic disease globally, but much of the world’s population does not consume the recommended servings of FV daily. It remains unknown whether global supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs. We sought to determine whether supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs, globally and in individual countries. Methods and Findings We used global data on agricultural production and population size to compare supply of FV in 2009 with population need, globally and in individual countries. We found that the global supply of FV falls, on average, 22% short of population need according to nutrition recommendations (supply:need ratio: 0.78 [Range: 0.05–2.01]). This ratio varies widely by country income level, with a median supply:need ratio of 0.42 and 1.02 in low-income and high-income countries, respectively. A sensitivity analysis accounting for need-side food wastage showed similar insufficiency, to a slightly greater extent (global supply:need ratio: 0.66, varying from 0.37 [low-income countries] to 0.77 [high-income countries]). Using agricultural production and population projections, we also estimated supply and need for FV for 2025 and 2050. Assuming medium fertility and projected growth in agricultural production, the global supply:need ratio for FV increases slightly to 0.81 by 2025 and to 0.88 by 2050, with similar patterns seen across country income levels. In a sensitivity analysis assuming no change from current levels of FV production, the global supply:need ratio for FV decreases to 0.66 by 2025 and to 0.57 by 2050. Conclusion The global nutrition and agricultural communities need to find innovative ways to increase FV production and consumption to meet population health needs, particularly in low-income countries."

Likewise, host behavioural changes can be a defence mechanism, counteracting the impact of pathogens on host fitness. We apply harmonic radar technology to characterize the impact of an emerging pathogen--Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia)--on honeybee (Apis mellifera) flight and orientation performance in the field. Honeybees are the most important commercial pollinators. Emerging diseases have been proposed to play a prominent role in colony decline, partly through sub-lethal behavioural manipulation of their hosts. We found that homing success was significantly reduced in diseased (65.8%) versus healthy foragers (92.5%). Although lost bees had significantly reduced continuous flight times and prolonged resting times, other flight characteristics and navigational abilities showed no significant difference between infected and non-infected bees. Our results suggest that infected bees express normal flight characteristics but are constrained in their homing ability, potentially compromising the colony by reducing its resource inputs, but also counteracting the intra-colony spread of infection. We provide the first high-resolution analysis of sub-lethal effects of an emerging disease on insect flight behaviour. The potential causes and the implications for both host and parasite are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2055619549,"Previous reports have suggested that human CD4(+) CD25(hi)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) have functional plasticity and may differentiate into effector T cells under inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings remain unclear. Here we identified the residue serine 422 of human FOXP3 as a phosphorylation site that regulates its function, which is not present in murine Foxp3. PIM1 kinase, which is highly expressed in human Tregs, was found to be able to interact with and to phosphorylate human FOXP3 at serine 422. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling inhibits PIM1 induction, whereas IL-6 promotes PIM1 expression in in vitro expanded human Tregs. PIM1 negatively regulates FOXP3 chromatin binding activity by specifically phosphorylating FOXP3 at Ser(422). Our data also suggest that phosphorylation of FOXP3 at the Ser(418) site could prevent FOXP3 phosphorylation at Ser(422) mediated by PIM1. Knockdown of PIM1 in in vitro expanded human Tregs promoted FOXP3-induced target gene expression, including CD25, CTLA4, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), or weakened FOXP3-suppressed IL-2 gene expression and enhanced the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Furthermore, PIM1-specific inhibitor boosted FOXP3 DNA binding activity in in vitro expanded primary Tregs and also enhanced their suppressive activity toward the proliferation of T effector cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PIM1 could be a new potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of human-specific autoimmune diseases because of its ability to modulate the immunosuppressive activity of human Tregs."
https://openalex.org/W1999931646,"Canopy gaps created by wind-throw events, or blowdowns, create a complex mosaic of forest patches varying in disturbance intensity and recovery in the Central Amazon. Using field and remote sensing data, we investigated the short-term (four-year) effects of large (>2000 m(2)) blowdown gaps created during a single storm event in January 2005 near Manaus, Brazil, to study (i) how forest structure and composition vary with disturbance gradients and (ii) whether tree diversity is promoted by niche differentiation related to wind-throw events at the landscape scale. In the forest area affected by the blowdown, tree mortality ranged from 0 to 70%, and was highest on plateaus and slopes. Less impacted areas in the region affected by the blowdown had overlapping characteristics with a nearby unaffected forest in tree density (583 ± 46 trees ha(-1)) (mean ± 99% Confidence Interval) and basal area (26.7 ± 2.4 m(2) ha(-1)). Highly impacted areas had tree density and basal area as low as 120 trees ha(-1) and 14.9 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. In general, these structural measures correlated negatively with an index of tree mortality intensity derived from satellite imagery. Four years after the blowdown event, differences in size-distribution, fraction of resprouters, floristic composition and species diversity still correlated with disturbance measures such as tree mortality and gap size. Our results suggest that the gradients of wind disturbance intensity encompassed in large blowdown gaps (>2000 m(2)) promote tree diversity. Specialists for particular disturbance intensities existed along the entire gradient. The existence of species or genera taking an intermediate position between undisturbed and gap specialists led to a peak of rarefied richness and diversity at intermediate disturbance levels. A diverse set of species differing widely in requirements and recruitment strategies forms the initial post-disturbance cohort, thus lending a high resilience towards wind disturbances at the community level."
https://openalex.org/W2093081635,"The phytochemical content, antioxidant activity and antiproliferative properties of three diverse varieties of proso millet are reported. The free phenolic content ranged from 27.48 (Gumi 20) to 151.14 (Mi2504-6) mg gallic acid equiv/100 g DW. The bound phenolic content ranged from 55.95 (Gumi20) to 305.81 (Mi2504-6) mg gallic acid equiv/100 g DW. The percentage contribution of bound phenolic to the total phenolic content of genotype samples analyzed ranged between 62.08% and 67.05%. Ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid are the predominant phenolic acid found in bound fraction. Caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid were also detected. Syringic acid was detected only in the free fraction. The antioxidant activity was assessed using the hydrophilic peroxyl radical scavenging capacity (PSC) assay. The PSC antioxidant activity of the free fraction ranged from 57.68 (Mi2504-6) to 147.32 (Gumi20) µmol of vitamin C equiv/100 g DW. The PSC antioxidant activity of the bound fraction ranged from 95.38 (Mizao 52) to 136.48 (Gumi 20) µmol of vitamin C equiv/100 g DW. The cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) of the extract was assessed using the HepG2 model. CAA value ranged from 2.51 to 6.10 µmol equiv quercetin/100 g DW. Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro against MDA human breast cancer and HepG2 human liver cancer cells. Results exhibited a differential and possible selective antiproliferative property of the proso millet. These results may be used to direct the consumption of proso millet with improved health properties."
https://openalex.org/W2008109649,"Enteric fever, caused by Salmonella enterica, remains an unresolved public health problem in India and antimicrobial therapy is the main mode of treatment. The objective of this study was to characterize the Salmonella enterica isolates from Kolkata with respect to their antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence profiles and molecular subtypes. Salmonella enterica blood isolates were collected from clinically suspected enteric fever patients attending various hospitals in Kolkata, India from January 2009 to June 2013 and were tested for AMR profiles by standard protocols; for resistance gene transfer by conjugation; for resistance and virulence genes profiles by PCR; and for molecular subtypes by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). A total of 77 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and 25 Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) from Kolkata were included in this study. Although multidrug resistance (resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole) was decreasing in S. Typhi (18.2%) and absent in S. Paratyphi A, increased resistance to fluoroquinolone, the current drug of choice, caused growing concern for typhoid treatment. A single, non-conjugative non-IncHI1 plasmid of 180 kb was found in 71.4% multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Typhi; the remaining 28.6% isolates were without plasmid. Various AMR markers (blaTEM-1, catA, sul1, sul2, dfrA15, strA-strB) and class 1 integron with dfrA7 gene were detected in MDR S. Typhi by PCR and sequencing. Most of the study isolates were likely to be virulent due to the presence of virulence markers. Major diversity was not noticed among S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A from Kolkata by PFGE. The observed association between AMR profiles and S. Typhi pulsotypes might be useful in controlling the spread of the organism by appropriate intervention. The study reiterated the importance of continuous monitoring of AMR and molecular subtypes of Salmonella isolates from endemic regions for better understanding of the disease epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W1989297192,"Astrogliosis with glial scar formation after damage to the nervous system is a major impediment to axonal regeneration and functional recovery. The present study examined the role of β1-integrin signaling in regulating astrocytic differentiation of neural stem cells. In the adult spinal cord β1-integrin is expressed predominantly in the ependymal region where ependymal stem cells (ESCs) reside. β1-integrin signaling suppressed astrocytic differentiation of both cultured ESCs and subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells. Conditional knockout of β1-integrin enhanced astrogliogenesis both by cultured ESCs and by SVZ progenitor cells. Previous studies have shown that injection into the injured spinal cord of a self-assembling peptide amphiphile that displays an IKVAV epitope (IKVAV-PA) limits glial scar formation and enhances functional recovery. Here we find that injection of IKVAV-PA induced high levels of β1-integrin in ESCs in vivo, and that conditional knockout of β1-integrin abolished the astroglial suppressive effects of IKVAV-PA in vitro. Injection into an injured spinal cord of PAs expressing two other epitopes known to interact with β1-integrin, a Tenascin C epitope and the fibronectin epitope RGD, improved functional recovery comparable to the effects of IKVAV-PA. Finally we found that the effects of β1-integrin signaling on astrogliosis are mediated by integrin linked kinase (ILK). These observations demonstrate an important role for β1-integrin/ILK signaling in regulating astrogliosis from ESCs and suggest ILK as a potential target for limiting glial scar formation after nervous system injury."
https://openalex.org/W1970760387,"The potential for application of any nanoparticles, including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), is strongly dependent on their stability against aggregation. Therefore, improvement of this parameter is a key task, especially in the case of AgNPs, because a correlation between size and biological activity has been demonstrated. In the present work, a natural stabilizer, gelatin, was investigated for the stabilization of AgNPs in an aqueous dispersion. The particles were prepared via a modified Tollens process, and the gelatin modifier was added prior to the reducing agent. The stability against aggregation of the AgNPs prepared by this method was more than one order of magnitude higher (on the basis of the critical coagulation concentration (CCC)) than that of AgNPs prepared via a similar method but without the assistance of gelatin. Their high stability against aggregation was confirmed over wide pH range (from 2 to 13) in which the particles did not exhibit rapid aggregation; such stability has not been previously reported for AgNPs. Additionally, gelatin not only fulfills the role of a unique stabilizer but also positively influences the modified Tollens process used to prepare the AgNPs. The diameter of the gelatin-modified AgNPs was substantially smaller in comparison to those prepared without gelatin. The polydispersity of the dispersion significantly narrowed. Moreover, the gelatin-stabilized AgNPs exhibited long-term stability against aggregation and maintained high antibacterial activity when stored for several months under ambient conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2031246473,"Dematiaceous fungi (black fungi) are a heterogeneous group of fungi present in diverse environments worldwide. Many species in this group are known to cause allergic reactions and potentially fatal diseases in humans and animals, especially in tropical and subtropical climates. This study represents the first survey of dematiaceous fungi in Malaysia and provides observations on their diversity as well as in vitro response to antifungal drugs. Seventy-five strains isolated from various clinical specimens were identified by morphology as well as an internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based phylogenetic analysis. The combined molecular and conventional approach enabled the identification of three classes of the Ascomycota phylum and 16 genera, the most common being Cladosporium, Cochliobolus and Neoscytalidium. Several of the species identified have not been associated before with human infections. Among 8 antifungal agents tested, the azoles posaconazole (96%), voriconazole (90.7%), ketoconazole (86.7%) and itraconazole (85.3%) showed in vitro activity (MIC ≤ 1 µg/mL) to the largest number of strains, followed by anidulafungin (89.3%), caspofungin (74.7%) and amphotericin B (70.7%). Fluconazole appeared to be the least effective with only 10.7% of isolates showing in vitro susceptibility. Overall, almost half (45.3%) of the isolates showed reduced susceptibility (MIC >1 µg/mL) to at least one antifungal agent, and three strains (one Pyrenochaeta unguis-hominis and two Nigrospora oryzae) showed potential multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2062849749,"In tropical wet forests, ants are a large proportion of the animal biomass, but the factors determining abundance are not well understood. We characterized ant abundance in the litter layer of 41 mature wet forest sites spread throughout Central America (Chiapas, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) and examined the impact of elevation (as a proxy for temperature) and community species richness. Sites were intentionally chosen to minimize variation in precipitation and seasonality. From sea level to 1500 m ant abundance very gradually declined, community richness declined more rapidly than abundance, and the local frequency of the locally most common species increased. These results suggest that within this elevational zone, density compensation is acting, maintaining high ant abundance as richness declines. In contrast, in sites above 1500 m, ant abundance dropped abruptly to much lower levels. Among these high montane sites, community richness explained much more of the variation in abundance than elevation, and there was no evidence of density compensation. The relative stability of abundance below 1500 m may be caused by opposing effects of temperature on productivity and metabolism. Lower temperatures may decrease productivity and thus the amount of food available for consumers, but slower metabolisms of consumers may allow maintenance of higher biomass at lower resource supply rates. Ant communities at these lower elevations may be highly interactive, the result of continuous habitat presence over geological time. High montane sites may be ephemeral in geological time, resulting in non-interactive communities dominated by historical and stochastic processes. Abundance in these sites may be determined by the number of species that manage to colonize and/or avoid extinction on mountaintops."
https://openalex.org/W2017684558,"K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchangers are broadly expressed in various tissues, and particularly enriched in neurons of the brain. The distinct physiological roles for the different members of this Ca(2+) transporter family are, however, not well described. Here we show that gene-targeted mice lacking the K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger, NCKX4 (gene slc24a4 or Nckx4), display a remarkable anorexia with severe hypophagia and weight loss. Feeding and satiety are coordinated centrally by melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R) in neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The hypophagic response of Nckx4 knock-out mice is accompanied by hyperactivation of neurons in the PVN, evidenced by high levels of c-Fos expression. The activation of PVN neurons in both fasted Nckx4 knock-out and glucose-injected wild-type animals is blocked by Ca(2+) removal and MC4R antagonists. In cultured hypothalamic neurons, melanocyte stimulating hormone induces an MC4R-dependent and sustained Ca(2+) signal, which requires phospholipase C activity and plasma membrane Ca(2+) entry. The Ca(2+) signal is enhanced in hypothalamic neurons from Nckx4 knock-out animals, and is depressed in cells in which NCKX4 is overexpressed. Finally, MC4R-dependent oxytocin expression in the PVN, a key essential step in satiety, is prevented by blocking phospholipase C activation or Ca(2+) entry. These findings highlight an essential, and to our knowledge previously unknown, role for Ca(2+) signaling in the MC4R pathway that leads to satiety, and a novel non-redundant role for NCKX4-mediated Ca(2+) extrusion in controlling MC4R signaling and feeding behavior. Together, these findings highlight a novel pathway that potentially could be exploited to develop much needed new therapeutics to tackle eating disorders and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2006105120,"Phycobiliproteins are employed by cyanobacteria, red algae, glaucophytes, and cryptophytes for light-harvesting and consist of apoproteins covalently associated with open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores. Although the majority of organisms assemble the individual phycobiliproteins into larger aggregates called phycobilisomes, members of the cryptophytes use a single type of phycobiliprotein that is localized in the thylakoid lumen. The cryptophyte Guillardia theta (Gt) uses phycoerythrin PE545 utilizing the uncommon chromophore 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin (DHBV) in addition to phycoerythrobilin (PEB). Both the biosynthesis and the attachment of chromophores to the apophycobiliprotein have not yet been investigated for cryptophytes. In this study, we identified and characterized enzymes involved in PEB biosynthesis. In addition, we present the first in-depth biochemical characterization of a eukaryotic phycobiliprotein lyase (GtCPES). Plastid-encoded HO (GtHo) was shown to convert heme into biliverdin IXα providing the substrate with a putative nucleus-encoded DHBV:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GtPEBA). A PEB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GtPEBB) was found to convert DHBV to PEB, which is the substrate for the phycobiliprotein lyase GtCPES. The x-ray structure of GtCPES was solved at 2.0 Å revealing a 10-stranded β-barrel with a modified lipocalin fold. GtCPES is an S-type lyase specific for binding of phycobilins with reduced C15=C16 double bonds (DHBV and PEB). Site-directed mutagenesis identified residues Glu-136 and Arg-146 involved in phycobilin binding. Based on the crystal structure, a model for the interaction of GtCPES with the apophycobiliprotein CpeB is proposed and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019938294,"Neurons producing serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) constitute one of the most widely distributed neuronal networks in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and exhibit a profuse innervation throughout the CNS already at early stages of development. Serotonergic neuron specification is controlled by a combination of secreted molecules and transcription factors such as Shh, Fgf4/8, Nkx2.2, Lmx1b and Pet1. In the mouse, Pet1 mRNA expression appears between 10 and 11 days post coitum (dpc) in serotonergic post-mitotic precursors and persists in serotonergic neurons up to adulthood, where it promotes the expression of genes defining the mature serotonergic phenotype such as tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) and serotonin transporter (SERT). Hence, the generation of genetic tools based on Pet1 specific expression represents a valuable approach to study the development and function of the serotonergic system. Here, we report the generation of a Pet1(210)-Cre transgenic mouse line in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of a 210 kb fragment from the Pet1 genetic locus to ensure a reliable and faithful control of somatic recombination in Pet1 cell lineage. Besides Cre-mediated recombination accurately occurred in the serotonergic system as expected and according to previous studies, Pet1(210)-Cre transgenic mouse line allowed us to identify novel, so far uncharacterized, Pet1 expression domains. Indeed, we showed that in the raphe Pet1 is expressed also in a non-serotonergic neuronal population intermingled with Tph2-expressing cells and mostly localized in the B8 and B9 nuclei. Moreover, we detected Cre-mediated recombination also in the developing pancreas and in the ureteric bud derivatives of the kidney, where it reflected a specific Pet1 expression. Thus, Pet1(210)-Cre transgenic mouse line faithfully drives Cre-mediated recombination in all Pet1 expression domains representing a valuable tool to genetically manipulate serotonergic and non-serotonergic Pet1 cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2039436414,"In neurons, the plasma membrane is functionally separated into several distinct segments. Neurons form these domains by delivering selected components to and by confining them within each segment of the membrane. Although some mechanisms of the delivery are elucidated, that of the confinement is unclear. We show here that 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (OPPC), a unique molecular species of phospholipids, is concentrated at the protrusion tips of several neuronal culture cells and the presynaptic area of neuronal synapses of the mouse brain. In PC12 cells, NGF-stimulated neuronal differentiation induces a phospholipase A1 activity at the protrusion tips, which co-localizes with the OPPC domain. Inhibition of the phospholipase A1 activity leads to suppression of phospholipid remodeling in the tip membrane and results in disappearance of the OPPC at the tips. In these cells, confinement of dopamine transporter and Gαo proteins to the tip was also disrupted.

These findings link the lateral distribution of the molecular species of phospholipids to the formation of functional segments in the plasma membrane of neurons and to the mechanism of protein confinement at the synapse. In neurons, the plasma membrane is functionally separated into the somatodendritic membrane and several distinct segments of the axon. These membrane compartments are essential for the directional propagation of action potential from the soma to the axon tip and for formation of neural circuits among neurons; however, the mechanisms underlining this compartmentalization are unclear. These compartments maintain distinct distributions of membrane proteins without obvious structural barriers at their boundaries (1.Winckler B. Poo M. No diffusion barrier at axon hillock.Nature. 1996; 379: 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, although the movement of membrane proteins between different compartments across the boundary is slower than that within a compartment, these membrane proteins cross the boundary at a measurable rate (2.Winckler B.

These findings suggest that, in neurons, a different confinement mechanism other than a physical diffusion barrier operates to maintain the distinct compartments. Biochemically, the main constituents of biological membrane are the glycerophospholipids. Besides variety in their hydrophilic portions, phospholipids comprise various molecular species with different fatty acid moieties (4.Hermansson M. Hokynar K. Somerharju P.

However, their distribution at subcellular levels and the biological significance of the variety remain unclear. The variety in the molecular species of phospholipids is produced by the remodeling process or Lands cycle (8.Lands W.E.

After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h before adding 3 mg/liter purified mAb#15 IgM in 5% skim milk and 1% BSA in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing away the primary antibody with PBS, the cells were stained with 200-fold diluted HRP-labeled antibody to mouse IgM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., SC2064) in 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h. The localization of the antigen was revealed by a DAB substrate kit (Nacalai Tesque, 25985-50). These samples were fixed again with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 10 min at 4 °C. They were then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 40 min at 4 °C and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Following dehydration, they were embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd.). Ultrathin sections were observed with a JEM-1400-Plus transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). PC12, Neuro-2a, and COS-7 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 15 min. For immunostaining with mAb#15 antibody, cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h before adding 0.3 mg/liter IgM concentration of mAb#15 culture supernatant in 5% skim milk and 1% BSA in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing the primary antibody with PBS, the cells were stained with 10,000-fold diluted Alexa 488-labeled antibody to mouse IgM (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA in PBS. For the localization study of Thy-1, dopamine transporter (DAT), and Gαo proteins, cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. This solution was used throughout as dilution buffer. Antibodies to Thy-1 (Millipore, MAB1406) and to DAT (Alomone Labs, AMT-003) were used in 100-fold dilution in combination with 5000-fold diluted Alexa 555-labeled antibody to rabbit IgG and Alexa 488-labeled antibody to mouse IgG. Antibody to Gαo (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13532) was used in 25-fold dilution with 2500-fold diluted Alexa 488-labeled antibody to mouse IgG. The cells were observed with a confocal fluorescent microscope with Nomarski optics (Olympus FV10). PC12 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min before treatment with phospholipases. Cells were treated with 0.5% (v/v) phospholipase A1 (PLA1, from Thermomyces lanuginosus; Sigma, L3295) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 kilounits/liter phospholipase A2 (PLA2, from honey bee venom, Sigma, P9279) in TBS, or 150 kilounits/liter phospholipase D (PLD, from cabbage; Sigma, P8398) in 100 mm MES, pH 6.8, 50 mm CaCl2 for 12 h at 25 °C. After the treatments, cells were immunostained with mAb#15 antibody as described above. The tip membrane fractions (TMFs) from NGF-treated PC12 cells or from the untreated cells were purified from 0.5 g each of cell pellet as described (14.Pfenninger K.H. Ellis L. Johnson M.P.

Lipid was extracted from the TMF pellet with chloroform/methanol (1:1). The remaining precipitate was dissolved in SDS-sample buffer for protein analysis. The lipids were separated on a C8 reversed-phase column (OS12S03-1546WT, YMC) at 40 °C by isocratic elution with 10 mm triethylamine acetate, pH 4, in H2O/methanol (7:93) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by a HPLC system (Shimazu, LC-20). Lipid samples were dissolved in 50 µl of methanol and applied to 96-well ELISA plates (Immulon 1B, Thermo). The samples were dried at 80 °C for 30 min. For assays on the HPLC samples, the plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h and then incubated for 1 h with 3 mg/liter mAb#15 antibody in 5% milk, 1% BSA/PBS. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody to mouse IgM (sc-2064, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 30,000-fold dilution in 1% BSA, PBS) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h. After washing the plates with PBS, immunoreactivity was quantified with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) measured with a luminometer (Fluoroskan, Thermo). For binding measurements to lipid standards, the plates were blocked with 0.1% ovalbumin (Wako) in PBS for 1 h and then incubated for 30 min with 10 µg/liter mAb#15 antibody in 5% milk, 3% normal goat serum, PBS. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated F(ab′)2 antibody fragment to mouse IgM (ab5930, Abcam), 2,000-fold dilution in 1% BSA, PBS) was added, followed by incubation for 30 min. After washing the plates with PBS, immunoreactivity was quantified as above. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and sphingomyelin from bovine brain (S7004) were from Sigma. Dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (OPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dioleoylphosphatidylserine and dioleoylphosphatidylinositol were from Avanti Polar Lipids. For the analysis of the tip membrane fractions, the lipid samples were mixed with equal volumes of 12.5 g/liter 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) (Sigma)/DHB-Li (Wako) 9:1 mix or 12.5 g/liter DHB/DHB-Na (Wako) 9:1 mix in 1:1 methanol/H2O as described (16.Cvacka J. Svatos A. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis of lipids and high molecular weight hydrocarbons with lithium 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate matrix.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One microliter of the mix was spotted onto a sample plate. The solution of matrix and analyte on the sample plate was allowed to dry for a few min. The crystal that formed was analyzed with an ABI SCIEX TOF-TOF 5800 mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. For quantitative analysis, 6.25 pmol of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was mixed to each spot as a calibration standard. For MS/MS analysis, collision-induced dissociation fragmentation was performed with a collision energy of 2 kV (17.Al-Saad K.A. Siems W.F. Hill H.H. Zabrouskov V. Knowles N.R. Structural analysis of phosphatidylcholines by post-source decay matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the analysis of 7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)-labeled standards in negative ion mode, 0.17 m p-nitroaniline (Wako) in 1:1 methanol/H2O was used as a matrix. To make liposome preparations, lipid mixtures containing 0.125 mg (20% mol/mol of PC) cholesterol and total 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine consisting of 90% mol/mol DPPC and 10% mol/mol of either DPPC, 1-palmitoyl-lyso-PC (Sigma, L5254) or 1-oleoyl-lyso-PC (Sigma, L1881) were dried in a nitrogen gas stream. The dried lipid membranes were sonicated in a bath type sonicator in a 1-ml solution of 0.1% bromphenol blue in PBS for 30 min at 70 °C. The liposome solutions were mixed with 2.3 ml of 2.2 m sucrose, PBS solution; layered in 12-ml tubes under 6 ml of 1 m sucrose, PBS and 3 ml of PBS; and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The interface fractions between PBS and 1 m sucrose were recovered as liposome fractions, diluted with PBS to a 12-ml volume, and centrifuged again as above. The liposome pellets were suspended in PBS, and their phosphatidylcholine contents were measured by a phospholipid assay kit (Wako, 296-63801). To measure the binding of mAb#15 to liposomes, each 20-µg liposome was mixed with 100 ng of mAb#15 in 100 µl of 0.1 g/liter BSA, PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The liposomes were washed once with PBS by precipitation with 15,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with 10 mg/liter Alexa 488-labeled antibody to mouse IgM in 100 µl of 0.1 g/liter BSA, PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The liposomes were washed twice with PBS as above. The binding of mAb#15 to liposomes was quantified by a flow cytometer (Attune, ABI) with a fluorescence of 488 nm and using a gate of FSC-A > 6M. To the lipid array (PIP strip, P-6001 Echelon Bioscience), OPPC (100 pmol) was spotted as a positive control. The array membrane was blocked with 0.3% ovalbumin (Wako) in PBS for 1 h and then incubated for 30 min with 0.5 mg/liter mAb#15 antibody in 5% milk in PBS. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated antibody to mouse IgM (1021-05, SouthernBiotech), 5,000-fold dilution in 0.3% ovalbumin in PBS) was added, followed by incubation for 30 min. After washing the membrane with PBS, the binding of mAb#15 to lipid spots was developed by a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and recorded on x-ray films. Two adult male mice (C57BL/6) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and perfused with 15 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The isolated brains were processed as described (18.Tamaki H. Yamashina S. Improved method for post-embedding cytochemistry using reduced osmium and LR white resin.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were blocked with 50 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min and 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with mAb#15 culture supernatant (3 mg/liter) for 12 h. These samples were then incubated with 3-fold diluted 10-nm immunogold-labeled antibody to mouse IgM (Aurion, 810.033) for 2 h. These were postfixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 min and washed with water. These sections were observed with an H-7100 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). PC12 cells treated with NGF for specified periods were washed extensively with DMEM without serum and phenol red (DMEM−SP) (Wako, 040-30095). The cells were cultured with DMEM−SP in the continuous presence of 50 µg/liter NGF during the assay. For the PLA1 assay of live cells, 1 µm PED-A1 substrate (Invitrogen) was added to the medium. The cells were immediately observed for less than 30 min with a confocal fluorescent microscopy with the excitation wave length at 488 nm and the emission band pass between 500 and 600 nm. For the PLA2 assay, 1 µm PC-A2 substrate (Invitrogen) was added instead to the medium. The rest of the procedure was similar to that used for the PLA1 assay of live cells. For the simultaneous staining of mAb#15 and PED-A1, PC12 cells treated with NGF for 36 or 48 h were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 15 min. At first, cells were processed as described for the immunostaining with mAb#15, except the secondary antibody was 10,000-fold diluted Alexa 555-labeled antibody to mouse IgM (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA in PBS. After washing the secondary antibody, 3 µm PED-A1 in PBS was applied. The cells were immediately observed with a confocal fluorescent microscopy, using an excitation wavelength at 488 nm for PLA1 and at 545 nm for mAb#15 with sequential scan mode. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE)-NBD, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine(DPPE)-NBD, and DOPE-NBD were synthesized by mixing either 1.6 mm POPE, DPPE, or DOPE (Avanti Polar Lipids) with 25 mm 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (Dojin) in methanol with 15 mm EDTA, 37.5 mm sodium borate, pH 8, at 60 °C for 5 min. Excess NBD was removed with Presep RPP reversed-phased columns (Wako, 294-36851). The products were further purified on a C8 reversed-phase column by isocratic elution with 10 mm triethylamine acetate, pH 4, in H2O/methanol (8:92) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elusion was monitored by the fluorescence of NBD at excitation/emission = 460/535 nm. For 1-acyl-2-hydroxy-phosphatidylethanolamine-NBD (lyso-PE-NBD) standards, 500 pmol of either DPPE-NBD or DOPE-NBD dissolved in 250 µl of hexane was hydrolyzed by 3 units of PLA2 (Sigma, P9279) in 250 µl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, at 25 °C for 12 h with rotation. Each lyso-PE-NBD was recovered from the aqueous phase by Presep RPP columns. These products were further purified on a C18 reversed-phase column (Imtakt, CD036) at 65 °C by isocratic elution with 50 mm triethylamine acetate, pH 4, in H2O/methanol (17:83) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The identity of the products was verified by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis as described above. The purified lipids were evaporated with an N2 gas stream and dissolved in ethanol. For remodeling experiments, 1 × 107 PC12 cells in 25 × 25 cm square culture plates were treated with NGF for 48 h or left alone. For inhibition study, either 100 µm RHC80267 (Sigma) or vehicle ethanol was preincubated with the cells for 30 min in the continuous presence of NGF before adding the substrate. Then cells were washed with PBS extensively, followed by the addition of the substrate DPPE-NBD (1 µm in DMEM−SP) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. For the inhibition study, either 100 µm RHC80267 or vehicle ethanol was added with the substrate. Cells were washed once with PBS, once with PBS containing 5 g/liter BSA (fatty acid free; Nacalai Tesque, 08587-26), and twice with PBS. From these cells, the TMFs were prepared as described above. Lipids in the TMF pellets or in whole cells were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (19.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). The lipid fractions were evaporated, dissolved in 200 µl of methanol, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were recovered. The supernatants were evaporated and dissolved in 30 µl of methanol, and 20 µl each of the samples was injected for analysis with HPLC. The lipids were separated on a C8 reversed-phase column as described above, and 1 ml of each fraction was collected between 9.8 min and 14.8 min. The amount of each remodeled products were quantified by the fluorescence of NBD, and the percentage in total NBD-phospholipids (retention time between 7.5–20 min) was calculated. Peak 3 at the retention time 12.5 min was collected for further analysis by PLA2. For treatment with PLA2, the fraction was evaporated, dissolved in 250 µl of hexane, and hydrolyzed by 0.3 units of PLA2 (Sigma, P9279) in 250 µl of 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, at 37 °C for 6 h with rotation. The lyso-PE-NBD was recovered from the aqueous phase by adding 1 ml of methanol as described (20.Zhao Z. Xu Y. An extremely simple method for extraction of lysophospholipids and phospholipids from blood samples.J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 652-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), evaporated, and dissolved in 30 µl of methanol. These samples were analyzed by the C18 column as described above. Each area of the corresponding peaks in the chromatogram was quantified, and oleic acid content at the sn-1 site was calculated with the equation, oleic acid content at the sn-1 site = 1-oleoyl-lyso-PE-NBD (mol)/(1-oleoyl-lyso-PE-NBD + 1-palmitoyl-lyso-PE-NBD) (mol). The p values were examined by two-tailed Student's t test (n = 6). For immunocytochemistry or the preparation of TMF in the presence of the inhibitor, PC12 cells treated with NGF for 48 h were treated with 100 µm RHC80267 (Sigma) or vehicle ethanol for 3 h in the continuous presence of NGF. PC12 cells treated with NGF for 3 days or unstimulated control cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% BSA. The uptake of a fluorescent dopamine analog (Neurotransmitter Transporter Uptake Assay Kit, Molecular Devices, R8173) was observed by the addition of the analog in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% BSA to the cells following the manufacturer's instructions. After the addition of the reagent, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C before observation with a confocal fluorescent microscopy at excitation/emission = 440/520 nm for up to 15 min. We produced monoclonal antibodies against the DRM fraction (12.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Sorting of GPI-anchored proteins to glycolipid-enriched membrane subdomains during transport to the apical cell surface.Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar) of PC12 cells (a rat pheochromocytoma cell line) into which the masculine gene had been introduced. One of them, designated mAb#15, recognized an antigen present on the plasma membrane and on some of vesicular structures, both at the protrusion tips of PC12 cells after NGF stimulation (Fig. 1, A–F). The antigen of mAb#15 was extracted from the cells with cold methanol (Fig. 1G), and the antigen in the methanol extract was resistant to a protease K digestion (data not shown), indicating the lipid nature of the antigen. In addition, digestion of phospholipids in the fixed cells with PLA1 or PLD removed the antigen at the tips (Fig. 1, H and J). In contrast, treatment with PLA2 enhanced the staining (Fig. 1I). These results indicated that the antigen is a kind of phospholipid and that the structure at the sn-1 position is important for the recognition. To identify the antigen molecule, we purified the membrane of the tips of processes (TMF) by applying a method for isolation of the growth cone membrane (14.Pfenninger K.H. Ellis L. Johnson M.P.

The efficacy of the purification was verified by co-purification of a protein, Gαo, which is localized at the tips of processes (Figs. 2A and 7J) (15.Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. G0 is a major growth cone protein subject to regulation by GAP-43.Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). From this tip fraction of NGF-treated cells and the corresponding fraction of unstimulated cells, lipids were extracted and fractionized by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Then the distribution of the antigen over the fractions was assayed by ELISA with mAb#15. The majority of the antigen that depends on NGF stimulation was eluted in fractions 29–33 (Fig. 2B). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of these fractions using DHB with lithium ion additive as a matrix (16.Cvacka J. Svatos A. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis of lipids and high molecular weight hydrocarbons with lithium 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate matrix.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) identified that the monocations with m/z 760.5, 766.6, 782.5, and 798.5 were present only in the NGF-stimulated tip fraction (Fig. 2, C and D). By comparing this ion profile with the ion profile with sodium ion additive, these were assigned to proton, lithium ion, sodium ion, and potassium ion adducts, respectively, of the molecule with the mass of 759.5 Da (Fig. 2, D and E). This mass corresponds to phosphatidylcholine with palmitoyl and oleoyl moieties. In accord with this, fragmentation analyses with collision-induced dissociation on the lithium adduct (M + Li+) at m/z 766.6 showed the signature peak for phosphatidylcholine (17.Al-Saad K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2078853904,"There is a growing body of literature to show that color can convey information, owing to its emotionally meaningful associations. Most research so far has focused on negative hue–meaning associations (e.g., red) with the exception of the positive aspects associated with green. We therefore set out to investigate the positive associations of two colors (i.e., green and pink), using an emotional facial expression recognition task in which colors provided the emotional contextual information for the face processing. In two experiments, green and pink backgrounds enhanced happy face recognition and impaired sad face recognition, compared with a control color (gray). Our findings therefore suggest that because green and pink both convey positive information, they facilitate the processing of emotionally congruent facial expressions (i.e., faces expressing happiness) and interfere with that of incongruent facial expressions (i.e., faces expressing sadness). Data also revealed a positive association for white. Results are discussed within the theoretical framework of emotional cue processing and color meaning."
https://openalex.org/W2111391074,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) initiates insect molting and metamorphosis. By contrast, juvenile hormone (JH) prevents metamorphosis. However, the mechanism by which JH inhibits metamorphosis remains unclear. In this study, we propose that JH induces the phosphorylation of Broad isoform Z7 (BrZ7), a newly identified protein, to inhibit 20E-mediated metamorphosis in the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera. The knockdown of BrZ7 in larvae inhibited metamorphosis by repressing the expression of the 20E response gene. BrZ7 was weakly expressed and phosphorylated during larval growth but highly expressed and non-phosphorylated during metamorphosis. JH regulated the rapid phosphorylation of BrZ7 via a G-protein-coupled receptor-, phospholipase C-, and protein kinase C-triggered pathway. The phosphorylated BrZ7 bound to the 5'-regulatory region of calponin to regulate its expression in the JH pathway. Exogenous JH induced BrZ7 phosphorylation to prevent metamorphosis by suppressing 20E-related gene transcription. JH promoted non-phosphorylated calponin interacting with ultraspiracle protein to activate the JH pathway and antagonize the 20E pathway. This study reveals one of the possible mechanisms by which JH counteracts 20E-regulated metamorphosis by inducing the phosphorylation of BrZ7."
https://openalex.org/W2058748752,"Objective In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) infiltration of immune cells into muscle and upregulation of MHC-I expression implies increased antigen presentation and involvement of the proteasome system. To decipher the role of immunoproteasomes in myositis, we investigated individual cell types and muscle tissues and focused on possible immune triggers. Methods Expression of constitutive (PSMB5, -6, -7) and corresponding immunoproteasomal subunits (PSMB8, -9, -10) was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in muscle biopsies and sorted peripheral blood cells of patients with IIM, non-inflammatory myopathies (NIM) and healthy donors (HD). Protein analysis in muscle biopsies was performed by western blot. Affymetrix HG-U133 platform derived transcriptome data from biopsies of different muscle diseases and from immune cell types as well as monocyte stimulation experiments were used for validation, coregulation and coexpression analyses. Results Real-time RT-PCR revealed significantly increased expression of immunoproteasomal subunits (PSMB8/-9/-10) in DC, monocytes and CD8+ T-cells in IIM. In muscle biopsies, the immunosubunits were elevated in IIM compared to NIM and exceeded levels of matched blood samples. Proteins of PSMB8 and -9 were found only in IIM but not NIM muscle biopsies. Reanalysis of 78 myositis and 20 healthy muscle transcriptomes confirmed these results and revealed involvement of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. Comparison with reference profiles of sorted immune cells and healthy muscle confirmed upregulation of PSMB8 and -9 in myositis biopsies beyond infiltration related changes. This upregulation correlated highest with STAT1, IRF1 and IFNγ expression. Elevation of T-cell specific transcripts in active IIM muscles was accompanied by increased expression of DC and monocyte marker genes and thus reflects the cell type specific involvement observed in peripheral blood. Conclusions Immunoproteasomes seem to indicate IIM activity and suggest that dominant involvement of antigen processing and presentation may qualify these diseases exemplarily for the evolving therapeutic concepts of immunoproteasome specific inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2061068411,"DNA vaccines encoding the viral G glycoprotein show the most successful protection capability against fish rhabdoviruses. Nowadays, the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective response remain still poorly understood. With the aim of shedding light on the protection conferred by the DNA vaccines based in the G glycoprotein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) we have used a specific microarray highly enriched in antiviral sequences to carry out the transcriptomic study associated to VHSV DNA vaccination/infection. The differential gene expression pattern in response to empty plasmid (pMCV1.4) and DNA vaccine (pMCV1.4-G860) intramuscular administration with regard to non-stimulated turbot was analyzed in head kidney at 8, 24 and 72 hours post-vaccination. Moreover, the effect of VHSV infection one month after immunization was also analyzed in vaccinated and non-vaccinated fish at the same time points. Genes implicated in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, IFN inducible/regulatory proteins, numerous sequences implicated in apoptosis and cytotoxic pathways, MHC class I antigens, as well as complement and coagulation cascades among others were analyzed in the different experimental groups. Fish receiving the pMCV1.4-G860 vaccine showed transcriptomic patterns very different to the ones observed in pMCV1.4-injected turbot after 72 h. On the other hand, VHSV challenge in vaccinated and non-vaccinated turbot induced a highly different response at the transcriptome level, indicating a very relevant role of the acquired immunity in vaccinated fish able to alter the typical innate immune response profile observed in non-vaccinated individuals. This exhaustive transcriptome study will serve as a complete overview for a better understanding of the crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune response in fish after viral infection/vaccination. Moreover, it provides interesting clues about molecules with a potential use as vaccine adjuvants, antiviral treatments or markers for vaccine efficiency monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2075951996,"S100A8 and S100A9 are highly-expressed calcium-binding proteins in neutrophils and monocytes, and in subsets of macrophages in inflammatory lesions. Unmethylated CpG motifs found in bacterial and viral DNA are potent activators of innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). S100A8, but not S100A9, mRNA and protein was directly induced by CpG-DNA in murine and human macrophages. Induction in murine macrophages peaked at 16 h. CpG-DNA-induced S100A8 required de novo protein synthesis; IL-10 and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synergistically enhanced expression and promoted earlier gene induction. Inhibitors of endogenous IL-10, PGE2, and the E prostanoid (EP) 4 receptor strongly suppressed S100A8 expression, particularly when combined. Thus, S100A8 induction by E. coli DNA required both IL-10 and PGE2/EP4 signaling. The MAPKs, PI3K and JAK pathways were essential, whereas ERK1/2 appeared to play a direct role. S100A8 induction by CpG-DNA was controlled at the transcriptional level. The promoter region responsible for activation, either directly, or indirectly via IL-10 and PGE2, was located within a -178 to -34-bp region and required STAT3 binding. Because of the robust links connecting IL-10 and PGE2 with an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, the induction profile of S100A8 strongly indicates a role for this protein in resolution of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2017794840,"Participation in weight loss programs is often associated with improved wellbeing alongside reduced cardio-metabolic risk. In contrast, population-based analyses have found no evidence of psychological benefits of weight loss, but this may be due to inclusion of healthy-weight individuals. We therefore examined cardio-metabolic and psychological changes following weight loss in a cohort of overweight/obese adults.Data were from 1,979 overweight and obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2); age ≥ 50 y), free of long-standing illness or clinical depression at baseline, from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Participants were grouped according to four-year weight change into those losing ≥ 5% weight, those gaining ≥ 5%, and those whose weight was stable within 5%. Logistic regression examined changes in depressed mood (eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score ≥ 4), low wellbeing (Satisfaction With Life Scale score <20), hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or anti-hypertensives), and high triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/l), controlling for demographic variables, weight loss intention, and baseline characteristics.The proportion of participants with depressed mood increased more in the weight loss than weight stable or weight gain groups (+289%, +86%, +62% respectively; odds ratio [OR] for weight loss vs. weight stable = 1.78 [95% CI 1.29-2.47]). The proportion with low wellbeing also increased more in the weight loss group (+31%, +22%, -4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (OR = 1.16 [0.81-1.66]). Hypertension and high triglyceride prevalence decreased in weight losers and increased in weight gainers (-28%, 4%, +18%; OR = 0.61 [0.45-0.83]; -47%, -13%, +5%; OR = 0.41 [0.28-0.60]). All effects persisted in analyses adjusting for illness and life stress during the weight loss period.Weight loss over four years in initially healthy overweight/obese older adults was associated with reduction in cardio-metabolic risk but no psychological benefit, even when changes in health and life stresses were accounted for. These results highlight the need to investigate the emotional consequences of weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2053142137,"The aim of our project was to perform an exploratory analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients, collected in different phases of their clinical course, in order to investigate the existence of peculiar profiles characterizing the different MS phenotypes. The study was carried out on 24 Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), 16 Relapsing Remitting (RR) MS, 11 Progressive (Pr) MS patients. The CSF samples were analysed using the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer in linear mode geometry and in delayed extraction mode (m/z range: 1000-25000 Da). Peak lists were imported for normalization and statistical analysis. CSF data were correlated with demographic, clinical and MRI parameters. The evaluation of MALDI-TOF spectra revealed 348 peak signals with relative intensity ≥ 1% in the study range. The peak intensity of the signals corresponding to Secretogranin II and Protein 7B2 were significantly upregulated in RRMS patients compared to PrMS (p<0.05), whereas the signals of Fibrinogen and Fibrinopeptide A were significantly downregulated in CIS compared to PrMS patients (p<0.04). Additionally, the intensity of the Tymosin β4 peak was the only signal to be significantly discriminated between the CIS and RRMS patients (p = 0.013). Although with caution due to the relatively small size of the study populations, and considering that not all the findings remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons, in our opinion this mass spectrometry evaluation confirms that this technique may provide useful and important information to improve our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2055398615,"The B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family is the key mediator of cellular sensitivity to apoptosis during pharmacological interventions for numerous human pathologies, including cancer. There is tremendous interest to understand how the proapoptotic BCL-2 effector members (e.g. BCL-2-associated X protein, BAX) cooperate with the BCL-2 homology domain only (BH3-only) subclass (e.g. BCL-2 interacting mediator of death, BIM; BCL-2 interacting-domain death agonist, BID) to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis and whether these mechanisms may be pharmacologically exploited to enhance the killing of cancer cells. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members have been designed rationally. However, the success of these ""BH3 mimetics"" in the clinic has been limited, likely due to an incomplete understanding of how these drugs function in the presence of multiple BCL-2 family members. To increase our mechanistic understanding of how BH3 mimetics cooperate with multiple BCL-2 family members in vitro, we directly compared the activity of several BH3-mimetic compounds (i.e. ABT-263, ABT-737, GX15-070, HA14.1, TW-37) in biochemically defined large unilamellar vesicle model systems that faithfully recapitulate BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Our investigations revealed that the presence of BAX, BID, and BIM differentially regulated the ability of BH3 mimetics to derepress proapoptotic molecules from anti-apoptotic proteins. Using mitochondria loaded with fluorescent BH3 peptides and cells treated with inducers of cell death, these differences were supported. Together, these data suggest that although the presence of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins primarily dictates cellular sensitivity to BH3 mimetics, additional specificity is conferred by proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1967102764,"The movement of juvenile loggerhead turtles (n = 42) out-fitted with satellite tags and released in oceanic waters off New Caledonia was examined and compared with ocean circulation data. Merging of the daily turtle movement data with drifter buoy movements, OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analyses - Real time) circulation data, and three different vertical strata (0–5 m, 0–40 m, 0–100 m) of HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model) circulation data indicated the turtles were swimming against the prevailing current in a statistically significant pattern. This was not an artifact of prevailing directions of current and swimming, nor was it an artifact of frictional slippage. Generalized additive modeling was used to decompose the pattern of swimming into spatial and temporal components. The findings are indicative of a positive rheotaxis whereby an organism is able to detect the current flow and orient itself to swim into the current flow direction or otherwise slow down its movement. Potential mechanisms for the means and adaptive significance of rheotaxis in oceanic juvenile loggerhead turtles are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2047479573,"Genus Ocimum contains a reservoir of diverse secondary metabolites, which are known for their defense and medicinal value. However, the defense-related metabolites from this genus have not been studied in depth. To gain deeper insight into inducible defense metabolites, we examined the overall biochemical and metabolic changes in Ocimum kilimandscharicum that occurred in response to the feeding of Helicoverpa armigera larvae. Metabolic analysis revealed that the primary and secondary metabolism of local and systemic tissues in O. kilimandscharicum was severely affected following larval infestation. Moreover, levels of specific secondary metabolites like camphor, limonene and β-caryophyllene (known to be involved in defense) significantly increased in leaves upon insect attack. Choice assays conducted by exposing H. armigera larvae on O. kilimandscharicum and tomato leaves, demonstrated that O. kilimandscharicum significantly deters larval feeding. Further, when larvae were fed on O. kilimandscharicum leaves, average body weight decreased and mortality of the larvae increased. Larvae fed on artificial diet supplemented with O. kilimandscharicum leaf extract, camphor, limonene and β-caryophyllene showed growth retardation, increased mortality rates and pupal deformities. Digestive enzymes of H. armigera - namely, amylase, protease and lipase- showed variable patterns after feeding on O. kilimandscharicum, which implies striving of the larvae to attain required nutrition for growth, development and metamorphosis. Evidently, selected metabolites from O. kilimandscharicum possess significant insecticidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032326626,"Histological analyses of fossil bones have provided clues on the growth patterns and life history traits of several extinct vertebrates that would be unavailable for classical morphological studies. We analyzed the bone histology of Hipparion to infer features of its life history traits and growth pattern. Microscope analysis of thin sections of a large sample of humeri, femora, tibiae and metapodials of Hipparion concudense from the upper Miocene site of Los Valles de Fuentidueña (Segovia, Spain) has shown that the number of growth marks is similar among the different limb bones, suggesting that equivalent skeletochronological inferences for this Hipparion population might be achieved by means of any of the elements studied. Considering their abundance, we conducted a skeletechronological study based on the large sample of third metapodials from Los Valles de Fuentidueña together with another large sample from the Upper Miocene locality of Concud (Teruel, Spain). The data obtained enabled us to distinguish four age groups in both samples and to determine that Hipparion concudense tended to reach skeletal maturity during its third year of life. Integration of bone microstructure and skeletochronological data allowed us to identify ontogenetic changes in bone structure and growth rate and to distinguish three histologic ontogenetic stages corresponding to immature, subadult and adult individuals. Data on secondary osteon density revealed an increase in bone remodeling throughout the ontogenetic stages and a lesser degree thereof in the Concud population, which indicates different biomechanical stresses in the two populations, likely due to environmental differences. Several individuals showed atypical growth patterns in the Concud sample, which may also reflect environmental differences between the two localities. Finally, classification of the specimens’ age within groups enabled us to characterize the age structure of both samples, which is typical of attritional assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W1994761278,"Isolating pure microbial cultures and cultivating them in the laboratory on defined media is used to more fully characterize the metabolism and physiology of organisms. However, identifying an appropriate growth medium for a novel isolate remains a challenging task. Even organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes can be difficult to grow, despite our ability to build genome-scale metabolic networks that connect genomic data with metabolic function. The scientific literature is scattered with information about defined growth media used successfully for cultivating a wide variety of organisms, but to date there exists no centralized repository to inform efforts to cultivate less characterized organisms by bridging the gap between genomic data and compound composition for growth media. Here we present MediaDB, a manually curated database of defined media that have been used for cultivating organisms with sequenced genomes, with an emphasis on organisms with metabolic network models. The database is accessible online, can be queried by keyword searches or downloaded in its entirety, and can generate exportable individual media formulation files. The data assembled in MediaDB facilitate comparative studies of organism growth media, serve as a starting point for formulating novel growth media, and contribute to formulating media for in silico investigation of metabolic networks.

https://openalex.org/W2001191199,"Sex identification in ancient human remains is a common problem especially if the skeletons are sub-adult, incomplete or damaged. In this paper we propose a new method to identify sex, based on real-time PCR amplification of small fragments (61 and 64 bp) of the third exon within the amelogenin gene covering a 3-bp deletion on the AMELX-allele, followed by a High Resolution Melting analysis (HRM). HRM is based on the melting curves of amplified fragments. The amelogenin gene is located on both chromosomes X and Y, showing dimorphism in length. This molecular tool is rapid, sensitive and reduces the risk of contamination from exogenous genetic material when used for ancient DNA studies. The accuracy of the new method described here has been corroborated by using control samples of known sex and by contrasting our results with those obtained with other methods. Our method has proven to be useful even in heavily degraded samples, where other previously published methods failed. Stochastic problems such as the random allele drop-out phenomenon are expected to occur in a less severe form, due to the smaller fragment size to be amplified. Thus, their negative effect could be easier to overcome by a proper experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W1968278630,"The fish family Sciaenidae has numerous species that produce sounds with superfast muscles that vibrate the swimbladder. These muscles form post embryonically and undergo seasonal hypertrophy-atrophy cycles. The family has been the focus of numerous passive acoustic studies to localize spatial and temporal occurrence of spawning aggregations. Fishes produce disturbance calls when hand-held, and males form aggregations in late afternoon and produce advertisement calls to attract females for mating. Previous studies on five continents have been confined to temperate species. Here we examine the calls of the silver croaker Plagioscion squamosissimus, a freshwater equatorial species, which experiences constant photoperiod, minimal temperature variation but seasonal changes in water depth and color, pH and conductivity.Dissections indicate that sonic muscles are present exclusively in males and that muscles are thicker and redder during the mating season. Disturbance calls were recorded in hand-held fish during the low-water mating season and high-water period outside of the mating season. Advertisement calls were recorded from wild fish that formed aggregations in both periods but only during the mating season from fish in large cages. Disturbance calls consist of a series of short individual pulses in mature males. Advertisement calls start with single and paired pulses followed by greater amplitude multi-pulse bursts with higher peak frequencies than in disturbance calls. Advertisement-like calls also occur in aggregations during the off season, but bursts are shorter with fewer pulses.Silver croaker produce complex advertisement calls that vary in amplitude, number of cycles per burst and burst duration of their calls. Unlike temperate sciaenids, which only call during the spawning season, silver croaker produce advertisement calls in both seasons. Sonic muscles are thinner, and bursts are shorter than at the spawning peak, but males still produce complex calls outside of the mating season."
https://openalex.org/W2085876385,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium and one of the leading causes of food-borne gastroenteritis. Its genome harbors two Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS1 and T3SS2), but only T3SS2 is required for enterotoxicity seen in animal models. Effector proteins secreted from T3SS2 have been previously shown to promote colonization of the intestinal epithelium, invasion of host cells, and destruction of the epithelial monolayer. In this study, we identify VPA1380, a T3SS2 effector protein that is toxic when expressed in yeast. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that VPA1380 is highly similar to the inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)-inducible cysteine protease domains of several large bacterial toxins. Mutations in conserved catalytic residues and residues in the putative IP6-binding pocket abolished toxicity in yeast. Furthermore, VPA1380 was not toxic in IP6 deficient yeast cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that VPA1380 is a cysteine protease that requires IP6 as an activator."
https://openalex.org/W1995199229,"The migration of Siamese mud carp (Henicorhynchus siamensis and H. lobatus), two of the most economically important fish species in the Mekong River, was studied using an otolith microchemistry technique. Fish and river water samples were collected in seven regions throughout the whole basin in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia over a 4 year study period. There was coherence between the elements in the ambient water and on the surface of the otoliths, with strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) showing the strongest correlation. The partition coefficients were 0.409–0.496 for Sr and 0.055 for Ba. Otolith Sr-Ba profiles indicated extensive synchronized migrations with similar natal origins among individuals within the same region. H. siamensis movement has been severely suppressed in a tributary system where a series of irrigation dams has blocked their migration. H. lobatus collected both below and above the Khone Falls in the mainstream Mekong exhibited statistically different otolith surface elemental signatures but similar core elemental signatures. This result suggests a population originating from a single natal origin but bypassing the waterfalls through a passable side channel where a major hydroelectric dam is planned. The potential effects of damming in the Mekong River are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2013472369,"The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common anatomical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the effects of stimulation may spread beyond the STN. Ongoing research aims to identify nearby anatomical structures where DBS-induced effects could be associated with therapeutic improvement or side effects. We previously found that DBS lead location determines the rate--abrupt vs. gradual--with which therapeutic effect washes out after stimulation is stopped. Those results suggested that electrical current spreads from the electrodes to two spatially distinct stimulation targets associated with different washout rates. In order to identify these targets we used computational models to predict the volumes of tissue activated during DBS in 14 Parkinson's patients from that study. We then coregistered each patient with a stereotaxic atlas and generated a probabilistic stimulation atlas to obtain a 3-dimensional representation of regions where stimulation was associated with abrupt vs. gradual washout. We found that the therapeutic effect which washed out gradually was associated with stimulation of the zona incerta and fields of Forel, whereas abruptly-disappearing therapeutic effect was associated with stimulation of STN itself. This supports the idea that multiple DBS targets exist and that current spread from one electrode may activate more than one of them in a given patient, producing a combination of effects which vary according to electrode location and stimulation settings."
https://openalex.org/W2076825539,"Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. A biomarker to accurately indicate the severity of iMN and predict long-term prognosis is insufficient. Here, we evaluated the clinical significance of circulating tumor necrosis factor receptors (cTNFRs) as prognostic biomarkers of iMN with nephrotic syndrome. A total of 113 patients with biopsy-proven iMN and 43 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Ninety patients with iMN had nephrotic range proteinuria. Levels of cTNFRs were measured by using serum samples collected at the time of initial diagnosis. Levels of cTNFRs were higher in the patients with nephrotic syndrome than in those with subnephrotic range proteinuria or in the healthy volunteers (P for trend <0.001). Estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria tended to worsen as the cTNFRs levels increased. Having a cTNFR1 level within the highest tertile was a significant risk factor for renal progression after adjustment, in comparison with the other tertiles (hazard ratio [HR], 3.39; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.48–7.78; P = 0.004). The cTNFR2 level within the highest tertile also significantly increased the risk of renal progression (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.43–7.54; P = 0.005). Renal tubular TNFRs expression was associated with cTNFRs level. However, the cTNFRs levels were not associated with autoantibody against phospholipase A2 receptor reactivity/levels or treatment response. This study demonstrated that cTNFRs levels at the time of initial diagnosis could predict renal progression in patients with iMN."

Standardized assessment of outcomes was performed, including duration of operation, objective sensory recovery, cold intolerance, time of returning to work, active total range of motion (ROM) of the injured fingers, and the cosmetic appearance of the donor/recipient sites.All flaps survived completely, and the follow-up duration was 13.5 months. The mean duration of the complete surgical procedure for AVFs was distinctly shorter than that of the other flaps (p<0.05). AVFs were employed to reconstruct skin defects and extensor tendon defects using a vascularized palmaris longus graft in 4 fingers. Digital blood supply was reestablished in 4 fingers by flow-through technique when using AVFs. Optimal sensory recovery was better with AVFs and SPBRA flaps as compared with UAPF flaps and PIPFs (p<0.05). No significant differences were noted in ROM or cold intolerance between the 4 groups. Optimal cosmetic satisfaction was noted for the recipient sites of AVFs and the donor sites of SPBRA flaps. The number of second-stage defatting operations required for AVFs was considerably lesser than that for the other flaps.All 4 types of free flaps from the ipsilateral extremity are a practical choice in finger reconstruction for small/moderate-sized skin defects. AVFs play an important role in such operations due to the wider indications, and better sensory recovery and cosmetic appearance associated with this method."
https://openalex.org/W2085644295,"Cell death by necrosis is emerging not merely as a passive phenomenon but as a cell-regulated process. Here, by using different necrotic triggers, we prove the existence of two distinct necrotic pathways.

However, G5, a non-selective isopeptidase inhibitor, triggers a distinct necrotic pathway that depends on the protein phosphatase PP2A and the actin cytoskeleton. PP2A catalytic subunit is stabilized by G5 treatment, and its activity is increased. Furthermore, PP2Ac accumulates into the cytoplasm during necrosis similarly to HMGB1. We have also defined in the actin-binding protein cofilin-1 a link between PP2A, actin cytoskeleton, and necrotic death. Cofilin-1-severing/depolymerization activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serine 3. PP2A contributes to the dephosphorylation of serine 3 elicited by G5.

Cell death by necrosis is characterized by organelle swelling and plasma membrane rupture, with the consequent release of cellular components in the microenvironment and the activation of the inflammatory response (1.Vanlangenakker N.

Han J. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 signaling to mitochondria in necrotic cell death requires RIP1/TRAF2-mediated JNK1 activation.J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5)/Drp1 axis could represent a convergent node for different necrotic pathways (10.Wang Z. Jiang H. Chen S. Du F. Wang X.

To clarify whether or not multiple necrotic pathways exist, we have compared the necrotic responses elicited by two different chemical stresses. Our studies indicate the existence of different necrotic pathways and identify in the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-cofilin-actin axis a new regulator of a specific form of necrotic death. U87MG, U-118MG, HT29, and IMR90-E1A/Bcl2/C9DN cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), glutamine (2 mmol/liter), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. U87MG cells expressing Bcl-xL, Drp1 K38A, GFP, Cofilin constructs, and myristoylated Akt were generated by retroviral infection (18.Foti C. Florean C. Pezzutto A. Roncaglia P. Tomasella A.

RNA oligos for interference (RNAi) were purchased from Invitrogen, Dharmacon, and Qiagen. Cells were transfected 24 h after plating by adding the Opti-MEM medium containing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) plus RNAi oligos. The following chemicals were used: LY (LY294002; LC Laboratories), BOC-D(OMe)-fmk (Imgenex), bortezomib (LC Laboratories), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) (Enzo Life Sciences), cytochalasin D, cucurbitacin E, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), Mdivi-1, biotinylated concanavalin A, and DMSO (Sigma), MitoTracker Red/CMXRos, 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP), streptavidin-FITC, phalloidin-TRITC (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes), okadaic acid (Enzo Life Sciences), and necrosulfonamide (NSA) (Merck Millipore).

Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated (Invitrogen). Cell lysates after SDS/PAGE were transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the specific primary antibodies. For primary antibody stripping, blots were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C in stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Quantitative densitometric analysis of the immunoblots was performed by ChemiDoc software (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed directly in Petri dishes with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-PP2Ac antibody (ON). After incubation with protein A beads the immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer. Beads were resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mm CaCl2), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without okadaic acid 100 nm in presence of 1 mm NiCl2 and 0.125 mg/ml BSA, and then analyzed by fluorimetric assay using DiFMUP substrate as described (20.Wegner A.M.

Immunocomplexes were recollected after the fluorimetric assay and next resolved in SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted. Mitochondria were labeled in vivo for 1 h with 25 nmol/liter MitoTracker Red. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with the primary antibody, phalloidin-TRITC. After washes, coverslips were incubated with the relative secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged with a Leica confocal scanner SP equipped with a 488 λ Ar laser and a 543–633 λ HeNe laser. The image analysis was performed using the MetaMorph 6.04 software. Cell images for deconvolution were taken using the Leica AF6000 LX microscope. Deconvolution software was used for image deconvolution and three-dimensional view reconstruction. Cells were lysed using TRI-REAGENT (Molecular Research Center). 1.0 μg of total RNA was retro-transcribed by using 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time-PCRs were performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96 and SYBR Green technology. Data were analyzed by a comparative threshold cycle using hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and β-actin as normalizer genes. All reactions were done in triplicate.

To explore the existence of different necrotic signaling pathways, we used two different chemical stressors: the isopeptidases inhibitor G5, an inducer of alterations in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton (18.Foti C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 8369-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and DMNQ, a generator of reactive oxygen species at mitochondrial level (23.Tchivilev I. Madamanchi N.R. Vendrov A.E. Niu X.L. Runge M.S. Identification of a protective role for protein phosphatase 1cγ1 against oxidative stress-induced vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22193-22205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As the cellular model to study necrosis we selected U87MG glioblastoma cells because of their intrinsic resistance to apoptosis and the tendency to die by necrosis (18.Foti C. Florean C. Pezzutto A. Roncaglia P. Tomasella A. Gustincich S. Brancolini C. Characterization of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent deaths in glioblastoma cells treated with inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 3140-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we overexpressed Bcl-xL to further suppress apoptosis. Cells were treated with escalating doses of G5 or DMNQ, and cell death was scored by a trypan blue assay (Fig. 1A). In general 5 μm G5 and 20 μm DMNQ were employed for the subsequent studies. Contrary to bortezomib, G5- or DMNQ-induced cell death was unaffected by caspase inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Next we evaluated the mitochondrial morphology using MitoTracker in relation to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. As a marker of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, we explored Smac localization. Both necrotic stimuli induced a dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1C), with the quantitative analysis reported in Fig. 1D. Smac was usually retained in the mitochondria, thus proving the absence of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (Fig. 1E). Curiously in the case of DMNQ a fraction of cells (10%) presented intact mitochondrial outer membrane but decreased MitoTracker staining, thus indicating that Δψm collapse occurs before mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (Fig. 1F). Cytoplasmic vacuolization, as a consequence of endoplasmic reticulum stress, occurs in response to the engagement of the unfolded response by UPS inhibitors (24.Mimnaugh E.G. Xu W. Vos M. Yuan X. Isaacs J.S. Bisht K.S. Gius D. Neckers L. Simultaneous inhibition of hsp 90 and the proteasome promotes protein ubiquitination, causes endoplasmic reticulum-derived cytosolic vacuolization, and enhances antitumor activity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1G, glioma cells incubated with G5 exhibit cytoplasmic vacuolization. However, when a time course analysis was performed, it was evident that mitochondrial fragmentation precedes cytoplasmic vacuolization (Fig. 1H). In conclusion, mitochondrial fragmentation is an early event during cell death induced either by G5 or DMNQ treatment. To elucidate the contribution of mitochondrial fragmentation to G5- and DMNQ-induced necrosis, cells were treated with the Drp1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 (25.Cassidy-Stone A. Chipuk J.E. Ingerman E. Song C. Yoo C. Kuwana T. Kurth M.J. Shaw J.T. Hinshaw J.E. Green D.R. Nunnari J. Chemical inhibition of the mitochondrial division dynamin reveals its role in Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Mdivi-1 attenuated necrosis only in response to DMNQ (Fig. 2A). To confirm this result we generated U87MG/Bcl-xL cells expressing a dominant negative mutant (K38A) of Drp1 (Fig. 2B). Treatment with G5 or with DMNQ of Drp1-K38A-overexpressing cells confirmed the result obtained with the Drp1 inhibitor. The dependence from Drp1 activity to fully elicit necrosis was observed only in the case of DMNQ treatment (Fig. 2C). To further prove that necrosis elicited by DMNQ or G5 engages two distinct pathways, we evaluated the contribution of RIP1 by treating cells with the specific inhibitor Nec-1 (9.Degterev A. Hitomi J. Germscheid M. Ch'en I.L. Korkina O. Teng X. Abbott D. Cuny G.D. Yuan C. Wagner G. Hedrick S.M. Gerber S.A. Lugovskoy A. Yuan J. Identification of RIP1 kinase as a specific cellular target of necrostatins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Cell death was efficiently rescued by Nec-1 only when elicited by DMNQ (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that two distinct necrotic pathways are activated by DMNQ and G5. We also investigated the ability of NSA, a MLKL inhibitor that blocks necrosis downstream of RIP3 activation (4.Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2012; 148: 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), to differentially influence G5- and DMNQ-induced necrosis. Inhibition of MLKL did not suppress the appearance of cell death in response to G5 and, surprisingly, in DMNQ-treated cells as well (Fig. 2E). To prove inhibitor efficiency, we treated U87MG/Bcl-xL cells with a classic necroptotic stimulus: the combination TNF-α, Smac mimetic (26.Lecis D. Mastrangelo E. Belvisi L. Bolognesi M. Civera M. Cossu F. De Cesare M. Delia D. Drago C. Manenti G. Manzoni L. Milani M. Moroni E. Perego P. Potenza D. Rizzo V. Scavullo C. Scolastico C. Servida F. Vasile F. Seneci P. Dimeric Smac mimetics/IAP inhibitors as in vivo active pro-apoptotic agents. Part II: structural and biological characterization.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2012; 20: 6709-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Boc-fmk, as caspase inhibitor). U87MG cells were unresponsive to the TNF-α, Smac mimetic, and Boc-fmk combination (Fig. 2F). We also used cyclohexamide instead of Smac in the combination (TNF-α, cyclohexamide, Boc-fmk). Here again cell death was undetectable (Fig. 2G). Finally we used staurosporine, a recently suggested necroptotic trigger (27.Dunai Z.A. Imre G. Barna G. Korcsmaros T. Petak I. Bauer P.I. Mihalik R. Staurosporine induces necroptotic cell death under caspase-compromised conditions in U937 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e41945Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Staurosporine induced both apoptosis and necrosis in U87MG/Bcl-xL cells (Fig. 2H); however, this necrotic response was unaffected by RIP1 and MLKL inhibition. When the same necrotic triggers were evaluated in IMR90-E1A cells, the vast majority of the cells died by apoptosis, as proved by the effectiveness of the caspase inhibitor (Fig. 2, I–K). We also examined colon cancer HT29 cells, commonly utilized for necroptotic experiments. These cells died by necroptosis in response to the TNF-α, Smac mimetic, and Boc-fmk combination. Nec-1 efficiently abrogated this cell death, and NSA was active, although less potent compared with Nec-1 (Fig. 2L). These results prove that HT29 cells can die through necroptosis and that the two inhibitors are valuable. When we analyzed G5- and DMNQ-induced death in HT29 cells, similarly to U87MG cells the two drugs exhibited differential susceptibility to RIP1 and MLKL inhibition. G5-induced cell death was unaffected, whereas DMNQ was partially counteracted by the two inhibitors, with Nec-1 showing a stronger effect (Fig. 2M). Overall these results further confirm the existence of different necrotic responses. Finally, we discovered that the divergent responsiveness of HT29 and U87MG cells to necroptotic stimuli and the different responsiveness to MLKL inhibition, in the case of DMNQ-induced necrosis, could be explained by the differential expression of RIP3. In fact, when we interrogated public available gene expression profiles from U87MG and HT29 cells for necroptotic gene mRNA levels (Fig. 2N), RIP3 mRNA was clearly reduced in U87MG compared with HT29 cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR experiments proved the dramatic reduction (∼400 times respect to HT29 cells) of RIP3 mRNA in U87MG cells (Fig. 2O). To gain insight into the necrotic pathway elicited by G5, we decided to monitor the activation of signaling pathways transducing stress and prosurvival signals (28.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Mammalian MAPK signal transduction pathways activated by stress and inflammation: a 10-year update.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 689-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) in G5-treated cells. We evaluated activations of ERKs, p38, JUNK, and Akt. ERKs and p38 but not JUNK were transiently activated in response to G5. However, these activations were anticipated without mirroring the appearance of necrosis (Fig. 3A). When the status of Akt activation was evaluated, it emerged that the kinetic of dephosphorylation of serine 473 and also of threonine 308 (after a transient up-regulation) was paired to the appearance of necrosis (Fig. 2E). This result suggests that inhibition of Akt could be linked to G5-induced necrosis. PP2A can dephosphorylate and inactivate Akt (29.Kuo Y.C. Huang K.Y. Yang C.H. Yang Y.S. Lee W.Y. Chiang C.W. Regulation of phosphorylation of Thr-308 of Akt, cell proliferation, and survival by the B55α regulatory subunit targeting of the protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme to Akt.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 30.Li G. Ji X.D. Gao H. Zhao J.S. Xu J.F. Sun Z.J. Deng Y.Z. Shi S. Feng Y.X. Zhu Y.Q. Wang T. Li J.J. Xie D. EphB3 suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer metastasis via a PP2A/RACK1/Akt signalling complex.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 667Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hence, we monitored PP2A subunit levels in cells treated with G5. Levels of PP2Ac catalytic subunit were increased until 3 h from G5 treatment with a drop at 6 h, after the advent of necrosis. By contrast levels of the scaffold subunit A (PR65) were unaffected. Having discovered an increase of the PP2Ac subunit, we next evaluated whether PP2A enzymatic activity was augmented after G5 treatment, thus explaining Akt dephosphorylation and inactivation. Fig. 3B illustrates that PP2A phosphatase activity is augmented in cells treated with G5. To evaluate the contribution of PP2A to G5-induced necrosis, we silenced the expression of the catalytic subunit and next incubated U87MG/Bcl-xL cells with G5 or DMNQ. Down-regulation of PP2Ac impacted both necrotic responses, although with opposite effects (Fig. 4A). PP2Ac is required for necrosis in response to G5, but it counteracts necrosis in response to DMNQ. This evidence further strengthens the hypothesis that cells can engage multiple necrotic pathways. The impact of PP2A in G5-induced necrosis was also evident at the level of mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 4B). In cells with reduced PP2Ac expression, mitochondria fragmentation is much less pronounced. To confirm the role of PP2A we used another siRNA that targets a different region of PP2Ac. Again, down-regulation of PP2Ac limited necrosis in response to G5 and favored necrosis in response to DMNQ (Fig. 4C). The impact of PP2A on G5-induced necrosis could be related to the status of Akt activation; hence, we evaluated Akt phosphorylation in cells silenced for PP2Ac and treated with G5 for 1 h. Fig. 4D and the quantitative analysis in Fig. 4E evidence that phosphorylation at threonine 308 was higher after G5 treatment in PP2Ac-silenced cells. In addition to its well established anti-apoptotic role, Akt has been reported to counteract some kinds of necrotic death (31.Mochizuki T. Asai A. Saito N. Tanaka S. Katagiri H. Asano T. Nakane M. Tamura A. Kuchino Y. Kitanaka C. Kirino T. Akt protein kinase inhibits non-apoptotic programmed cell death induced by ceramide.J. Biol.

Akt and mTOR mediate programmed necrosis in neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hence, we explored whether the pro-necrotic role of PP2A in G5-treated cells could be explicated through the inhibition of Akt activity. First, by using the PI3K inhibitor LY, we observed that suppression of the PI3K-Akt axis was insufficient for triggering the death of U87MG/Bcl-xL cells (Fig. 4, F and G). Second, G5-induced necrosis was unaffected by the overexpression of a constitutive active form of Akt (Fig. 4, H and I). In summary, although Akt activity is down-regulated by G5 treatment and PP2A contributes to this modulation, this kinase does not play a major role during G5-induced necrotic death. The contribution of PP2A to G5-induced necrosis was confirmed in U-118MG cells, another glioblastoma cell line (Fig. 4J). By contrast, in a different apoptosis-resistant cell line represented by human fibroblasts expressing E1A and Bcl2 oncogenes and a catalytic inactive dominant negative mutant of Caspase-9 (19.Henderson C.J.

Studies of wildlife ecology regularly use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assess wild animal movement and behavior within environments with relatively unlimited space and finite resources. However, rather than depicting landscapes, a GIS could be developed in animal production environments to provide insight into animal behavior as an indicator of animal welfare. We developed a GIS-based approach for studying agricultural animal behavior in an environment with finite space and unlimited resources. Concurrent data from wireless body-worn location tracking sensor and video-recording systems, which depicted spatially-explicit behavior of hens (135 hens/room) in two identical indoor enclosures, were collected. The spatial configuration of specific hen behaviors, variation in home range patterns, and variation in home range overlap show that individual hens respond to the same environment differently. Such information could catalyze management practice adjustments (e.g., modifying feeder design and/or location). Genetically-similar hens exhibited diverse behavioral and spatial patterns via a proof of concept approach enabling detailed examinations of individual non-cage laying hen behavior and welfare."

To gain more insights into the pathogenesis of this organism, the high throughput cDNA microarray assays were employed to evaluate host responses of porcine alveolar macrophages to M. hyopneumoniae infection. A total of 1033 and 1235 differentially expressed genes were identified in porcine alveolar macrophages in responses to exposure to M. hyopneumoniae at 6 and 15 hours post infection, respectively. The differentially expressed genes were involved in many vital functional classes, including inflammatory response, immune response, apoptosis, cell adhesion, defense response, signal transduction, protein folding, protein ubiquitination and so on. The pathway analysis demonstrated that the most significant pathways were the chemokine signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains (Nod)-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis signaling pathway. The reliability of the data obtained from the microarray was verified by performing quantitative real-time PCR. The expression kinetics of chemokines was further analyzed. The present study is the first to document the response of porcine alveolar macrophages to M. hyopneumoniae infection. The data further developed our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of M. hyopneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2014230812,"Phytophthora ramorum, an invasive pathogen and the causal agent of Sudden Oak Death, has become established in mixed-evergreen and redwood forests in coastal northern California. While oak and tanoak mortality is the most visible indication of P. ramorum’s presence, epidemics are largely driven by the presence of bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), a reservoir host that supports both prolific sporulation in the winter wet season and survival during the summer dry season. In order to better understand how over-summer survival of the pathogen contributes to variability in the severity of annual epidemics, we monitored the viability of P. ramorum leaf infections over three years along with coincident microclimate. The proportion of symptomatic bay laurel leaves that contained viable infections decreased during the first summer dry season and remained low for the following two years, likely due to the absence of conducive wet season weather during the study period. Over-summer survival of P. ramorum was positively correlated with high percent canopy cover, less negative bay leaf water potential and few days exceeding 30°C but was not significantly different between mixed-evergreen and redwood forest ecosystems. Decreased summer survival of P. ramorum in exposed locations and during unusually hot summers likely contributes to the observed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of P. ramorum epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W1994415646,"99mTc is the standard radionuclide used for nuclear medicine imaging. In addition to gamma irradiation, 99mTc emits low-energy Auger and conversion electrons that deposit their energy within nanometers of the decay site. To study the potential for DNA damage, direct DNA binding is required. Plasmid DNA enables the investigation of the unprotected interactions between molecules and DNA that result in single-strand breaks (SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs); the resulting DNA fragments can be separated by gel electrophoresis and quantified by fluorescent staining. This study aimed to compare the plasmid DNA damage potential of a 99mTc-labeled HYNIC-DAPI compound with that of 99mTc pertechnetate (99mTcO4−). pUC19 plasmid DNA was irradiated for 2 or 24 hours. Direct and radical-induced DNA damage were evaluated in the presence or absence of the radical scavenger DMSO. For both compounds, an increase in applied activity enhanced plasmid DNA damage, which was evidenced by an increase in the open circular and linear DNA fractions and a reduction in the supercoiled DNA fraction. The number of SSBs elicited by 99mTc-HYNIC-DAPI (1.03) was twice that caused by 99mTcO4− (0.51), and the number of DSBs increased fivefold in the 99mTc-HYNIC-DAPI-treated sample compared with the 99mTcO4− treated sample (0.02 to 0.10). In the presence of DMSO, the numbers of SSBs and DSBs decreased to 0.03 and 0.00, respectively, in the 99mTcO4– treated samples, whereas the numbers of SSBs and DSBs were slightly reduced to 0.95 and 0.06, respectively, in the 99mTc-HYNIC-DAPI-treated samples. These results indicated that 99mTc-HYNIC-DAPI induced SSBs and DSBs via a direct interaction of the 99mTc-labeled compound with DNA. In contrast to these results, 99mTcO4− induced SSBs via radical formation, and DSBs were formed by two nearby SSBs. The biological effectiveness of 99mTc-HYNIC-DAPI increased by approximately 4-fold in terms of inducing SSBs and by approximately 10-fold in terms of inducing DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W2041908997,"Neurodegenerative diseases share a common characteristic, the presence of intracellular or extracellular deposits of protein aggregates in nervous tissues. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a severe and fatal neurodegenerative disorder, which affects preferentially motoneurons. Changes in the redox state of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are associated with the onset and development of familial forms of ALS. In human SOD1 (hSOD1), a conserved disulfide bond and two free cysteine residues can engage in anomalous thiol/disulfide exchange resulting in non-native disulfides, a hallmark of ALS that is related to protein misfolding and aggregation. Because of the many competing reaction pathways, traditional bulk techniques fall short at quantifying individual thiol/disulfide exchange reactions. Here, we adapt recently developed single-bond chemistry techniques to study individual disulfide isomerization reactions in hSOD1. Mechanical unfolding of hSOD1 leads to the formation of a polypeptide loop held by the disulfide. This loop behaves as a molecular jump rope that brings reactive Cys-111 close to the disulfide. Using force-clamp spectroscopy, we monitor nucleophilic attack of Cys-111 at either sulfur of the disulfide and determine the selectivity of the reaction. Disease-causing mutations G93A and A4V show greatly altered reactivity patterns, which may contribute to the progression of familial ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2045613007,"Variable (V) domains of antibodies are essential for antigen recognition by our adaptive immune system. However, some variants of the light chain V domains (VL) form pathogenic amyloid fibrils in patients. It is so far unclear which residues play a key role in governing these processes. Here, we show that the conserved residue 2 of VL domains is crucial for controlling its thermodynamic stability and fibril formation. Hydrophobic side chains at position 2 stabilize the domain, whereas charged residues destabilize and lead to amyloid fibril formation. NMR experiments identified several segments within the core of the VL domain to be affected by changes in residue 2. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations showed that hydrophobic side chains at position 2 remain buried in a hydrophobic pocket, and charged side chains show a high flexibility. This results in a predicted difference in the dissociation free energy of ∼10 kJ mol(-1), which is in excellent agreement with our experimental values. Interestingly, this switch point is found only in VL domains of the κ family and not in VLλ or in VH domains, despite a highly similar domain architecture. Our results reveal novel insight into the architecture of variable domains and the prerequisites for formation of amyloid fibrils. This might also contribute to the rational design of stable variable antibody domains."

Each EGF-like domain is rich of cysteine and glycine to produce three loops that are essential for high-affinity binding to its ligand. Nearly all reported CADASIL-associated mutations result in gain or loss of a cysteine residue within the EGF-like domains. Only a few cysteine-sparing NOTCH3 mutations have been documented in the patients with CADASIL to date. Here, we reported a Chinese CADASIL family with a cysteine-sparing NOTCH3 mutation. In this family, affected patients had dizziness, memory loss, gait instability, or hemiplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse leukoencephalopathy with confluent signal abnormalities in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and centrum semiovale bilaterally. By screening the entire coding region of NOTCH3, a novel missense mutation p.G149V (c.446G>T) was found. This mutation was not detected in 400 normal controls. Considering the critical position of glycine within the C-loop of EGF-like domain and its high conservation through evolution, p.G149V mutation could be a potential pathogenic cause for CADASIL."
https://openalex.org/W2072132121,"The Anopheles gambiae species complex includes at least seven morphologically indistinguishable species, one of which, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, is the primary mosquito vector responsible for the transmission of malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. Sympatric ecological diversification of An. gambiae s.s. is in progress within this complex, leading to the emergence of at least two incipient species (the M and S molecular forms now recognized as good species and named An. coluzzii and An. gambiae respectively) that show heterogeneous levels of divergence in most parts of Africa. However, this process seems to have broken down in coastal areas of West Africa at the extreme edge of the distribution. We undertook a longitudinal study to describe An. gambiae s.s. populations collected from two inland transects with different ecological characteristics in south-eastern Senegal. Analysis of samples collected from 20 sites across these two transects showed the M and S molecular forms coexisted at almost all sampled sites. Overall, similar hybridization rates (2.16% and 1.86%) were recorded in the two transects; sites with relatively high frequencies of M/S hybrids (up to 7%) were clustered toward the north-western part of both transects, often near urban settings. Estimated inbreeding indices for this putative speciation event varied spatially (range: 0.52–1), with hybridization rates being generally lower than expected under panmictic conditions. Such observations suggest substantial reproductive isolation between the M and S molecular forms, and further support the ongoing process of speciation in these inland areas. According to a recent reclassification of the An. gambiae complex, the M and S molecular forms from this zone correspond to An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, respectively. There is considerable evidence that these molecular forms differ in their behavioural and ecological characteristics. Detailed study of these characteristics will allow the development and implementation of better insect control strategies for combating malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2025945847,"It is generally the case that a significant degree of uncertainty exists concerning the behavior of ecological systems. Adaptive management has been developed to address such structural uncertainty, while recognizing that decisions must be made without full knowledge of how a system behaves. This paradigm attempts to use new information that develops during the course of management to learn how the system works. To date, however, adaptive management has used a very limited information set to characterize the learning that is possible. This paper uses an extension of the Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to expand the information set used to update belief in competing models. This feature can potentially increase the speed of learning through adaptive management, and lead to better management in the future. We apply this framework to a case study wherein interest lies in managing recreational restrictions around golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nesting sites. The ultimate management objective is to maintain an abundant eagle population in Denali National Park while minimizing the regulatory burden on park visitors. In order to capture this objective, we developed a utility function that trades off expected breeding success with hiker access. Our work is relevant to the management of human activities in protected areas, but more generally demonstrates some of the benefits of POMDP in the context of adaptive management."
https://openalex.org/W2146774083,"Mitochondria form a reticulum network dynamically fuse and divide in the cell. The balance between mitochondria fusion and fission is correlated to the shape, activity and integrity of these pivotal organelles. Resveratrol is a polyphenol antioxidant that can extend life span in yeast and worm. This study examined mitochondria dynamics in replicative senescent yeast cells as well as the effects of resveratrol on mitochondria fusion and fission. Collecting cells by biotin-streptavidin sorting method revealed that majority of the replicative senescent cells bear fragmented mitochondrial network, indicating mitochondria dynamics favors fission. Resveratrol treatment resulted in a reduction in the ratio of senescent yeast cells with fragmented mitochondria. The readjustment of mitochondria dynamics induced by resveratrol likely derives from altered expression profiles of fusion and fission genes. Our results demonstrate that resveratrol serves not only as an antioxidant, but also a compound that can mitigate mitochondria fragmentation in replicative senescent yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964538769,"Introduction Epigenetic modifications such as aberrant DNA methylation has long been associated with tumorogenesis. Little is known, however, about how these modifications appear in cancer progression. Comparing the methylome of breast carcinomas and locoregional evolutions could shed light on this process. Methods The methylome profiles of 48 primary breast carcinomas (PT) and their matched axillary metastases (PT/AM pairs, 20 cases), local recurrences (PT/LR pairs, 17 cases) or contralateral breast carcinomas (PT/CL pairs, 11 cases) were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to determine differentially methylated probes (DMPs), and a similarity score was defined to compare methylation profiles. Correlation with copy-number based score was calculated and metastatic-free survival was compared between methods. Results 49 DMPs were found for the PT/AM set, but none for the others (FDR ). Hierarchical clustering clustered 75% of the PT/AM, 47% of the PT/LR, and none of the PT/CL pairs together. A methylation-based score (MS) was defined as a clonality measure. The PT/AM set contained a high proportion of clonal pairs while PT/LR pairs were evenly split between high and low MS score, suggesting two groups: true recurrences (TR) and new primary tumors (NP). CL were classified as new tumors. MS score was significantly correlated with copy-number based scores. There was no significant difference between the metastatic-free survival of groups of patients based on different classifications. Conclusion Epigenomic alterations are well suited to study clonality and track cancer progression. Methylation-based classification of TR and NP performed as well as clinical and copy-number based methods suggesting that these phenomenons are tightly linked."
https://openalex.org/W2078157537,"Tumors are often greatly dependent on signaling cascades promoting cell growth or survival and may become hypersensitive to inactivation of key components within these signaling pathways. Ras and RAF mutations found in human cancer confer constitutive activity to these signaling molecules thereby converting them into an oncogenic state. RAF dimerization is required for normal Ras-dependent RAF activation and is required for the oncogenic potential of mutant RAFs. Here we describe a new mouse model for lung tumor development to investigate the role of B-RAF in oncogenic C-RAF-mediated adenoma initiation and growth. Conditional elimination of B-RAF in C-RAF BxB-expressing embryonic alveolar epithelial type II cells did not block adenoma formation. However, loss of B-RAF led to significantly reduced tumor growth. The diminished tumor growth upon B-RAF inactivation was due to reduced cell proliferation in absence of senescence and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, B-RAF elimination inhibited C-RAF BxB-mediated activation of the mitogenic cascade. In line with these data, mutation of Ser-621 in C-RAF BxB abrogated in vitro the dimerization with B-RAF and blocked the ability to activate the MAPK cascade. Taken together these data indicate that B-RAF is an important factor in oncogenic C-RAF-mediated tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2044732502,"Although rarely considered predators, wildlife hunters can function as important ecological and evolutionary agents. In part, their influence relates to targeting of large reproductive adults within prey populations. Despite known impacts of size-selective harvests, however, we know little about what enables hunters to kill these older, rarer, and presumably more wary individuals. In other mammalian predators, predatory performance varies with knowledge and physical condition, which accumulates and declines, respectively, with age. Moreover, some species evolved camouflage as a physical trait to aid in predatory performance. In this work, we tested whether knowledge-based faculty (use of a hunting guide with accumulated experience in specific areas), physical traits (relative body mass [RBM] and camouflage clothing), and age can predict predatory performance. We measured performance as do many hunters: size of killed cervid prey, using the number of antler tines as a proxy. Examining ∼4300 online photographs of hunters posing with carcasses, we found that only the presence of guides increased the odds of killing larger prey. Accounting for this effect, modest evidence suggested that unguided hunters presumably handicapped with the highest RBM actually had greater odds of killing large prey. There was no association with hunter age, perhaps because of our coarse measure (presence of grey hair) and the performance trade-offs between knowledge accumulation and physical deterioration with age. Despite its prevalence among sampled hunters (80%), camouflage had no influence on size of killed prey. Should these patterns be representative of other areas and prey, and our interpretations correct, evolutionarily-enlightened harvest management might benefit from regulatory scrutiny on guided hunting. More broadly, we suggest that by being nutritionally and demographically de-coupled from prey and aided by efficient killing technology and road access, wildlife hunters in the developed world might have overcome many of the physical, but not knowledge-based, challenges of hunting."
https://openalex.org/W2078464271,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a systemic dysfunction of T-cells. In this study we tested the impact of DMARD and anti-TNF agents on short-term activation characteristics of T-cells. We enrolled 12 patients with newly diagnosed RA (naïve RA) who were treated with methothrexate (MTX) and glucocorticsteroid (GCS) and 22 patients with established RA non responding to conventional DMARD therapy who were treated with different anti-TNF agents. Nine healthy volunteers served as controls. Blood samples were taken at baseline, then at 4th and 8th week of therapy. The characteristics of several intracellular activation processes during short-term activation of T-cells including cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level, mitochondrial Ca(2+) level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generation were determined by a novel flow-cytometry technique. At baseline, the tested processes were comparable to controls in naïve RA. During GCS therapy, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level and ROS generation decreased. After the addition of MTX to GCS cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level became comparable to controls, while ROS generation decreased further. In DMARD non responders, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level was higher than controls at baseline. The cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level became comparable to controls and ROS generation decreased during each of the three anti-TNF-α agent therapies. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) level and NO generation were unaltered in all of the patient groups. These results indicate that intracellular machinery is affected in T-cells of RA patients. This may alter the behavior of T-cells during activation. Different therapeutic approaches may modulate the abnormal T-cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W2089467635,"HER2 and TOP2A gene status are assessed for diagnostic and research purposes in breast cancer with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, FISH probes do not target only the annotated gene, while chromosome 17 (chr17) is among the most unstable chromosomes in breast cancer. Here we asked whether the status of specifically targeted genes on chr17 might help in refining prognosis of early high-risk breast cancer patients.Copy numbers (CN) for 14 genes on chr17, 4 of which were within and 10 outside the core HER2 amplicon (HER2- and non-HER2-genes, respectively) were assessed with qPCR in 485 paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in the frame of two randomized phase III trials.HER2-genes CN strongly correlated to each other (Spearman's rho >0.6) and were concordant with FISH HER2 status (Kappa 0.6697 for ERBB2 CN). TOP2A CN were not concordant with TOP2A FISH status (Kappa 0.1154). CN hierarchical clustering revealed distinct patterns of gains, losses and complex alterations in HER2- and non-HER2-genes associated with IHC4 breast cancer subtypes. Upon multivariate analysis, non-HER2-gene gains independently predicted for shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with triple-negative cancer, as compared to luminal and HER2-positive tumors (interaction p = 0.007 for DFS and p = 0.011 for OS). Similarly, non-HER2-gene gains were associated with worse prognosis in patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery as compared to modified radical mastectomy (p = 0.004 for both DFS and OS). Non-HER2-gene losses were unfavorable prognosticators in patients with 1-3 metastatic nodes, as compared to those with 4 or more nodes (p = 0.017 for DFS and p = 0.001 for OS).TOP2A FISH and qPCR may not identify the same pathology on chr17q. Non-HER2 chr17 CN patterns may further predict outcome in breast cancer patients with known favorable and unfavorable prognosis."
