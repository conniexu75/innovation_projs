https://openalex.org/W4220861013,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant of concern evades antibody-mediated immunity that comes from vaccination or infection with earlier variants due to accumulation of numerous spike mutations. To understand the Omicron antigenic shift, we determined cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystal structures of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain bound to the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) S309 (the parent mAb of sotrovimab) and to the human ACE2 receptor. We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity. Remodeling of interactions between the Omicron receptor-binding domain and human ACE2 likely explains the enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the ancestral virus."
https://openalex.org/W4206915534,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogenous autoimmune disease in which autoreactive lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS contribute to inflammation and secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulins1,2. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been epidemiologically linked to MS, but its pathological role remains unclear3. Here we demonstrate high-affinity molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and the central nervous system protein glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM) and provide structural and in vivo functional evidence for its relevance. A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements and the crystal structure of the EBNA1-peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment enabled tracking of the development of the naive EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1-GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates disease in a mouse model of MS, and anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in patients with MS. Our results provide a mechanistic link for the association between MS and EBV and could guide the development of new MS therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4206931214,"Abstract Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA-binding protein that is genetically and pathologically associated with rare and aggressive forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To explore the mechanisms by which mutant FUS causes neurodegeneration in ALS-FTD, we generated a series of FUS knock-in mouse lines that express the equivalent of ALS-associated mutant FUSP525L and FUSΔEX14 protein. In FUS mutant mice, we show progressive, age-dependent motor neuron loss as a consequence of a dose-dependent gain of toxic function, associated with the insolubility of FUS and related RNA-binding proteins. In this disease-relevant mouse model of ALS-FUS, we show that ION363, a non-allele-specific FUS antisense oligonucleotide, efficiently silences Fus and reduces postnatal levels of FUS protein in the brain and spinal cord, delaying motor neuron degeneration. In a patient with ALS with a FUSP525L mutation, we provide preliminary evidence that repeated intrathecal infusions of ION363 lower wild-type and mutant FUS levels in the central nervous system, resulting in a marked reduction in the burden of FUS aggregates that are a pathological hallmark of disease. In mouse genetic and human clinical studies, we provide evidence in support of FUS silencing as a therapeutic strategy in FUS-dependent ALS and FTD."
https://openalex.org/W4220846827,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Beta variant of concern (VOC) resists neutralization by major classes of antibodies from COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. In this study, serum of Beta-infected patients revealed reduced cross-neutralization of wild-type virus. From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of mutations present in Beta and Omicron into a major antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with wild type-elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype that targets the RBD ridge. These findings advance our understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 shaped by antigenic drift, with implications for design of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4207036299,"Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) lacking a human leukocyte antigen-matched donor may benefit from gene therapy through the provision of gene-corrected, autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we present comprehensive, long-term follow-up results (median follow-up, 7.6 years) (phase I/II trial no. NCT02333760 ) for eight patients with WAS having undergone phase I/II lentiviral vector-based gene therapy trials (nos. NCT01347346 and NCT01347242 ), with a focus on thrombocytopenia and autoimmunity. Primary outcomes of the long-term study were to establish clinical and biological safety, efficacy and tolerability by evaluating the incidence and type of serious adverse events and clinical status and biological parameters including lentiviral genomic integration sites in different cell subpopulations from 3 years to 15 years after gene therapy. Secondary outcomes included monitoring the need for additional treatment and T cell repertoire diversity. An interim analysis shows that the study meets the primary outcome criteria tested given that the gene-corrected cells engrafted stably, and no serious treatment-associated adverse events occurred. Overall, severe infections and eczema resolved. Autoimmune disorders and bleeding episodes were significantly less frequent, despite only partial correction of the platelet compartment. The results suggest that lentiviral gene therapy provides sustained clinical benefits for patients with WAS."

https://openalex.org/W4206963232,"Past works have linked the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health responses such as isolation, quarantine, and lockdown to increased anxiety, sleep disorders, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Only a few studies, mostly carried out in high-income countries, have investigated the association between the pandemic and suicide rate. We seek to investigate the changes in the monthly suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, compared to the pre-pandemic suicide rates.This is a retrospective study investigating the changes in suicide rates in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic period (April 2020 to June 2021), compared to the pre-pandemic period (July 2017 to March 2020), adjusted for seasonality and long-term trend in the suicide rate. We performed analysis for the entire country as well as sub-sample analyses stratified by gender and provinces. A total of 24350 suicides deaths during four years of the study window were analyzed. We found an overall increase in the monthly suicide rate in Nepal with an average increase of 0.28 (CI: 0.12,0.45) suicide per 100,000 during the pandemic months. The increase in suicide rate was significant both among males (increase in rate = 0.26, CI: 0.02,0.50) and females (increase in rate = 0.30, CI: 0.18,0.43). The most striking increments in suicide rates were observed in June, July, and August 2020. The pattern of increased suicide rates faded away early on among males, but the effect was sustained for a longer duration among females. Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces had the highest increase in suicide rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased suicide rate in Nepal. The findings may inform policymakers in designing appropriate public health responses to the pandemic that are considerate of the potential impact on mental health and suicide."

https://openalex.org/W4206965940,"This study evaluated the relationship between water pH and the physicochemical properties of water while controlling for the influence of heavy metals and bacteriological factors using a nested logistic regression model. The study further sought to assess how these relationships are compared across confined water systems (ground water) and open water systems (surface water). Samples were collected from 100 groundwater and 132 surface water locations in the Tarkwa mining area. For the zero-order relationship in groundwater, EC, TDS, TSS, Ca, SO42-, total alkalinity, Zn, Mn, Cu, faecal and total coliform were more likely to predict optimal water pH. For surface water however, only TSS, turbidity, total alkalinity and Ca were significant predictors of optimal pH levels. At the multivariate level for groundwater, TDS, turbidity, total alkalinity and TSS were more likely to predict optimal water pH while EC, Mg, Mn and Zn were associated with non-optimal water pH. For the surface water system, turbidity, Ca, TSS, NO3, Mn and total coliform were associated with optimal water pH while SO42-, EC, Zn, Cu, and faecal coliform were associated with non-optimal water pH. The non-robustness of predictors in the surface water models were conspicuous. The results indicate that the relationship between water pH and other water quality parameters are different in different water systems and can be influenced by the presence of other parameters. Associations between parameters are steadier in groundwater systems due to its confined nature. Extraneous inputs and physical variations subject surface water to constant variations which reflected in the non-robustness of the predictors. However, the carbonate system was influential in how water quality parameters associate with one another in both ground and surface water systems. This study affirms that chemical constituents in natural water bodies react in the environment in far more complicated ways than if they were isolated and that the interaction between various parameters could predict the quality of water in a particular system."
https://openalex.org/W4226112714,"Physics-based predictive simulations have been shown to capture many salient features of human walking. Yet they often fail to produce realistic stance knee and ankle mechanics. While the influence of the performance criterion on the predicted walking pattern has been previously studied, the influence of musculoskeletal mechanics has been less explored. Here, we investigated the influence of two mechanical assumptions on the predicted walking pattern: the complexity of the foot model and the stiffness of the Achilles tendon. We found, through three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of walking, that modeling the toes, and thus using two-segment instead of single-segment foot models, contributed to robustly eliciting physiological stance knee flexion angles, knee extension torques, and knee extensor activity. Modeling toes also slightly decreased the first vertical ground reaction force peak, increasing its agreement with experimental data, and improved stance ankle kinetics. It nevertheless slightly worsened predictions of ankle kinematics. Decreasing Achilles tendon stiffness improved the realism of ankle kinematics, but there remain large discrepancies with experimental data. Overall, this simulation study shows that not only the performance criterion but also mechanical assumptions affect predictive simulations of walking. Improving the realism of predictive simulations is required for their application in clinical contexts. Here, we suggest that using more complex foot models might contribute to such realism."

Following a multimodal pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) treatment, a reduction in pain and improvement in psychosexual outcomes were found in the short term, but no study thus far has examined whether these changes are sustained over time.To examine the improvements in pain, sexual functioning, sexual distress, body image concerns, pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, painful intercourse self-efficacy, depressive symptoms and pelvic floor disorder symptoms in gynecological cancer survivors with dyspareunia after PFPT, and to explore women's perceptions of treatment effects at one-year follow-up.This mixed-method study included 31 gynecological cancer survivors affected by dyspareunia. The women completed a 12-week PFPT treatment comprising education, manual therapy and pelvic floor muscle exercises. Quantitative data were collected using validated questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment and one-year follow-up. As for qualitative data, semi-structured interviews were conducted at one-year follow-up to better understand women's perception and experience of treatment effects.Significant improvements were found from baseline to one-year follow-up on all quantitative outcomes (P ≤ 0.028). Moreover, no changes were found from post-treatment to one-year follow-up, supporting that the improvements were sustained at follow-up. Qualitative data highlighted that reduction in pain, improvement in sexual functioning and reduction in urinary symptoms were the most meaningful effects perceived by participants. Women expressed that these effects resulted from positive biological, psychological and social changes attributable to multimodal PFPT. Adherence was also perceived to influence treatment outcomes.Findings suggest that the short-term improvements following multimodal PFPT are sustained and meaningful for gynecological cancer survivors with dyspareunia one year after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4206996735,"Nucleoprotein complexes play an integral role in genome organization of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Apart from their role in locally structuring and compacting DNA, several complexes are known to influence global organization by mediating long-range anchored chromosomal loop formation leading to spatial segregation of large sections of DNA. Such megabase-range interactions are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, but have not been demonstrated in prokaryotes. Here, using a genome-wide sedimentation-based approach, we found that a transcription factor, Rok, forms large nucleoprotein complexes in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Using chromosome conformation capture and live-imaging of DNA loci, we show that these complexes robustly interact with each other over large distances. Importantly, these Rok-dependent long-range interactions lead to anchored chromosomal loop formation, thereby spatially isolating large sections of DNA, as previously observed for insulator proteins in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W4206911473,"The bacterial second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) controls various cellular processes, including motility, toxin production, and biofilm formation. c-di-GMP is enzymatically synthesized by GGDEF domain-containing diguanylate cyclases and degraded by HD-GYP domain-containing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to 2 GMP or by EAL domain-containing PDE-As to 5'-phosphoguanylyl-(3',5')-guanosine (pGpG). Since excess pGpG feedback inhibits PDE-A activity and thereby can lead to the uncontrolled accumulation of c-di-GMP, a PDE that degrades pGpG to 2 GMP (PDE-B) has been presumed to exist. To date, the only enzyme known to hydrolyze pGpG is oligoribonuclease Orn, which degrades all kinds of oligoribonucleotides. Here, we identified a pGpG-specific PDE, which we named PggH, using biochemical approaches in the gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Biochemical experiments revealed that PggH exhibited specific PDE activity only toward pGpG, thus differing from the previously reported Orn. Furthermore, the high-resolution structure of PggH revealed the basis for its PDE activity and narrow substrate specificity. Finally, we propose that PggH could modulate the activities of PDE-As and the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP, resulting in phenotypic changes including in biofilm formation."
https://openalex.org/W4206929028,"Background The benefits of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to chronic heart failure (CHF) patients is controversial. We investigated the beneficial effects of a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, topiroxostat, in patients with CHF and hyperuricemia (HU), in comparison to allopurinol. Methods and results The prospective, randomized open-label, blinded-end-point study was performed in 141 patients with CHF and HU at 4 centers. Patients were randomly assigned to either topiroxostat or allopurinol group to achieve target uric acid level ≤6.0 mg/dL. According to the protocol, 140 patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Percent change in ln (N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) at week 24 (primary endpoint) was comparable between topiroxostat and allopurinol groups (1.6±8.2 versus -0.4±8.0%; P = 0.17). In the limited number of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricle ejection fraction &lt;45%), ratio of peak early diastolic flow velocity at mitral valve leaflet to early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E/e’) decreased in topiroxostat group, but not in allopurinol group. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine and L-type fatty acid-binding protein levels increased and osmolality decreased significantly in allopurinol group, while these changes were less or absent in topiroxostat group. In allopurinol group HFrEF patients, additional to the increases in these urinary marker levels, urinary creatinine levels decreased, with no change in clearance, but not in topiroxostat group. Conclusions Compared with allopurinol, topiroxostat did not show great benefits in patients with CHF and HU. However, topiroxostat might have potential advantages of reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not worsening oxidative stress in proximal renal tubule, and renoprotection over allopurinol in HFrEF patients."
https://openalex.org/W4207050880,"Faithful replication of genomic DNA by high-fidelity DNA polymerases is crucial for the survival of most living organisms. While high-fidelity DNA polymerases favor canonical base pairs over mismatches by a factor of ∼1 × 105, fidelity is further enhanced several orders of magnitude by a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease that selectively removes mispaired bases in the primer strand. Despite the importance of proofreading to maintaining genome stability, it remains much less studied than the fidelity mechanisms employed at the polymerase active site. Here we characterize the substrate specificity for the proofreading exonuclease of a high-fidelity DNA polymerase by investigating the proofreading kinetics on various DNA substrates. The contribution of the exonuclease to net fidelity is a function of the kinetic partitioning between extension and excision. We show that while proofreading of a terminal mismatch is efficient, proofreading a mismatch buried by one or two correct bases is even more efficient. Because the polymerase stalls after incorporation of a mismatch and after incorporation of one or two correct bases on top of a mismatch, the net contribution of the exonuclease is a function of multiple opportunities to correct mistakes. We also characterize the exonuclease stereospecificity using phosphorothioate-modified DNA, provide a homology model for the DNA primer strand in the exonuclease active site, and propose a dynamic structural model for the transfer of DNA from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site based on MD simulations.

DNA polymerases have evolved to efficiently copy genomes with extremely high fidelity to fulfill their critical role in maintaining genome stability. A large contribution to replication fidelity comes from a finely tuned polymerase active site that makes errors in only one out of 105 base pairs while incorporating nucleotides at rates exceeding 300 per second (1Dangerfield T.L. Johnson K.A. Conformational dynamics during high-fidelity DNA replication and translocation defined using a DNA polymerase with a fluorescent artificial amino acid.J. Biol.

High-fidelity polymerases also contain a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease that further increases replication fidelity by removing mismatches after they are incorporated. The contribution of this activity to fidelity varies depending on the enzyme (3Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Kinetic characterization of the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the gene 43 protein of bacteriophage T4.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar), ranging from a factor of ∼10 to more than 10,000 (4Donlin M.J.

Significant contribution of the 3'→5' exonuclease activity to the high fidelity of nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by human DNA polymerase ε.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 13853-13860Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that the substrate for the exonuclease reaction is at least partially single-stranded, rather than duplex DNA, based on the temperature dependence of the exonuclease reaction (7Brutlag D. Kornberg A. Enzymatic synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid: XXXVI. A proofreading function for the 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity in deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Google Scholar), but temperature dependence alone cannot distinguish alternative models because of expected differences in the thermodynamics of DNA binding at the pol (polymerase) and exo (exonuclease) sites. Before structures were available, early work was complicated by the low sequence identity of different exonucleases as sequence alignment of exonuclease domains from different enzymes usually gives less than 15% sequence identity (8Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Eukaryotic DNA polymerase amino acid sequence required for 3’—5’ exonuclease activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Google Scholar, 9Wang J. Yu P.

Subsequent crystal structures and kinetic studies on T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow Fragment polymerase identified conserved active site carboxylates that coordinate two metal ions at the exo site, suggesting a general two-metal ion mechanism (9Wang J.

Studies on phosphorothioate DNA supported this mechanism and afforded insights into the stereochemistry of the reaction (11Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A.

The DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 has been an important model system for understanding high-fidelity DNA replication due to its simple structure consisting of only two polypeptides (phage T7 gene product 5 and Escherichia coli thioredoxin) and its fast, accurate, and processive DNA replication. We previously determined the complete kinetic pathway of correct nucleotide incorporation and misincorporation by T7 DNA polymerase using a variant with a fluorescent artificial amino acid (15Dangerfield T.L.

Characterization of conformational dynamics during misincorporation and mismatch extension using a DNA polymerase with a fluorescent artificial amino acid.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 298: 101451Google Scholar). This polymerase also features a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease active site within the N-terminal region of gene product 5, approximately 35 Å from the polymerase active site. Prior studies provided an initial kinetic model for exonuclease proofreading by this enzyme (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Kinetic partitioning between the exonuclease and polymerase sites in DNA error correction.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar), showing that: 1) ssDNA binds directly to the exonuclease active site and is rapidly hydrolyzed at a rate of at least 1000 s−1; 2) a fraction of dsDNA substrate binds directly to the exonuclease active site and is rapidly hydrolyzed, while the remainder binds at the polymerase active site and then transfers to the exo site, which limits the rate of mismatch hydrolysis (Scheme in Fig. 1). The fraction that binds to each site and the rate of transfer between the two active sites are dependent on the extent of fraying of the primer terminus of the DNA substrate. Although it was shown that mismatches can be slowly extended by correct bases (kcat: 0.025 s−1 km: 87 μM (17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. An induced-fit kinetic mechanism for DNA replication fidelity: Direct measurement by single-turnover kinetics.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Google Scholar)) and are rarely extended by a mismatched nucleotide, important outstanding questions remain. In particular, the rate of extension relative to excision of these buried mismatches remains to be measured to assess the net contribution of the exonuclease to replication fidelity. Moreover, there is no structural model for the exonuclease–DNA complex of T7 DNA polymerase. In this paper, we present our kinetic characterization of the substrate specificity of the proofreading exonuclease of T7 DNA polymerase. We address the temperature dependence of the proofreading reaction, measure the kinetics of extension versus excision of buried mismatches, and propose a structural model for the exonuclease active site based on homology modeling refined by MD simulation. Our data demonstrate that the fidelity of this enzyme may be much higher than that previously estimated and shows key active site differences when compared with other DNA polymerases with proofreading exonuclease domains. We performed our previous kinetic studies on the correct nucleotide incorporation for T7 DNA polymerase at 4 °C in order to better resolve the fast rate of the conformational change step, so we initially performed experiments to characterize the exonuclease activity at 4 °C to be consistent with the previous results (1Dangerfield T.L. Johnson K.A. Conformational dynamics during high-fidelity DNA replication and translocation defined using a DNA polymerase with a fluorescent artificial amino acid.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100143Google Scholar). Our previous study and others (18Fiala K.A. Sherrer S.M. Brown J.A. Suo Z.

A new general method for simultaneous fitting of temperature and concentration dependence of reaction rates yields kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for HIV reverse transcriptase specificity.J.

Enzymatic synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid: XXXVI. A proofreading function for the 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity in deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Google Scholar) showed a strong temperature dependence of the reaction, which was attributed to the effect of temperature on the melting of mispaired DNA bases, but could be a function of other structural changes involved in transferring DNA from the polymerase to the exo sites. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the proofreading reaction for T7 DNA polymerase remains to be studied. To begin our studies on the proofreading exonuclease activity for T7 DNA polymerase, we performed single turnover rapid quench experiments with synthetic DNA substrates containing 0 through 5 terminal mismatches (Table 1) at 4 and 20 °C (Fig. 1). A 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) label on the primer strand was used to quantify the reaction products by PAGE or by capillary electrophoresis (20Dangerfield T.L. Huang N.Z. Johnson K.A. High throughput quantification of short nucleic acid samples by capillary electrophoresis with automated data processing.Anal. Biochem. 2021; 629: 114239Google Scholar). A molar excess of T7 DNA polymerase was mixed with the DNA substrate of interest to start the reaction, and samples were quenched at various times by addition of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.3 M). The loss of the starting material (27 nt primer) for each substrate was fit by simulation using the model shown in Figure 1.

Percent flux was derived numerically from the partial derivatives in KinTek Explorer as described in Experimental procedures. In the simple model in the scheme in Figure 1, adapted from earlier studies on exonuclease proofreading for T7 DNA polymerase (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Kinetic partitioning between the exonuclease and polymerase sites in DNA error correction.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar), the DNA can bind either at the polymerase active site (with second order rate constant, k1) and then transfer to the exonuclease active site (k3), or the DNA can bind directly to the exonuclease active site (k2) where it is rapidly hydrolyzed at a rate of ∼1000 s−1 (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Kinetic partitioning between the exonuclease and polymerase sites in DNA error correction.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar). This model explains the biphasic nature of the excision data, where the fast phase represents the fraction binding directly to the exonuclease active site where it is rapid excised, and the slower phase represents the fraction that binds at the polymerase active site and is more slowly transferred to the exonuclease active site. Initial attempts to fit the simple excision data to this model revealed that the individual rate constants for binding (k1, k2) and dissociation (k−1, k−2) at the exonuclease and polymerase active sites were not well constrained by the data. While the individual rate constants could take on a large number of values and still provide a reasonable fit, it was clear that the ratio of second order rate constants for binding at the two sites was well constrained by the data. Therefore, to extract the relevant information using a minimal model, we locked k1 at 300 μM−1s−1 as a reasonable estimate for diffusion-limited DNA binding (although all values from ∼50–600 μM−1s−1 gave a nearly identical fit), we locked k−1 and k−2 at 0.2 s−1 as reasonable minimal estimates for rates of DNA dissociation from each site (although values up to 50 s−1 depending on k1 and k2 gave reasonably good fits). We then allowed k2 to float in the fitting. This approach to global fitting allowed us to accurately extract the information content of the data; namely, the relative rates of binding to the pol and exo sites and the rate and equilibrium constants for transfer from the pol to the exo site. For each substrate, we then used the flux calculation feature of KinTek Explorer (see Experimental procedures) to determine the fraction of DNA that binds from solution to each site and the rate of transfer from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site. These are the principal parameters that were well defined by the data. The flux, rates of transfer between active sites, as well as the individual rate constants used in the flux calculation are given in Table 2. In addition to these parameters, another step was added that limits the fraction of hydrolyzed DNA in the first binding event since the curves did not trend toward complete reaction on the timescale of the experiments. We added a step where the EDp state interconverts to an intermediate inhibited state, EDI, to account for the nonzero endpoint. The resulting rate constants for the partitioning of the EDp state are given in Table 2. To simplify the interpretation, we performed flux calculations to determine the fraction of EDp that partitions to EDx versus EDI (Table 2). Although the biphasic nature of the curves is consistent with previous work, the activity we measured at 4 °C was significantly lower than that previously reported for this enzyme at 20 °C, as demonstrated by the data in Figure 1 and the quantification in Table 2. Even with five terminal mismatches, less than 35% of the DNA bound directly to the exonuclease active site from solution and a significant fraction (∼25%) partitioned into the inhibited state at 4 °C. We then repeated the above experiments at 20 °C to examine the effect of temperature on the proofreading reaction. DNA substrates with various numbers of mismatches were mixed with an excess of T7 DNA polymerase to start the reaction in the quench-flow instrument. Samples were processed as described above to give the results shown in Figure 1B with the fitted parameters shown in Table 3. We found much faster exonuclease activity at 20 °C, with rates comparable to those observed in earlier studies (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Kinetic partitioning between the exonuclease and polymerase sites in DNA error correction.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar). When increasing the temperature from 4 °C to 20 °C (Tables 2 and 3), the rates of transfer from the polymerase to exonuclease active site increase by factors of 2 to 10, depending on the DNA substrate, while the fraction that bound directly to the exonuclease active site also increased by a factor ranging from two- to eightfold. Finally, a greater fraction partitioned from EDp to EDx relative to EDI at 20 °C, accounting for the observation that the reaction proceeded more closely toward completion at the higher temperature.Table 3Kinetic parameters from fitting data with different numbers of mismatches at 20 °C# Of mismatches% FluxDNA to EDx versus EDp% FluxEDp to EDx versus EIk3 (s−1)K3k2 (μM−1 s−1)k4 (s−1)k−4 (s−1)0<1–0.023 ± 0.0060.00872.6 ± 1.6––16382.9 ± 0.30.06118.3 ± 3.55.42 ± 0.730.33 ± 0.05233787.7 ± 0.70.473142 ± 72.22 ± 0.963.2 ± 1.23378216.6 ± 1.80.573172 ± 113.9 ± 1.21.8 ± 0.745010069 ± 81.003301 ± 25––559100102 ± 101.400420 ± 28––Rate and equilibrium constants are numbered according to the scheme in Figure 1 and were derived by global data fitting as described in the text.

Percent flux was derived numerically from the partial derivatives in KinTek Explorer as described in Experimental procedures. Inclusion of the EDI state is necessary to construct a minimal model that accurately describes the data, but its identity is unknown. Transfer of DNA to the exo site presumably depends on the fraction of frayed primer at the pol site, so the EDI state could be due to a small fraction of nonfrayed DNA that is stabilized at the pol site, perhaps by a conformational change in the enzyme corresponding to the nucleotide-induced closed state (1Dangerfield T.L. Johnson K.A. Conformational dynamics during high-fidelity DNA replication and translocation defined using a DNA polymerase with a fluorescent artificial amino acid.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100143Google Scholar). Previously we calculated the fidelity of wild-type T7 DNA polymerase at the polymerase active site at 4 °C (15Dangerfield T.L. Johnson K.A. Optimized incorporation of an unnatural fluorescent amino acid affords measurement of conformational dynamics governing high-fidelity DNA replication.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 17265-17280Google Scholar) and found that it was comparable with the value measured at 20 °C (17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. An induced-fit kinetic mechanism for DNA replication fidelity: Direct measurement by single-turnover kinetics.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Google Scholar), indicating that despite changing rate constants, the overall fidelity of the polymerase during incorporation was not significantly affected by temperature. This unexpected result is consistent with the broad physiological temperature range for bacteriophage T7. However, we observed a large effect of temperature on the proofreading activity, presumably reflecting the significant conformational changes in the enzyme and DNA melting required to transfer the DNA primer strand from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site approximately 35 Å away. Because of the strong temperature dependence on the proofreading reaction between 4 °C and 20 °C, the rest of the experiments in this paper were performed at 20 °C to more closely mimic standard physiological conditions. In the previous section, we showed that DNA substrates containing more terminal mismatches were excised faster than DNA substrates with fewer mismatches. This is not surprising as mismatched primer termini are typically frayed and are expected to more readily bind to the exonuclease active site (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Kinetic partitioning between the exonuclease and polymerase sites in DNA error correction.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar). As the temperature increases, so does the degree of fraying of the mismatch and correspondingly more of the primer strand partitions into the exonuclease active site. However, the probability of creating such a substrate with multiple terminal mismatches in vivo is highly unlikely for this enzyme. The experiments in Figure 1 were designed to probe the underlying mechanisms rather than represent physiologically relevant states. A more likely scenario is that after misincorporation, the mismatch may either be removed or extended by the addition of the next correct nucleotide (17Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. An induced-fit kinetic mechanism for DNA replication fidelity: Direct measurement by single-turnover kinetics.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Google Scholar), potentially allowing further polymerization of more correct nucleotides and in turn, burying the mismatch so a mutation becomes incorporated into the genome. To assess whether the exonuclease was afforded multiple opportunities for proofreading after a single mismatch, we compared rates of excision of mismatches buried by different numbers of correct base pairs. Rapid quench experiments (at 20 °C) were performed as before by mixing DNA with an excess of T7 DNA polymerase to start the reaction. The data were analyzed as described in the previous section. Figure 2A shows the time course of excision for the various buried mismatches tested, with mismatches at various positions from n-1 to n-10 relative to the 3′ end of the primer, in addition to a 3′ terminal mismatch (n-0). Data were fit by simulation using the model in Figure 1, as described above, to derive the fraction of DNA that binds directly to the exonuclease active site versus the polymerase active site, the flux from EDp to EDx relative to EDI, and the rate of transfer from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site. Rate constants and flux parameters estimated from the fitting are given in Table 4. Surprisingly, mismatches buried at the n-1 through n-3 position were removed even more efficiently than the 3′-terminal mismatch (n-0). The fraction that bound to the exo site from solution relative to the pol site was 5 to 9 times greater than for the terminal mismatch, and the rate of transfer from EDp to EDx was 2 to 5 times greater than the substrate containing a 3′-terminal mismatch (n-0). Substrates with buried mismatches at the n-4 and n-5 positions, however, were removed slower than a terminal mismatch. Minimal exonuclease activity was observed for the n-7 and n-10 buried mismatch substrates, although these substrates were hydrolyzed at rates slightly faster than the substrate with 0 mismatches. These results suggest that the mechanisms governing how mutations are removed or stably incorporated into the genome by this high-fidelity DNA polymerase must be re-evaluated. Proofreading appears to remove a mismatch most efficiently after it has been buried by incorporation of correct base pairs. However, to fully evaluate the fate of a mismatch, we need to measure rates of extension and excision.Table 4Kinetic parameters from fitting data at different buried mismatch position at 20 °CBuried mismatch position% FluxDNA to EDx versus EDp% FluxEDp to EDx versus EIk3 (s−1)K3k2 (μM−1 s−1)k4 (s−1)k−4 (s−1)n-0 (3′ mismatch)6352.9 ± 0.30.06118.3 ± 3.55.42 ± 0.730.33 ± 0.05n-1388814.9 ± 1.30.597179 ± 112.33 ± 0.580.62 ± 0.27n-25510031 ± 31.19357 ± 24––n-329727.3 ± 0.60.393118 ± 63.0 ± 0.72.3 ± 0.4n-4<1–0.22 ± 0.010.007<2––n-55–0.29 ± 0.010.04914.7 ± 3.1––n-7<1–0.078 ± 0.0030.007<2––n-10<1–0.028 ± 0.0010.007<2––Rate and equilibrium constants are numbered according to the scheme in Figure 1 and were derived by global data f"
https://openalex.org/W4207061265,"Binocular vision uses the parallax principle of the human eye to obtain 3D information of an object, which is widely used as an important means of acquiring 3D information for 3D reconstruction tasks. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D reconstruction, we propose a 3D reconstruction method that combines second-order semiglobal matching, guided filtering and Delaunay triangulation. First, the existing second-order semiglobal matching method is improved, and the smoothness constraint of multiple angle directions is added to the matching cost to generate a more robust disparity map. Second, the 3D coordinates of all points are calculated by combining camera parameters and disparity maps to obtain the 3D point cloud, which is smoothed by guided filtering to remove noise points and retain details. Finally, a method to quickly locate the insertion point and accelerate Delaunay triangulation is proposed. The surface of the point cloud is reconstructed by Delaunay triangulation based on fast point positioning to improve the visibility of the 3D model. The proposed approach was evaluated using the Middlebury and KITTI datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed second-order semiglobal matching method has higher accuracy than other stereo matching methods and that the proposed Delaunay triangulation method based on fast point location requires less time than the original Delaunay triangulation."
https://openalex.org/W4220736552,"Abstract Local invasion is the initial step towards metastasis, the main cause of cancer mortality. In human colorectal cancer (CRC), malignant cells predominantly invade as cohesive collectives and may undergo partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) at the invasive front. How this particular mode of stromal infiltration is generated is unknown. Here we investigated the impact of oncogenic transformation and the microenvironment on tumor cell invasion using genetically engineered organoids as CRC models. We found that inactivation of the Apc tumor suppressor combined with expression of oncogenic Kras G12D and dominant-negative Trp53 R172H did not cell-autonomously induce invasion in vitro. However, oncogenic transformation primed organoids for activation of a collective invasion program upon exposure to the prototypical microenvironmental factor TGFβ1. Execution of this program co-depended on a permissive extracellular matrix which was further actively remodeled by invading organoids. Although organoids shed some epithelial properties particularly at the invasive edge, TGFβ1-stimulated organoids largely maintained epithelial gene expression while additionally implementing a mesenchymal transcription pattern, resulting in a pEMT phenotype that did not progress to a fully mesenchymal state. Notably, while TGFβ1 induced pEMT and promoted collective invasion, it abrogated self-renewal capacity of TKA organoids which correlated with the downregulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) marker genes. Mechanistically, induction of the non-progressive pEMT required canonical TGFβ signaling mediated by Smad transcription factors (TFs), whereas the EMT master regulators Snail1 and Zeb1 were dispensable. Gene expression profiling provided further evidence for pEMT of TGFβ1-treated organoids and showed that their transcriptomes resemble those of human poor prognosis CMS4 cancers which likewise exhibit pEMT features. We propose that collective invasion in colorectal carcinogenesis is triggered by microenvironmental stimuli through activation of a novel, transcription-mediated form of non-progressive pEMT independently of classical EMT regulators."

Members of the family Herpesviridae are membrane-enveloped viruses, characterized by a comparably large particle size (100–300 nm) and a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The nine presently known human herpesviruses can be assigned to three subfamilies, i.e., the α-, β-, and γ-Herpesvirinae, based on their morphology, genetics, and biological properties (1Roizman B. Baines J. The diversity and unity of Herpesviridae.Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1991; 14: 63-79Google Scholar). A typical feature of all herpesvirus infections is their lifelong persistence in the host with extended periods of latency followed by intermittent periods of reactivation. While most herpesviral infections may remain on subclinical or asymptomatic stages in immunocompetent persons, severe impairments of health can occur in older persons and/or those with a compromised immune system, such as patients suffering from AIDS/immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (HIV-1), immunosuppressive treatment or cancer therapy. The present study focuses on the α-herpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV, HHV-3), which shows a seroprevalence of >90 % in the human population worldwide (2Bollaerts K. Riera-Montes M. Heininger U. Hens N. Souverain A. Verstraeten T. Hartwig S. A systematic review of varicella seroprevalence in European countries before universal childhood immunization: Deriving incidence from seroprevalence data.Epidemiol. Infect. 2017; 145: 2666-2677Google Scholar). VZV causes chickenpox (varicella) in children and persists in the nervous system of the immunocompetent host during latency. Upon reactivation, VZV leads to lesions known as shingles (zoster) and can cause severe neurological conditions such as acute sequelae or continuing burning pain. The prototype viruses of the β- and γ-subfamilies are human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), respectively. HCMV has a seroprevalence of 40% to 95% in various parts of the world, and congenital HCMV infections (cCMV) acquired during pregnancy can lead to stillbirth, severe birth defects in newborns as well as late-onset developmental retardation (3Marschall M.

Dis. 2017; 17: e177-e188Google Scholar). EBV is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis, and in addition, EBV infections are associated with various, typically malignant tumors, such as Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, posttransplant B and T cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma (6Jha H.C. Banerjee S. Robertson E.S. The role of gammaherpesviruses in cancer pathogenesis.Pathogens. 2016; 5: 18Google Scholar). Animal herpesviruses such as bovine α-herpesvirus 1, equine herpesviruses, or pseudorabies virus (PRV) can cause pathogenic infections in domesticated animals. These are often met by a strict culling policy causing severe economic repercussions (7Oladunni F.S. Horohov D.W. Chambers T.M. EHV-1: A constant threat to the horse industry.Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10: 2668Google Scholar, 8Raaperi K. Orro T. Viltrop A. Epidemiology and control of bovine herpesvirus 1 infection in Europe.Vet. J. 2014; 201: 249-256Google Scholar, 9Pomeranz L.E.

Although antiviral drugs and vaccines exist for combatting some herpesvirus infections, approved vaccines against HCMV and EBV are still missing, and in cases of clinically problematic VZV infections, antiviral therapy has not yet achieved the desired efficacy. Treatments are also under the continuous threat of the emergence of viral drug resistance or vaccine escape mutations. Hence, the identification of novel antiherpesviral drugs and targeting strategies remains a global research focus (10Britt W.J. Prichard M.N. New therapies for human cytomegalovirus infections.Antiviral Res. 2018; 159: 153-174Google Scholar, 11Perera M.R. Wills M.R. Sinclair J.H. HCMV antivirals and strategies to target the latent reservoir.Viruses. 2021; 13: 817Google Scholar). Common to all herpesviruses is the preassembly of capsids in the nucleus, whereas the final maturation of virions occurs in the cytosol and trans-Golgi membrane vesicles. Due to size constraints, intranuclear capsids cannot migrate from the nucleoplasm to the cytosol via the nuclear pore complex (NPC) but rely on the mechanism of nuclear egress that is regulated in a herpesvirus-specific manner (12Hellberg T. Passvogel L. Schulz K.S. Klupp B.G. Mettenleiter T.C. Nuclear egress of herpesviruses: The prototypic vesicular nucleocytoplasmic transport.Adv.

Virol. 2017; 27https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1934Google Scholar). This process starts with the formation of the core nuclear egress complex (core NEC) formed between two viral proteins, namely between a membrane-associated and a nucleoplasmic-soluble protein. The core NEC combines multiple regulatory aspects. For once, it functions as a scaffold platform for the recruitment of virus- and host-cell-derived NEC-associated effector proteins that destabilize the lamina at the inner layer of the nuclear envelope and induce membrane fission (13Marschall M.

Secondly, the complex associates to higher oligomers, specifically to hexameric and possibly pentameric arrangements, that induce capsid docking followed by budding through the inner nuclear membrane (15Bigalke J.M.

A hallmark of all complexes is the so-called hook-into-groove interaction with the membrane-associated NEC protein (e.g., VZV Orf24) forming a groove-like interaction surface, onto which a contiguous segment from the nucleoplasmic-soluble NEC protein (e.g., VZV Orf27) binds in a hook-like manner (3Marschall M.

The hook-like segment is approximately 30 residues long, is formed by two α-helices, and interacts with high affinity with the groove protein, thus resulting in core NEC assembly (19Walzer S.A. Egerer-Sieber C. Sticht H. Sevvana M. Hohl K. Milbradt J. Muller Y.A. Marschall M. Crystal structure of the human cytomegalovirus pUL50-pUL53 core nuclear egress complex provides insight into a unique assembly scaffold for virus-host protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27452-27458Google Scholar). In all known characterized complexes, this interaction motif accounts for about 80% of the total number of interactions formed between the hook and the groove protein. The hook-into-groove interaction principle of NEC formation appears highly specific for individual herpesviruses. Interestingly, however, an experimental testing of selected examples of NEC protein interactions between herpesviruses in a nonautologous, cross-viral manner, revealed some promiscuity of interaction as observed for NEC protein pairs derived from members of the same subfamily (22Häge S. Sonntag E. Borst E.M. Tannig P. Seyler L. Bauerle T. Bailer S.M. Lee C.P. Muller R. Wangen C. Milbradt J. Marschall M. Patterns of autologous and nonautologous interactions between core nuclear egress complex (NEC) proteins of alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesviruses.Viruses. 2020; 12: 303Google Scholar). Because of the scarcity of currently available structural information, the structural determinants for the subfamily-specific interaction pattern remain currently poorly understood. Here, we report the 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure of the core NEC complex from α-herpesvirus VZV, namely the complex formed between the groove protein Orf24 and the hook protein Orf27. Computational alanine scanning, mutational data, and structural comparisons between VZV and the previously reported α-herpesviral NECs of HSV-1 and PRV revealed a number of shared intermolecular interaction features that clearly differed from those in the β-/γ-herpesviral NECs of HCMV and EBV, respectively. Referring to functional aspects, an analysis by coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) and confocal imaging (CLSM) colocalization showed that VZV Orf24-Orf27 complex formation displays some promiscuity regarding binding to other α-herpesviral NEC protein binding partners, while this is not the case with regard to nonautologous interactions between core NEC proteins belonging to different herpesviral subfamilies. These findings thus confirm initial data reported earlier and explain both the distinct properties and specificity restrictions so far observed by various studies on herpesviral NEC interactions. To complement and evaluate the implications from structural data obtained for β- and γ-herpesviral NECS in previous studies and newly obtained structural insight into the first structure of the α-herpesvirus VZV (see below), we performed a number of infection assays in order to monitor and compare the expression of core NEC proteins and NEC-associated viral kinases in the courses of infection for these three herpesviruses (18Muller Y.A. Häge S. Alkhashrom S. Hollriegl T. Weigert S. Dolles S. Hof K. Walzer S.A. Egerer-Sieber C. Conrad M. Holst S. Losing J. Sonntag E. Sticht H.

Chem. 2015; 290: 27452-27458Google Scholar). To this end, we used α- (VZV), β- (HCMV), and γ-herpesviruses (EBV) that express the GFP (green fluorescent protein) as a reporter for monitoring the courses of an in vitro infection. At this stage, we were able to demonstrate the expression of all core NEC proteins and NEC-associated viral kinases for these three selected herpesviruses, in early to late phases of a multiround viral replication analysis (2–3 days per viral replication cycle). Infected cells were used for collecting consecutive samples at 2, 4, and 6 days postinfection (d p.i.) to analyze viral replication kinetics in a comparative manner. Stocks of VZV (cell-associated virus inoculi) and HCMV (cell-free supernatant virus inoculi) were used for fresh infection of primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), and EBV-positive producer cells (Akata-BX1 carrying EBV-GFP) were induced for the viral lytic cycle by chemical stimulation with TPA. Samples were analyzed by Western blot (Wb) staining procedures using a panel of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies, i.e., those directed to the viral core NEC proteins as well as the respective egress-regulating viral protein kinases (in addition to control proteins of infection such as the GFP reporter and HCMV-/EBV-encoded immediate early proteins IE1p72 or BZLF1, respectively). The NEC proteins and NEC-relevant kinases of all three viruses were expressed with early-late kinetics, mostly starting with detectable signals at 2 days p.i. in dependence on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) or the concentration of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induction (Fig. S1). The detected NEC proteins comprised molecular masses between 30 and 42 kDa (VZV, Orf24 30 kDa, and Orf27 27 to 34 kDa; HCMV, pUL50 42 kDa, and pUL53 38 kDa; EBV, BFRF1 37 to 38 kDa), while the protein kinases ranged from higher molecular-mass sizes between 42 and 100 kDa (the latter showing the bands of three isoforms of HCMV pUL97 70 to 100 kDa, (23Webel R.

Individually purified Orf24 and Orf27 proteins from VZV behave as monomers in solution and readily form a stable heterodimeric complex upon mixing (Fig. 1). This behavior, namely monomeric protomers yielding a heterodimeric core NEC, has already been reported for the α-herpesvirus core NEC formed by the HSV-1 proteins pUL34 (groove protein) and pUL31 (hook protein) (30Bigalke J.M. Heuser T. Nicastro D. Heldwein E.E. Membrane deformation and scission by the HSV-1 nuclear egress complex.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4131Google Scholar). However, in contrast to α-herpesviral pUL31 proteins from HSV-1 and PRV, which cannot be studied in solution in absence of a solubility tag, the pUL31-homologous protein of VZV, i.e., Orf27, behaves differently (16Bigalke J.M. Heldwein E.E. Structural basis of membrane budding by the nuclear egress complex of herpesviruses.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 2921-2936Google Scholar, 20Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Weberruss M. Lorenz M. Cheleski J.

Mettenleiter T.C. et al.Crystal structure of the herpesvirus nuclear egress complex provides insights into inner nuclear membrane remodeling.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2645-2652Google Scholar). Both Orf24 and Orf27 remain soluble after removal of the His- and GST-tag, respectively, and display circular dichroism spectra of well-folded proteins (data not shown). To shed light on possible species-related features as well as subfamily-specific differences in core NEC formation, we purified the individual proteins from VZV, HCMV, and EBV and investigated complex formation using identical experimental setups. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments show that in addition to VZV, the EBV BFRF1-BFLF2 complex formation also originates from the interaction of monomeric proteins. In contrast, the HCMV pUL50-pUL53 heterodimeric complex is formed upon recombination of monomeric pUL50 with homodimeric pUL53 (Figs. 1 and S2) (31Sam M.D. Evans B.T. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Biochemical, biophysical, and mutational analyses of subunit interactions of the human cytomegalovirus nuclear egress complex.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2996-3006Google Scholar). As previously reported for HCMV, only the groove protein pUL50 behaves as a monomer in solution, whereas the hook protein pUL53 is dimeric, at least in vitro with bacterially produced truncated pUL53 (31Sam M.D. Evans B.T. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Biochemical, biophysical, and mutational analyses of subunit interactions of the human cytomegalovirus nuclear egress complex.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2996-3006Google Scholar). Moreover, the hook segment of pUL53 is responsible for pUL53 homodimerization (17Lye M.F. Sharma M. El Omari K. Filman D.J. Schuermann J.P. Hogle J.M. Coen D.M.

Interestingly, however, homodimerization could not be observed under conditions of eukaryotic expression and the use of various interaction studies (32Kicuntod J. Alkhashrom S. Häge S. Diewald B.

To gain insight into the thermodynamic profiles of the interactions of the three prototypical subfamily members, the affinities of the VZV, EBV, and HCMV core NEC protein complexes were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments. In both assay formats, affinities in the midnanomolar range (10–90 nM) were determined for all three interactions, indicating similar stabilities of the complexes. (Table 1 and Figs. 2 and S3). These affinities are slightly higher than those determined for the interaction of peptides covering the hook segments of HCMV pUL53 and EBV BFLF2 only. These hook peptides bound with 120 nM and 117 nM affinity to HCMV pUL50 and EBV BFRF1, respectively (3Marschall M. Häge S. Conrad M. Alkhashrom S. Kicuntod J. Schweininger J. Kriegel M. Losing J.

Open table in a new tab We now also investigated the binding of the VZV Orf27 hook segment to VZV Orf24 (Fig. S4). In case of VZV, the hook peptide binds with an affinity of only 13.7 μM, which represents a 300–1200-fold reduction in affinity when compared with the binding of entire Orf27 to Orf24 (Table 1). This reduction in affinity is considerably larger than in HCMV (6–9-fold) and EBV (up to 4-fold). In all NEC complexes investigated so far, the intermolecular contacts extend beyond the contacts formed by the hook-into-groove interaction since the latter accounts for only about 80 % of all contacts observed in the complexes (see also below) (3Marschall M.

https://openalex.org/W4206613984,"Inhibition of P300 acetyltransferase activity by specific inhibitor C646 has been shown to improve insulin signaling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this improvement remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed P300 levels of obese patients and found that they were significantly increased in liver hepatocytes. In addition, large amounts of P300 appeared in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of P300 acetyltransferase activity by C646 drastically increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor protein substrates (IRS1/2) without affecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor (IRβ) in hepatocytes in the absence of insulin. Since IRS1/2 requires membrane translocation and binding to inositol compounds for normal functions, we also examined the role of acetylation on binding to phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 and found that IRS1/2 acetylation by P300 reduced this binding. In contrast, we show that inhibition of IRS1/2 acetylation by C646 facilitates IRS1/2 membrane translocation. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that C646 activates IRβ's tyrosine kinase activity and directly promotes IRβ interaction with IRS1/2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1/2 and subsequent activation of insulin signaling even in the absence of insulin. In conclusion, these data reveal the unique effects of C646 in activating insulin signaling in patients with obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4226295834,"Tuberculosis is one of the ten leading causes of death and the leading infectious cause worldwide. The disease represents a challenge to health systems around the world. In 2018, it is estimated that 10 million people were affected by tuberculosis, and approximately 1.5 million people died due to the disease worldwide, including 251,000 patients coinfected with HIV. In Brazil, the disease caused 4,490 deaths, with rate of 2.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The objective of this study was to analyze the time behavior, spatial, spatial-temporal distribution, and the effects of social vulnerability on the incidence of TB in Brazil during the period from 2001 to 2017.A spatial-temporal ecological study was conducted, including all new cases of tuberculosis registered in Brazil during the period from 2001 to 2017. The following variables were analyzed: incidence rate of tuberculosis, the Social Vulnerability Index, its subindices, its 16 indicators, and an additional 14 variables available on the Atlas of Social Vulnerability. The statistical treatment of the data consisted of the following three stages: a) time trend analysis with a joinpoint regression model; b) spatial analysis and identification of risk areas based on smoothing of the incidence rate by local empirical Bayesian model, application of global and local Moran statistics, and, finally, spatial-temporal scan statistics; and c) analysis of association between the incidence rate and the indicators of social vulnerability.Brazil reduced the incidence of tuberculosis from 42.8 per 100,000 to 35.2 per 100,000 between 2001 and 2017. Only the state of Minas Gerais showed an increasing trend, whereas nine other states showed a stationary trend. A total of 326 Brazilian municipalities were classified as high priority, and 22 high-risk spatial-temporal clusters were identified. The overall Social Vulnerability Index and the subindices of Human Capital and Income and Work were associated with the incidence of tuberculosis. It was also observed that the incidence rates were greater in municipalities with greater social vulnerability.This study identified clusters with high risk of TB in Brazil. A significant association was observed between the incidence rate of TB and the indices of social vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W4206921954,"Background Stomach pain is an ailment that occurs frequently in the general population. It is not unusual if such stomach issues produce some amount of stress in an individual, but it can be worrying if these pains lead to significant mental health problems. The relationship between some abdominal pain, such as bowel syndrome, and depression or anxiety has been gaining much interest. However, previous studies that have empirically investigated this relationship are scarce. Methods To analyze the impact of having gastrointestinal problems, among other socioeconomic conditions, on the onset of depression and anxiety in the Spanish population, we compare treating gastrointestinal diseases as exogenous in a single-equation probit model with a bivariate probit model in which this variable is treated as endogenous. A likelihood-ratio test of the correlation coefficient of the disturbances suggests that gastrointestinal problems are endogenous. Thus, the approach taken herein allows the direct testing of the hypothesis that having gastrointestinal problems and the onset of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety are jointly determined by certain socioeconomic factors. A cross-sectional analytical study was analyzed using data from a 2017 survey of health indicators and life conditions that was developed by the Statistics Spanish Office. Results The probability of having depression or anxiety increases with age, stress, daily limitations and gastrointestinal disorders. On the other hand, the probability is lower for men, married people and those who engage in exercise several times per week. Our findings estimate that having gastrointestinal problems increases the probability of having depression in 7% and the probability of anxiety in 8.8% of the sample. Conclusions Our empirical results suggest that not considering the endogeneity of gastrointestinal problems could result in an overestimate of the impact of this factor on the development of depression or anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4206932316,"Reason for dysphagia in a significant number of patients remains unclear even after a thorough workup. Each swallow induces esophageal distension followed by contraction of the esophagus, both of which move sequentially along the esophagus. Manometry technique and current system of classifying esophageal motility disorders (Chicago Classification) is based on the analysis of the contraction phase of peristalsis.Whether patients with unexplained dysphagia have abnormalities in the distension phase of esophageal peristalsis is not known.Using Multiple Intraluminal esophageal impedance recordings, which allow determination of the luminal cross-sectional area during peristalsis, we studied patients with nutcracker esophagus (NC), esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO), and functional dysphagia (FD).Distension contraction plots revealed that swallowed bolus travels significantly faster through the esophagus in all patient groups as compared to normals. The luminal cross-sectional area (amplitude of distension), and the area under the curve of distension were significantly smaller in patients with NC, EGJOO, and FD as compared to normals. Bolus traverses the esophagus in the shape of an ""American Football"" in normal subjects. On the other hand, in patients the bolus flow was fragmented. ROC curves revealed that bolus flow abnormalities during peristalsis are a sensitive and specific marker of dysphagia.Our findings reveal abnormality in the distension phase of peristalsis (a narrow lumen esophagus) in patients with dysphagia. We propose that the esophageal contraction forcing the swallowed bolus through a narrow lumen esophagus is the cause of dysphagia sensation in patients with normal contraction phase of peristalsis."

However, many types of RNA differentiation, including messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) remain unreported despite their crucial roles in regulating adipogenesis. Chinese Guizhou Congjiang pigs are raised in the Guizhou province of China for their high-quality meat. Therefore, it is important for breeders to explore the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes from the longissimus dorsi muscle of these pigs. In the present study, a transcriptome analysis of intramuscular preadipocytes from Chinese Guizhou Congjiang pigs, including analyses of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs at days 0 (D0), 4 (D4), and 8 (D8) was performed. A total of 1,538, 639, and 445 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 479, 192, and 126 DE lncRNAs, and 360, 439, and 304 DE circRNAs were detected between D4 and D0, D8 and D0, and D8 and D4, respectively. Functional analyses identified many significantly enriched RNAs related to lipid deposition, cell differentiation, metabolism processes, and obesity-related diseases, biological processes, and pathways. We identified two lncRNAs (TCONS_00012086 and TCONS_00007245) closely related to fat deposition according to their target genes and tissue expression profiles. Subcellular distribution analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that both TCONS_00012086 and TCONS_00007245 are cytoplasmic lncRNAs.

In this study, the responses of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) and one of its major pests, the aphid Sitobion avenae, to different drought regimes were investigated, considering different time points and plant parts. Plants were kept well-watered or subjected to either continuous or pulsed drought. Phloem exudates were collected twice from leaves and once from ears during the growth period and concentrations of amino acids, organic acids and sugars were determined. Population growth and survival of the aphid S. avenae were monitored on these plant parts. Relative concentrations of metabolites in the phloem exudates varied with the time point, the plant part as well as the irrigation regime. Pronounced increases in relative concentrations were found for proline, especially in pulsed drought-stressed plants. Moreover, relative concentrations of sucrose were lower in phloem exudates of ears than in those of leaves. The population growth and survival of aphids were decreased on plants subjected to drought and populations grew twice as large on ears compared to leaves. Our study revealed that changes in irrigation frequency and intensity modulate plant-aphid interactions. These effects may at least partly be mediated by changes in the metabolic composition of the phloem sap."
https://openalex.org/W4206991526,"To explore methodological challenges when using real-world evidence (RWE) to estimate comparative-effectiveness in the context of Health Technology Assessment of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in Scotland.We used linkage data from the Prescribing Information System (PIS), Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR) and mortality records for newly anticoagulated patients to explore methodological challenges in the use of Propensity score (PS) matching, Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and covariate adjustment with PS. Model performance was assessed by standardised difference. Clinical outcomes (stroke and major bleeding) and mortality were compared for all DOACs (including apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) versus warfarin. Patients were followed for 2 years from first oral anticoagulant prescription to first clinical event or death. Censoring was applied for treatment switching or discontinuation.Overall, a good balance of patients' covariates was obtained with every PS model tested. IPW was found to be the best performing method in assessing covariate balance when applied to subgroups with relatively large sample sizes (combined-DOACs versus warfarin). With the IPTW-IPCW approach, the treatment effect tends to be larger, but still in line with the treatment effect estimated using other PS methods. Covariate adjustment with PS in the outcome model performed well when applied to subgroups with smaller sample sizes (dabigatran versus warfarin), as this method does not require further reduction of sample size, and trimming or truncation of extreme weights.The choice of adequate PS methods may vary according to the characteristics of the data. If assumptions of unobserved confounding hold, multiple approaches should be identified and tested. PS based methods can be implemented using routinely collected linked data, thus supporting Health Technology decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4206928578,"Progressive immune deficiency of aging is characterized by severe thymic atrophy, contracted T cell repertoire, and poor immune function. p63 is critical for the proliferative potential of embryonic and adult stem cells, as well as thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Because p63 null mice experience rapid post-natal lethality due to epidermal and limb morphogenesis defects, studies to define a role for p63 expression in TEC biology focused on embryonic thymus development and in vitro experiments. Since post-natal thymic stromal development and function differs from that of the embryo, we assessed the impact of lineage-restricted p63 loss on pre- and post-natal murine TEC function by generating mice with a loss of p63 function targeted to TEC, termed p63TECko mice. In adult p63TECko mice, severe thymic hypoplasia was observed with a lack in a discernable segregation into medullary and cortical compartments and peripheral T cell lymphopenia. This profound thymic defect was seen in both neonatal as well as embryonic p63TECko mice. In addition to TECs, p63 also plays in important role in the development of stratified epithelium of the skin; lack of p63 results in defects in skin epidermal stratification and differentiation. Interestingly, all adult p63TECko mice lacked hair follicles despite having normal p63 expression in the skin. Together our results show a critical role of TEC p63 in thymic development and maintenance and show that p63 expression is critical for hair follicle formation."
https://openalex.org/W4206934382,"This study aimed to assess community perceptions towards invasion of Prosopis juliflora, utilization, and its control options in Afar region, Northern Ethiopia. Using purposive sampling and stratified random methods, 20 members of key informants and 154 households from four sites of Awash Fentale and Amibara Districts were selected. For data analysis, we used Kruskal Wallis non-parametric tests of K independent samples. About 30% of respondents in Amibara and 29% in Awash Fentale reported that Prosopis juliflora was largely introduced into their landscape by livestock. It showed that 29% of the respondents in Awash Fentale and 41% in Amibara responded that Prosopis juliflora largely invaded and affected rangelands. Morevover, about 1% of respondents in Awash Fentale and 14% in Amibara argued that Prosopis juliflora hindered movements of livestock. In addition, 30% of respondents in Amibara and 29% in Awash Fentale believe that Prosopis juliflora was largely dispersed by livestock. It showed that 20% of households in Awash Fentale and 41% in Amibara have the notion that Prosopis juliflora majorly impacted rangelands. Whereas 1.3% of respondents in Awash Fentale and 14% in Amibara argued that Prosopis juliflora have hampered the movement of livestock. Thus, the afromentioned findings are implications for management of rangelands. With regard to the control of Prosopis juliflora invasions, 12% of respondents in Awash Fentale and 33% in Amibara District tried control its expansion by fire. About 10% of respondents in Awash Fentale and 9% in Amibara district managed Prosopis juliflora expansion by its utilization, whereas, in Awash Fentale (11%) and Amibara (8%) households indicated that invasion of Prosopis juliflora could be controlled by mechanical methods. It is advisable to do some managerial work to reverse these impacts as perceived by local communities in the study area to avert the aggressive proliferation of Prosopis juliflora in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4206979029,"Background Both insulin resistance and postprandial glucose spikes are known for their potential to induce vascular endothelial dysfunction in individuals with metabolic syndrome. However, these factors are inextricable, and therefore, their relative contributions to inducing endothelial dysfunction remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of these factors and clarify whether bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), a novel nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activator, protects against glucose spike-induced endothelial dysfunction. Methods We induced glucose spikes twice daily for a duration of 1 week to rats fed a standard/control diet (CD) and Western-type diet (WTD). Endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) was evaluated using isolated thoracic aortas. Gene expression and dihydroethidium (DHE)-fluorescence studies were carried out; the effect of CDDO-Me on aortic endothelial dysfunction in vivo was also evaluated. Results Neither WTD-induced insulin resistance nor pure glucose spikes significantly deteriorated EDR. However, under high-glucose (20 mM) conditions, the EDR of thoracic aortas of WTD-fed rats subjected to glucose spikes was significantly impaired. In this group of rats, we observed significantly enhanced DHE fluorescence as a marker of reactive oxygen species, upregulation of an oxidative stress-related gene (NOX2), and downregulation of an antioxidant gene (SOD2) in the thoracic aortas. As expected, treatment of the thoracic aorta of this group of rats with antioxidant agents significantly improved EDR. We also noted that pretreatment of aortas from the same group with CDDO-Me attenuated endothelial dysfunction, accompanied by a correction of the redox imbalance, as observed in gene expression and DHE fluorescence studies. Conclusions For the first time, we showed that insulin resistance and glucose spikes exert a synergistic effect on aortic endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, our study reveals that CDDO-Me ameliorates endothelial dysfunction caused by glucose spikes in a rat model of metabolic syndrome."

In this study, we aimed to use computed tomography (CT) colonography (CTC) to detect signs of PM earlier in patients in whom PM was suspected but not yet diagnosed. CTC was used to evaluate patients with clinical symptoms or general CT findings that were suspicious but not sufficient to confirm PM. In total, 18 patients with suspected PM were enrolled. Ten patients (55.6%) had PM on CTC. Abnormal colonic deformities were identified at locations other than those of the lesions detected by general CT in seven patients. The sensitivity and specificity of CTC for the detection of PM were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. The median overall survival after CTC was 201 days in the CTC-positive group, which was significantly shorter than that in the CTC-negative group (945 days, p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, a positive CTC finding was the only factor independently associated with survival (p = 0.005). According to our experience with 18 patients, CTC can be an alternative to conventional imaging for early detection of PM. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm and validate these findings.

https://openalex.org/W4207034345,"Graphlet adjacency extends regular node adjacency in a network by considering a pair of nodes being adjacent if they participate in a given graphlet (small, connected, induced subgraph). Graphlet adjacencies captured by different graphlets were shown to contain complementary biological functions and cancer mechanisms. To further investigate the relationships between the topological features of genes participating in molecular networks, as captured by graphlet adjacencies, and their biological functions, we build more descriptive pathway-based approaches.We introduce a new graphlet-based definition of eigencentrality of genes in a pathway, graphlet eigencentrality, to identify pathways and cancer mechanisms described by a given graphlet adjacency. We compute the centrality of genes in a pathway either from the local perspective of the pathway or from the global perspective of the entire network.We show that in molecular networks of human and yeast, different local graphlet adjacencies describe different pathways (i.e., all the genes that are functionally important in a pathway are also considered topologically important by their local graphlet eigencentrality). Pathways described by the same graphlet adjacency are functionally similar, suggesting that each graphlet adjacency captures different pathway topology and function relationships. Additionally, we show that different graphlet eigencentralities describe different cancer driver genes that play central roles in pathways, or in the crosstalk between them (i.e. we can predict cancer driver genes participating in a pathway by their local or global graphlet eigencentrality). This result suggests that by considering different graphlet eigencentralities, we can capture different functional roles of genes in and between pathways."

This study aims to assess the health promoting lifestyle of community residents in China, and explore its association with their health management intention and behaviors during the integrated healthcare system reform.A total of 666 residents were recruited from six county level hospitals and 12 community health centers from July to August 2019 in Zhejiang Province, China. Health promoting lifestyle was measured by the Chinese version Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II scale (HPLP-II).The average total score of HPLP-II among our sample was 130.02±23.19. Among the six domains, interpersonal relationship had the highest average score (2.68±0.50), and physical activity scored the lowest (2.21±0.59). Total score of HPLP-II scale was negatively associated with being male (β = -0.13, p<0.01; Ref: female), positively associated with being students (β = 0.15, p<0.01; Ref: self-employed), and positively associated with a monthly per capita income of more than 8000 RMB (β = 0.15, p<0.01; Ref: less than 3000 RMB). The domain scores of HPLP-II were significantly correlated with residents' health management intention and their behavior on following doctors' advice or not.The health promoting lifestyles of community residents in China are at moderate levels. Improving residents' healthy lifestyle levels might be helpful for changing their health management intentions or behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4206292284,"Arabidopsis LHP1 (LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1), a unique homolog of HP1 in Drosophila, plays important roles in plant development, growth, and architecture. In contrast to specific binding of the HP1 chromodomain to methylated H3K9 histone tails, the chromodomain of LHP1 has been shown to bind to both methylated H3K9 and H3K27 histone tails, and LHP1 carries out its function mainly via its interaction with these two epigenetic marks. However, the molecular mechanism for the recognition of methylated histone H3K9/27 by the LHP1 chromodomain is still unknown. In this study, we characterized the binding ability of LHP1 to histone H3K9 and H3K27 peptides and found that the chromodomain of LHP1 binds to histone H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me2/3 peptides with comparable affinities, although it exhibited no binding or weak binding to unmodified or monomethylated H3K9/K27 peptides. Our crystal structures of the LHP1 chromodomain in peptide-free and peptide-bound forms coupled with mutagenesis studies reveal that the chromodomain of LHP1 bears a slightly different chromodomain architecture and recognizes methylated H3K9 and H3K27 peptides via a hydrophobic clasp, similar to the chromodomains of human Polycomb proteins, which could not be explained only based on primary structure analysis. Our binding and structural studies of the LHP1 chromodomain illuminate a conserved ligand interaction mode between chromodomains of both animals and plants, and shed light on further functional study of the LHP1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W4206910476,"Many membrane proteins function as dimers or larger oligomers, including transporters, channels, certain signaling receptors, and adhesion molecules. In some cases, the interactions between individual proteins may be weak and/or dependent on specific lipids, such that detergent solubilization used for biochemical and structural studies disrupts functional oligomerization. Solubilized membrane protein oligomers can be captured in lipid nanodiscs, but this is an inefficient process that can produce stoichiometrically and topologically heterogeneous preparations. Here, we describe a technique to obtain purified homogeneous membrane protein dimers in nanodiscs using a split GFP (sGFP) tether. Complementary sGFP tags associate to tether the coexpressed dimers and control both stoichiometry and orientation within the nanodiscs, as assessed by quantitative Western blotting and negative-stain EM. The sGFP tether confers several advantages over other methods: it is highly stable in solution and in SDS-PAGE, which facilitates screening of dimer expression and purification by fluorescence, and also provides a dimer-specific purification handle for use with GFP nanobody-conjugated resin. We used this method to purify a Frizzled-4 homodimer and a Frizzled-4/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 heterodimer in nanodiscs. These examples demonstrate the utility and flexibility of this method, which enables subsequent mechanistic molecular and structural studies of membrane protein pairs."
https://openalex.org/W4206997387,"Background The large amount of glucose in the dialysate used in peritoneal dialysis (PD) likely affects the glycemic control. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between HbA1c variability, as a measure of long-term glycemic variability, and the risk of all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with PD. Methods 325 patients with diabetes and ESRD were followed (2008–2018) in the Swedish Renal Registry. Patients were separated in seven groups according to level of HbA1c variability. The group with the lowest variability was denoted the reference. The ratio of the standard deviation (SD) to the mean of HbA1c, HbA1c (SD)/HbA1c (mean), i.e. the coefficient of variation (CV), was defined as HbA1c variability. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were examined using Cox regression analyses. Results During follow-up, 170 (52%) deaths occurred. The highest mortality was among patients with the second highest HbA1c variability, CV≥2.83 [n = 44 of which 68% patients died]. In the multivariate analyses where lowest HbA1c variability (CV≤0.51) was used as the reference group, HbA1c CV 2.83–4.60 (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.78–5.55; p&lt;0.001) and CV&gt; 4.6 (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.21–5.11; p = 0.014) were associated with increased risk of death. Conclusion The high risk of all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and PD increased significantly with elevated HbA1c variability, as measure of long-term glycemic control. This indicates that stable glycemia is associated with an improvement of survival; whereas more severe glycemic fluctuations, possibly caused by radical changes in dialysis regimes or peritonitis, are associated with a higher risk of mortality in diabetic patients with PD."

The results indicated reductions of up to 30% in the mean climatological streamflow patterns; and reductions in rainfall amounts of 22.9%, 13.3% and 12.4% at latitudes 9°, 12°and 13°South, respectively. Decreasing trends were found in simulations of hydropower generation under the influence of different climate variables. Thus, the hydroelectric system operates in contingency, due to the growing energy load demand resulting in more energy imports in Northeast Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W4207034671,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors with high mortality worldwide. Spermatogenesis-associated serine-rich 2 (SPATS2) could be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, the regulatory mechanism of SPATS2 in HCC requires further elucidation. Therefore, the study's objective was to investigate this process in HCC. In this study, we found that SPATS2 is significantly upregulated in HepG2 cells to promote cell growth and migration. SPATS2 is the target transcript of lncRNA SNHG5. SPATS2 positively affects the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells caused by the higher expression of SNHG5. Mechanistically, we identified that the elevated of SPATS2 was attributed to SNHG5 related hypomethylation of SPATS2. SNHG5 reduced the expression of DNMT3a to suppress the methylation level of SPATS2. Taken together, our results uncover a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of lncRNA SNHG5-DNMT3a axis-related SPATS2 expression underlying HCC progression. This may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC."

This is especially relevant if there are important gaps among these locations in terms of significant factors such as job opportunities, quality of health service, among others. This research presents a methodology to perform a recommended geographic redistribution of immigrants to improve their chances of socio-economic integration. The proposed methodology adapts a data-driven algorithm developed by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University to allocate immigrants based on a socio-economic integration outcome across available locations. We extend their approach to study the immigration process between two developing countries. Specifically, we focus on the case of the arrival of immigrants from Venezuela to Colombia. We consider the absorptive capacity of locations in Colombia and include the health and education needs of immigrants in our analysis. From the application in the Venezuelan-Colombian context, we find that the proposed redistribution increases the probability that immigrants access formal employment by more than 50%. Furthermore, we identify variables associated with immigrants’ formal employment and discuss specific strategies to improve the probability of success of vulnerable immigrants."

The USA were the most represented and produced more champions than any other nation, followed by the UK, Ukraine and Russia. Denmark (100%), Ukraine (85.4%) and the UK (67.3%) produced the greatest ‘success rates’ in World Heavyweight Championship contests. Where possible, comparisons between bout winners and losers were also made. Winners were significantly taller ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.35) and had a greater reach ( p = 0.003, d = 0.23) when compared to losers. Championship bouts were settled by the following methods: a form of knockout (101), points decision (57), retirement (14), draw (3), disqualification (3), technical decision (1), whilst 3 no contests were omitted from the analysis. Total punches thrown and landed, and jabs and power punches thrown and landed were consistently significantly greater ( p &lt; 0.005, d = 0.27–0.73) in winners, compared to losers. Winners were more accurate compared to their losing counterparts by ~ 8 percentage points. The data presented in the present study clearly show some anthropometric advantages of championship bout winners, compared to their unsuccessful counterparts, and that winners are more active and accurate when compared to losers. The punch output data, albeit very basic, may be useful in informing tactical strategy and preparation of heavyweight prospects. Likewise, the data in the present study may be an interesting resource for professional boxing enthusiasts. Future research should seek to replicate the analysis in the present study across other weight divisions to explore any potential differences between weight classes. Additionally, extending the analysis to female boxing may provide interesting comparisons."

Japanese patients reported better HRQoL outcomes on the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) emotional well-being domain, a 6-question subset of the PDQ-39 which is considered to reflect the emotional aspects of the disease-specific HRQoL, when treated with rasagiline, than placebo, in both a monotherapy clinical trial (NCT02337725) and an adjunctive therapy clinical trial in patients with wearing-off phenomena (NCT02337738). Objective To investigate how rasagiline exerts its effect on the PDQ-39 emotional well-being domain in Japanese patients with Parkinson’s disease. Methods A path analysis was performed to assess the direct treatment effects of rasagiline on the PDQ-39 emotional well-being domain and the effects mediated indirectly through the influence on items related to motor symptoms by a post-hoc analysis of two clinical trials in Japan. Results In the monotherapy trial, the PDQ-39 emotional well-being domain was mainly affected indirectly through items related to motor symptoms (80.7%) composed of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II (67.2%) and Part III (13.5%). In the adjunctive therapy trial, the PDQ-39 emotional well-being domain was also mainly influenced indirectly through effects on items related to motor symptoms (1 mg/day: 54.7%, 0.5 mg/day: 57.6%) composed of MDS-UPDRS Part II (1 mg/day: 35.6%, 0.5 mg/day: 40.9%), Part III (1 mg/day: 8.0%, 0.5 mg/day: 8.3%) and mean daily OFF-time (1 mg/day: 11.1%, 0.5 mg/day: 8.4%).

While sports have provided an appropriate platform for studying this phenomenon, the majority of existing literature examines scenarios in a vacuum with results that might or might not be applicable in the wild . In this study, we build on the existing literature and develop an appropriate framework to quantify the extent to which success can come in streaks—beyond the stroke of chance—in a natural environment. Considering in-game basketball game situations, our analysis provides statistical evidence that individual players do indeed exhibit the hot hand in varying degrees, that is, individual players can consistently get in a streak of successful shots beyond random chance. However, as a whole, the average player exhibits shooting regression, that is, after consecutive makes he tends to perform below expectations. Even though our results are based on a sports setting, we believe that our study provides a path towards thinking of the hot hand beyond a laboratory-like, controlled environment. This is crucial if we want to use similar results to enhance our decision making and better understand short and long term outcomes of repeated decisions."

This promotes the acquisition, spread and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms and pneumococcal disease are one of the most frequent infections among Hajj pilgrims. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing the PPV23 to Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. A decision tree framework with a 1-year cycle length was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a PPV23 vaccination program with no vaccination. The cost information was retrieved from the Lembaga Tabung Haji Malaysia (LTH) database. Vaccine effectiveness was based on the locally published data and the disease incidence specifically related to Streptococcus pneumoniae was based on a literature search. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the provider: Ministry of Health and LTH Malaysia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), cases averted, and net cost savings were estimated. Findings from this study showed that PPV23 vaccination for Malaysian Hajj pilgrims was cost-effective. The PPV23 vaccination programme has an ICER of MYR -449.3 (US$-110.95) per case averted. Based on the national threshold value of US$6,200-US$8,900 per capita, the base-case result shows that introduction of the PPV23 vaccine for Malaysian Hajj pilgrims is very cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis revealed parameters related to annual incidence and hospitalised cost of septicemia and disease without vaccination as the key drivers of the model outputs. Compared with no vaccination, the inclusion of PPV23 vaccination for Malaysian Hajj pilgrims was projected to result in a net cost saving of MYR59.6 million and 109,996 cases averted over 5 years period. The PPV23 vaccination program could substantially offer additional benefits in reducing the pneumococcal disease burden and healthcare cost. This could be of help for policymakers to consider the implementation of PPV23 vaccination for Malaysian performing hajj."
https://openalex.org/W4206917663,"Purpose The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage remains the standard staging system for the assessment of endometrial cancer (EC) prognosis. Thus, we aim to identify the significant genes or biomarkers associated with the stage of endometrial cancer, which may also help reveal the mechanism of EC progression and assess the prognosis of patients with EC. Materials and methods We compared the mRNA expression levels of EC patients with stages I and II as well as stages III and IV in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of EC patients at different stages were selected by volcano plot and Venn analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathways were applied to analyze the identified genes. Protein protein interaction (PPI) network was employed to identify the correlation. The survival analyses based on TCGA database were conducted for further screening. The Human Protein Atlas, quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to confirm the differences in expression of DEGs in endometrial cancer samples at different FIGO stages. Results CKMT1A was identified as a candidate gene. Through survival analyses, we found that CKMT1A may be a poor prognostic factor in the overall survival of endometrial cancer patients. GO and Pathways revealed that CKMT1A is closely associated with the metabolic process. More importantly, Human Protein Atlas and quantitative PCR confirmed the differences in expression of CKMT1A in endometrial cancer samples at different FIGO stages. Conclusion In summary, this study shows that CKMT1A is a newly identified essential tumor progression regulator of endometrial cancer, which may give rise to novel therapeutic strategies in the management of endometrial cancer patients to prolong its prognosis and prevent tumor progression."

Levels of adoption of ILVs have been documented in the literature, but little is known about their impacts. Applying an instrumental variables regression to data collected from a sample of 1,694 lentil plots and DNA fingerprinting for varietal identification, this study provides estimates of the plot-level impacts of adoption of ILVs in Bangladesh. Model results show that adoption of ILVs is associated with 14.3% (181.14 kg/ha) higher yields and 17.23% (US$169.44/ha) higher gross margins. Since 45% of lentil area is under ILVs, they generated over 8.77 tones (6%) more supply of lentils from domestic sources, saving the country US$8.22 million in imports in 2015 alone. By investing in the generation and scaling of ILVs, Bangladesh and other South Asian countries with similar agro-ecologies can increase production and decrease dependency on lentil imports."

The system showed great potential for complementing established mechanical characterization methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), parallel plate compression (PPC), and nanoindentation, while significantly reducing the volume of valuable hydrogels used for testing. We achieved a volume reduction of ~0.22 μl/sample using the μTweezers vs. ~157 μl/sample using the PPC, while targeting high-throughput measurement of widely adopted micro-mesoscale (a few hundred μm-1500 μm) 3D cell cultures. The μTweezers applied and measured nano-millinewton forces through cantilever' deflection with high linearity and tunability for different applications; the assembly is compatible with typical inverted optical microscopes and fit on standard tissue culture Petri dishes, allowing mechanical compression characterization of arrayed 3D hydrogel-based organoids in a high throughput manner. The average achievable output per group was 40 tests per hour, where 20 organoids and 20 reference images in one 35 mm petri dish were tested, illustrating efficient productivity to match the increasing demand on 3D organoids' applications. The changes in stiffness of collagen I hydrogel organoids in four conditions were measured, with ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) or without (control). The Young's modulus of the control group (Control-day 0, E = 407± 146, n = 4) measured by PPC was used as a reference modulus, where the relative elastic compressive modulus of the other groups based on the stiffness measurements was also calculated (control-day 0, E = 407 Pa), (SKOV3-day 0, E = 318 Pa), (control-day 5, E = 528 Pa), and (SKOV3-day 5, E = 376 Pa). The SKOV3-embedded hydrogel-based organoids had more shrinkage and lowered moduli on day 0 and day 5 than controls, consistently, while SKOV3 embedded organoids increased in stiffness in a similar trend to the collagen I control from day 0 to day 5. The proposed method can contribute to the biomedical, biochemical, and regenerative engineering fields, where bulk mechanical characterization is of interest. The μTweezers will also provide attractive design and application concepts to soft membrane-micro 3D robotics, sensors, and actuators."

The pooled prevalence and odds ratio of the associated risk factors or determinants with their 95% confidence interval will be computed using STATA version 16 software. The existence of heterogeneity among studies will be assessed by computing p-values of Higgins's I2 test statistics and Cochran's Q-statistics based on chi-square with a 5% level of significance among reported prevalence. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be conducted based on study quality to investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed through visual examination of funnel plots and objectively by Egger's regression test. This review protocol has been registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021286814).By collecting and summarizing information on adolescent undernutrition can be a step towards a better understanding of the prevalence of nutritional status of Indian adolescents and how the associated factors influence the prevalence of undernutrition. This review will provide directions for further research and healthcare practitioners. This summarized finding at the national level will provide impetus to build nutritional strategies and proper healthcare services to fight against undernutrition among the most ignored population."
https://openalex.org/W4206993061,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling is critical for the survival of B-cell lymphomas and is a therapeutic target of drugs such as Ibrutinib. However, the role of T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling in the survival of T/Natural Killer (NK) lymphomas is not clear. ZAP-70 (zeta associated protein-70) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase with a critical role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling. It has also been shown to play a role in normal NK cell signalling and activation. High ZAP-70 expression has been detected by immunohistochemistry in peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and NK cell lymphomas (NKTCL). We therefore, studied the role of TCR pathways in mediating the proliferation and survival of these malignancies through ZAP-70 signalling. ZAP-70 protein was highly expressed in T cell lymphoma cell lines (JURKAT and KARPAS-299) and NKTCL cell lines (KHYG-1, HANK-1, NK-YS, SNK-1 and SNK-6), but not in multiple B-cell lymphoma cell lines. siRNA depletion of ZAP-70 suppressed the phosphorylation of ZAP-70 substrates, SLP76, LAT and p38MAPK, but did not affect cell viability or induce apoptosis in these cell lines. Similarly, while stable overexpression of ZAP-70 mediates increased phosphorylation of target substrates in the TCR pathway, it does not promote increased survival or growth of NKTCL cell lines. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor Gefitinib, which has off-target activity against ZAP-70, also did not show any differential cell kill between ZAP-70 overexpressing (OE) or knockdown (KD) cell lines. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing highlighted that there was very minimal differential gene expression in three different T/NK cell lines induced by ZAP-70 KD. Importantly, ZAP-70 KD did not significantly enrich for any downstream TCR related genes and pathways. Altogether, this suggests that high expression and constitutive signalling of ZAP-70 in T/NK lymphoma is not critical for cell survival or downstream TCR-mediated signalling and gene expression. ZAP-70 therefore may not be a suitable therapeutic target in T/NK cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4206998536,"Cervical cancer (CC) promotion and prevention (P&P) programmes' challenge lies in guaranteeing that follow-up strategies have a real impact on reducing CC-related mortality rates. CC P&P programme compliance and coverage rates are relevant indicators for evaluating their success and good performance; however, such indicators' frequency rates are considerably lower among women living in rural and border areas. This study was aimed at identifying factors associated with CC screening programme attendance for women living in Colombia's Amazon region.This study (qualitative and quantitative phases) was carried out between September 2015 and November 2016; women residing in the border towns of Leticia and Puerto Nariño participated in it. The first phase (qualitative) involved interviews and focus group discussions; this led to establishing factors related to CC P&P programme attendance which were used in the quantitative phase for designing a survey for determining the strength of association in a logistic regression model. The terms attendance and compliance were considered to apply to women who had followed the 1-1-3 scheme throughout their lives, i.e. a cytology examination every 3 years after receiving two consecutive negative annual cytology results.Inclusion criteria were met by 309 women (≥18-year-olds having an active sexual life, having resided in the target community for at least one year); 15.2% had suitable P&P programme follow-up. Screening programme attendance was positively associated with first intercourse after becoming 20 years-old (aOR: 3.87; 1.03-9.50 95%CI; p = 0.045), frequent contraceptive use (aOR: 3.11; 1.16-8.33 95%CI; p = 0.023), awareness of the age to participate in P&P programmes (aOR: 2.69; 1.08-6.68 95%CI; p = 0.032), awareness of cytology's usefulness in identifying cervical abnormalities (aOR: 2.43; 1.02-5.77 95%CI; p = 0.043) and considering cytology important (aOR: 2.64; 1.12-6.19 95%CI; p = 0.025). Women living in rural areas had a lower probability (aOR 0.43: 0.24-0.79 95%CI; p = 0.006) of adhering to CC P&P programmes.This study's findings suggested the need for including novel strategies in screening programmes which will promote CC P&P activities going beyond hospital outpatient attendance to reach the most remote or widely scattered communities, having the same guarantees regarding access, opportunity and quality. Including education-related activities and stimulating the population's awareness regarding knowledge about CC prevention could be one of the main tools for furthering the impact of attendance at and compliance with P&P programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4207033283,"Objective Sex disparity is a major societal issue. The aim of this paper was to describe changes in the representation of women among speakers of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) annual meeting over 10 years, between 2009 and 2019 and to compare them to changes in the proportion of women among American psychiatrists. Methods Data were collected from the programs of the APA annual meetings of 2009 and 2019, and from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed. Results There were 1,138 distinct speakers at the 2009 conference and 1,784 at the 2019 conference. The number of distinct female speakers increased from 413 (36.3%) to 813 (45.6%). The proportion of female speakers at the meetings was almost equivalent to the proportion of women in the American psychiatrists’ workforce. The number of female chairs increased from 158 (39.6%) to 322 (46.4%). There were 38 female speakers in child and adolescent psychiatry in 2009 (51.4% of 74 speakers) and 74 in 2019 (51.0% of 155 speakers). Conclusions The representation of women at the APA annual meetings increased between 2009 and 2019. At the same time, the growth in the percentage of women in the American psychiatrists’ workforce was slower. The APA appears to promote female representation during its annual meetings."
https://openalex.org/W4207052881,"Patients with inflammatory arthritis die prematurely of cardiovascular disease. Inflammation activates platelets. Since treatment of inflammatory arthritis is associated with reduced mortality, and decreased platelet reactivity reduces cardiovascular events, we hypothesised that platelet reactivity as measured by dynamic platelet function (DPF) would be increased in patients with inflammatory arthritis and that reactivity could be reduced with therapeutic intervention.To characterise platelet function using a validated physiological assay in patients with inflammatory arthritis before and after disease improvement.22 patients were recruited and treated as per local protocol. DPF was measured at baseline and after clinical improvement. Video microscopy was utilised to measure dynamic platelet behaviour in microliters of blood perfused over von Willebrand factor (VWF) at arterial shear rates (1500 s-1). Motion-analysis software measured the number of platelets interacting with VWF, translocating across VWF, the speed and distance platelets travelled across VWF, and stably adhering to the surface. Platelet parameters at baseline and following improvement were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired student t-test. Changes in platelet function were correlated to inflammatory disease markers by Pearson Correlation.18 patients completed the study. Platelet adhesion decreased and platelet motion increased following treatment. Tender joint count correlated with platelet adhesion (Pearson r = 0.616, p≤0.01) while CRP correlated with velocity of platelet movement (Pearson r = 0.563, p≤0.01).Improvement in clinical markers of inflammation is associated with a corresponding change in platelet function. Given the association between reduced mortality and decreased platelet reactivity our results suggest that an appropriate assay of platelet function could guide future therapy of patients with inflammatory arthritis."
