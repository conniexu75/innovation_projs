https://openalex.org/W3029661147,"Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3030942202,"Profiling tumor bacteria Bacteria are well-known residents in human tumors, but whether their presence is advantageous to the tumors or to the bacteria themselves has been unclear. As an initial step toward addressing this question, Nejman et al. produced an exhaustive catalog of the bacteria present in more than 1500 human tumors representing seven different tumor types (see the Perspective by Atreya and Turnbaugh). They found that the bacteria within tumors were localized within both cancer cells and immune cells and that the bacterial composition varied according to tumor type. Certain biologically plausible associations were identified. For example, breast cancer subtypes characterized by increased oxidative stress were enriched in bacteria that produce mycothiol, which can detoxify reactive oxygen species.

https://openalex.org/W3031912651,"Synucleinopathies, which include multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are human neurodegenerative diseases1. Existing treatments are at best symptomatic. These diseases are characterized by the presence of, and believed to be caused by the formation of, filamentous inclusions of α-synuclein in brain cells2,3. However, the structures of α-synuclein filaments from the human brain are unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that α-synuclein inclusions from the brains of individuals with MSA are made of two types of filament, each of which consists of two different protofilaments. In each type of filament, non-proteinaceous molecules are present at the interface of the two protofilaments. Using two-dimensional class averaging, we show that α-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with MSA differ from those of individuals with DLB, which suggests that distinct conformers or strains characterize specific synucleinopathies. As is the case with tau assemblies4-9, the structures of α-synuclein filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA differ from those formed in vitro using recombinant proteins, which has implications for understanding the mechanisms of aggregate propagation and neurodegeneration in the human brain. These findings have diagnostic and potential therapeutic relevance, especially because of the unmet clinical need to be able to image filamentous α-synuclein inclusions in the human brain."

https://openalex.org/W3029756541,"Fully synthetic whole proteins in reach Solid-phase peptide synthesis of homogeneous peptides longer than about 50 amino acids has been a long-standing challenge because of inefficient coupling and side reactions. Hartrampf et al. used an automated chemistry platform to optimize fast-flow peptide synthesis and were able to produce fully synthetic single-domain proteins (see the Perspective by Proulx). The targets included proinsulin and enzymes such as barnase and a version of HIV-1 protease containing multiple noncanonical amino acids. Refolded peptides were nearly indistinguishable from recombinant proteins, and the synthesized enzymes had activity close to that of their ribosomally synthesized counterparts. This method will enable fast, on-demand synthesis of small proteins with a vastly expanded pool of precursor amino acids. Science , this issue p. 980 ; see also p. 941"
https://openalex.org/W3031256816,"Remarkable progress in molecular analyses has improved our understanding of the evolution of cancer cells toward immune escape1–5. However, the spatial configurations of immune and stromal cells, which may shed light on the evolution of immune escape across tumor geographical locations, remain unaddressed. We integrated multiregion exome and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data with spatial histology mapped by deep learning in 100 patients with non-small cell lung cancer from the TRACERx cohort6. Cancer subclones derived from immune cold regions were more closely related in mutation space, diversifying more recently than subclones from immune hot regions. In TRACERx and in an independent multisample cohort of 970 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, tumors with more than one immune cold region had a higher risk of relapse, independently of tumor size, stage and number of samples per patient. In lung adenocarcinoma, but not lung squamous cell carcinoma, geometrical irregularity and complexity of the cancer–stromal cell interface significantly increased in tumor regions without disruption of antigen presentation. Decreased lymphocyte accumulation in adjacent stroma was observed in tumors with low clonal neoantigen burden. Collectively, immune geospatial variability elucidates tumor ecological constraints that may shape the emergence of immune-evading subclones and aggressive clinical phenotypes. Multiregion spatial histology, exome and transcriptome data from patients with non-small cell lung cancer suggest that cancer subclones from immune cold regions diversify later than subclones from immune hot regions"
https://openalex.org/W3030508707,"Zeolites that prefer alkynes Alkenes such as ethylene and propene must be separated from alkynes before they can be converted in polymers. Drawbacks in current methods, such as hydrogenation of alkynes producing unwanted alkanes, has spurred interest in sorption separation methods. Zeolites have generally been inefficient, given the similar sizes and volatilities of the molecules. Chai et al. incorporated atomically dispersed divalent transition metal cations into faujasite zeolite and found that the nickel-containing analog efficiently removed alkynes from olefins through chemoselective binding at open nickel(II) sites. At ambient conditions in the presence of water and carbon dioxide, the zeolites retained separation selectivities of 100 and 92, respectively, for acetylene over ethylene and propyne over propylene for 10 adsorption-desorption cycles.

https://openalex.org/W3031073114,"The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the 'proportion expressed across transcripts', which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies."

Achieving direct communication between such cells and electronic devices would allow precise control of therapies. Krawczyk et al. describe a bioelectronic interface that uses wireless-powered electrical stimulation of cells to promote the release of insulin (see the Perspective by Brier and Dordick). The authors engineered human β cells to respond to membrane depolarization by rapidly releasing insulin from intracellular storage vesicles. A bioelectronic device that incorporates the cells can be wirelessly triggered by an external field generator.

Here, we report three immunotherapeutic modalities based on a human anti-CD133 antibody fragment that targets a unique epitope present in glycosylated and non-glycosylated CD133 and studied their effects on targeting CD133+ cells in patient-derived models of GBM. We generated an immunoglobulin G (IgG) (RW03-IgG), a dual-antigen T cell engager (DATE), and a CD133-specific chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T): CART133. All three showed activity against patient-derived CD133+ GBM cells, and CART133 cells demonstrated superior efficacy in patient-derived GBM xenograft models without causing adverse effects on normal CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells in humanized CD34+ mice. Thus, CART133 cells may be a therapeutically tractable strategy to target CD133+ CSCs in human GBM or other treatment-resistant primary cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3029979731,"The cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio is fundamental to biochemistry, but the extent to which it reflects versus drives metabolic physiology in vivo is poorly understood. Here we report the in vivo application of Lactobacillus brevis (Lb)NOX1, a bacterial water-forming NADH oxidase, to assess the metabolic consequences of directly lowering the hepatic cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio in mice. By combining this genetic tool with metabolomics, we identify circulating α-hydroxybutyrate levels as a robust marker of an elevated hepatic cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, also known as reductive stress. In humans, elevations in circulating α-hydroxybutyrate levels have previously been associated with impaired glucose tolerance2, insulin resistance3 and mitochondrial disease4, and are associated with a common genetic variant in GCKR5, which has previously been associated with many seemingly disparate metabolic traits. Using LbNOX, we demonstrate that NADH reductive stress mediates the effects of GCKR variation on many metabolic traits, including circulating triglyceride levels, glucose tolerance and FGF21 levels. Our work identifies an elevated hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio as a latent metabolic parameter that is shaped by human genetic variation and contributes causally to key metabolic traits and diseases. Moreover, it underscores the utility of genetic tools such as LbNOX to empower studies of 'causal metabolism'."

Molecular chaperones are known to maintain protein homeostasis. Here, we show that an ATP-dependent human chaperone system disassembles Tau fibrils in vitro. We found that this function is mediated by the core chaperone HSC70, assisted by specific cochaperones, in particular class B J-domain proteins and a heat shock protein 110 (Hsp110)-type nucleotide exchange factor (NEF). The Hsp70 disaggregation machinery processed recombinant fibrils assembled from all six Tau isoforms as well as Sarkosyl-resistant Tau aggregates extracted from cell cultures and human AD brain tissues, demonstrating the ability of the Hsp70 machinery to recognize a broad range of Tau aggregates. However, the chaperone activity released monomeric and small oligomeric Tau species, which induced the aggregation of self-propagating Tau conformers in a Tau cell culture model. We conclude that the activity of the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery is a double-edged sword, as it eliminates Tau amyloids at the cost of generating new seeds.

Amyloid deposits are characteristic of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Typically, symptoms surface only at advanced age, indicating that a buffering system exists that prevents disease onset and amyloid formation earlier in life (1Labbadia J. Morimoto R.I. The biology of proteostasis in aging and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84 (25784053): 435-46410.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-033955Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Disease-associated proteins aggregate into amyloid fibrils characterized by their highly ordered β-sheet structure (2Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, amyloid formation, and human disease: a summary of progress over the last decade.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 (28498720): 27-6810.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The monomeric form of these proteins populates conformations susceptible to aggregation, leading to the formation of a variety of assemblies of various molecular weights. Some have seeding propensities that trigger further aggregation into fibrils by templated incorporation of the monomeric form of the constituting protein in a conformation that is compatible with the fibril ends. This templated propagation of the amyloid structure is thought to be the basis for the prion-like spreading of pathological inclusions and toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases (3Brundin P. Melki R. Kopito R. Prion-like transmission of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20308987): 301-30710.1038/nrm2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is implicated in ∼20 different diseases, termed tauopathies, with AD being the most common form of dementia (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Tau pathology and neurodegeneration.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12 (23684085): 609-62210.1016/S1474-4422(13)70090-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Thus, Tau is the most frequently aggregating protein in human neurodegenerative diseases. Under physiological conditions, Tau is highly soluble and expressed as six alternatively spliced isoforms (5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Multiple isoforms of human microtubule-associated protein tau: sequences and localization in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer’s disease.Neuron. 1989; 3 (2484340): 519-52610.1016/0896-6273(89)90210-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar).

Detached Tau then forms aggregates in the cytoplasm that eventually evolve into fibrillar inclusions in affected neurons or glial cells (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M.

Our work and other studies demonstrated that Hsp70 disaggregation activity strongly relies on a coordinated action of an Hsp70 core chaperone with specific cochaperones (13Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol.

As the effects of chaperones and cochaperones on Tau amyloid fibrils were usually examined individually and not in combination, only the prevention of aggregation and a slight shift of the amyloid equilibrium toward the soluble fraction because of their binding to intermediates was observed but no specific disaggregation activity of preformed Tau fibrils. Furthermore, a tightly timed on-off switching of chaperone and substrate expression would be necessary to distinguish between the prevention of aggregation and disaggregation activity by chaperones in in vivo models, which is usually not done. J-domain proteins deliver clients to Hsp70 by preselecting them and activating their ATP hydrolysis-dependent binding into the substrate binding pocket of Hsp70, thereby determining substrate specificity of the machinery. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) regulate the lifetime of the Hsp70-substrate complexes, which determines substrate fate, such as refolding, transfer to other chaperone systems, or handover to the degradation machinery (20Bracher A. Verghese J. The nucleotide exchange factors of Hsp70 molecular chaperones.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2015; 2: 1010.3389/fmolb.2015.00010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To date, the correct composition of chaperones and cochaperone combinations that efficiently dissolves Tau fibrils is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the human Hsp70 disaggregation machinery, referred to here as Hsp70 disaggregase, can disassemble amyloid Tau fibrils in vitro. The Hsp70 disaggregase is an ATP-dependent chaperone system that is comprised of the constitutively expressed Hsp70 family member HSPA8 (HSC70), the J-domain proteins DNAJB1 or DNAJB4, and HSPA4 (APG2), an Hsp110-type NEF. Recombinant fibrils of all six Tau isoforms, as well as Sarkosyl-resistant Tau aggregates extracted from a cell culture model or AD brain tissue, could be processed by this chaperone system, demonstrating that this chaperone machinery can disintegrate disease-relevant amyloids. We further show that class B J-domain proteins are essential for this activity and that there is partial redundancy within this class of chaperones, whereas class A J-domain proteins were not able to support Hsp70 disaggregase function. The disaggregation reaction produced monomeric Tau as well as small oligomers. Importantly, Tau species liberated by the disaggregation reaction were seeding competent and induced the formation of Tau foci in a biosensor cell line for Tau aggregation, which were stably inherited over multiple cell passages. This study shows that Hsp70 disaggregase activity can be extended to the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases involving Tau. Although almost completely depolymerized to monomers, the fraction of Tau that was released from amyloid fibrils by chaperone action was still seeding competent. As the generation of seeding-competent species might boost the prion-like propagation of amyloid Tau aggregates, it needs to be examined whether chaperone-mediated Tau disaggregation may exacerbate the associated neurotoxicity in vivo. We have previously shown that the human Hsp70 disaggregase comprised of HSC70, DNAJB1, and HSPA4 can disassemble α-synuclein fibrils in vitro (21Gao X. Carroni M. Nussbaum-Krammer C. Mogk A.

To investigate whether Tau fibrils can be disassembled by this chaperone system, we performed in vitro disaggregation assays (21Gao X. Carroni M. Nussbaum-Krammer C. Mogk A. Nillegoda N.B.

Recombinant 1N3R Tau, harboring one N-terminal insertion and three microtubule binding repeats (Fig. S1), was assembled into fibrils, and fibril formation was verified by negative-stain transmission EM (TEM) (Fig. 1B). Tau fibrils were treated with the human Hsp70 disaggregation machinery (HSC70, DNAJB1, HSPA4) and subsequently centrifuged to separate larger fibrils from liberated smaller oligomers and monomers. The amount of Tau in supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). In the presence of the three chaperones and ATP, more than 40% of 1N3R Tau was detected in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1C and D). In contrast, in the absence of ATP, the chaperone mix did not confer any significant disaggregation activity (Fig. 1C and D). The three components of the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery were also added individually and in all possible combinations to test their respective contribution to fibril disassembly (Fig. 1E and F). Treatment with single or pairwise combinations of chaperones did not promote a shift of Tau to the supernatant fraction, except HSC70 together with DNAJB1, which resulted in relocation of ∼28% of Tau to the supernatant (Fig. 1E and F). However, the combination of all three chaperones was required for the most efficient disaggregation reaction leading to ∼43% disassembly (Fig. 1E and F), indicating a critical role of the Hsp110-type NEF in Tau fibril disaggregation. In conclusion, the human HSC70/DNAJB1/HSPA4 disaggregation machinery efficiently disassembles a significant fraction of Tau fibrils in vitro. Human Tau has six different isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing (5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Multiple isoforms of human microtubule-associated protein tau: sequences and localization in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer’s disease.Neuron. 1989; 3 (2484340): 519-52610.1016/0896-6273(89)90210-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Whereas all isoforms were found in aggregates isolated from AD patients' brains, there are also isoform-specific tauopathies where amyloid deposits consist exclusively of either 3R or 4R Tau isoforms (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Tau pathology and neurodegeneration.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12 (23684085): 609-62210.1016/S1474-4422(13)70090-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). For example, Tau filaments in Pick's disease contain only 3R Tau, whereas progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by fibrils made entirely of 4R isoforms. To test whether all six isoforms are substrates for the disaggregation machinery, recombinant fibrils of the other five Tau isoforms (0N3R, 2N3R, 0N4R, 1N4R, and 2N4R) (Fig. 2A) were subjected to disaggregation, and the reaction products were analyzed by differential centrifugation (Fig. 2B). Similar to 1N3R fibrils, fibrils formed by all other Tau isoforms could be disassembled by the human disaggregation machinery, although with varying efficiencies (Fig. 2B and C). In general, all 3R isoforms displayed higher disaggregation rates than their 4R counterparts, with 0N3R Tau fibrils being most efficiently disassembled (53%) and 0N4R fibrils being most resistant to chaperone-mediated disaggregation (11%). Overall, these results show that the Hsp70 disaggregase exhibits disaggregation activity toward all Tau variants and is not limited to fibrils assembled from a certain Tau isoform. Amyloid aggregates formed in vivo might possess different properties than in vitro aggregated fibrils, as posttranslational modifications or coaggregation with other endogenous proteins could affect the overall structural arrangement (22Fichou Y. Al-Hilaly Y.K. Devred F. Smet-Nocca C. Tsvetkov P.O. Verelst J. Winderickx J. Geukens N. Vanmechelen E. Perrotin A. Serpell L. Hanseeuw B.J. Medina M. Buée L. Landrieu I.

Commun. 2019; 7 (30823892): 3110.1186/s40478-019-0682-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Tau aggregates formed in cells are clients of the human Hsp70 disaggregation machinery, we made use of a HEK293 cell model of Tau aggregation (23McEwan W.A. Falcon B. Vaysburd M. Clift D. Oblak A.L. Ghetti B. Goedert M. James L.C. Cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21 inhibits seeded tau aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; 114 (28049840): 574-57910.1073/pnas.1607215114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This cell line constitutively overexpresses Venus-tagged full-length P301S mutant 0N4R Tau (0N4R TauP301S-Venus), which remains Sarkosyl soluble under normal growth conditions and was successfully used as a biosensor for Tau seeding (23McEwan W.A. Falcon B. Vaysburd M. Clift D. Oblak A.L. Ghetti B. Goedert M. James L.C. Cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21 inhibits seeded tau aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; 114 (28049840): 574-57910.1073/pnas.1607215114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After treating the cells with recombinant fibrils from the 1N4R Tau isoform, we specifically enriched the seeded cells through flow cytometry sorting and expanded them to provide a source of Tau aggregates that were formed in cells (Fig. 3A). The Sarkosyl-resistant material was extracted from the seeded cells and subjected to in vitro disaggregation assays. In the presence of HSC70, DNAJB1, HSPA4, and ATP, 30% of the TauP301S-Venus was recovered in the supernatant fraction following centrifugation (Fig. 3B and C). Next, we evaluated whether patient-derived Tau can also be disassembled by the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery. We prepared Tau filaments from Braak stage VI AD cortex gray matter using Sarkosyl extraction and extensive ultracentrifugation steps as previously described (24Guo J.L. Narasimhan S. Changolkar L. He Z. Stieber A. Zhang B. Gathagan R.J. Iba M. McBride J.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Unique pathological tau conformers from Alzheimer’s brains transmit tau pathology in nontransgenic mice.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 (27810929): 2635-265410.1084/jem.20160833Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). Treating Tau filaments prepared in this manner with the disaggregation machinery in vitro released 57% of Tau into the supernatant fraction (Fig. 3D and E). Together, these results demonstrate that the human Hsp70 disaggregation machinery is capable of disassembling Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau, which was aggregated in a human cell culture model, as well as pathological Tau species extracted from the brain of an AD patient. Hsp70 substrate specificity is mediated by J-domain proteins that recognize chaperone clients and deliver them to Hsp70 (13Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20651708): 579-59210.1038/nrm2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Humans encode more than 40 different J-domain proteins, subdivided into structural classes A, B, and C, with distinct substrate specificities and cellular localization (13Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Several class A and B J-domain proteins are differentially regulated in the brain both during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases (25Brehme M. Voisine C. Rolland T. Wachi S. Soper J.H. Zhu Y. Orton K. Villella A. Garza D. Vidal M. Ge H. Morimoto R.I. A chaperome subnetwork safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease.Cell Rep. 2014; 9 (25437566): 1135-115010.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In particular, the class A cochaperone DNAJA1 as well as the class B cochaperone DNAJB4 are upregulated in patients with AD, PD, and Huntington's disease (HD) compared with age-matched controls (25Brehme M. Voisine C. Rolland T. Wachi S. Soper J.H. Zhu Y. Orton K. Villella A. Garza D. Vidal M. Ge H. Morimoto R.I. A chaperome subnetwork safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease.Cell Rep. 2014; 9 (25437566): 1135-115010.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These findings point to a potential role of these cochaperones in regulating proteostasis in the context of protein-misfolding diseases. Therefore, we investigated whether these J-domain proteins could also serve in combination with HSC70 and HSPA4 to disaggregate Tau fibrils (Fig. 4A). The class B J-domain protein DNAJB4 was equally capable of promoting disaggregation of recombinant 1N3R Tau fibrils as DNAJB1, both shifting ∼50% of Tau to the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4A and B). Although 1N4R fibrils again were less susceptible to disassembly by the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery than 1N3R fibrils, DNAJB4 could also substitute for DNAJB1 and mediated ∼36% disaggregation compared with ∼26% for DNAJB1 (Fig. 4A and C). The two class A J-domain proteins tested here, DNAJA1 and DNAJA2, did not enable disaggregation of either 1N3R or 1N4R Tau fibrils (Fig. 4A–C). Moreover, DNAJA2 did not promote the disaggregation of any other Tau isoform (Fig. S3A). In conclusion, the class B J-domain protein DNAJB4, which is closely related to DNAJB1 (Fig. S3B and C), also enabled efficient disaggregation of amyloid Tau fibrils, whereas the class A J-domain proteins could not assist their disassembly. The products of the disaggregation reaction could consist of multiple protein species, such as monomers, small oligomers, and other fibril fragments with intermediate lengths. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether chaperone-mediated disaggregation of amyloid fibrils is advantageous or disadvantageous. A complete resolubilization and refolding of Tau into monomers is considered beneficial, whereas the production and accumulation of fibrillar intermediates is considered disadvantageous, as the latter could contribute to the propagation of Tau aggregates through the continuous production of new seeds. Therefore, it is important to analyze the products of the disaggregation reaction more closely. To monitor the disaggregation dynamics, we determined the quantity of amyloid structures during chaperone-mediated disaggregation by measuring the fluorescence of the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin T (ThT) over time. Incubation of both 1N3R (Fig. 5A) and 1N4R (Fig. 5B) Tau fibrils with the disaggregation machinery and ATP resulted in a decrease in ThT fluorescence of 20% and 10% within 4 h, respectively. After that, the ThT fluorescence plateaued over the course of the measurement. In the absence of ATP, the ThT fluorescence remained stable over time. This observation reflected the results obtained by differential centrifugation for the two Tau isoforms (Fig. 1C and D and 2B and C). However, the disaggregation efficiency determined by reduction in ThT fluorescence was, in general, lower than the efficiencies obtained by the sedimentation assay and subsequent immunoblotting. To characterize the composition of the disaggregated Tau material in more detail, we performed rate-zonal centrifugation, in which Tau assemblies are separated according to their size. We first performed control experiments with untreated monomeric and fibrillar Tau, respectively (Fig. S4). After 3 h of centrifugation over a 5–45% sucrose gradient, monomeric recombinant 1N3R and 1N4R Tau remained in the first two low-density fractions, whereas untreated fibrils migrated to the higher density fractions (Fig. S4). Next, 1N3R and 1N4R Tau fibrils were analyzed after 30 min and 4 h of chaperone treatment. These time points were chosen based on the disaggregation kinetics followed using ThT binding, reflecting the intermediate and endpoints of the disaggregation reaction, respectively (Fig. 5A and B). In the presence of HSC70, DNAJB1, HSPA4, and ATP, an increasing amount of Tau was detected in the low-density fractions over the course of the disaggregation reaction, whereas the amount of Tau in all middle- and high-density fractions was reduced (Fig. 5C–E). Fibrils incubated for 4 h with chaperones but without ATP behaved like untreated fibrils and moved to higher density fractions during the centrifugation, and no shift of Tau to lower density fractions was observed (Fig. 5C–E and Fig. S4). We did not detect any buildup of Tau in intermediate fractions during the disaggregation reaction (Fig. 5D and E). This finding was also in line with our EM analysis, where we did not observe widespread fibril fragmentation (Fig. S5). Instead, most of the Tau protein liberated by the disaggregation machinery shifted to the low-density fractions in the sucrose gradients, suggesting that predominantly monomeric or small oligomeric Tau species were released. To further characterize these low-molecular-weight Tau species, we next subjected Tau fibrils with and without chaperone treatment to sequential centrifugation (Fig. 6A). In untreated 1N4R Tau fibril preparations, about 6% of Tau was found in the 20,000 × g supernatant (Fig. 2B). However, these Tau species sedimented at 337,000 × g, whereas the Tau material that was released by disaggregation remained in the supernatant, hinting at a smaller particle size of these species (Fig. 6B). Hence, the 337,000 × g supernatant contains Tau species specifically produced by the action of the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery, which are not present without chaperone treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3028703248,"Infection by enveloped viruses involves fusion of their lipid envelopes with cellular membranes to release the viral genome into cells. For HIV, Ebola, influenza and numerous other viruses, envelope glycoproteins bind the infecting virion to cell-surface receptors and mediate membrane fusion. In the case of influenza, the receptor-binding glycoprotein is the haemagglutinin (HA), and following receptor-mediated uptake of the bound virus by endocytosis1, it is the HA that mediates fusion of the virus envelope with the membrane of the endosome2. Each subunit of the trimeric HA consists of two disulfide-linked polypeptides, HA1 and HA2. The larger, virus-membrane-distal, HA1 mediates receptor binding; the smaller, membrane-proximal, HA2 anchors HA in the envelope and contains the fusion peptide, a region that is directly involved in membrane interaction3. The low pH of endosomes activates fusion by facilitating irreversible conformational changes in the glycoprotein. The structures of the initial HA at neutral pH and the final HA at fusion pH have been investigated by electron microscopy4,5 and X-ray crystallography6-8. Here, to further study the process of fusion, we incubate HA for different times at pH 5.0 and directly image structural changes using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. We describe three distinct, previously undescribed forms of HA, most notably a 150 Å-long triple-helical coil of HA2, which may bridge between the viral and endosomal membranes. Comparison of these structures reveals concerted conformational rearrangements through which the HA mediates membrane fusion."

Meeske et al. discovered AcrVIA1, a viral-encoded inhibitor that binds to Cas13 to occlude the RNA guide and prevent the activation of the nuclease (see the Perspective by Barrangou and Sontheimer). As opposed to inhibitors of DNA-cleaving CRISPR-Cas systems, which require multiple infections to neutralize all Cas nucleases of the host, production of AcrVIA1 by a single virus is sufficient to overcome the CRISPR-Cas13 response.

https://openalex.org/W3030424063,"Sex chromosomes in males of most eutherian mammals share only a small homologous segment, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), in which the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), pairing and crossing over must occur for correct meiotic segregation1,2. How cells ensure that recombination occurs in the PAR is unknown. Here we present a dynamic ultrastructure of the PAR and identify controlling cis- and trans-acting factors that make the PAR the hottest segment for DSB formation in the male mouse genome. Before break formation, multiple DSB-promoting factors hyperaccumulate in the PAR, its chromosome axes elongate and the sister chromatids separate. These processes are linked to heterochromatic mo-2 minisatellite arrays, and require MEI4 and ANKRD31 proteins but not the axis components REC8 or HORMAD1. We propose that the repetitive DNA sequence of the PAR confers unique chromatin and higher-order structures that are crucial for recombination. Chromosome synapsis triggers collapse of the elongated PAR structure and, notably, oocytes can be reprogrammed to exhibit spermatocyte-like levels of DSBs in the PAR simply by delaying or preventing synapsis. Thus, the sexually dimorphic behaviour of the PAR is in part a result of kinetic differences between the sexes in a race between the maturation of the PAR structure, formation of DSBs and completion of pairing and synapsis. Our findings establish a mechanistic paradigm for the recombination of sex chromosomes during meiosis."

However, although voltage-sensing domains transduce transmembrane electric field changes by a common mechanism involving the outward or inward translocation of gating charges1-3, the general determinants of channel gating polarity remain poorly understood4. Here we suggest a molecular mechanism for electromechanical coupling and gating polarity in non-domain-swapped Kv channels on the basis of the cryo-electron microscopy structure of KAT1, the hyperpolarization-activated Kv channel from Arabidopsis thaliana. KAT1 displays a depolarized voltage sensor, which interacts with a closed pore domain directly via two interfaces and indirectly via an intercalated phospholipid. Functional evaluation of KAT1 structure-guided mutants at the sensor-pore interfaces suggests a mechanism in which direct interaction between the sensor and the C-linker hairpin in the adjacent pore subunit is the primary determinant of gating polarity. We suggest that an inward motion of the S4 sensor helix of approximately 5-7 Å can underlie a direct-coupling mechanism, driving a conformational reorientation of the C-linker and ultimately opening the activation gate formed by the S6 intracellular bundle. This direct-coupling mechanism contrasts with allosteric mechanisms proposed for hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels5, and may represent an unexpected link between depolarization- and hyperpolarization-activated channels."

As strong Pacific cyclones have become stronger, they have increased the amount of energy contained in cyclonic mesoscale ocean eddies and decreased that of anticyclonic ones.

Here we find that nearly one in four human tumours contains a composite mutation of a cancer-associated gene, defined as two or more nonsynonymous somatic mutations in the same gene and tumour. Composite mutations are enriched in specific genes, have an elevated rate of use of less-common hotspot mutations acquired in a chronology driven in part by oncogenic fitness, and arise in an allelic configuration that reflects context-specific selective pressures. cis-acting composite mutations are hypermorphic in some genes in which dosage effects predominate (such as TERT), whereas they lead to selection of function in other genes (such as TP53). Collectively, composite mutations are driver alterations that arise from context- and allele-specific selective pressures that are dependent in part on gene and mutation function, and which lead to complex-often neomorphic-functions of biological and therapeutic importance."

https://openalex.org/W3029550069,"Mutations in the human cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene are known to cause endothelial dysfunction responsible for cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. CBS is the predominant hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzyme in endothelial cells (ECs). Recently, H2S was shown to attenuate ROS and improve mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are metabolic organelles that actively transform their ultrastructure to mediate their function. Therefore, we questioned whether perturbation of CBS/H2S activity could drive mitochondrial dysfunction via mitochondrial dynamics in ECs. Here we demonstrate that silencing CBS induces mitochondria fragmentation, attenuates efficient oxidative phosphorylation, and decreases EC function. Mechanistically, CBS silencing significantly elevates ROS production, thereby leading to reduced mitofusin 2 (MFN2) expression, decouple endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts, increased mitochondria fission, enhanced receptor-mediated mitophagy, and increased EC death. These defects were significantly rescued by the treatment of H2S donors. Taken together our data highlights a novel signaling axis that mechanistically links CBS with mitochondrial function and ER-mitochondrial tethering and could be considered as a new therapeutic approach for the intervention of EC dysfunction-related pathologies."

Reducing oxidative stress by an ALDH2 activator could have therapeutic potential for limiting AAA development. We hypothesized that ALDH2 deficiency could increase the risk for AAA by decreasing ROS elimination and that an ALDH2 activator could provide an alternative option for AAA treatment.

Residues were more likely to be present in unpasteurized milk samples (5/21, 23.8%) compared to pasteurized samples (5/75, 6.8%); P = 0.039. Two thirds of unpasteurized samples (14/21, 66.7%) contained detectable numbers of presumptive E. coli (mean 3.5 Log10 CFU/ml) and of these, 92.8% (13/14) were positive for ampicillin- (mean 3.2 Log10 CFU/ml) and 50% (7/14) for tetracycline-resistant E. coli (mean 3.1 Log10 CFU/ml). We found no relationship between the presence of antibiotic residues and the presence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in unpasteurized milk sold within Kibera (P > 0.2)."
https://openalex.org/W3029081907,"Unwanted sexual attention (UWSA) and sexual harassment (SH) are prevalent experiences for women in working life and often accompanied by poor health. Despite increasing numbers especially of young people working in insecure and irregular employment settings, there is little empirical evidence if such precarious arrangements are associated with UWSA or SH. To investigate this, we used a representative sample of the European working population consisting of 63,966 employees in 33 countries who participated in the European Working Conditions Survey in 2010 or 2015. Precarious employment (PE) was assessed on the basis of seven indicators and a formative index derived from them: temporary employment, contractual duration < 1 year, schedule unpredictability, involuntary part-time, low information on occupational health and safety risks (OSH), low pay (wage < 60%), and multiple job-holding. We measured self-reported experiences of workplace UWSA during the last month and SH during the last 12 months each using a single-item questionnaire. Multi-level Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios for UWSA and SH according to PE adjusted for survey year, age, education, type of household, migration background, job tenure, weekly working hours, occupational position, working sector, company size, workplace gender ratio, and visiting customers or clients. 0.8% of men reported UWSA in the last month and 2.6% of the women. SH in the last year was reported by 0.4% of the men and 1.3% of the women. For both men and women, PE was significantly associated with elevated prevalence of UWSA and SH, in particular when reporting schedule unpredictability, multiple job-holding and low information on OSH. Our results suggest that precariously employed individuals may be more prone to experience unwanted sexual behaviour at the workplace compared with workers in non-precarious settings."
https://openalex.org/W3032591671,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the first committed step in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids. The multisubunit ACCase in the chloroplast is activated by a shift to pH 8 upon light adaptation and is inhibited by a shift to pH 7 upon dark adaptation. Here, titrations with the purified ACCase biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunits from Arabidopsis indicated that they can competently and independently bind biotin carboxylase (BC) but differ in responses to pH changes representing those in the plastid stroma during light or dark conditions. At pH 7 in phosphate buffer, BADC1 and BADC2 gain an advantage over BCCP1 and BCCP2 in affinity for BC. At pH 8 in KCl solution, however, BCCP1 and BCCP2 had more than 10-fold higher affinity for BC than did BADC1. The pH-modulated shifts in BC preferences for BCCP and BADC partners suggest they contribute to light-dependent regulation of heteromeric ACCase. Using NMR spectroscopy, we found evidence for increased intrinsic disorder of the BADC and BCCP subunits at pH 7. We propose that this intrinsic disorder potentially promotes fast association with BC through a fly-casting mechanism. We hypothesize that the pH effects on the BADC and BCCP subunits attenuate ACCase activity by night and enhance it by day. Consistent with this hypothesis, Arabidopsis badc1 badc3 mutant lines grown in a light-dark cycle synthesized more fatty acids in their seeds. In summary, our findings provide evidence that the BADC and BCCP subunits function as pH sensors required for light-dependent switching of heteromeric ACCase activity."
https://openalex.org/W3032311445,"Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the liver or serum in the absence of detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI poses a risk for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of OBI in Kenya is unknown, thus a study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and molecular characterization of OBI in Kenyan populations at high risk of HBV infection. Sera from two Nairobi cohorts, 99 male sex workers, primarily having sex with men (MSM-SW), and 13 non-MSM men having HIV-positive partners, as well as 65 HBsAg-negative patients presenting with jaundice at Kenyan medical facilities, were tested for HBV serological markers, including HBV DNA by real-time PCR. Positive DNA samples were sequenced and MSM-SW patients were further tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Of the 166 HBsAg-negative samples tested, 31 (18.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.5-25.3) were HBV DNA positive (i.e., occult), the majority (20/31; 64.5%) of which were HBV core protein antibody positive. HCV infection was not observed in the MSM-SW participants, although the prevalence of HBsAg positivity was 10.1% (10/99; 95% CI 5.6-17.6). HBV genotype A was predominant among study cases, including both HBsAg-positive and OBI participants, although the data suggests a non-African network transmission source among MSM-SW. The high prevalence of HBV infection among MSM-SW in Kenya suggests that screening programmes be instituted among high-risk cohorts to facilitate preventative measures, such as vaccination, and establish entry to treatment and linkage to care."
https://openalex.org/W3031350240,"Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin and activates blood and vascular cells in thrombo-inflammatory diseases. Platelets are amplifiers of thrombin formation when activated by leukocyte- and vascular cell-derived thrombin. CD36 on platelets acts as sensitizer for molecules with damage-associated molecular patterns, thereby increasing platelet reactivity. Here, we investigated the role of CD36 in thrombin-generation on human platelets, including selected patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Platelets deficient in CD36 or blocked by anti-CD36 antibody FA6.152 showed impaired thrombin generation triggered by thrombin in calibrated automated thrombography. Using platelets with congenital function defects, blocking antibodies, pharmacological inhibitors, and factor-depleted plasma, CD36-sensitive thrombin generation was dependent on FXI, fibrin, and platelet signaling via GPIbα and SFKs. CD36-deficiency or blocking suppressed thrombin-induced platelet αIIbβ3 activation, granule exocytosis, binding of adhesion proteins and FV, FVIII, FIX, FX, but not anionic phospholipid exposure determined by flow cytometry. CD36 ligated specifically soluble fibrin, which recruited distinct coagulation factors via thiols. Selected patients with CKD showed elevated soluble fibrin plasma levels and enhanced thrombin-induced thrombin generation, which was normalized by CD36 blocking. Thus, CD36 is an important amplifier of platelet-dependent thrombin generation when exposure of anionic phospholipids is limited. This pathway might contribute to hypercoagulability in CKD."

Another in vitro study showed that siRNA-mediated reduction of Alcα, in cultured neurons, enhanced amyloidogenic processing of APP (21Vagnoni A. Perkinton M.S. Gray E.H. Francis P.T. Noble W.

These observations collectively suggest a functional link between Alcα and APP metabolism; however, the physiological significance of Alcα in APP metabolism in vivo remains unclear. Here, we explored the role of Alcα in APP metabolism, in vivo, by generating Alcα-deficient mice. The β-site cleavage of endogenous APP and generation of Aβ were enhanced in the brains of Alcα-deficient mice, and amyloid plaque formation was facilitated in the brains of human APP-producing transgenic mice in an Alcα-deficient background. These observations indicate that Alcα plays a physiologically relevant role in APP metabolism to ameliorate AD pathogenesis. To evaluate the role of Alcα in endogenous APP metabolism, Alcα-deficient mice were generated using a standard gene knockout method with a targeting vector in which the coding sequence of exon 1 was replaced with the LacZ-pA-PGK-Neo-pA cassette (Fig. 1A). Mutant mice carrying the allele without pGKNeo were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice over 10 generations. The mutation was confirmed by Southern blotting and PCR analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). The absence of Alcα protein was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunostaining (Fig. 1, D and E) of brain extracts and slices with specific antibodies, as Alcα is predominantly expressed in brain tissue (20Araki Y.

Neither band was detected in the brains of knockout (−/−) mice (Fig. 1D). Alcα was expressed in whole-brain tissue with a stronger expression in the hippocampal neurons of WT (+/+) mice, based on immunohistochemical staining; these signals were not detected in knockout (−/−) mice (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that homozygous mutant mice expressed neither the full-length Alcα nor the truncated/processed fragments of Alcα. APP is primarily cleaved by either α- or β-secretase to generate APP CTFs. The α-cleavage of APP generates C83/CTFα by cleaving the peptide bond between Lys-687 and Leu-688 (sequence numbering refers to the APP770 isoform) within the Aβ sequence. Thus, this cleavage is amyloidolytic. Alternatively, β-cleavage of APP generates C99/CTFβ by cleaving the peptide bond between Met-671 and Asp-672 and generates C89/CTFβ′ by cleaving the peptide bond between Tyr-681 and Gln-682 (27Cole S.L.

We examined whether defects in Alcα would influence the primary cleavages of APP in vivo (Fig. 2). The cerebral cortex and hippocampus membrane fractions, prepared from WT (+/+) and Alcα-KO (−/−) mice brains (3 months old), were analyzed for Alcα expression and cleavages of APP by immunoblotting. Identical protein amounts were loaded per lane, as indicated in the figure legends, and the densities of bands were quantified followed by normalization using the integral membrane protein flotillin-1. Among the three major APP isoforms (amino acid numbers 770, 751, and 695), brain neurons exclusively expressed the APP695 isoform and showed three protein bands. These comprised two mature forms with different O-glycosylation with N-glycosylation and one immature form with N-glycosylation alone on an immunoblotted membrane (reviewed in Ref. 34Suzuki T. Nakaya T. Regulation of amyloid β-protein precursor by phosphorylation and protein interactions.J. Biol.

Maturation of APP was largely identical and a slight alteration of APP protein level was observed, however not statistically significant, between the WT (+/+) and knockout (−/−) mouse brains (Fig. 2 (A and C) and Fig. S1). This suggests that defects in Alcα expression did not significantly affect the expression or posttranslational modification of the APP. We next examined APP CTF levels in the brains of these mice. Three CTF fragments (C99, C89, and C83) were detected and measured by immunoblotting phosphatase-treated membrane fractions prepared from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the indicated mice, with antibodies raised against the APP cytoplasmic region (see Fig. S1). Levels of C99 and C89, generated by β-cleavage of APP, were significantly increased in Alcα-KO mouse brains compared with WT mice. Levels of C83, generated by α-cleavage of APP, were not altered among the brains of WT and Alcα-deficient mice (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the β-site cleavage of APP was enhanced in the brains of Alcα-deficient mice. We further examined age-specific alterations of the enhanced β-site cleavage in Alcα-KO mice. Selective enhancement of β-site cleavage in Alcα-KO mice was observed from 2-month-old adult mice (Fig. S1). The ratio of β-site cleavage enhancement was virtually unaltered with age. The observed enhancement of β-site cleavage in Alcα-KO mice was probably not due to the augmented expression of BACE1, as no statistically significant alteration of BACE1 expression was observed between the WT and Alcα-deficient mouse brains (see Fig. 4A). Enhanced β-site cleavage of APP should induce increased Aβ generation as APP CTFs are subject to a secondary cleavage by γ-secretase that generates Aβ and p3 peptides. We next quantified the endogenous Aβ levels in the brains of WT and Alcα-deficient mice (Fig. 2D). Mouse Aβ is largely recovered into a TBS-insoluble fraction, regardless of its nonaggregative nature (17Saito Y. Sano Y. Vassar R. Gandy S. Nakaya T. Yamamoto T. Suzuki T. X11 proteins regulate the translocation of Amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) into detergent-resistant membrane and suppress the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by β-site-cleaving enzyme in brain.J.

We thus examined Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in TBS-insoluble fractions of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of WT and Alcα-deficient mice at ages 2, 6, and 12 months. Endogenous mouse Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were significantly increased in the brains of Alcα-deficient mice (filled columns) compared with the WT mice (open columns). The enhancements were roughly comparable with those of the enhanced production of Aβ peptides at the corresponding ages. As stated earlier, endogenous mouse Aβ is less aggregation-prone than the human Aβ, and it is rather natural to not observe significant age-related accumulation of mouse Aβ in these mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Alcα may functionally suppress amyloidogenic β-cleavage of APP in the brain. Mouse Aβ does not form amyloid plaques due to its nonaggregative nature (33Kimura A. Hata S. Suzuki T.

However, less is known about how lncRNAs respond to environmental cues and what transcriptional mechanisms regulate their expression. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the lncRNA Tug1 (taurine upregulated gene 1) is crucial for the progression of diabetic kidney disease, a major microvascular complication of diabetes. Using a combination of proximity labeling with the engineered soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2), ChIP-qPCR, biotin-labeled oligonucleotide pulldown, and classical promoter luciferase assays in kidney podocytes, we extend our initial observations in the current study and now provide a detailed analysis on a how high-glucose milieu downregulates Tug1 expression in podocytes. Our results revealed an essential role for the transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) in controlling Tug1 transcription in the podocytes in response to increased glucose levels. Along with ChREBP, other coregulators, including MAX dimerization protein (MLX), MAX dimerization protein 1 (MXD1), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), were enriched at the Tug1 promoter under high-glucose conditions. These observations provide the first characterization of the mouse Tug1 promoter's response to the high-glucose milieu. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism by which ChREBP can coordinate glucose homeostasis with the expression of the lncRNA Tug1 and further our understanding of dynamic transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs in a disease state."
https://openalex.org/W3031495295,"Numerous nutritional approaches aimed at reducing body weight have been developed as a strategy to reduce obesity. Most of these interventions rely on reducing caloric intake or limiting calories access to a few hours per day. In this work, we analyzed the effects of the extended (24 hours/day) or restricted (1 hour/day) access to a cafeteria-style (CAF) diet, on rat body weight and hepatic lipid metabolism, with respect to control rats (CTR) fed with a standard chow diet. The body weight gain of restricted-fed rats was not different from CTR, despite the slightly higher total caloric intake, but resulted significantly lower than extended-fed rats, which showed a CAF diet-induced obesity and a dramatically higher total caloric intake. However, both CAF-fed groups of rats showed, compared to CTR, unhealthy serum and hepatic parameters such as higher serum glucose level, lower HDL values, and increased hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol amount. The hepatic expression and activity of key enzymes of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS), was similarly reduced in both CAF-fed groups of rats with respect to CTR. Anyway, while in extended-fed rats this reduction was associated to a long-term mechanism involving sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), in restricted-fed animals a short-term mechanism based on PKA and AMPK activation occurred in the liver. Furthermore, hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative stress resulted significantly increased in extended, but not in restricted-fed rats, as compared to CTR. Overall, these results demonstrate that although limiting the total caloric intake might successfully fight obesity development, the nutritional content of the diet is the major determinant for the health status."
https://openalex.org/W3031813132,"Background and objectives MitraClip implantation is an established therapy for secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) in high-risk patients and has shown to improve several important outcome parameters such as functional capacity. Patient selection is both challenging and crucial for achieving therapeutic success. This study investigated baseline predictors of functional improvement as it was quantified by the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) after transcatheter mitral valve repair. Methods and results We retrospectively analyzed 79 patients with secondary MR treated with MitraClip implantation at an academic tertiary care center. Before and four weeks after the procedure, all patients underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, six-minute walk tests and echocardiography. 6MWD significantly improved after MitraClip therapy (295 m vs. 265 m, p < 0.001). A linear regression model including seven clinical baseline variables significantly predicted the change in 6MWD (p = 0.002, R2 = 0.387). Female gender, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension were found to be significant negative predictors of 6MWD improvement. At baseline, female patients had significant higher left ventricular ejection fraction (49% vs. 42%, p = 0.019) and lower 6MWD (240 m vs. 288 m, p = 0.034) than male patients. Conclusion MitraClip implantation in secondary MR significantly improves functional capacity in high-risk patients even in the short term of four weeks after the procedure. Female gender, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are baseline predictors of a less favourable functional outcome. While further validation in a larger cohort is recommended, these parameters may improve patient selection for MitraClip therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3029994862,"One in five patients does not improve in pain with walking (non-responders) 12 months after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This longitudinal study investigated a broad range of symptoms before and after TKA and evaluated possible differences in symptom distress between responders and non-responders with regards to pain with walking after TKA.Prior to TKA surgery, 182 patients completed a demographic questionnaire and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF). The MSAS-SF was repeated 12 months following TKA. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Patients were categorized as responders or non-responders based on their trajectories of pain with walking assessed prior to surgery, on postoperative day 4, at 6 weeks, and at 3 and 12 months.Overall, the most distressful preoperative symptoms were pain, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, worrying, feeling bloated, and problems with sexual interest or activity. However, compared with patients classified as responders to TKA, non-responders had higher total symptom distress scores both preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. Preoperatively, non-responders scored higher than responders on five of the seven most distressing symptoms (i.e., all except difficulty sleeping and feeling bloated), and 12 months postoperatively, non-responders scored higher than responders on six of the seven most distressing symptoms (i.e., all but feeling bloated). In a multivariate analysis, higher preoperative distress scores for pain and problems with sexual interest or activity were significant predictors of non-response to TKA, controlling for other relevant factors.Patients' preoperative symptom burden may be a useful indicator of their risk for non-improvement following TKA surgery. Future studies need to evaluate the effect of reducing patients' preoperative symptom burden on TKA outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3030368986,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) gene rearrangement is characterized by increased expression of a set of homeodomain transcription factors, including homeobox A9 (HOXA9) and HOXA10. The target genes for these regulators include fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and Ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase 2 (ARIH2). FGF2 induces leukemia stem cell expansion in MLL1-rearranged AML. ARIH2 encodes TRIAD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for termination of emergency granulopoiesis and leukemia suppressor function in MLL1-rearranged AML. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including the FGF receptor, are TRIAD1 substrates that are possibly relevant to these activities. Using transcriptome analysis, we found increased activity of innate immune response pathways and RTK signaling in bone marrow progenitors from mice with MLL1-rearranged AML. We hypothesized that sustained RTK signaling, because of decreased TRIAD1 activity, impairs termination of emergency granulopoiesis during the innate immune response and contributes to leukemogenesis in this AML subtype. Consistent with this, we found aberrantly sustained emergency granulopoiesis in a murine model of MLL1-rearranged AML, associated with accelerated leukemogenesis. Treating these mice with an inhibitor of TRIAD1-substrate RTKs terminated emergency granulopoiesis, delayed leukemogenesis during emergency granulopoiesis, and normalized innate immune responses when combined with chemotherapy. Emergency granulopoiesis also hastened postchemotherapy relapse in mice with MLL1-rearranged AML, but remission was sustained by ongoing RTK inhibition. Our findings suggest that the physiological stress of infectious challenges may drive AML progression in molecularly defined subsets and identify RTK inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to counteract this process."

Small non coding RNAs gather a wide collection of classes, such as microRNAs, tRNA-derived fragments, small nucleolar RNAs and small nuclear RNAs, to name a few. As usual in RNA-seq studies, the sequencing step is followed by a feature quantification step: when a genome is available, the reads are aligned to the genome, their genomic positions are compared to the already available annotations, and the corresponding features are quantified. However, problem arises when many reads map at several positions and while different strategies exist to circumvent this problem, all of them are biased. In this article, we present a new strategy that compares all the reads that map at several positions, and their annotations when available. In many cases, all the hits co-localize with the same feature annotation (a duplicated miRNA or a duplicated gene, for instance). When different annotations exist for a given read, we propose to merge existing features and provide the counts for the merged features. This new strategy has been implemented in a tool, mmannot, freely available at https://github.com/mzytnicki/mmannot."

https://openalex.org/W3030774399,"One hot July morning, I put on a business casual dress and headed to a biotech company for the first day of my internship. It felt daunting. Academia was my safe space; I had never worked anywhere else. When I arrived at the office, I was ushered into an orientation room, where people in formal business attire told me about the company's mission, products, and research areas. As the morning wore on, my unease about working for a for-profit company grew. I left the orientation wondering whether pausing my Ph.D. research to take on the internship had been a mistake.



> “I'd spent years dreaming up potential jobs based on my interests.” 

When I started my Ph.D. program, I was open with my advisers about my career intentions, telling them that I wanted to work outside academia. I enjoyed doing research, but I wasn't interested in sitting at a desk writing grants for the rest of my career—something I knew I'd have to do a lot of if I became a professor.

My university had a program that enabled students to take a break from their research to do an internship at a company or government agency. My advisers told me about the program early on, and they encouraged me to plan on doing an internship during my final year. They thought that the experience would help me build connections and figure out what to do after graduation.

So I started to search for internships during my fourth year, at first focusing my search on science policy because I'd grown increasingly interested in that career path. I was disheartened to find that paid internships in science policy in my city were few and far between. I needed a solid paycheck and couldn't afford to relocate to another city temporarily, so I widened my search and started to look at positions in the biotech industry. My university had connections with local companies, so it was easier to find industry positions.

After the orientation session on my first day at the company, my manager sat me down to chat. I noticed her sneakers, colorful T-shirt, and cool haircut, and I remember thinking that she didn't look anything like the corporate representatives I'd listened to that morning. She asked me what I wanted to do after I graduated. After hearing of my interest in science policy, she asked, “Are you sure that the day-to-day experience of science policy professionals appeals to you?” I couldn't come up with an answer that felt satisfying; all I could say was that I thought the work would be important. “You should take on a short-term position to find out if you'll like it,” she advised. Suddenly, it hit me that I'd spent years dreaming up potential jobs based on my interests, but I didn't have any experience to know whether I'd like any of them.

Over the past 11 months, I've learned that her advice to give a new career path a try was spot on. I'd gone into my company internship expecting to do standard experiments devoid of creative thought. I was prepared to get bored quickly. But there's more creativity in industry than I imagined. Few products actually make it to market, and my company is willing to try different ideas and experimentation methods, even if they ultimately lead to a dead-end. I have been surprised by how much I've enjoyed my work.

My experience at the company has been so positive that my manager and I agreed to extend my internship to a full year. My Ph.D. advisers even allowed me to include some of the experiments I performed at the company in my dissertation.

I successfully defended my Ph.D. this month, and I am on the hunt for my first post-Ph.D. job. I've been applying for scientist positions in industry—now convinced that industry is where I would like to work after all. On the side, I hope to volunteer for groups that are working in the realm of science policy. I haven't given up on that dream, but I understand that you never know whether you'll like something until you try it out."
https://openalex.org/W3031760114,"ZMAT2 is among the least-studied of mammalian proteins and genes, even though it is the ortholog of Snu23, a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing in yeast. Here we have used data from genomic and gene expression repositories to examine the Zmat2 gene and locus in 8 terrestrial vertebrates, 10 ray-finned fish, and 1 lobe-finned fish representing > 500 million years of evolutionary diversification. The analyses revealed that vertebrate Zmat2 genes are similar to their mammalian counterparts, as in 16/19 species studied they contain 6 exons, and in 18/19 encode a single conserved protein. However, unlike in mammals, no Zmat2 pseudogenes were identified in these vertebrates, although an expressed Zmat2 paralog was characterized in flycatcher that resembled a DNA copy of a processed and retro-transposed mRNA, and thus could be a proto-pseudogene captured during its evolutionary journey from active to inert. The Zmat2 locus in terrestrial vertebrates, and in spotted gar and coelacanth, also shares additional genes with its mammalian counterparts, including Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (Hars), Hars2, and others, but these are absent from the Zmat2 locus in teleost fish, in which Stem-loop-binding protein 2 (Slbp2) and Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2a (Lcp2a) are present instead. Taken together, these observations argue that a recognizable Zmat2 was present in the earliest vertebrate ancestors, and postulate that during chromosomal tetraploidization and subsequent re-diploidization during modern teleost evolution, the duplicated Zmat2 gene was retained and the original lost. This study also highlights how information from genomic resources can be leveraged to reveal new biologically significant insights."
