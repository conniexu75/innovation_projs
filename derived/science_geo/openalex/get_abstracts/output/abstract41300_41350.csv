https://openalex.org/W2165326144,"The initiation of lipid peroxidation by Fe2+ and H2O2 (Fenton's reagent) is often proposed to be mediated by the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Using Fe2+, H2O2, and phospholipid liposomes as a model system, we have found that lipid peroxidation, as assessed by malondialdehyde formation, is not initiated by the hydroxyl radical, but rather requires Fe3+ and Fe2+. EPR spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and the bleaching of para-nitrosodimethylaniline confirmed the generation of the hydroxyl radical in this system. Accordingly, catalase and the hydroxyl radical scavengers mannitol and benzoate efficiently inhibited the generation and the detection of hydroxyl radical. However, catalase, mannitol, and benzoate could either stimulate or inhibit lipid peroxidation. These unusual effects were found to be consistent with their ability to modulate the extent of Fe2+ oxidation by H2O2 and demonstrated that lipid peroxidation depends on the Fe3+:Fe2+ ratio, maximal initial rates occurring at 1:1. These studies suggest that the initiation of liposomal peroxidation by Fe2+ and H2O2 is mediated by an oxidant which requires both Fe3+ and Fe2+ and that the rate of the reaction is determined by the absolute Fe3+:Fe2+ ratio."

https://openalex.org/W1509781249,"Lauric acid omega-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450LA omega) was purified from livers of rats that had been given the hypolipidemic drug clofibrate. Immunoblot analysis with anti-cytochrome P-450LA omega antibody revealed the presence of two clofibrate-induced cytochrome P-450 proteins in both liver and kidney. This antibody was used to screen a lambda gt11 expression library constructed from liver mRNA isolated from rats given clofibrate. The clone, pP-450LA omega, was isolated and found to contain 2062 base pairs with an open reading frame of 509 amino acids (Mr 58,222). The pP-450LA omega cDNA insert was placed in the yeast expression vector pAAH5, and the resultant plasmid expressed a protein of the same size and activity as cytochrome P-450LA omega. The mechanism of the regulation of the cytochrome P-450LA omega gene by hypolipidemic agents was examined. The rate of cytochrome P-450LA omega gene transcription was increased as early as 1 h after administration of clofibrate, and this increase was followed by an elevation of cytochrome P-450LA omega mRNA, immunochemically detectable protein, and cytochrome P-450LA omega activity. In contrast, no increase in transcriptional activity was detected after clofibrate administration for the cytochrome P-450PCN or P-450b/e genes. The cytochrome P-450LA omega has several structural features in common with other cytochrome P-450s, including a conserved cysteine-containing heme-binding fifth ligand fragment and a hydrophobic amino terminus. Overall, cytochrome P-450LA omega shared less than 35% cDNA nucleotide and amino acid similarity with cytochromes P-450c, P-450d, P-450e, and P-450PCN, indicating that it is a member of a new cytochrome P-450 gene family. Southern blot analysis indicates that this family contains two or three genes."
https://openalex.org/W1560656625,"The structures of the guanosine 5'O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-containing guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are distinct from those of the GDP-containing forms. One indication of the conformational change caused by GTP gamma S is a Mg2+-sensitive increase in the intensity of the proteins' tryptophan fluorescence (Higashijima, T., Ferguson, K.M., Sternweis, P.C., Ross, E.M., Smigel, M.D., Gilman, A.G. (1987), J. Biol. Chem., 262, 762-766). GTP causes a similar change in the fluorescence of Go, a G protein from bovine brain. When Mg2+ is also present, the increase in fluorescence is transient, and the rate of decline in the intensity of the fluorescence is the same as the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the protein. The steady-state rate of hydrolysis of GTP by Go (0.3-0.4/min) is slower than the catalytic rate of the protein (2/min), because the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the release of GDP."

https://openalex.org/W1543008345,"The short-term effects of ethanol on calcium homeostasis were studied in isolated hepatocytes. Ethanol caused a rapid transient activation of phosphorylase not associated with changes in cAMP levels which peaked after 20-30 s and declined slowly over a period of 5-10 min. Maximal activation was found with 200 mM ethanol, and a significant effect was observed at 25 mM ethanol. Similar effects were induced by other organic solvents and by halothane, with more hydrophobic agents being effective at lower concentrations. In hepatocytes loaded with the intracellular calcium indicator quin2, the addition of ethanol caused a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium, with a kinetic pattern compatible with its involvement in the activation of phosphorylase. Pretreatment of the hepatocytes with phenylephrine or vasopressin to deplete the hormone-sensitive calcium pools in the cells prevented the ethanol-induced calcium mobilization. In 32P-labeled hepatocytes addition of ethanol caused a small (5-7%) decrease in the level of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and a 10-15% increase in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and [32P]phosphatidic acid. In hepatocytes labeled with myo-[3H]inositol, ethanol induced a 50-100% increase in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and inositol bisphosphate. The changes in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level due to ethanol paralleled the time course of the elevation of cytosolic free calcium levels and activation of phosphorylase a. The effects of ethanol were comparable to those of a physiologic (1 nM) dose of vasopressin; however, unlike with vasopressin, the inositol phosphates and cytosolic calcium levels declined to basal levels 2 min after the addition of ethanol. These results indicate that ethanol, in common with calcium-mobilizing hormones, activates hormone-sensitive phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. The resulting changes in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate can account for the mobilization of intracellular calcium and the consequent activation of phosphorylase by ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1581237266,"Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) transduce a remarkably diverse group of extracellular signals to a relatively limited number of intracellular target enzymes. In the neutrophil, transduction of the signal following fMet-Leu-Phe receptor-ligand interaction is mediated by a pertussis toxin substrate (Gi) that activates inositol-specific phospholipase C. We have utilized a plasma membrane-containing fraction from unstimulated human neutrophils as the target enzyme to explore the role of G proteins in arachidonate and cytosolic cofactor-dependent activation of the NADPH-dependent O-2-generating oxidase. When certain guanine nucleotides or their nonhydrolyzable analogues were present during arachidonate and cytosolic cofactor-dependent activation, they exerted substantial dose-dependent effects. The GTP analogue, GTP gamma S, caused a 2-fold increase in NADPH oxidase activation (half-maximal stimulation, 1.1 microM). Either GDP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue, GDP beta S, inhibited up to 80% of the basal NADPH oxidase activation (Ki GDP = 0.12 mM, GDP beta S = 0.23 mM). GTP caused only slight and variable stimulation, whereas F-, an agent known to promote the active conformation of G proteins, caused a 1.6-fold stimulation of NADPH oxidase activation. NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system was absolutely and specifically dependent on Mg2+. Although O2- production in response to fMet-Leu-Phe was inhibited greater than 90% in neutrophils pretreated with pertussis toxin, cytosolic cofactor and target oxidase membranes from neutrophils treated with pertussis toxin showed no change in basal- or GTP gamma S-stimulated NADPH oxidase activation. Cholera toxin treatment of neutrophils also had no effect on the cell-free activation system. Our results suggest a role for a G protein that is distinct from Gs or Gi in the arachidonate and cytosolic cofactor-dependent NADPH oxidase cell-free activation system."

https://openalex.org/W1610293468,"Many cells (including angiotensin II target cells) respond to external stimuli with accelerated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generating 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a rapidly diffusible and potent Ca2+-mobilizing factor. Following its production at the plasma membrane level, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is believed to interact with specific sites in the endoplasmic reticulum and triggers the release of stored Ca2+. Specific receptor sites for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were recently identified in the bovine adrenal cortex (Baukal, A. J., Guillemette, G., Rubin, R., Spat, A., and Catt, K. J. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 133, 532-538) and have been further characterized in the adrenal cortex and other target tissues. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding sites are saturable and present in low concentration (104 +/- 48 fmol/mg protein) and exhibit high affinity for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Kd 1.7 +/- 0.6 nM). Their ligand specificity is illustrated by their low affinity for inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Kd approximately 10(-7) M), inositol 1-phosphate and phytic acid (Kd approximately 10(-4) M), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (Kd approximately 10(-3) M), with no detectable affinity for inositol 1-phosphate and myo-inositol. These binding sites are distinct from the degradative enzyme, inositol trisphosphate phosphatase, which has a much lower affinity for inositol trisphosphate (Km = 17 microM). Furthermore, submicromolar concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate evoked a rapid release of Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial ATP-dependent storage sites in the adrenal cortex. Specific and saturable binding sites for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were also observed in the anterior pituitary (Kd = 0.87 +/- 0.31 nM, Bmax = 14.8 +/- 9.0 fmol/mg protein) and in the liver (Kd = 1.66 +/- 0.7 nM, Bmax = 147 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein). These data suggest that the binding sites described in this study are specific receptors through which inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ in target tissues for angiotensin II and other calcium-dependent hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1517450192,"A cDNA library in lambda-phage lambda gt11 containing DNA inserts prepared from human liver mRNA was screened with monoclonal antibodies to human protein C inhibitor. Six positive clones were isolated from 6 X 10(6) phages and plaque purified. The cDNA in the phage containing the largest insert, which hybridized to a DNA probe prepared on the basis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature inhibitor, was sequenced. This cDNA insert contained 2106 base pairs coding for a 5'-noncoding region, a 19-amino acid signal peptide, a 387-amino acid mature protein, a stop codon, and a long 3'-noncoding region of 839 base pairs. Based on the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal peptide released by cleavage of protein C inhibitor by activated protein C as well as by thrombin, the reactive site peptide bond of protein C inhibitor is Arg354-Ser355. Five potential carbohydrate-binding sites were found in the mature protein. The high homology of the amino acid sequence of protein C inhibitor to the other known inhibitors clearly demonstrates that protein C inhibitor is a member of the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors including alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, antithrombin III, ovalbumin, and angiotensinogen. Based on the difference matrices for these proteins, we present possible phylogenetic trees for these proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1777982235,"In previous studies from this laboratory we isolated and characterized a 37-kDa protein that was associated with the membrane of erythroid cells. The polypeptide appeared to undergo a lineage-specific alteration in its interaction with the membrane during erythroid development and migrated as a family of isoelectric focusing variants during analyses on two-dimensional gels. We report here that the 37-kDa protein is homologous to the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12). This conclusion was reached from the results of several experimental approaches comparing the biochemical and genetic properties of the 37-kDa protein (p37) with authentic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Peptide maps of highly purified p37 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, generated with Staphylococcus V8 protease, were identical. The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone encoding p37 was nearly identical to the published sequence for genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that the interaction of the enzyme with the red cell membrane is more complex than previously envisioned. The existence of subpopulations of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase molecules is envisioned that exhibit different levels of enzyme activity and bind to the red cell membrane with varying affinities."
https://openalex.org/W1555929637,"The regulation of [Ca2+]i in rat pinealocytes was studied using the fluorescent indicator quin2. Pinealocyte resting [Ca2+]i was approximately 100 nM; this rapidly decreased in low Ca2+ medium (approximately 10 microM), indicating there was a high turnover of [Ca2+]i in these cells. Norepinephrine (NE, 10(-6) M) increased [Ca2+]i to approximately 350 nM within 1 min; [Ca2+]i then remained elevated for 30 min. The relative potency of adrenergic agonists was NE greater than phenylephrine much greater than isoproterenol. Phentolamine (10(-6) M) and prazosin (10(-8) M) blocked the effects of adrenergic agonists; in contrast, propranolol (10(-6) M) or yohimbine (10(-6) M) had little or no effect. These observations indicate NE acts via alpha 1-adrenoceptors to elevate [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i response to NE did not occur when [Ca2+]e was reduced to approximately 10 microM by adding EGTA 5s before NE, indicating an increase in net Ca2+ influx is involved rather than mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The effect of NE was not blocked by nifedipine (10(-6) M), which did block a K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, presumably involving voltage-sensitive channels. Ouabain (10(-5) M) caused a gradual increase in [Ca2+]i; this increase was not blocked by nifedipine. Together these data indicate that pinealocyte [Ca2+]i may be influenced by mechanisms regulated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and perhaps a Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism stimulated by ouabain. These studies indicate that the pinealocyte is an interesting model to use to study the adrenergic regulation of [Ca2+]i because of the rapid and prolonged changes in [Ca2+]i produced by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1497205192,"A large-scale preparation of the two-subunit protein complex (QPs) that converts succinate dehydrogenase into succinate-ubiquinone reductase from cytochrome b-c1 particles is achieved by a procedure involving Triton X-100 solubilization and calcium phosphate column chromatography at different pH values. The isolated two-subunit QPs contains 25 nmol of cytochrome b560/mg of protein and is able to reconstitute with soluble succinate dehydrogenase to form a TTFA-sensitive succinate-ubiquinone reductase. The maximum reconstitutive activity is 100 mumol of succinate oxidized per min per mg of QPs protein at 23 degrees C. Although cytochrome b560 in isolated QPs is not succinate reducible and its dithionite reduced form is reactive to carbon monoxide, cytochrome b560 is shown to be physically associated with succinate dehydrogenase by the following observations. The dithionite reduced form of cytochrome b560 in isolated QPs has a symmetrical alpha-absorption peak, which upon reconstitution with succinate dehydrogenase becomes slightly broadened and shows a shoulder at around 553 nm, identical to that of cytochrome b560 in succinate-ubiquinone reductase. Upon addition of succinate dehydrogenase to QPs, about 50% of the reduced form of cytochrome b560 in the QPs becomes insensitive to carbon monoxide treatment. The redox potential of cytochrome b560 in QPs is -144 mV which is higher than that of cytochrome b560 in succinate-ubiquinone reductase (-185 mV). Upon addition of succinate dehydrogenase, the redox potential of about 46% of the cytochrome b560 in QPs preparation becomes identical to that of cytochrome b560 in succinate-ubiquinone reductase. Cytochrome b560 in the QPs preparation shows two epr signals, g = 3.07 and g = 2.92, whereas cytochrome b560 in succinate-ubiquinone reductase exhibits only one epr signal at g = 3.46. When QPs is reconstituted with succinate dehydrogenase to form succinate-ubiquinone reductase, the g = 3.46 epr signal reappears at the expense of the g = 3.07 signal. Based on epr measurement at liquid helium temperature, about 18% of the total cytochrome b in the isolated active succinate-cytochrome c reductase is cytochrome b560, indicating that cytochrome b560 is indeed a unique cytochrome b and not a denatured product of cytochrome b562 or b565."

https://openalex.org/W1545991421,"We report the purification and localization of the fadL gene product (FLP), an essential component of the long-chain fatty acid transport machinery in Escherichia coli. FLP was extracted from total membranes by differential extraction with the nonionic detergents Tween 20 and Triton X-100. This protein was further purified from a Tween 20-insoluble-Triton X-100-soluble extract by salt fractionation, gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This regime results in a 95-fold purification of FLP from total membranes. The purified protein preparation was homogeneous based on silver staining and gave the characteristic behavior established for the fadL gene product in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate at different temperatures prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr of 33,000 when heated at 25 degrees C and Mr of 43,000 when heated at 100 degrees C) and on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (pI of 4.6 and a Mr of 33,000). Purified FLP was rich in hydrophobic residues accounting for approximately 45% of the total amino acid composition. To localize FLP, antisera were raised against the purified protein and were used to probe differentially fractionated membranes by Western immunoblotting. This procedure demonstrated the presence of this protein only in the outer membrane fraction of fadL+ strains. We confirmed the outer membrane localization of FLP by measuring long-chain fatty acid transport in fadL+ and fadL strains treated with EDTA to alter outer membrane permeability and in spheroplasts generated from fadL+ and fadL strains. Both EDTA-treated cells and spheroplasts transported long-chain fatty acids at essentially the same rate regardless of whether they contained a wild-type or mutant fadL gene. These data imply that FLP is a protein in the outer membrane which is specifically involved in long-chain fatty acid transport."
https://openalex.org/W1577701521,"The gene encoding the beta-subunit of rat thyrotropin (TSH beta) has been isolated and characterized. Blot hybridization of restriction enzyme digests of rat genomic DNA suggests that the gene is present in a single copy. The transcriptional unit is 4.9 kilobases in size representing 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns of 3.9 and 0.4 kilobases. Its nucleotide sequence reveals that the locations of the exon/intron junctions are one nucleotide upstream from the translational start and between codons +34 and +35. The location of the second intron is apparently strictly conserved among the glycoprotein hormone beta-subunit genes being four codons downstream from a region encoding a consensus sequence: Cys-Ala-Gly-Tyr. Using S1 nuclease mapping and oligonucleotide-primed reverse transcription of normal and thyroidectomized rat pituitary mRNA, two transcriptional start sites were identified in the rat TSH beta gene that are 28 and 71 nucleotides upstream from the translational start site. The level of TSH beta mRNA containing the downstream site is altered by thyroidal status whereas the other mRNA utilizing the upstream cap site appears to be constitutively expressed. Characteristic promoter elements are present in the 5'-flanking region including TATAAA or Goldberg-Hogness consensus regions which are present 29 and 26 bases upstream from the respective starts of transcription. Also, several CAAT boxlike sequences are located between 95 and 300 bases upstream from the start of translation. Isolation and characterization of the gene encoding the TSH beta gene will facilitate the study of the molecular mechanisms by which hormones regulate TSH beta gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1576360850,"As a step toward the molecular elucidation of the putative replicational apparatus associated with the nuclear matrix, we have investigated the possible matrix association of several replicational related enzymes. In addition to the previously identified DNA polymerase alpha, DNA primase, 3'-5' exonuclease, RNase H, and DNA methylase were all recovered at significant levels (20-30% of total nuclear activity) in nuclear matrix isolated from regenerating rat liver during maximal in vivo replication (22 h post-hepatectomy). In contrast, DNA ligase was not detected on the nuclear matrix even though significant activity was present in isolated nuclei. Examination of the replicative dependency of these enzyme activities following partial hepatectomy revealed pre-replicative elevations which were distinct for each matrix-bound enzyme. A second late-replicative peak in DNA methylase is consistent with a role of this matrix-bound enzyme in the maintenance of the inheritable methylation pattern. Mild sonication resulted in a significant release of all of these activities except RNase H. A major portion of the matrix-solubilized DNA polymerase alpha, DNA primase, 3'-5' exonuclease, and DNA methylase activities cosedimented on sucrose gradients between approximately 8-12 S. Our results are consistent with the organization of at least a portion of these replicative enzymes into nuclear matrix-bound replicational complexes. We also propose a novel pre-replicative assembly model of the matrix-bound replicational apparatus in which DNA primase plays an initial and critical role."
https://openalex.org/W1570895488,"The adk gene encoding adenylate kinase in Escherichia coli was cloned in pBR322. Adenylate kinase represented about 4% of total proteins in extracts of cells containing the pBR322:adk plasmid. This allowed preparation of more than 90% pure enzyme in a single-step purification procedure. Amino acid analysis, high performance liquid chromatography separation of trypsin digests, sequence analysis of most peptides, and determination of the N-terminal sequence of the whole protein confirmed the primary structure of E. coli adenylate kinase predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the adk gene (Brune, M., Schumann, R., and Wittinghofer, F. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 7139-7151). 2-Nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid reacted with the single cysteine residue of E. coli adenylate kinase. The cyanylated protein was cleaved upon exposure to alkaline pH, yielding two peptides corresponding to residues 1-76 and 77-214, respectively. A mixture of purified peptides tended to reassociate, recovering both catalytic activity and binding properties for adenine nucleotides. E. coli adenylate kinase has a broader specificity for nucleoside monophosphates than does the mammalian enzyme. In addition to 2'-dAMP, other nucleoside monophosphates such as 3'-dAMP, adenine-9-beta-D-arabinofuranoside 5'-monophosphate, and 7-deazaadenosine (tubercidine) 5'-monophosphate were able to replace AMP as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1593644339,"U6 RNA is an abundant, capped small nuclear RNA (snRNA) associated with hnRNP particles (Reddy, R., and Busch, H. (1983) Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 30, 127-162). Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles containing U4 and U6 RNAs are required components for splicing of pre-mRNAs (Berget and Robberson, 1986; Black and Steitz, 1986). In this study the Drosophila U6 RNA genes have been isolated and characterized. The Drosophila genome contains three U6 snRNA genes which are clustered in a 2-kilobase-pairs long DNA fragment. The U6 RNA coding regions are 100% homologous in all three genes, but the flanking sequences diverged significantly from each other. A possible secondary structure model for the Drosophila U4/U6 RNA complex is presented. Consistent with our previous observation that U6 RNA is a RNA polymerase III product (Reddy, R., Henning, D., Das, G., Harless, M., and Wright, D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 75-81), all three genes contained a region homologous to the consensus intragenic regulatory region and a cluster of T residues on the 3'-end, characteristic of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. A TATA box was found between nucleotides -23 and -31, and a stretch of 28 nucleotides from -43 to -71 was conserved in the 5'-flanking region of all three U6 RNA genes. The Drosophila U6 RNA genes were transcribed in vitro by Drosophila nuclear extracts but were not transcribed by Novikoff hepatoma or HeLa cell extracts. Similarly, a mouse U6 RNA gene was transcribed in Novikoff hepatoma or HeLa cell extracts but not in Drosophila nuclear extracts. These results suggest that species-specific factor(s) are involved in the transcription of U6 snRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1499003340,"Crude extracts of Clostridium acetobutylicum contain a butyrate kinase of high specific activity (5.2 mumol/min/mg of protein). The enzyme has been purified 77-fold in a six-step procedure to a specific activity of 402 mumol/min/mg of protein. The purified butyrate kinase showed a single band with a molecular weight of 85,000 on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme is a dimer of two apparently identical subunits with molecular weights of 39,000. The pH optimum for the reaction in the butyryl phosphate-forming direction is 7.5, and the pI of the kinase is 5.6. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is also reported. It contains no tryptophan and is low in sulfur-containing amino acids. The kinase has a broad substrate specificity and exhibits its highest relative activities with butyrate and valerate. Butyrate kinase is rapidly inactivated at 50 degrees C in the absence of a fatty acid substrate. Although a reducing agent was required for maximum activity, treatment with several sulfhydryl-modifying agents failed to inhibit the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1553323604,"The substrate specificity of different forms of polycation-stimulated (PCSH, PCSL, and PCSC) phosphorylase phosphatases and of the catalytic subunit of the MgATP-dependent protein phosphatase from rabbit skeletal muscle was investigated. This was done, with phosphorylase a as the reference substrate, using the synthetic phosphopeptides patterned after the phosphorylated sites of pyruvate kinase (type L) (Arg2-Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala (S2), and its Thr(32P) substitute (T4)), inhibitor-1 (Arg4-Pro-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T5), Arg2-Pro-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T1), and its Ser(32P) substitute (S1)), and some modified phosphopeptides (Arg2-Ala-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T2) and Arg2-Pro-Thr(32P)-Val-Ala (T3)), all phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, casein(Thr-32P), phosphorylated by casein kinase-2, was also tested. The PCS phosphatases show a striking preference for the T4 configuration, PCSC being the least efficient. The catalytic subunit of the MgATP-dependent phosphatase was almost completely inactive toward all these substrates. As shown for the PCSH phosphatase, and comparing with T4, the two proline residues flanking the Thr(P) in T1 and T5, just as in inhibitor-1, drastically imparied the dephosphorylation by lowering the Vmax and not by affecting the apparent Km. The C-terminal proline (as in T2) by itself represents a highly unfavorable factor in the dephosphorylation. The critical effect of the sequence X-Thr(P)-Pro or Pro-Thr(P)-Pro (T1, T2, T5, and inhibitor-1) can be overcome by manganese ions. The additional finding that this is not the case with the Pro-Ser(P)-Pro sequence (S1) suggests that the effect of Mn2+ is highly substrate specific. These observations show the considerable importance of the primary structure of the substrate in determining the specificity of the protein phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1524726064,"A Dictyostelium discoideum myosin heavy chain kinase has been purified 14,000-fold to near homogeneity. The enzyme has a Mr = 130,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and greater than 700,000 as determined by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m. The enzyme has a specific activity of 1 mumol/min X mg when assayed at a Dictyostelium myosin concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. A maximum of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin is incorporated by the kinase, and the phosphorylated amino acid is threonine. Phosphate is incorporated only into the myosin heavy chains, not into the light chains. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase of Dictyostelium myosin is inhibited 70-80% following maximal phosphorylation with the kinase. The myosin heavy chain kinase requires 1-2 mM Mg2+ for activity and is most active at pH 7.0-7.5. The activity of the enzyme is not significantly altered by the presence of Ca2+, Ca2+ and calmodulin, EGTA, cAMP, or cGMP. When incubated with Mg2+ and ATP, phosphate is incorporated into the myosin heavy chain kinase, perhaps by autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1503853334,"We have studied the structure and regulation of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) mRNA during mouse adipocyte and muscle cell differentiation. This message has a size of 2.8 kilobases that includes a coding segment of 1050 bases and a large untranslated 3' end of about 1700 bases. There is a high degree of amino acid homology (91%) between the mouse adipocyte and rabbit muscle GPD proteins. GPD mRNA is not detected in myoblasts, but, as in adipogenesis, it is expressed upon differentiation into myotubes. The modulation of GPD mRNA by cyclic AMP analogues and tumor necrosis factor has been examined in both adipocytes and myotubes. Dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP causes a large reduction of GPD mRNA levels in both cell types, with less than 20% remaining after 18 h of treatment. Tumor necrosis factor effects a dramatic and rapid reduction in GPD mRNA in fat cells and a slower but significant decrease in the level of this mRNA in muscle cells. These results indicate that GPD gene expression is linked to cell differentiation in both fat and muscle cells, and suggest certain similarities in hormonal modulation in both cell types."

L., Painter, G., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4852-4859). We now describe a membrane-bound kinase that phosphorylates the 4'-position of the above tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate product. The lipid A 4'-kinase is distinct from the diglyceride kinase of E. coli. When crude membrane preparations are employed, several nucleoside triphosphates are able to support the phosphorylation of the tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate, but ATP is the most efficient. The 4'-kinase requires Mg2+ and is stimulated by phospholipids, especially cardiolipin. Under optimal conditions the specific activity in crude extracts is 0.5 nmol/min/mg. The enzyme is rapidly inactivated by preincubation in the presence of detergents, such as Nonidet P-40 or octylglucoside, but phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerol stabilize the enzyme. The product generated in vitro has been characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Those analyses confirm that the 4' hydroxyl is the site of phosphorylation. The 4'-kinase reported here is likely to represent a key step in the de novo biosynthesis of lipid A."
https://openalex.org/W1510090986,"The [NiFe] hydrogenase isolated from Desulfovibrio gigas was poised at different redox potentials and studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The data firmly establish that this hydrogenase contains four prosthetic groups: one nickel center, one [3Fe-xS], and two [4Fe-4S] clusters. In the native enzyme, both the nickel and the [3Fe-xS] cluster are EPR-active. At low temperature (4.2 K), the [3Fe-xS] cluster exhibits a paramagnetic Mossbauer spectrum typical for oxidized [3Fe-xS] clusters. At higher temperatures (greater than 20 K), the paramagnetic spectrum collapses into a quadrupole doublet with parameters magnitude of delta EQ magnitude of = 0.7 +/- 0.06 mm/s and delta = 0.36 +/- 0.06 mm/s, typical of high-spin Fe(III). The observed isomer shift is slightly larger than those observed for the three-iron clusters in D. gigas ferredoxin II (Huynh, B. H., Moura, J. J. G., Moura, I., Kent, T. A., LeGall, J., Xavier, A. V., and Munck, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3242-3244) and in Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (Emptage, M. H., Kent, T. A., Huynh, B. H., Rawlings, J., Orme-Johnson, W. H., and Munck, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1793-1796) and may indicate a different iron coordination environment. When D. gigas hydrogenase is poised at potentials lower than -80 mV (versus normal hydrogen electrode), the [3Fe-xS] cluster is reduced and becomes EPR-silent. The Mossbauer data indicate that the reduced [3Fe-xS] cluster remains intact, i.e. it does not interconvert into a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Also, the electronic properties of the reduced [3Fe-xS] cluster suggest that it is magnetically isolated from the other paramagnetic centers."

This presequence targets subunit IV into mitochondria and is removed by a protease in the matrix space. Here we show that removal of as few as 4 amino-terminal residues from the subunit IV presequence (which had been attached to the cytosolic protein dihydrofolate reductase) blocks import of the protein into mitochondria and proteolytic removal of the presequence by the soluble matrix protease. Thus, this protease requires not only an appropriate cleavage site at the carboxy-terminal end of the presequence, but also information at the extreme amino terminus of the presequence."
https://openalex.org/W1516940749,"omega-Hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been reported in human and rodent polymorphonuclear leukocytes; preliminary information indicates that this metabolism is cytochrome P-450 dependent. Therefore, these studies were initiated to characterize the cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolism of LTB4 in other tissues. LTB4 was metabolized by rat hepatic microsomes to two products, 20-hydroxy(omega)-LTB4 and 19-hydroxy(omega-1)-LTB4. The formation of these metabolites was both oxygen and NADPH dependent indicating that a monooxygenase(s) was responsible for these reactions. The apparent Km and Vmax for LTB4 omega-hydroxylase were 40.28 microM and 1202 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. In contrast, the apparent Km and Vmax for LTB4 (omega-1)-hydroxylase were 61.52 microM and 73.50 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Both LTB4 omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylases were inhibited by metyrapone in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, SK&F 525A inhibited LTB4 (omega-1)- but not omega-hydroxylase. In contrast, alpha-naphthoflavone decreased LTB4 omega- but not (omega-1)-hydroxylase activities. The differences in the Km apparent for substrate as well as the differential inhibition by inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 suggest that the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylations of LTB4 in hepatic microsomes are mediated by different isozymes of P-450. Furthermore, several additional characteristics of LTB4 hydroxylases indicate that these isozymes of P-450 may be different from those which catalyze similar reactions on medium-chain fatty acids, such as laurate and prostaglandins."
https://openalex.org/W1651895013,"Retinoic acid, which induces the differentiation of HL 60 cells to granulocytes, produces a cell alkalinization from pHi = 7.03 to pHi = 7.37. The half-maximum effect of retinoic acid is observed at 10 nM. The effect of retinoic acid on the pHi develops slowly, and it precedes the differentiation of the cells. A cell alkalinization is also observed after differentiation of the cells by dimethyl sulfoxide. It is not observed using etretinate, a synthetic retinoid that does not promote the differentiation of HL 60 cells. Two pHi regulating mechanisms coexist in HL 60 cells. The Na+/H+ exchange system is the major mechanism that allows HL 60 cells to recover from an intracellular acidosis. A second mechanism is a Na-HCO3 cotransport system. During differentiation of the cells by retinoic acid, a 2-fold increase in the activity of the Na+/H+ exchange system is observed, while the activity of the NaHCO3 cotransport remains constant. The properties of interaction of the Na+/H+ exchanger with internal H+, external Na+, and Li+ as well as with amiloride and its derivatives are defined. The Na+/H+ exchanger of HL 60 cells is characterized by unusually low affinities for alkali cations and a high affinity for amiloride and its derivatives. The pHi dependence of the exchanger is not modified after differentiation by retinoic acid. It is concluded that the mechanism of activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by retinoic acid is distinct from the short-term effect produced by mitogens and phorbol esters which change the pHi dependence of the system."
https://openalex.org/W1516892790,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) has been shown to target nascent secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. In the wheat germ cell-free system, SRP arrests the elongation of the nascent chains until the translational complex is docked to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where the interaction between SRP and docking protein causes a release of the nascent chain arrest. For two secretory proteins, arrested peptides of 70 amino acids have been identified (Walter, P., Ibrahimi, I., and Blobel, G. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 91, 545-550; Meyer, D. I., Krause, E., and Dobberstein, B. (1982) Nature 297, 647-650). By using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system, we have analyzed SRP arrest and the resulting peptides of the two secretory proteins lysozyme and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the membrane protein invariant chain. SRP arrested the elongation of all three proteins at multiple sites, giving rise to ladders of arrested peptides. The size of the arrested peptides increased with the time of translation, resulting in mostly full-length pre-peptides after about 40 min. This suggests that SRP arrest in transient rather than stable. Upon addition of microsomes, the SRP arrest was released, and all the blocked peptides could be chased into mature proteins or full-length precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1537997858,"The chick 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor has been identified via immunoblot analysis and isolated to homogeneity via positive immunoselection and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytosolic extracts of intestinal mucosa, as well as purified samples highly enriched for receptor by nonimmunologic methodology were electrophoresed on denaturing gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed utilizing a purified monoclonal antibody against the chick receptor. Two protein signals were detected by this approach, a major species of 60,300 daltons and a minor form at 58,600 daltons. Both immunologically identified species were present in receptor-positive tissues but were absent in receptor-negative liver extracts. The two immunoreactive cytosolic proteins comigrated with two polypeptides detected via Coomassie Blue staining as well as by immunoblot analysis after enrichment utilizing DNA-cellulose, blue dextran-Sepharose, and other chromatographic separation techniques. Increasing concentrations of the minor form during purification suggest it arises from the larger molecular weight species via proteolysis. Finally, both forms of the receptor were isolated to near homogeneity employing positive immunoselection and each individually purified to homogeneity employing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These experiments show that the chick receptor exists as a major species of 60,300 as well as a minor form of 58,600 and that both forms can be purified to homogeneity via immunoaffinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1479866305,"We have characterized proteolytic fragments of the chick intestinal 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) receptor, produced through either exogenous or endogenous protease action, utilizing a variety of physical and functional assays coupled to immunoblot detection methodology. Treatment of intestinal cytosol with increasing concentrations of trypsin resulted in a progressive diminishment of the 60-kDa receptor concomitant with the appearance of a 20-kDa fragment reactive by Western blot analysis to an anti-1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor monoclonal antibody. Cleveland analysis supported the receptor-origin of this 20-kDa fragment: a common immunoreactive species of 12 kDa could be generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease treatment of the intact 60-kDa receptor as well as the 20-kDa proteolytic product. The 20-kDa fragment did not bind hormone but was capable of interacting with DNA-cellulose in a fashion identical to that of the 60-kDa receptor and, therefore, may contain the functional DNA-binding domain of the chick 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. Thus, this fragment likely represents the complement of a larger hormone-bound fragment that we have previously described (Allegretto, E. A., and Pike, J.W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10139-10145). In contrast to the exogenous effect of trypsin, incubation of cytosol resulted in the time-dependent formation of an endogenous protease-derived fragment of 45 kDa. Cleveland analysis was consistent with the 60-kDa receptor derivation of the 45-kDa fragment. This species retained the hormone-binding site and the antibody determinant but was devoid of DNA-binding activity. Moreover, it generated neither the trypsin-dependent 20-kDa fragment nor the V8 protease-dependent 12-kDa species and, therefore, was derived from the opposite end of the receptor molecule. These data have facilitated the construction of a schematic model of the chick receptor in which the immunoreactive epitope is located between the functional domains for hormone binding and DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1553798393,"We studied the effect of the carboxyl group-specific reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide on the Na+/H+ exchanger present in microvillus membrane vesicles isolated from rabbit renal cortices. Pretreatment of membrane vesicles with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide resulted in irreversible inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange which was not due to vesicle disruption or collapse of imposed pH gradients. Inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, resulted primarily from a decrease in binding affinity for substrate, was pH-dependent in a manner consistent with reaction with carboxyl groups, and was greater than inhibition by hydrophilic carbodiimides. Substrates Na+ and Li+ and the competitive inhibitor amiloride protected against inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a pH-dependent fashion. Finally, we demonstrated amiloride-sensitive covalent binding of radiolabeled dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to a 100-kDa protein. In conclusion, a catalytically important carboxyl group is located in a relatively hydrophobic microenvironment at or near the external transport site of the renal Na+/H+ exchanger; and the transporter itself, or a subunit thereof, may be a 100-kDa protein."

Transient expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin cDNA was observed between 48 and 70 h after transfection. Analysis of pro-opiomelanocortin-related material in COS-1 cell extracts and culture medium revealed that these cells synthesize and secrete constitutively pro-opiomelanocortin without further processing into its mature hormones. Our results suggest that COS-1 cells do not contain the necessary enzymatic machinery to process complex precursors such as pro-opiomelanocortin."

https://openalex.org/W1590810143,"ermC encodes a methylase that modifies 23 S rRNA, conferring resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics. The expression of this gene is induced by erythromycin using a translational mechanism. We have employed the inherent RNase activity of a Bacillus subtilis S-30 extract as a probe for studying the interaction of ribosomes with ermC mRNA in the presence of antibiotics. 5' end-labeled ermC runoff transcript is a substrate for this RNase activity, while the ribosome-bound region of the RNA appears to be protected. Erythromycin- and oleandomycin-dependent protection of fragments of length 79-81 was observed during the translation of end-labeled ermC transcript. This occurs only using unmethylated (erythromycin sensitive) ribosomes. Various other antibiotics including clindomycin, tylosin, and lincomycin do not show this specific protection. These effects parallel the in vivo specificity of ermC induction. The effect of erythromycin can be abolished by using oligonucleotides complementary to regions of the ermC transcript upstream from nucleotide 71 and not by using an oligonucleotide complementary to a region of ermC downstream from that position. These results are interpretable in terms of the translational attenuation model and demonstrate that erythromycin-bound ribosomes initiate translation of the leader peptide, stall upstream from nucleotide 80 on the ermC mRNA, and thus make the ribosome-binding site for methylase message available for ribosome interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1581525501,"The complete amino acid sequence of an aspartic protease from Rhizopus chinensis, rhizopuspepsin isozyme pI 5, has been determined. Partial sequences were first obtained from the isolated isozyme by a combination of chemical and proteolytic enzyme cleavages, peptide purifications, and Edman degradations. About one-half of the sequence was revealed by this approach. To complete the amino acid sequence, a cDNA library of R. chinensis in pBR322 was constructed. An oligonucleotide probe was synthesized based on the sequence Trp-Trp-Gly-Ile-Thr, and about 40 positive clones were identified by colony hybridization. A clone, 33E2, which had an insert size of about 1.1 kilobase pairs, was found to contain the entire coding region of rhizopuspepsin isozyme pI 5. The sequence of rhizopuspepsin contains 325 amino acid residues. The alignment of the rhizopuspepsin sequence against other aspartic proteases revealed expected homology, with the closest similarity to penicillopepsin which shares 39% identical residues. Porcine pepsin shares about 36% identical residues with rhizopuspepsin."
https://openalex.org/W1542367728,"We have used a Bacillus subtilis in vitro translation system to test the translational attenuation model for ermC regulation. The ermC gene product is known to methylate rRNA, rendering ribosomes unable to bind this antibiotic. We have shown that the induction of ermC methylase in vitro is post-transcriptional and specific for the macrolides erythromycin and oleandomycin. Erythromycin has no significant effect on the stability of the ermC transcript in vitro, and hence the post-transcriptional induction of methylase under these conditions occurs by stimulation of translation. The induction effect requires ribosomes able to bind erythromycin. By adding small proportions of unmethylated to a methylated extract in the presence of erythromycin, methylase synthesis could be induced. Conversely, when small amounts of methylated extracts were mixed with unmethylated extracts, methylase synthesis could be maintained at elevated levels in the presence of a high concentration of erythromycin. These effects were specific for the inducible ermC, were not observed with a constitutive variant, and could be explained satisfactorily by the translational attenuation model. The roles of three segments of the ermC leader in regulation were explored by probing with appropriate complementary synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. The induction effect of erythromycin was mimicked by using an oligonucleotide that could free the ribosome binding site for methylase."
https://openalex.org/W1528636870,"The regulation of phosphoinositide phosphorylation was studied in Swiss 3T3 cells that were stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Studies with intact cells showed that the mitogen increased the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-P2) during the cell cycle, with distinct peaks of incorporation for all three phosphoinositides after 1 h, and for PtdIns and PtdIns-P2 after 20 h. Direct measurements of the activities of PtdIns kinase and PtdIns-P kinase in freeze-thawed cells revealed that the activity of PtdIns kinase was rate-limiting for the synthesis of PtdIns-P2. Maximal activities of PtdIns kinase and PtdIns-P kinase, with exogenous substrates, were unchanged during the 1st h of PDGF treatment, but doubled during the next 24 h. The increase in PtdIns kinase activity began within 2-4 h, exceeded the increase in cell protein, and was abolished by cycloheximide, which suggests that the enzyme was induced specifically in response to PDGF. The increase in activity of PtdIns-P kinase paralleled the increase in cell protein. Dose-response curves for PDGF showed that the activities of PtdIns kinase and PtdIns-P kinase at 24 h increased in proportion to the extent of mitogenic stimulation of the cells. Our results support the conclusion that the activities of PtdIns kinase and PtdIns-P kinase increase in response to PDGF, but only after several hours of cell cycle traverse."
https://openalex.org/W1540637195,"As HL-60 cells matured along the granulocytic pathway, phorbol diester-induced superoxide anion production was compared to phorbol diester-induced protein phosphorylation using an in vitro phosphorylation technique. Maturation was induced by 0, 2, 4, or 6 days incubation with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In 0 day Me2SO HL-60 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced phosphorylation of protein pp29 (Mr = 28,600) and to a lesser extent protein pp76 (Mr = 76,300). With increased time of Me2SO incubation, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced phosphorylation of pp212 (Mr = 211,800), pp134 (Mr = 134,200), and pp76, whereas the phosphorylation of pp29 did not change appreciably. In close agreement with this increase in protein phosphorylation was the observed increase in phorbol diester-induced superoxide anion formation. Morphological characterization of cells during Me2SO-induced differentiation reveals that these increases in phorbol diester responses are probably attributable to the proportional rise in metamyelocytes, band, and segmented neutrophils. A variety of phorbol diesters increased superoxide anion generation in HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocyte-like cells by 6-day incubation with Me2SO. The structure-activity relationship of these phorbol diester derivatives for protein phosphorylation was strongly correlated to their ability to increase superoxide anion generation. Thus, we propose that phorbol diester-induced phosphorylation of pp212, pp134, and pp76, but not pp29 may play a role in mediating the functional response of phorbol diester-induced superoxide anion generation in HL-60 cells differentiated into mature granulocyte-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W1503582968,"The mitogenic effect of thyrotropin on functional rat thyroid cells of the line FRTL-5 is correlated with membrane lipid fluidity as evaluated by fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Continued exposure of FRTL-5 cells to a medium lacking thyrotropin causes cessation of cell proliferation and a decrease in membrane lipid fluidity which reaches its minimum in approximately 8 days. The change in lipid fluidity is due to an absolute increase (greater than 2-fold) of membrane cholesterol, with an increased cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and an increased ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of the membrane phospholipids, contributed primarily by a nearly 4-fold increase in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated C16 fatty acids. It is also associated with a variation of the relative proportions of the major membrane phospholipids; thus, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine decrease while phosphatidylcholine increases. Both membrane fluidity and lipid composition can be restored by thyrotropin to their original levels, i.e. levels measured under continuous exposure to the hormone. Complete reversal requires at least 48 h, i.e. approximately the same time required for resumption of growth when FRTL-5 cells, starved in thyrotropin, are re-exposed to the hormone. Changes in lipid composition and fluidity can be prevented or can be reversed if FRTL-5 cells are exposed to dibutyryl cAMP while being deprived of thyrotropin. Dibutyryl cAMP has only a modest direct effect on growth; however, this pretreatment eliminates the 48-h lag phase with respect to thyrotropin stimulation. It is proposed that the effects of thyrotropin on growth of FRTL-5 cells requires a modification of the molecular structure and the physical state of cell membranes, which can be mediated by cAMP, although cAMP is not sufficient by itself to promote growth."
https://openalex.org/W1488779322,"In rabbit platelet membranes, the contents of alkenylacyl phospholipids (plasmalogen) were 56% of phosphatidylethanolamine and 3% of phosphatidylcholine. This uneven distribution of plasmalogens in each phospholipid class could be attributed to the different substrate specificity of ethanolaminephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.1) and cholinephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.2). The properties of the enzymes were studied, using endogenous diglycerides and CDP-[3H]ethanolamine or CDP-[14C]choline as substrates. The newly formed phospholipids were mainly diacyl and alkenylacyl and only rarely alkylacyl type. The ratios of the labeled alkenylacyl to diacyl type of phospholipids clearly varied with the concentrations of CDP-ethanolamine or CDP-choline. When 1, 10, and 30 microM CDP-[3H]ethanolamine were used, the labeled phospholipids contained 53, 37, and 27% of the alkenylacyl type, respectively. The apparent Km for CDP-ethanolamine to synthesize alkenylacyl and diacyl types were 2.2 and 8.1 microM. On the other hand, when 1, 10, and 30 microM CDP-[14C]choline were used, the labeled lipids contained 10, 17, and 24% alkenylacyl type, respectively. The apparent Km for CDP-choline to synthesize alkenylacyl and diacyl types were 24 and 4.3 microM. Further, the syntheses of diacyl type of phosphatidylethanolamine and the alkenylacyl type of phosphatidylcholine were markedly inhibited by unlabeled CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, respectively. The two enzymes had opposite substrate specificities, and ethanolaminephosphotransferase showed a high preference to plasmalogen synthesis, especially in the presence of CDP-choline."
https://openalex.org/W1505334286,"The Na/K—ATPase is a membrane-bound enzyme system found in all eucaryotic cells. This enzyme regulates Na and K concentrations and energy metabolism, as well as controlling the transport of other cellular constituents. The Na/K—ATPase has been isolated to about 90% purity in a membrane-bound form from kidney outer medulla by detergent extraction (Jorgenson et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 694:27). The pure enzyme consists of two major subunits: the catalytic subunit (a) having an estimated molecular weight of 90 to 120K, and another subunit of unknown function (β) with molecular weight estimated as 45 to 65K. The stoichiometry of the subunits has been the subject of some debate. However, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the ratio of subunits (α/β) is 1/1, and the enzyme exists as a dimer in vivo (α2, β2). Analysis of low-angle neutron scattering from a solution containing detergent-solublized membrane protein provides a direct method of determining molecular weight and radius of gyration of a membrane protein. In this study, a purified Na/K—ATPase preparation from guinea pig outer medulla was first solubilized with the nonionic detergent Brij 58 (a polyoxyethylene ether) at a weight ratio of 5 mg detergent/mg protein. The purified protein was further delipidated by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE in the presence of 0.2% Brij 58. The ATPase-Brij complex preserved 30% of the original membrane-bound Na/K—ATPase activity at Vmax. Contrast matching by varying the H2O/D2O ratio of the detergent-protein solution was used to eliminate the scattering contribution of the detergent. The scattering intensity at zero angle for a set of proteins of known molecular weight was derived experimentally; the molecular weight of the Na/K—ATPase was thus determined to be 385 to 421K by measuring the zero-angle scattering intensity from the protein-detergent complex at the contrast match-point of the detergent. The radius of gyration of the Na/K—ATPase was found to be 76.2 A. The molecular weight and radius of gyration indicate that the Na/K—ATPase is in the dimer form (α2, β2) in this micellar preparation.

In the cold, the association was characterized as reversible binding to the spheroplast surface. At 37 degrees C, the association became irreversible due to fusion of the viral envelope with the yeast plasma membrane according to the following data. Proteinase K digestion degraded the viral envelope glycoprotein G but left the internal N and M proteins of VSV intact and associated with the spheroplasts. The plasma membrane could be stained by indirect immunofluorescent labeling using antiserum against VSV. By immunoelectron microscopy, no VSV particles could be detected at the spheroplast surface. Instead, the G protein could be visualized at the external aspect of the plasma membrane using specific antiserum and protein A-gold. Fusion of VSV with spheroplasts occurred below pH 4.75 at temperatures of 30-42 degrees C. It was strictly dependent on the prior removal of the yeast cell wall. The fusion process was fast, calcium-independent, and nonleaky, leaving the spheroplasts viable for at least 4 h. On the average, less than 100 VSV particles could be fused per one spheroplast.
