https://openalex.org/W1497435349,"We have previously investigated the interaction of macrophages with red blood cells (RBC) displaying phosphatidylserine (PS) in their surface membranes after the transfer of the fluorescent lipid analog 1-acyl-2-[(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)aminocaproyl] phosphatidylserine to the RBC (Tanaka, Y., and Schroit, A. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11335-11343). This derivative, which is rapidly transferred to the RBC at 37 degrees C, results in the efficient binding and phagocytosis of the RBC by autologous macrophages. In the present study, we show that 51Cr-labeled RBC containing [(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-aminododecanoyl]phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) are rapidly cleared from the peripheral circulation of syngeneic mice and accumulate in the liver and spleen. Fluorescence microscopy of Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages isolated from the liver and spleens of these animals revealed phagocytosed fluorescent RBC, suggesting the clearance was probably due to endocytosis of the RBC. The accumulation of these RBC in the spleen was dramatic, with approximately 30% of the injected cells localizing in this organ within 60 min. In contrast, the intravenous injection of RBC containing similar amounts of NBD-phosphatidylcholine or NBD-phosphatidylglycerol did not result in clearance which differed significantly from control (untreated) RBC populations. The observed clearance of NBD-PS-containing RBC was much different than the clearance of opsonized RBC which preferentially localized in the liver. These findings show that PS in RBC can serve as a signal for triggering their in vivo recognition and concomitant elimination from the circulation and suggest that the exposure of endogenous PS in the outer leaflet of RBC which occurs in certain pathological conditions could trigger their removal from the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W1590831713,"The frequency and specificity of mutations produced in vitro by eucaryotic DNA polymerase-beta have been determined in a forward mutation assay using a 250-base target sequence in M13mp2 DNA. Homogeneous DNA polymerase-beta, isolated from four different sources, produces mutations at a frequency of 4-6%/single round of gap-filling DNA synthesis. DNA sequence analyses of 460 independent mutants resulting from this error-prone DNA synthesis demonstrate a wide variety of mutational events. Frameshift and base substitutions are made at approximately equal frequency and together comprise about 90% of all mutations. Two mutational hot spots for frameshift and base substitution mutations were observed. The characteristics of the mutations at these sites suggest that certain base substitution errors result from dislocation of template bases rather than from direct mispair formation by DNA polymerase-beta. When considering the entire target sequence, single-base frameshift mutations occur primarily in runs of identical bases, usually pyrimidines. The loss of a single base occurs 20-80 times more frequently than single-base additions and much more frequently than the loss of two or more bases. Base substitutions occur at many sites throughout the target, representing a wide spectrum of mispair formations. Averaged over a large number of phenotypically detectable sites, the base substitution error frequency is greater than one mistake for every 5000 bases polymerized. Large deletion mutations are also observed, at a frequency more than 10-fold over background, indicating that purified DNA polymerases alone are capable of producing such deletions. These data are discussed in relation to the physical and kinetic properties of the purified enzymes and with respect to the proposed role for this DNA polymerase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1512639331,"In a study of the binding stoichiometry of various metals to rat liver metallothionein, the protein appears to coordinate metals in 2 distinct configurations. Ions of at least 18 different metals were shown to associate with the protein suggesting that there is little specificity in binding. Most metals exhibited saturation binding at 7 mol eq forming M7-metallothionein. These included Bi(III), Cd(II), Co(II), Hg(II), In(III), Ni(II), Pb(II), Sb(III), and Zn(II). Others metals including Os(III), Pd(II), Pt(IV), Re(V), Rh(III), and Tl(III) give a positive indication of binding, but stoichiometries were unclear. Ag(I) and Cu(I) bound in clusters as M12-metallothionein. This binding stoichiometry was determined in 3 ways: (a) by determining the equivalence point in Cu- and Ag-titrated samples where resistance to proteolysis is maximal; (b) by determining the point where Zn ions are completely displaced from Zn7-metallothionein; and (c) by direct binding studies. Ag-reconstituted protein, recovered from gel filtration, had an average Ag content of 11.5 g atoms/mol of protein. A similar stoichiometry for the Cu-protein resulted from displacement of Zn from Zn7-metallothionein by Cu(I). The M12-protein was converted to the M7-protein by displacement of Ag(I) or Cu(I) with 7 mol eq of Hg(II). Whereas the distribution of metals in the 2 domains of M7-metallothionein is M4 alpha and M3 beta, the arrangement in the M12-molecule is probably M6 alpha and M6 beta. We propose that metallothionein ligates Ag(I) and Cu(I) in a trigonal geometry by bridging thiolates. This is in contradistinction to a tetrahedral binding geometry in the M7-protein. Distinct binding configurations may result in different tertiary structures for M7- and M12-proteins which may relate to metabolic specificity of Zn-metallothionein and Cu-metallothionein, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1595843384,"Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in culture is accompanied by alterations in the abundance of several mRNAs and by the appearance of many new adipocyte-specific mRNAs. To investigate the processes responsible for these alterations, the kinetics of accumulation of several specific mRNAs were compared with their respective rates of nuclear runoff transcription. The mRNAs for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and an unidentified 4800-base mRNA increase in abundance only moderately (2-4-fold) during differentiation. Runoff transcription by nuclei isolated from 3T3-L1 cells during the course of differentiation revealed very little or no change in the rates of transcription of these mRNAs. Similar results were obtained for the beta, alpha-actin and beta-tubulin mRNAs where no difference in nuclear runoff transcription rates were observed even though a 2-fold decrease in the steady-state levels of these mRNAs accompanies differentiation. In contrast, the steady-state levels of mRNAs for 3T3-L1 P2 protein, an adipocyte homologue of myelin P2 protein, and an unidentified 5000-base mRNA increased dramatically (greater than 20-fold) during adipose conversion. These large increases in abundance were correlated with marked rises (greater than 10-fold) in nuclear runoff transcription rates for these mRNAs during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. No change in runoff transcription activity for these mRNAs was detected by nuclei from control nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells. These results strongly suggest that an increased rate of specific transcription is primarily responsible for the accumulation of these mRNAs during preadipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2156691397,"The membrane form of Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (mfVSG) is acylated with ester-linked tetradecanoic (myristic) acid (Ferguson, M. A. J., and Cross, G. A. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3011-3015). Comparative analysis of Pronase peptides from mfVSG and soluble VSG localizes the site of mfVSG acylation to a COOH-terminal oligosaccharide structure. Chemical and enzymatic treatment of the acylated Pronase mfVSG fragment revealed that the myristic acid is present as a diglyceride (sn-1,2-dimyristin) that is probably linked to the COOH-terminal oligosaccharide via a phosphodiester bond between the sn-3-glycerol hydroxyl and a sugar hydroxyl group. The endogenous membrane-associated enzyme, which quantitatively cleaves myristic acid from mfVSG to produce soluble VSG, releases diglyceride, as would be expected of a phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W2052975271,"Proto-onc genes are normal cellular genes that are related to the transforming (onc) genes of retroviruses. Because of this relationship these genes are now widely believed to be potential cancer genes. In some tumors, proto-onc genes are mutated or expressed more than in normal cells. Under these conditions, proto-onc genes are hypothesized to be active cancer genes in one of two possible ways: The one gene-one cancer hypothesis suggests that one activated proto-onc gene is sufficient to cause cancer. The multigene-one cancer hypothesis suggests that an activated proto-onc gene is a necessary but not a sufficient cause of cancer. However, mutated or transcriptionally activated proto-onc genes are not consistently associated with the tumors in which they are occasionally found and do not transform primary cells. Further, no set of an activated proto-onc gene and a complementary cancer gene with transforming function has yet been isolated from a tumor. Thus, there is still no proof that activated proto-onc genes are sufficient or even necessary to cause cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2108682052,"We have carried out a study of the reaction of 13-hydroperoxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid hydroperoxide) with hematin. The major products are erythro-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, threo-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid, 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid. Several minor products have also been identified, including 9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, 11-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid, and 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid. Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the observed products arise by at least two pathways. In the major pathway, hematin reduces 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid by one electron to an alkoxyl radical that cyclizes to an adjacent double bond to form an epoxy allylic radical. The allylic radical either couples to the hydroxyl radical coordinated to hematin or diffuses from the solvent cage and couples to O2, forming a peroxyl radical. In the minor pathway, the hydroperoxide is oxidized by one electron to a 13-peroxyl radical that undergoes beta-scission to a pentadienyl radical and O2. Exchange of hydroperoxide-derived O2 for dissolved O2 occurs at this stage followed by coupling of O2 to either terminus of the pentadienyl radical. Both pathways of hydroperoxide metabolism generate significant quantities of peroxyl radicals that epoxidize the isolated double bonds of dihydroaromatic molecules. The products of hydroperoxide reaction with hematin and the oxygen labeling patterns are very similar to the products of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolism by platelets, aorta, and lung. Our results not only provide a mechanism for the formation of a series of mammalian metabolites of linoleic and arachidonic acids but also offer an estimate of the yield of peroxyl radicals generated during the process."
https://openalex.org/W1598464999,"The monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) obtained from the lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella minnesota R595 was fractionated on a silicic acid column to yield the heptaacyl, hexaacyl, and pentaacyl MLA. Each of these MLAs was methylated with diazomethane to yield the dimethyl derivative and purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular ions obtained by positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of purified dimethyl heptaacyl MLA allowed us to establish the molecular formula and Mr of C112H211N2O23P and 1983.3, respectively. Cleavage at the glycosidic linkage yielded an oxonium ion of mass 1115, which showed that the distal sugar unit contained one phosphate (dimethyl), two hydroxymyristates, one laurate, and one myristate, while the reducing sugar unit contained two hydroxymyristates and one palmitate. By utilizing two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, we were able to assign all of the protons of dimethyl heptaacyl MLA. This assignment included the beta protons of the three acyloxyacyl groups. A substantial downfield shift of the protons at the 3- and 3' -carbons was observed, which indicated that these two positions are occupied by ester groups. Fast atom bombardment mass spectral analysis of the hexaacyl and pentaacyl MLAs showed that these structures were identical to the previously designated TLC-3 and TLC-5 fractions, respectively, from Salmonella typhimurium. From this study, the complete structures of the MLA series found in the LPS of S. minnesota can now be described."
https://openalex.org/W1589065898,"Rat liver microsomes were discovered to actively oxidize retinol to polar metabolites, including 4-hydroxyretinol, in a system requiring oxygen and NADPH. Involvement of cytochrome P-450 was indicated by CO and SKF-525A inhibition and reconstitution of this system with purified forms of cytochrome P-450 (b and f). Addition of excess unlabeled retinoic acid did not decrease the specific activity of the products formed from labeled retinol, suggesting that retinoic acid is not involved as an intermediate step. Microsomal inducers (such as phenobarbital) strikingly enhanced the activity of the system, resulting in 5-10-fold increased rates of retinol degradation. Furthermore, microsomal substrates (such as benzphetamine) inhibited microsomal retinol metabolism. This new pathway of retinol metabolism in liver microsomes may explain, at least in part, vitamin A-drug interactions, including drug-induced hepatic depletion of vitamin A."

https://openalex.org/W1553918158,"Most previous studies on inhibitors of lysosomal protein breakdown have been performed on isolated or cultured cells or on perfused organs. We have tested various inhibitors of proteolysis on lysosomes isolated from livers of rats injected with [14C]leucine 15 min (short labeling time) and 16 h (long labeling time) before killing. Intact lysosomes were incubated with different inhibitors (leupeptin, propylamine, E-64, pepstatin, and chloroquine) in increasing concentrations. None of these caused more than a 40-75% inhibition of proteolysis irrespective of labeling protocol. Chloroquine was the most effective inhibitor, followed by leupeptin, propylamine, E-64, and pepstatin. When lysosomes were incubated with various combinations of inhibitors, including a weak base and an enzyme inhibitor, a somewhat higher inhibition (86%) was obtained. To assess if lysosomes are active in the degradation of both short and long lived proteins, lysosomes were isolated from livers of rats labeled with [14C]leucine for various time intervals. The highest fractional proteolytic rates were seen for short lived proteins. If the recovery of the isolated lysosomes is taken into consideration, about 80% (short labeling time) and 90% (long labeling time) of the total proteolysis in the homogenate could be accounted for by lysosomes. Isolated Golgi, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions displayed negligible proteolytic activities. The cytosol contributed one-fifth of the total protein breakdown of short lived proteins, whereas insignificant proteolysis was recovered in the cytosolic fraction following long time labeling. Accordingly, we propose that 1) lysosomal inhibitors do not completely suppress proteolysis in isolated lysosomes and that 2) both short and long lived proteins are degraded in lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1589382058,"The C57BL/6N inbred mouse cytochrome P1-450 and P3-450 genes, two genes in the same family and under control by the Ah receptor, have been completely sequenced. The transcription initiation sites were confirmed by primer extension studies. An additional 823 and 893 bp of the 5' upstream flanking regions of P1-450 and P3-450, respectively, and 1771 and 1251 bp of the 3' downstream flanking regions of P1-450 and P3-450, respectively, were sequenced and studied. P1-450 exons total 2619 nucleotides, and the gene spans 6215 bp. P3-450 exons total 1892 nucleotides, and the gene spans 6716 bp. Three interesting highly homologous regions of 11 or 12 bp, upstream between -280 and -530 from the cap site of both genes, are noted as possible candidates for binding by the inducer-Ah receptor complex (and/or other DNA-binding regulatory proteins). Several stretches of DNA upstream from the cap site, in several introns, and in the 3' flanking region of both genes have a high degree of homology with known core enhancer sequences. Other interesting stretches (DNA with Z-DNA-forming properties, DNA with recombinational potential, highly repetitive and middle repetitive sequences between 50 and 360 bp in length, and simple sequences presumably having no function in gene expression) exist throughout many of the introns and flanking regions in both the positive and negative strands of both genes. The mouse 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible and rat phenobarbital-inducible P-450 genes were compared for the amino acid residue number at each exon-intron junction, the location in the coding triplet at which the exons are split, and homologies among introns and exons. It can be shown that these two gene families probably diverged from a common ancestor more than 200 million years ago and that P1-450 and P3-450 split from each other about 65 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1537759294,"The domain structure of human fibronectins isolated from plasma and from the conditioned medium of normal and transformed fibroblasts was analyzed by limited proteolysis and S-cyanylation followed by immunostaining of released fragments with five kinds of antibodies, each specific for one functional domain. The results indicate that all three human fibronectins are composed of the same set of functional domains aligned in the same topological order. However, the following clear differences were found in specific fragments released from plasma fibronectin (pFN) and those released from fibronectin of normal (N-cFN) and transformed fibroblasts (T-cFN). Two fragments (Mr = 70,000 and 60,000) were released from the COOH-terminal region of pFN by cathepsin D. These fragments represent the COOH-terminal heparin-binding (Hep-2) and fibrin-binding (Fib-2) domains. The corresponding fragments released from both N-cFN and T-cFN by cathepsin D had much larger molecular weights (Mr = 100,000 and 83,000-74,000) than those from pFN. The fragments from the Fib-2 domain alone, however, did not show any difference among all three FNs. The internal region, from the gelatin-binding (Gel) domain through the Hep-2 domain, of N-cFN and T-cFN was released as a Mr = 210,000 fragment upon mild trypsin digestion. The corresponding fragment from pFN was released as a Mr = 185,000 fragment. The COOH-terminal half, including the Hep-2 domain, of both N-cFN and T-cFN was released by S-cyanylation as Mr = 160,000-145,000 fragments, which are 25,000-20,000 larger than the corresponding fragments of pFN. These results clearly indicate that the Hep-2 domain of N-cFN and T-cFN is 30,000-20,000 daltons larger than the same domain of pFN. Although various fragments released from N-cFN and T-cFN showed a similar pattern, there were minor differences. Thermolysin fragments derived from the Hep-2 domain of N-cFN were clearly distinguishable from those from T-cFN. Three groups of fragments with Mr = 40,000, 35,000-32,000, and 30,000 were released from N-cFN, while only the 35,000-32,000 fragment was released from T-cFN. The Mr = 44,000/60,000 thermolysin fragments representing the Gel domain and the Mr = 210,000/165,000 tryptic fragments representing the internal domains of T-cFN were slightly, but consistently, larger than those of N-cFN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1589721097,"The complete covalent structure of the constitutive cytochrome P-450, form 3b, from rabbit liver microsomes was determined. The apocytochrome contains 490 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain, Mr = 55,860. Peptides from selective chemical and proteolytic cleavages were isolated by a combination of gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Overlapping peptide sequences were used to deduce the complete sequence. The constitutive form is only 46% homologous to the phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P-450 (Heinemann, F. S., and Ozols, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4195-4201) and contains a deletion at position 22. Strongly conserved regions include Cys435 and a previously identified tryptic peptide, residues 345-357. The distribution of hydrophobic segments is used to predict the membrane topology of the protein, and four possible orientations of this protein in the membrane are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1887457172,"Subunit interactions in the band 3 protein of the human red blood cell membrane have been examined by a combination of cross-linking, chemical labeling, and in situ proteolysis. In agreement with Staros (Staros, J. V. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 3950-3955), we find that the membrane-impermeant active ester bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BSSS) cross-links band 3 in intact cells to a dimer, with no formation of higher oligomer. Combined cross-linking of the outer surface with BSSS and the cytoplasmic domain with Cu2+/o-phenanthroline does not produce significant covalent tetramer of band 3 (beyond that produced by Cu2+/o-phenanthroline alone). Therefore, the membrane domains and cytoplasmic domains of the same pair of subunits are cross-linked to each other. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (H2DIDS) is known to form a covalent cross-link between complementary chymotryptic fragments (Mr 60,000 and 35,000). Edman degradation of band 3 from H2DIDS/chymotrypsin-treated cells shows that the H2DIDS cross-link is between fragments of the same subunit. In contrast, BSSS forms both intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links between complementary chymotryptic fragments. No intermolecular cross-links between two 35,000-dalton or two 60,000-dalton fragments are detectable. We have localized one end of the BSSS intermolecular cross-link to within 4 residues of the exofacial chymotrypsin cleavage site. The polypeptide sequence on each side of the site suggests that hydrophobic membrane-crossing segments emerge at the cell surface near the site of intermolecular cross-linking. This is the first detailed information available on the regions of the band 3 primary structure near the interface between subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1601302393,"A CMP-NeuAc:Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-R alpha 2----3-sialyltransferase has been purified over 20,000-fold from a Triton X-100 extract of human placenta by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and CDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose in a yield of 10%. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed that the enzyme consists of a major polypeptide species with a molecular weight of 41,000 and some minor forms with molecular weights of 40,000, 43,000, and 65,000, respectively, which can be resolved partially by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Isoelectric focusing revealed that the enzyme occurs in a major and a minor charged form with pI values of 5.0-5.5 and 6.0, respectively. Acceptor specificity studies indicated that the enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of sialic acid from CMP-NeuAc into glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides which possess a terminal Gal beta----3GalNAc unit. Analysis of the structure of the product chain by high-pressure liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography as well as methylation analysis revealed that a NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAc sequence is elaborated. The best glycoprotein acceptors are antifreeze glycoprotein and porcine submaxillary asialo/afucomucin. The disaccharide Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-Thr shows values for Km and V which are close to those of the latter glycoprotein. Lactose as well as oligosaccharides in which galactose is linked beta 1----3 or beta 1----4 to N-acetylglucosamine are less efficient acceptors. Of the glycolipids tested only gangliosides GM1 and GD1b served as an acceptor. The enzyme does not show an absolute aglycon specificity, and attaches sialic acid regardless the anomeric configuration of the N-acetylgalactosaminyl residue in the accepting Gal beta 1----3GalNAc unit. By use of specific acceptor substrates it could be demonstrated that the purified enzyme is free from other known sialyltransferase activities. Studies with rabbit antibodies raised against a partially purified sialyltransferase preparation indicated that the enzyme is immunologically unrelated to a Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc-R alpha 2----3-sialyltransferase, which previously had been identified in human placenta (Van den Eijnden, D.H., and Schiphorst, W. E. C. M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3159-3162). Initial-rate kinetic studies suggest that the sialyltransferase operates through a mechanism involving a ternary complex of enzyme, sugar donor, and acceptor. This is the first report on the extensive purification and characterization of a sialyltransferase from a human tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1509567174,"The in vivo affinity of human apolipoprotein A-IV (apo-A-IV) for plasma lipoproteins is considerably less than that of other apolipoproteins. We have therefore studied its spectroscopic properties and its association with model chylomicrons to investigate its structural characteristics and to define their influence upon its affinity for lipids. Fluorescence emission spectra of apo-A-IV in dilute aqueous solution revealed that its single tryptophan residue resides in a pH-sensitive hydrophobic domain, which is maximally protected from iodide quenching at pH 7.5. Denaturation of apo-A-IV by guanidine hydrochloride caused a multiphasic fluorescence emission red shift, with an unusual enhancement of quantum yield. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of apo-A-IV demonstrated negative ellipticity maxima at 210 and 222 nm, consistent with 54% alpha-helical structure. The alpha-helicity of apo-A-IV as measured by [theta]222 was also pH-sensitive and displayed a distinctive decrease between pH 7.0 and 8.0. Apo-A-IV was exquisitely sensitive to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride, and its estimated free energy of stabilization in aqueous solution was near zero. Apo-A-IV bound to the surface of Sf greater than 400 particles of a phospholipid-triglyceride emulsion in a noncooperative, concentration-dependent manner. The affinity of apo-A-IV for these model chylomicrons was influenced by changes in pH or addition of guanidine hydrochloride in a manner which correlated well with the structural changes observed under similar conditions. We conclude that human apolipoprotein A-IV possesses several biophysical properties characteristic of the better studied plasma apolipoproteins, yet, apo-A-IV appears to be marginally stable in aqueous solution and its structural characteristics and lipid binding properties are particularly sensitive to environment."
https://openalex.org/W1985490240,"Peripheral transection of the sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve in rats unbalanced palatability, selectively reducing the ingestive actions elicited by preferred tastes but leaving unchanged the aversive actions elicited by unpreferred tastes. The reduction in the number of positive ingestive actions occurred even though the capacity to emit these actions remained unimpaired. These findings show that there is an interaction between somatosensation and gustation in the processing of palatability."
https://openalex.org/W1487411642,"Human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase also converts lysolecithin to lecithin in the presence of low density lipoproteins. To understand the physiological importance of this lysolecithin acyltransferase reaction, we investigated the molecular species of lysolecithin available for acylation in normal plasma and the lecithins which are formed by the acylation of each of these lysolecithins. Palmitate- and stearate-containing lysolecithins were formed by the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction, whereas oleate- and linoleate-containing lysolecithins were formed by the action of post-heparin lipase(s). All the natural lysolecithins were esterified at comparable rates by the isolated enzyme. Lyso platelet-activating factor was esterified about 70% as efficiently as the lysolecithins, while lysophosphatidylethanolamine was esterified at about 30% the rate observed with lysolecithin. The 2-acyl isomers of lysolecithin were acylated to the same extent as the 1-acyl isomers, although considerable isomerization of the former took place during the incubation. There were no net changes in the concentrations of lecithin and lysolecithin after 6 h of incubation with the enzyme, although over 10% of the labeled lysolecithin was converted to lecithin, indicating that the endogenous lecithin serves as the acyl donor in the reaction. When the molecular species of lecithin formed were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, the same pattern of fatty acid incorporation was observed with all the lysolecithins used. The bulk of the radioactivity was incorporated into molecular species formed by the acylation with linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids, in decreasing order. However, in each case, the lecithins formed by acylation with palmitic acid had the highest specific radioactivity, followed by those acylated with linoleic and oleic acids. From these results it is postulated that the enzyme alters the molecular species composition of lecithin in plasma without increasing the net amount of total lecithins."
https://openalex.org/W1499458587,"During growth in unreplenished medium, the fraction of active, polysomal ribosomes progressively decreases about 3-fold from 80-90% to only 20-40% due to a reduced rate of initiation. To assess whether the abundance of initiation factors could be involved in this repression of translational activity. HeLa cell cytoplasmic lysates were resolved by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and spots corresponding to the initiation factor proteins were quantitated. The relative abundance of most of the initiation factor proteins only decreases by 10-40% and roughly parallels that of the ribosomes. Measurement of the rates of synthesis and turnover of the initiation factor proteins establishes that during periods of active growth, synthesis and degradation occur coordinately with total cell protein. As growth rate decreases, the synthesis of some initiation factor proteins, particularly eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-3 subunits, becomes depressed. Serum stimulation of serum-depleted cells recruits most inactive ribosomes and mRNAs into polysomes, but most initiation factor mRNAs are not selectively recruited. The principal exceptions are eIF-3p24 which exhibits 4-5 fold enhanced synthesis and eIF-3p44 and eIF-4A whose syntheses are moderately stimulated."

Since the circulating level of AVP is too low to mediate a testicular action of this peptide, we have conducted studies to identify testicular AVP-like substances. The supernatant of homogenized, acid-extracted rat testes was found to contain AVP immunoreactivity which showed parallelism with synthetic AVP in a specific radioimmunoassay for AVP. Chromatography of this extract on a Sephadex G-25 column produced three peaks of AVP immunoreactivity. The largest peak eluted close to the column void volume, a second smaller peak eluted at the total column volume, while a third peak co-eluted with synthetic AVP. Following acetone precipitation, ether extraction, and octadecylsilica (C18) adsorption chromatography of the acid extract, the third peak of AVP immunoreactivity (about 600 pg/testis) was fully retained by C18 chromatography and showed parallelism with synthetic AVP in both radioimmuno- and radioreceptor assays. This substance also co-migrated with synthetic AVP on both Sephadex G-25 and reverse-phase thin layer chromatography (RPTLC). The second peak was only partially retained by C18 adsorption chromatography, dilution curves were not parallel with synthetic AVP in radioimmuno- or radioreceptor assay, and this material failed to co-migrate with synthetic AVP on Sephadex G-25 and RPTLC. The first peak of apparent AVP immunoreactivity was associated with an enzyme(s) that degraded labeled AVP. This enzymatic activity, as well as the immunoreactivity, could be eliminated by heating the extract to 90 degrees C. These results demonstrate, by a number of independent criteria, that rat testes contain a substance which behaves like authentic AVP. Due to its high concentration, the AVP-like peptide may be synthesized or concentrated by testis cells. In addition, testis tissue contains enzymatic activity which degrades AVP and could represent a site of regulation of AVP action. Coupled with the previously demonstrated testis action of AVP, these results suggest a paracrine or autocrine role of the neurohypophysial hormone at the testis level."

Their chemical structures were determined to be: GalNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Man(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer; GalNAc(alpha 1-4)GalNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Man(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer and Gal(alpha 1-3)GalNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Man(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer; Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc(alpha 1-4)GalNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Man(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer; and GlcNAC(beta 1-3)Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc(alpha 1-4)GalNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Man(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1)Cer. By the use of specific exoglycosidases, it was possible to assign anomeric configurations to all the sugar residues present. Analysis of the ceramide moiety by electron-impact mass spectrometry revealed the dominant fatty acid and sphingoid to be arachidic acid (C20:0) and tetradecasphing-4-enine, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1576180119,"Infection of mammalian cells with Semliki Forest virus requires the endocytosis of the virus, its delivery to prelysosomal endosomes, and fusion of the viral envelope with the endosome membrane. Previous studies have indicated that the low endosomal pH triggers a conformational change in the viral spike glycoproteins rendering them fusogenic. In this paper, we demonstrate an additional factor(s) which regulates virus fusion in endosomes. We found that Semliki Forest virus is unable to penetrate or infect baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells grown in medium containing reduced Na+ concentrations. Virus endocytosis and degradation are nearly normal, the virus is transported to endosomes where a characteristic low pH-induced loss of trypsin-sensitivity of the E1 spike glycoprotein occurs. Nevertheless, the viral envelope fails to fuse with the endosomal membrane and the viral RNA is not released into the cytosol. As judged by the uptake of the voltage-sensitive probe [3H]triphenylmethyl phosphonium we observed a close correlation between conditions which inhibit virus infection and which cause depolarization of the cells. We propose that in intact cells, the fusion of Semliki Forest virus with the endosome membrane depends not only on acidic endosomal pH, but also on the maintenance of the potential."
https://openalex.org/W1550156772,"Abstract An 18 S multienzyme complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is found to be active in the synthesis of diadenosine-5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (AppppA). Most of the activity is attributed to lysyl-tRNA synthetase in the complex. Free lysyl-tRNA synthetase dissociated from the synthetase complex is about 6-fold more active than the complex in AppppA synthesis, while their apparent Michaelis constants for ATP and lysine are similar. AMP, which reportedly activates AppppA synthesis (Hilderman, R.H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4353-4357), has no effect on AppppA synthesis. The higher activity of free Lys-tRNA synthetase is in part due to the higher stimulation of AppppA synthesis by Zn2+. These results suggest that association of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may affect AppppA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1504695628,"Rat liver 60 S ribosomal subunits were modified with 2-iminothiolane. After treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the cross-linked proteins were extracted and then separated into 24 fractions by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Each protein fraction was then analyzed by diagonal polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (Sommer, A., and Traut, R.R. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 3946-3950). The pieces of gel containing cross-linked protein spots that were shifted from the diagonal line were labeled with 125I. The labeled protein was extracted from the gel and identified by three kinds of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Fifty-three cross-linked protein pairs involving 35 protein species containing two acidic proteins were identified. From these and previous results, a preliminary model of the protein topography of the 60 S ribosomal subunit was constructed and discussed in relation to other functional data on 60 S ribosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1589803608,"H1 phosphorylation has been studied through the precise nuclear division cycle of Physarum polycephalum. The number of sites of phosphorylation of Physarum H1 is very much larger than the number of sites reported for mammalian H1 molecules which is consistent with the larger molecular weight of Physarum H1. At metaphase all of the Physarum H1 molecules contain 20-24 phosphates. Immediately following metaphase, these metaphase-phosphorylated H1 molecules undergo rapid dephosphorylation to give an intermediate S phase set of phosphorylated H1 molecules containing 9-16 phosphates. Progressing into S phase newly synthesized H1 is phosphorylated and eventually merges with the old dephosphorylated H1 to give a ladder of bands 1-20. By the end of S phase or early G2 phase, there is a ladder of bands 1-16 all of which undergo phosphate turnover. Further into G2 phase the bands move to higher states of phosphorylation, and by prophase all of the H1 molecules contain 15-24 phosphates which increases to 20-24 phosphates at metaphase. These results support the proposals that H1 phosphorylation is an important factor in the process of chromosome condensation through G2 phase, prophase to metaphase."
https://openalex.org/W1507416988,"The pH variation of the kinetic parameters, Vmax and V/K, was examined for the forward and reverse reaction of bovine liver argininosuccinate lyase. In the forward reaction the Vmax profile showed one group that must be unprotonated for activity over the pH range 5-10. The V/K profile for argininosuccinate showed one group that must be unprotonated and two groups that must be protonated for activity. The Vmax profile for the reverse reaction showed only one group that must be protonated for activity. These results support the proposal that catalysis is facilitated in the forward reaction by a general base that abstracts a proton from C-3 of argininosuccinate and a general acid that donates a proton to the guanidinium nitrogen during carbon-nitrogen bond cleavage. The enzyme is completely inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate or a water-soluble carbodiimide at pH 6. These experiments suggest that a histidine and a carboxyl group are at or near the active site and are essential for catalytic activity. The observed shifts of the pH profiles of the forward reaction with temperature and organic solvent (25% dioxane) were also consistent with a histidine and carboxylate group."
https://openalex.org/W1516284522,"An invertase from Ricinus communis leaves was purified 4,400-fold. The preparation was homogeneous by criteria of gel electrophoresis, gel permeation, adsorption, and ionic exchange chromatography. One optimum pH at 3.5 was observed with crude invertase; however, purified preparations showed two optima, at pH 3.5 and 5.5. Addition of bovine serum albumin restored one maximum at pH 3.5 and elicited a 30% of the invertase. The effect was caused by many other proteins and by heparin, dextran sulfate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Fructose, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, maleic, trans-aconitic, malic, and ascorbic acids were simple competitive inhibitors of the purified enzyme. Glucose was a noncompetitive inhibitor. The by proteins suppressed these inhibitory effects. The minimum concentration of activator necessary to reach the maximal or of optimal activation was always reached at a concentration of 1 X 10(-6) M, independently of the nature of the activator, when 8.6 X 10(-12) mol of enzyme were used. Apparent molecular weight determinations of the enzyme in the presence and absence of activator and molecular weight determinations based on determinations of the point of optimal suggested that the purified enzyme is a heptamer (Mr of 77,900, Stokes radius 32 A, frictional ration f/fo 1.1, partial specific volume 0.749 ml/g) and that the activated form is a trimer consisting of two enzyme subunits and one activator molecule. The was lost by dilution of the trimer. The enzyme subunit, as isolated by gel filtration in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (Mr 11,000) was inactive but quickly regained activity upon removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate."

The conversion of the membrane-bound form to the released form has been found to consist of the cleavage of a phosphodiester bond, distal to the phosphate, linking the protein to a phospholipid. We suggest that this linkage constitutes the normal mode of attachment of the protein to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1571446892,"A DNA primase activity has been purified from the budding yeast Saccharomyces. The resulting preparation was nearly homogeneous and was devoid of DNA and RNA polymerase activities. The primase activity cofractionated with a Mr 65,000 polypeptide in sedimentation and chromatography procedures, and the native molecular weight of the enzyme corresponded closely to this value suggesting that the primase or an active proteolytic fragment of the protein exists as a monomer. Both heat-denatured calf thymus DNA and poly(dT) could be utilized by the enzyme as templates. Primase exhibited an absolute requirement for divalent cations and for rATP on a poly(dT) template. Although it required the ribonucleotide to initiate primer chains, the enzyme could incorporate the deoxynucleotide into primers. The product of the primase-catalyzed reaction was an oligonucleotide of discrete length (11-13 nucleotides), and oligonucleotides that were apparently dimers of this unit length were also observed. Primers that were synthesized were virtually identical in size in both the presence and absence of dATP incorporation. Although the bulk of DNA primase activity was isolated as a free enzyme, a portion of cellular primase activity co-chromatographed with DNA polymerase suggesting an association between these enzymes similar to that found in several higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1545434430,"An inverse relationship exists in the rat uterus between the endogenous estradiol concentration and the rate of accumulation within the nuclei of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) that bind estradiol. Exposure of the uterine nuclei to physiological concentrations of estradiol, either in vivo or in vitro, results in the hormone binding to the nuclear RNP and the transport of the RNP-estradiol complex from the nuclei. Evidences suggest that the RNP-estradiol complex, thus released upon in vivo exposure of the nuclei to estradiol, associates with the ribosomes forming polysomes. The polysome profiles show that the hormone-binding activity is mainly associated with the rapidly sedimenting polysomal fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1561534231,"When primary corneal endothelial cells were grown in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-conditioned medium, a minor population of cells acquired fibroblastic morphology. Such modulated endothelial cells supported by PMN-conditioned medium grew much faster than the major nonresponding polygonal endothelial cell. Upon serial passages, the modulated endothelial cells became the dominant cell type and eventually formed a homogeneous fibroblastic culture. At the same time, phenotypic changes of collagen were observed. The primary endothelial cells grown in PMN-conditioned medium, consisting of responding elongated cells and nonresponding polygonal endothelial cells, produced predominantly type IV collagen with type III collagen as a minor component. As cells were subcultured and fibroblastic cells became dominant, type IV collagen synthesis was dramatically decreased and type I collagen synthesis was increased in parallel. When they reached the fully modulated stage, the cultures synthesized types I and III collagen, with type I accounting for 75-85% of the total. Type I collagen synthesized by the fibroblastic endothelial cells shared common characteristics with known type I collagen, such as migration behavior on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CNBr peptide profiles, and immunologic identity. Thus, PMNs apparently contribute to the modulation of corneal endothelial cells, causing them to acquire characteristics of fibroblasts, cell multilayering, and deposition of interstitial extracellular matrix composed predominantly of interstitial type I collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1534293510,"Na+-dependent amino acid transport can be reconstituted by gel filtration of disaggregated plasma membrane and asolectin vesicles coupled to a freeze-thaw cycle. The resultant transport activity is markedly affected by the nature of the reconstitution medium. Reconstitution in K+ permits the formation of active liposomes, whereas reconstitution in Na+, Li+, or choline does not. Electron micrographs of K+ liposomes show a wide variation in liposome sizes. Ficoll density gradient fractionation of K+ liposomes shows that the largest vesicles are lipid rich, have the lowest density, and have the highest level of Na+-dependent amino acid transport. Liposomes formed in Na+ have a 34% smaller trapped volume than K+ liposomes and lack a population of large vesicles. A second freeze-thaw in K+ restores activity to Na+ liposomes which now contain large low density active vesicles. Fluorescence measurements of freeze-thaw-induced mixing of vesicle lipids indicates that the absence of large vesicles in Na+ liposomes is due to inhibition by Na+ of lipid vesicle fusion events during freezing and thawing. The large vesicle fraction is enriched in a 125-kDa peptide. It has not yet been established whether this peptide is part of the transport system for neutral amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1595995023,"Pretreatment of cultured chondrosarcoma chondrocytes at 37 degrees C for 15 min with 15 mM diethylcarbamazine (DEC) followed by a 60-min pulse with [35S] sulfate in the presence of DEC resulted in an approximate 40% inhibition of synthesis and a 75% inhibition of secretion of 35S-proteoglycan. The inhibition was dose-related and was not due to a decrease in protein synthesis. Chondrocytes exposed for 75 min to 15 mM DEC, washed, incubated for 17 h in DEC-free medium, and then pulsed with [35S]sulfate showed no inhibition in the rate of synthesis of proteoglycan or in the per cent of radiolabeled proteoglycans exocytosed into the culture medium, indicating full reversibility of the inhibitory effect. When chondrocytes were incubated for 75 min with both 1 mM beta-D-xyloside and 15 mM DEC, secretion of beta-D-xyloside-bound 35S-glycosaminoglycan was inhibited by more than 70% despite an approximate 3-fold increase in intracellular 35S-macromolecules, as compared to cells exposed to beta-D-xyloside alone. Upon removal of DEC, the block in the secretion of beta-D-xyloside-bound 35S-glycosaminoglycans was reversed, although there was a 15-30-min lag in the initiation of exocytosis. Light and electron microscopic examination of chondrocytes after 75 min of incubation with 15 mM DEC revealed large vacuoles, a distended Golgi apparatus, and a distended endoplasmic reticulum which contained electron dense material. Upon removal of DEC, the vacuoles disappeared and distended organelles returned to their normal appearance between 15 and 30 min, coincident with the start of exocytosis of 35S-proteoglycan and beta-D-xyloside-bound 35S-glycosaminoglycan. These biochemical and morphological studies indicate that DEC treatment of chondrosarcoma chondrocytes alters the transport of molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and the transport of molecules from the Golgi to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1483976238,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), the common precursor to beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in rat neurointermediate lobe cells, exhibits both charge and size heterogeneity on two-dimensional gel electrophoretograms. Short term [3H]phenylalanine pulse-labeling, and pulse-chase studies, revealed that this heterogeneity is acquired either co-translationally, through the addition of mannose-rich oligosaccharide chains to the nascent protein, or post-translationally, probably during the period of oligosaccharide processing from the high mannose to the complex forms. In this process, radioactive sulfate is incorporated into different glycoprotein variants of POMC. In the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of the N-glycosylation process, [35S]sulfate incorporation does not occur in any of the major variant forms of POMC, thereby preventing the appearance of the most acidic forms on two-dimensional gels. POMC tryptic fragments were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Sulfate incorporation occurred in only two peptides that were also labeled with [3H]glucosamine. Extensive alkaline digestion of these peptides in the presence of sodium borohydride released the sulfate-containing moieties which were separated from free amino acids by gel filtration. Sulfate bearing moieties could also be released by almond emulsin peptide:N-glycosidase digestion. All these results unambiguously show that sulfate moieties preferentially enter asparagine-linked carbohydrate side chains and not amino acid residues of the POMC polypeptide. It is also likely that differential sulfation, conferring unequal amounts of negative charge upon various glycoprotein variants of POMC, is responsible for much of the charge heterogeneity displayed by the prohormone."

It also inhibits the binding of a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, [3H] 17 beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one ([3H]4-MA), to the enzyme in liver microsomes. The inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase activity and of inhibitor binding activity by diazo-MAPD becomes irreversible upon UV irradiation. [1,2-3H]Diazo-MAPD binds to a single high affinity site (Kd 8 nM, 125 pmol binding sites/mg of protein) in liver microsomes of female rats, and this binding requires NADPH. Without UV irradiation, this binding is reversible, and it becomes irreversible upon UV irradiation. Both the initial reversible binding and the subsequent irreversible conjugation after UV irradiation are inhibited by inhibitors (diazo-MAPD and 4-MA) and substrates (progesterone and testosterone) of 5 alpha-reductase, but they are not inhibited by 5 alpha-reduced steroids (5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol). NADPH stimulates the binding of [3H] diazo-MAPD to microsomes of male rat liver and prostate. UV irradiation also induces conjugation of [3H] diazo-MAPD to these microsomes. Photoaffinity labeled liver microsomes of female rats were solubilized and fractionated by high performance gel filtration. The radioactive conjugate eluted in one major peak at Mr 50,000."
https://openalex.org/W1678878269,"The kidney and urine glycosphingolipids of five pigmentation mutants which are known to have altered secretion of kidney lysosomal enzymes were examined. Among 34 pigmentation mutants which have been studied (Novak, E. K., Wieland, F., Jahreis, G. P., and Swank, R. T. (1980) Biochem. Genet. 18, 549-561) eight are known to have a 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in kidney beta-glucuronidase in testosterone-treated females. These mutants appear to have defects in lysosomal processing, and because the mutations are at separate loci, each mutant probably affects different steps in assembly and/or exocytosis of lysosomes and related subcellular organelles. To test whether the neutral glycosphingolipids, galabiglycosylceramides, and globotriglycosylceramides thought to be associated with kidney lysosomes (McCluer, R. H., Williams, M. A., Gross, S. K., and Meisler, M. H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13112-13120) also exhibit abnormal secretion in the mutants with lysosomal enzyme abnormalities, the mutants beige-J, pale ear, light ear, pallid, and ruby eye-2-J were studied. The kidney and urine neutral glycosphingolipids from males of each mutant and C57BL/6J control mice were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Beige-J, light ear, and pale ear showed marked increases in total kidney glycolipids; globotriglycosylceramides accounted for the bulk of the increase. Ruby eye-2-J showed less marked but significantly increased quantities of one galabiglycosylceramide and the globotriglycosylceramides in kidney. Pallid showed no significant increase in total kidney glycolipids but the globotriglycosylceramides appeared slightly elevated. In terms of the decrease in total urinary glycosphingolipids, the mutants fell into 2 categories. Beige-J, light ear, and pale ear were severely affected, whereas ruby eye-2-J and pallid were affected to a much lesser extent. Within the most severely affected group the excretion of the globotriglycosylceramides was more severely affected than that of the galabiglycosylceramides. The galabiglycosylceramides and globotriglycosylceramides appear to be specific markers of lysosomal membranes, but the independent behavior of these two classes of lipids during testosterone induction in normal mice and the differential effects on their secretion by different mutants indicate that they do not always exist in a characteristic ratio in a single type of subcellular organelle. All of the mutants accumulate organelles in their kidney proximal tubules which have distinct morphological characteristics as seen by electron microscopy."

The cross-linked protein complexes formed were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a basic-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel system under nonreducing conditions. Each complex in the gel was labeled with 125I and extracted under reducing conditions. The protein components of the complex were analyzed by two kinds of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography.

The result, replacement in a retention mode, together with the finding that tritium from the alpha-position of the substrate is recycled and appears both at C alpha and C beta of the product suggests a single base mechanism and an active site geometry of the pyridoxal phosphate-substrate complex in which H alpha and the beta-substituent are syn oriented."
https://openalex.org/W1577570270,"The possibility that some factor in serum changes the substrate specificity of purified human plasma carboxyl esterase, which hydrolyzes the short chain fatty acid ester, tributyrin, was investigated. The purified carboxyl esterase from human plasma hydrolyzed 48 mmol of tributyrin/mg of protein/h, monoolein at 1560 mumol of released fatty acids/mg of protein/h, diolein at 133 mumol of released fatty acids/mg of protein/h, and triolein at less than 10 mumol of released fatty acids/mg of protein/h. When human serum was applied to phenyl-Sepharose, a triolein hydrolysis-promoting factor (THPF) for purified carboxyl esterase was bound to the gel and was eluted with water. This partially purified human serum THPF enhanced carboxyl esterase-catalyzed triolein hydrolysis about 30-fold, diolein hydrolysis 2-fold, and monoolein hydrolysis 1.5-fold. Hydrolysis of triolein in very low density lipoproteins (d less than 1.006) and intermediate lipoproteins (1.006 less than d less than 1.019) by carboxyl esterase was also enhanced by addition of THPF. THPF activity was reduced by treatment of delipidation, but resistant to trypsin treatment or heating at 50 degrees C. These results indicated that serum carboxyl esterase can hydrolyze the long chain fatty acid ester, triolein, in the presence of triolein hydrolysis-promoting factor in serum."
https://openalex.org/W1573615384,"Conditions are defined which permit analysis of estrogen receptors from the mammalian uterus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thereby solving a longstanding problem encountered in previous attempts at such analysis, namely the failure of a large portion of the receptor population to enter such gels. A paramount requirement for entry of the estrogen-receptor complex into polyacrylamide gels is its maintenance in an untransformed state which does not form aggregates that are excluded from these gels. Of the multiple estrogen-binding proteins separated, only one (relative mobility of 0.5-0.6) possessed the definitive characteristics of the classical estrogen receptor. The inclusion of molybdate in extraction buffers selectively enhanced receptor recovery and facilitated its separation. Moreover, the estrogen-receptor complex so resolved is separated from other types of estrogen-binding proteins present in the uterine cytosol. These findings show that the molybdate-stabilized estrogen receptor exists in a single discrete form, but otherwise exhibits multiple forms that are probably artifactual. Electrophoresis in discontinuous buffers, but not in a continuous buffer system, promoted aggregate formation. This finding has implications concerning the subunit structure of the untransformed receptor."
