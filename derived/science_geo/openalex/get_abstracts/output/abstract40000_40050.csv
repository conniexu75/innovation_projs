https://openalex.org/W2060520834,"The three-dimensional structure of poliovirus has been determined at 2.9 A resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. Each of the three major capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) contains a ""core"" consisting of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel with two flanking helices. The arrangement of beta strands and helices is structurally similar and topologically identical to the folding pattern of the capsid proteins of several icosahedral plant viruses. In each of the major capsid proteins, the ""connecting loops"" and NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions are structurally dissimilar. The packing of the subunit ""cores"" to form the virion shell is reminiscent of the packing in the T = 3 plant viruses, but is significantly different in detail. Differences in the orientations of the subunits cause dissimilar contacts at protein-protein interfaces, and are also responsible for two major surface features of the poliovirion: prominent peaks at the fivefold and threefold axes of the particle. The positions and interactions of the NH2- and COOH-terminal strands of the capsid proteins have important implications for virion assembly. Several of the ""connecting loops"" and COOH-terminal strands form prominent radial projections which are the antigenic sites of the virion."

https://openalex.org/W2006943139,Protein secretion from cells can take several forms. Secretion is constitutive if proteins are secreted as fast as they are synthesized. In regulated secretion newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion are stored at high concentration in secretory vesicles until the cell receives an appropriate stimulus. When both constitutive and regulated protein secretion can take place in the same cell a mechanism must exist for sorting the correct secretory protein into the correct secretory vesicle. The secretory vesicle must then be delivered to the appropriate region of plasma membrane. Transfection of DNA encoding foreign secretory proteins into regulated secretory cells has provided insight into the specificity of sorting into secretory vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2086727023,"As a consequence of alternative RNA processing events, a single rat gene can generate messenger RNA's (mRNA's) encoding either calcitonin or a neuropeptide referred to as alpha-type calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP). An mRNA product of a related gene has been identified in rat brain and thyroid encoding the protein precursor of a peptide differing from alpha-CGRP by only a single amino acid. The RNA encoding this peptide, which is referred to as beta-CGRP, appears to be the only mature transcript of the beta-CGRP gene. Hybridization histochemistry reveals a similar distribution of alpha- and beta-CGRP mRNA's, but their relative levels of expression vary in different cranial nerve nuclei. Thus beta-CGRP is a new member of a family of related genes with potential functions in regulating the transduction of sensory and motor information."
https://openalex.org/W1999381784,"The reported incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues to increase in countries throughout the world. On the basis of a polynomial model for extrapolation, the cumulative number of cases diagnosed and reported since 1981 in the United States is expected to double during the next year with over 12,000 additional cases projected to be diagnosed by July 1986. The annual incidence rates for single (never-married) men in Manhattan and San Francisco, intravenous drug users in New York City and New Jersey, and persons with hemophilia A ranged from 261 to 350 per 100,000 population during 1984. For single men aged 25 to 44 years in Manhattan and San Francisco, AIDS was the leading cause of premature mortality in 1984 as measured by years of potential life lost. Infection with HTLV-III/LAV is considerably more common than reported AIDS in high-risk populations and can persist at least for several years, so the presence of specific antibody should be considered presumptive evidence of current infection. The screening of donated blood and plasma for antibody to HTLV-III/LAV and use of safer clotting factor concentrates should greatly reduce HTLV-III/LAV transmission through blood and blood products. Most HTLV-III/LAV infections occur through sexual transmission, use of contaminated needles, and as a result of infected mothers passing the virus to newborns. Continued research commitment is needed to develop an HTLV-III/LAV vaccine and therapy for this infection. In the interim, widespread community efforts are needed to minimize transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2047472099,"Radiolabeled amino acid sequencing was used to characterize gp41, an antigen of HTLV-III/LAV, the virus believed to be the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This antigen is the one most commonly detected in immunoblot assays by sera of patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and other individuals infected with HTLV-III/LAV. A mouse monoclonal antibody that was reactive with gp41 precipitated a 160-kilodalton protein (gp160) in addition to gp41, but did not precipitate a 120-kilodalton protein (gp120) from extracts of metabolically labeled cells producing HTLV-III. Extracts of infected cells that had been labeled with tritiated leucine or isoleucine were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the p41 was eluted from the gel bands and subjected to amino-terminal radiolabeled amino acid sequencing by the semiautomated Edman degradation. Leucine residues occurred in cycles 7, 9, 12, 26, 33, and 34 among 40 cycles and isoleucine occurred in cycle 4 among 24 cycles analyzed. Comparison of the data with the deduced amino acid sequence of the env gene product of HTLV-III precisely placed gp41 in the COOH-terminal region of the env gene product. Gp160 is thus the primary env gene product and it is processed into gp120 and gp41."

https://openalex.org/W2038552915,"A new, competitive, nonpeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, asperlicin, was isolated from the fungus Aspergillus alliaceus. The compound has 300 to 400 times the affinity for pancreatic, ileal, and gallbladder CCK receptors than proglumide, a standard agent of this class. Moreover, asperlicin is highly selective for peripheral CCK receptors relative to brain CCK and gastrin receptors. Since asperlicin also exhibits long-lasting CCK antagonist activity in vivo, it should provide a valuable tool for investigating the physiological and pharmacological actions of CCK."

https://openalex.org/W2012413789,"Apolipoprotein (apo-) B is the ligand responsible for the receptor-mediated catabolism of low density lipoproteins, the principal cholesterol-transporting lipoproteins in plasma. The primary structure of the carboxyl-terminal 30 percent (1455 amino acids) of human apo-B (apo-B100) has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of complementary DNA. Portions of the protein structure that may relate to its receptor binding function and lipid binding properties have been identified. The apo-B100 messenger RNA is about 19 kilobases in length. The apo-B100 gene is expressed primarily in liver and, to a lesser extent, in small intestine, but in no other tissues. The gene for apo-B100 is located in the p24 region (near the tip of the short arm) of chromosome 2."

https://openalex.org/W2024579431,"Benzodiazepines, which are widely prescribed for their antianxiety effects, are shown to be potent stimulators of human monocyte chemotaxis. The chemotactic effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists were blocked by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK-11195, suggesting that these effects are mediated by the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Diazepam was also active in inducing chemotaxis. Binding studies on purified monocytes revealed high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and the displacement potencies of various benzodiazepines correlated with their relative potencies in mediating chemotaxis. The demonstration of functional benzodiazepine receptors on human monocytes, together with recent evidence of receptor-mediated monocyte chemotaxis by other psychoactive peptides (such as opiate peptides), suggests a biochemical substrate for psychosomatic communication."

https://openalex.org/W2046292512,"beta-Adrenergic receptors were identified in two fractions of guinea pig myocardium: a purified sarcolemmal fraction and a light vesicle (presumably intracellular) fraction. In the light vesicle fraction, which contained approximately 25 percent of the myocardial receptors under control conditions, the receptors appeared to be segregated from the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding and catalytic components of adenylate cyclase. During myocardial ischemia, beta-adrenergic receptors were redistributed from the intracellular vesicles to the sarcolemmal fraction, where isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was increased. These findings should facilitate further studies on cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate adrenergic receptor traffic in the myocardium and may explain the rapid enhancement in adrenergic receptor expression that occurs with myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2078663632,"The genes controlling high-level production of Shiga-like toxin (SLT) in Escherichia coli were cloned from the SLT converting phage 933J. This phage was isolated from a strain of E. coli that caused a foodborne outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis. The genes that convert normal E. coli to organisms producing high levels of toxin were cloned into the plasmid pBR328 and expressed in E. coli HB101. DNA restriction mapping, subcloning, examination of the cloned gene products by minicell analysis, neutralization, and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to SLT were used to localize the toxin converting genes and identify them as structural genes for SLT. Southern hybridization studies established that the DNA fragment carrying the cloned toxin structural genes had homology with the DNA of Shigella."
https://openalex.org/W2030335526,"Infection of normal peripheral blood T cells by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated retrovirus (ARV) was evaluated in long-term cultures of helper-inducer T cells (T4 cells). Cells that were inoculated with ARV and maintained in medium supplemented with interleukin-2 remained productively infected with this virus for more than 4 months in culture, although they showed no cytopathic effects characteristic of acute ARV infection. The presence of replicating virus was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase activity of culture fluids and by viral antigens and budding particles detected on cells by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Virus produced in these cultures remained infectious and could induce cytopathic effects and viral antigens in uninfected lymphoid cells. The finding that normal lymphocytes may be productively infected by an AIDS retrovirus in the absence of cell death suggests that a range of biologic effects may occur after infection in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1583519568,"There are two isozymes of the Na,K-ATPase, which can be purified separately from rat renal medulla and brainstem axolemma. Here the basic kinetic properties of the two Na,K-ATPases have been compared in conditions permitting enzyme turnover. The two isozymes are half-maximally activated at different concentrations of ATP, the axolemma Na,K-ATPase having the higher affinity. They are half-maximally activated by Na+ and K+ at very similar concentrations but show differences in cooperativity toward Na+. The affinities of both isozymes for ATP and Na+ are affected in a qualitatively similar way by variations in the concentration of K+. Both isozymes transport 22Na+ and 42K+ in a ratio close to 3:2 in artificial lipid vesicles. The two isozymes differ most strikingly in the inhibition of ATPase activity by ouabain. The axolemma Na,K-ATPase has a high affinity for ouabain with positive cooperativity, while the renal medulla Na,K-ATPase has a lower affinity with negative cooperativity. It is likely that the cooperativity differences are due to kinetic effects, reflecting different rates of conformation transitions during enzyme turnover. The functional result of the contrasting cooperativities is that the difference in sensitivity to ouabain is amplified."
https://openalex.org/W1593753945,"The responses of neutrophils to formyl peptides are initiated and in many cases achieve a maximal level prior to equilibrium receptor occupancy. In order to begin to understand the linkage between receptor occupancy and cell response we have used a pulsed binding procedure to analyze: 1) the number of receptors contributing to three potential signalling events and six functional responses and 2) the evolution of these responses once ligand binding is interrupted. We find that the half-optimal elevations of the potential signals are produced by less than 1% occupancy (Ca2+) or 1-3% occupancy (cAMP, membrane depolarization). In contrast, actin polymerization and a rapid light scatter response are elicited by less than 0.1% occupancy. Half-optimal elastase release and degranulation require approximately 3% occupancy. While half-optimal O2- production and aggregation require approximately 30% occupancy, the half-optimal rate of O2- production requires less than 10% occupancy. To resolve the apparent lack of correlation between the responses and the signals we examined their time courses following the pulse of stimulation. At least four responses and one signal are transient and decay while occupied receptors remain on the membrane surface. These include the Quin 2-Ca2+ signal, actin polymerization, the light scatter response, O2- generation, and aggregation. Ca2+ elevation is correlated with the responses in that: 1) each of these responses is transient unless new receptors are occupied; 2) occupancy of nearly all of the receptors contributes to the time course of these responses; 3) when binding is interrupted, the responses decay with a half-time of 15 s, following a latency of approximately 10 s or less (except for disaggregation where latency is 30-40 s). We discuss evidence in support of the hypothesis that transient cell responses arise from transient receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2018843666,"During development, the chronotropic response of rat ventricular myocardium to α1-adrenergic stimulation changes from positive to negative. The α1-agonist phenylephrine increases the rate of contraction of neonatal rat myocytes cultured alone but decreases the rate of contraction when the myocytes are cultured with functional sympathetic neurons. The developmental induction of the inhibitory myocardial response to α1-adrenergic stimulation in intact ventricle and in cultured myocytes was shown to coincide with the functional acquisition of a substrate for pertussis toxin. A 41-kilodalton protein from myocytes cultured with sympathetic neurons and from adult rat myocardium showed, respectively, 2.2- and 16-fold increases in pertussis toxin-associated ADP-ribosylation (ADP, adenosine diphosphate) as compared to controls. In nerve-muscle cultures, inhibition of the actions of this protein by pertussis toxin-specific ADP-ribosylation reversed the mature inhibitory α1-adrenergic response to an immature stimulatory pattern. The results suggest that innervation is associated with the appearance of a functional pertussis toxin substrate by which the α1-adrenergic response becomes linked to a decrease in automaticity."

https://openalex.org/W2007143067,"Bacteria of different genera isolated at nine medical centers in different parts of the United States and at one center in Venezuela during the first decade of gentamicin usage carried the gentamicin resistance gene 2""-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase on the same transferable plasmid. Such widespread dissemination of a newly observed resistance gene on one plasmid suggests that a new resistance gene may emerge once on a single plasmid, which then carries it to other centers and other plasmids. The resistance gene might, therefore, be contained if detected early."
https://openalex.org/W1523957389,"Abstract Glucagon was added to isolated rat hepatocytes, either alone or together with vasopressin or angiotensin II, and the effects on the initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate were investigated. Addition of glucagon alone which increased cyclic AMP content of the cells slightly increased the initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate. When glucagon was added together with vasopressin or angiotensin II--both of which when added separately increase the initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate but did not affect the cellular content of cyclic AMP--the measured initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate was larger than the sum of that seen with each hormone alone. This indicates that glucagon and Ca2+-linked hormones synergistically enhanced the Ca2+ influx in rat hepatocytes. These effects of glucagon can be mimicked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or forskolin, suggesting that cyclic AMP augments both the resting Ca2+ and the vasopressin- or angiotensin II-stimulated influx. Measurement of the initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate as a function of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration indicated that the increase in the Ca2+ influx resulting from single or combined glucagon and vasopressin administration occurred through a homogeneous population of Ca2+ gates. These hormones were found to raise both the apparent Km for external Ca2+ and the apparent Vmax of the Ca2+ influx. The maximal increase in these two parameters was observed when the two hormones were added together. This suggests that glucagon and vasopressin synergistically stimulate the same Ca2+ gating mechanism. The dose-response curves for the action of glucagon or vasopressin applied in the presence of increasing concentrations of vasopressin or glucagon, respectively, showed that each hormone increases the maximal response to the other without affecting its ED50. It is proposed that glucagon and the Ca2+-linked hormones control the cellular concentration of two intermediates which are both necessary to allow Ca2+ entry into the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598028013,"Transducin, the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of the retinal light-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase system, is structurally and functionally similar to the inhibitory and stimulatory guanyl nucleotide-binding proteins, Gi and Gs, of the adenylate cyclase complex. All are heterotrimers composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Gs and Gi can be activated by NaF with AlCl3 as well as by agonists acting through specific receptors. The effects of NaF and AlCl3 on transducin were investigated in a reconstituted system consisting of the purified subunits of transducin (T alpha, T beta, gamma) and rhodopsin. NaF noncompetitively inhibited the GTPase activity of T alpha in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Inhibition by NaF was enhanced synergistically by AlCl3 which alone only slightly inhibited GTPase activity. None of the other anions tested reproduced the effect of fluoride. Fluoride inhibited [3H]guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate binding to T alpha and release of bound GDP. The ADP-ribosylation of T alpha by pertussis toxin and binding of T alpha to rhodopsin, both of which are enhanced in the presence of T beta gamma, were inhibited by NaF and AlCl3. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that fluoride enhances the dissociation of T alpha from T beta gamma, resulting in the inhibition of GTP-GDP exchange, and therefore, GTP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1601669499,"Much of the evidence for a physiologically important endogenous inhibitor of the sodium pump has been either contradictory or indirect. We have identified three discrete fractions in desalted deproteinized plasma from normal humans that resemble the digitalis glycosides in that they: are of low molecular weight; are resistant to acid and enzymatic proteolysis; inhibit NaK-ATPase activity; inhibit Na+ pump activity in human erythrocytes; displace [3H]ouabain bound to the enzyme; and cross-react with high-affinity polyclonal and monoclonal digoxin-specific antibodies but not with anti-ouabain or anti-digitoxin antibodies. An additional fraction cross-reacted with digoxin-specific antibodies but had no detectable activity against NaK-ATPase. The three inhibitory fractions differed from cardiac glycosides in that their concentration-effect curves in a NaK-ATPase inhibition and [3H]ouabain radioreceptor assays were steeper than unlabeled ouabain. This suggests that these inhibitors are not simple competitive ligands for binding to NaK-ATPase. In the presence of sodium, no fraction required ATP for binding to NaK-ATPase, and in the presence of potassium, only one fraction had the reduced affinity for the enzyme that is characteristic of cardiac glycosides. Unlike digitalis, all three NaK-ATPase inhibitory fractions stimulated the activity of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase. The presence of at least three fractions in human plasma that inhibit NaK-ATPase and cross-react to a variable degree with different digoxin-specific antibody populations could explain much of the conflicting evidence for the existence of endogenous digitalis-like compounds in plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2073799013,"The immunoglobulin kappa (kappa) gene promoter was activated by a ""neutral"" enhancer derived from Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV) in immunoglobulin-producing myeloma cells, regardless of the enhancer's orientation or position in the vector. In one fibroblast line (3T3) the immunoglobulin kappa gene promoter was completely inactive when linked to the HaMuSV enhancer, whereas in mouse L cells, promoter activity was observed only with the HaMuSV enhancer in tandem with the immunoglobulin kappa gene promoter. The differential behavior of the gene promoter, when activated by a neutral enhancer in these three murine cell lines, suggests that promoter sequences contribute to the tissue-specific expression of this gene."

The ""A"" region was found to be specifically expressed as polyadenylated RNA's of 5.5 and 5.0 kilobases in infected cells. The ""B"" region was expressed as 1.8- to 2.0-kilobase RNA species.

https://openalex.org/W1498438838,"To study acidification mechanisms in the distal nephron, microsomes were prepared from rat renal medulla by differential centrifugation. Microsomes were enriched in the enzyme marker gamma-glutamyl transferase and contained an ATP-dependent proton pump, as evidenced by ATP-dependent, 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-reversible quenching of acridine orange fluorescence. Acidification was vanadate-insensitive, but was completely inhibited by micromolar N-ethylmaleimide. Maximal acidification was achieved in the presence of halide (Cl-, Br-) only and was not attainable with potassium-valinomycin diffusion potentials without halide ion. Microsomal ATPase activity was neither chloride- nor N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive. A chloride conductance was observed only with vesicles which had undergone ATP-dependent acidification. An ATP-dependent, N-ethylmaleimide-inhibitable, 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-reversible, and chloride-attenuated quench of bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid-(5] pentamethinoxonol fluorescence was seen, consistent with net transfer of positive charge into the vesicles. Nonetheless, positive intravesicular potentials increased the ATP-dependent initial acidification rate, perhaps by increasing availability of chloride ion to the transport site. Our results are consistent with an electrogenic, ATP-dependent proton pump regulated by a voltage-sensitive chloride site."
https://openalex.org/W2007547258,"When vole cells that had been transformed by Rous sarcoma virus were treated with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA), specific phosphorylation of pp60v-src was increased. Partial V8 protease mapping indicated that the increased phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues located in the amino terminus of the molecule. Treatment of cells with dimethyl sulfoxide or 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate did not elicit this response. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of pp60v-src immunoprecipitated from untreated and TPA-treated cells indicated that a specific tryptic amino-terminal peptide was hyperphosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W2086372522,"Enhancers, cis-acting transcriptional control elements have been described in both viral and cellular genes1. They influence transcription in a quantitative fashion, act over relatively large distances (several kilobases, kb) and behave independently of their position and orientation. Enhancers have been described in immunoglobulin, chymotrypsin and insulin genes2–9. They bear little homology with each other except for an 8-base pair (bp) 'consensus' core element, GTGGAAATTTG (refs 10, 11), but even this element is sometimes non-homologous9.I have searched for such elements in the human antithrombin HI (AT-III) gene. AT-III is an important coagulation protein which inactivates thrombin12. It is produced by the liver and, to a lesser extent, by the kidney13. Here, I report that the 5' flanking region of the AT-III gene encodes a segment homolgous with the enhancer containing the joining–constantκ (Jκ–Cκ) intron of immunoglobulin κ-chain genes. This extensive homology suggests the existence of regulatory factors that recognize common DNA sequences in lymphoid tissues and in those which express AT-III."
https://openalex.org/W1488471698,"The biological activity of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the rabbit mammary prolactin (PRL) receptor (M110, A82, and A917) were investigated using explants of rabbit mammary gland. The three mAbs which were all able to inhibit the binding of 125I-ovine prolactin to its receptor had different biological activities. Two mAbs (M110 and A82) were able to prevent the stimulating effect of PRL on casein synthesis when the molar ratio between the mAb and PRL was 100. At a lower concentration, M110 moved the PRL dose-response curve to the right by a factor of 2.4. This mAb was also effective in vivo, reducing milk production in a lactating rabbit, in a similar fashion to the prolactin lowering drug, CB-154. One mAb (A917) was able to mimic the action of PRL on both casein and DNA ([3H]thymidine incorporation) synthesis, whereas the other two mAbs were without any stimulatory effect. For this stimulatory effect to be observed, bivalency of the antibody was essential, since monovalent fragments, which were able to inhibit PRL binding, had no agonistic activity. The ability of the mAbs to induce a down-regulation of receptors was also studied. M110, which was equipotent to PRL in occupation of receptors, induced no down-regulation, while A917, which had full biological activity, induced only a small degree of down-regulation. These studies suggest that the binding domain of the receptor might be relatively complex, since only a part of this domain recognized by the antibody with PRL-like activity was able to induce hormonal action. Alternatively, only those antibodies able to microaggregate the receptors may possess PRL-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W1927749662,"N-Acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, a hepatic metabolite of acetaminophen, and its analogue, N-acetyl-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine, were metabolized by rat liver microsomes and NADPH to their corresponding 4-aminophenoxyl free radicals. ESR spectra were recorded and unambiguously identified. As indicated by the purple color and confirmed by UV and mass spectroscopy, indophenols were formed as final products. The 4-aminophenoxyl free radical formation could be suppressed by the deacetylase inhibitors, sodium fluoride and paraoxon. Microsomal incubations of N-acetyl-2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine and NADPH do not result in a detectable radical concentration; in addition, no indophenol was found. Substitution of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase for rat liver microsomes eliminates the deacetylase activity and results in direct reduction of N-acetyl-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine to the N-acetyl-2,6-dimethyl-4-aminophenoxyl free radical. Neither the incubation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine nor that of N-acetyl-2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase yielded a detectable concentration of the corresponding phenoxyl free radical. When starting material that had been exposed to the atmosphere was used, a previously reported free radical with a splitting constant of approximately 2 G was formed. This spectrum is identical with that of the 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzosemiquinone free radical, implying hydrolysis of the starting material. Neither the N-acetyl-4-aminophenoxyl nor the N-acetyl-2,6-dimethyl-4-aminophenoxyl radical reduces oxygen to form superoxide or react with oxygen in any other detectable way."
https://openalex.org/W1958256417,"Prostaglandins (PG) inhibit active cyclic AMP export from pigeon red cells, PGA1 and PGA2 most potently (Brunton, L.L., and Mayer, S.E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9714-9720). To probe the mechanism of this action of PGA1, we have studied the interaction of [3H]PGA1 with suspensions of pigeon red cells. The interaction of PGA1 with pigeon red cells is a multistep process of uptake, metabolism, and secretion. [3H] PGA1 rapidly enters red cells and is promptly metabolized (Vmax greater than or equal to 1 nmol/min/10(7) cells) to a compound(s) that remains in the aqueous layer after ethylacetate extraction. The glutathione-depleting agent, diamide, inhibits formation of the PGA1 metabolite. In agreement with the order of potency of other prostaglandins to inhibit cAMP efflux (A much greater than E congruent to B greater than F), PGA2 forms a polar adduct whereas prostaglandins E2, B1, and F2 alpha do not. The red cells secrete the polar metabolite of PGA1 by a saturable mechanism (at 37 degrees C, Km congruent to 0.6 microM, Vmax congruent to 0.5 pmol/min/10(7) cells) that lowered temperatures inhibit (Eact congruent to 21 kcal/mol). Because uptake and metabolism progress with much greater rates than metabolite secretion, red cells transiently concentrate the polar compound intracellularly. Onset and reversal of inhibition of cyclic AMP export by PGA1 coincide with accumulation and secretion of PGA1 metabolite, suggesting that the polar metabolite acts at an intracellular site to inhibit cyclic AMP efflux. In the accompanying Appendix, we present chromatographic and amino acid analyses demonstrating that the polar metabolite is a glutathione adduct of PGA1."
https://openalex.org/W1533442065,"Three monoclonal antibodies (M110, A82, and A917) were obtained by fusing myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified rabbit mammary gland prolactin (PRL) receptors. All 3 antibodies were capable of complete inhibition of 125I-ovine prolactin (oPRL) binding to rabbit mammary PRL receptors in either particulate or soluble form. M110 showed slightly greater potency than oPRL in competing for 125I-oPRL binding. These antibodies also inhibited PRL binding to microsomal fractions from rabbit liver, kidney, adrenal, ovary, and pig mammary gland, although A82 showed poor inhibition in pig mammary gland. There was no cross-reaction of any of the 3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the other species tested: human (T-47D breast cancer cells) and rat (liver, ovary). In order to confirm that these antibodies are specific to the binding domain, antibodies were purified, iodinated, and binding characteristics were investigated. 125I-M110 and 125I-A82 binding was completely inhibited by lactogenic hormones, whereas nonlactogenic hormones did not cross-react. Competition of 125I-M110 by oPRL (ID50 = 0.44 nM) was comparable to that of 125I-oPRL by unlabeled oPRL (ID50 = 0.35 nM), while 125I-A917 binding was only partially competed (30-60%) by lactogenic hormones. Tissue and species specificity of labeled antibody binding paralleled results of binding inhibition experiments using 125I-oPRL. In addition, A82 and A917 completely inhibited 125I-M110 binding. In contrast, 125I-A82 binding was stimulated by A917 and 125I-A917 binding was stimulated by A82. These findings indicate that monoclonal antibodies can be readily prepared from partially purified PRL receptors from rabbit mammary gland; two antibodies (M110 and A82) are hormone binding site specific while the other (A917) binds a domain partially but not entirely distinct from the hormone binding site, and that all three antibodies have strong species specificity."

https://openalex.org/W1496233211,"Resonance Raman (RR) spectra are reported for aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart cytosol, and for inhibitor complexes. They are interpreted with reference to the previously analyzed spectra of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) Schiff base adducts. This comparison shows that, as expected, the pyridine N atom is protonated in the native enzyme at pH 5, and in the glutarate complexes at pH 8.5, and that it is also protonated in the alpha-methylaspartate complex; the stabilization of the pyridine proton at high pH must be due to the interaction with aspartate 222 seen in the x-ray crystal structure. RR spectra of the erythro-beta-hydroxy-DL-aspartate complex, representing the p-quinoid enzyme intermediate, as well as of AlIII complexes of PLP Schiff bases with phenylalanine and tyrosine ethyl ester have been obtained via the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering technique, and partially assigned. A novel H/D exchange at the coenzyme C4' atom has been observed for the native enzyme in D2O, and has been determined, by a combination of NMR and RR measurements, to be due to the Raman laser irradiation. This photoprocess, which is not observed for PLP Schiff bases in aqueous solution, is attributed to a photoexcited p-quinoid intermediate, similar to that implicated in the enzyme mechanism. It is suggested that this intermediate is stabilized by protein interactions which localize charge on the phenolate O atom, plausibly a hydrogen bond from the nearby tyrosine 225. H/D exchange would then follow via the aldimine-ketimine interconversion known to take place in the enzyme reaction."

The proteoliposomes were loaded with 22Na+. Imposition of a valinomycin-mediated potassium diffusion potential, positive out, resulted in very rapid efflux of radioactive Na+ against its electrochemical gradient. That the Na+ efflux was mediated by the electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporter is indicated by the following characteristics that had been established for the porter in previous studies: dependence upon an electrical potential; pH sensitivity, with activity dependent upon an alkaline pH; inhibition by Li+; and an apparent concentration dependence upon Na+ that correlated well with measurements in cells and membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W252309102,"Avian red cells rapidly and extensively metabolize prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) to a polar form that extracts into 80% ethanol and is quantitatively desalted and recovered over a Waters C18 Sep-Pak. This material co-chromatographs with synthetic PGA1-GSH and with the human red cell PGA1 metabolite on cellulose and silica gel thin layer plates and on normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. Quantitation of the amino acid composition by [35S]cysteine incorporation and by fluorometric amino acid analysis of the material eluting from high performance liquid chromatography indicates the presence of PGA1, cysteine, glutamate, and glycine in equimolar ratios. Base sensitivity of the metabolite indicates that it exists largely (80%) in the 9-hydroxyl form. We conclude that the polar metabolite of PGA1 that acts intracellularly to inhibit cyclic AMP efflux by avian red cells is a glutathione conjugate of PGA1."
https://openalex.org/W1599796495,"Addition of 1 eq of fluorescein mercuric acetate (FMA) to beef heart cytochrome oxidase was found to inhibit the steady-state electron transfer activity by 50%, but further additions up to 10 eq had no additional effect on activity. The partial inhibition caused by FMA is thus similar to that observed with other mercury compounds (Mann, A. J., and Auer, H. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 454-458). The fluorescence of FMA was quenched by a factor of 10 upon binding to cytochrome oxidase, consistent with the involvement of a sulfhydryl group. However, addition of mercuric chloride to FMA-cytochrome oxidase resulted in an increase in fluorescence, suggesting that FMA was displaced from the high affinity binding site. Cytochrome c binding to FMA-cytochrome oxidase resulted in a 10% decrease in the fluorescence, possibly caused by Forster energy transfer from FMA to the cytochrome c heme. The binding site for FMA in cytochrome oxidase was investigated by carrying out sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under progressively milder dissociation conditions. When FMA-cytochrome oxidase was dissociated with 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 6 M urea, FMA was predominantly bound to subunit II following electrophoresis. However, when the dissociation was carried out at 4 degrees C in the absence of urea with progressively smaller amounts of lithium dodecyl sulfate, the labeling of subunit II decreased and that of subunit I increased. These experiments demonstrate that mercury compounds bind to a high affinity site on cytochrome oxidase, possibly located in subunit I, but then migrate to subunit II under the normal sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis conditions. A definitive assignment of the high affinity binding site in the native enzyme cannot be made, however, because it is possible that mercury compounds can migrate from one sulfhydryl to another under even the mildest electrophoresis conditions."
