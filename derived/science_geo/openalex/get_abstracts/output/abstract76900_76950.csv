https://openalex.org/W2065035447,"IRREVERKE et al.1,2 have demonstrated the presence of γ-guanidinobutyric acid in the brain, kidney and liver of animals, using paper chromatography, and have isolated the substance in pure form from calf brain. Pisano, Mitoma and Udenfriend3 demonstrated that γ-guanidino-butyric acid is produced from y-aminobutyric acid and arginine by transamidinase activity in mammalian kidney. The present communication describes the seizures caused by administration of the compound to rabbits."

In the past few years we and others have shown that freezing can accelerate a number of catalysed reactions, including hydrolysis, aminolysis, dehydration, oxidation arid peroxide decomposition1–7."

Research on the Australian species is still in progress and this report is intended to communicate only some preliminary results."

https://openalex.org/W2005272969,"ADENOSINE triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis was studied cytochemically in embryonic myocardia of the chick, using a modification of Wachstein and Meisel's method1. Fresh embryonic hearts were pre-fixed in ice cold 2.5 per cent glutaraldehyde for 30 min and stored at 0°–4° C in an isotonic sucrose medium containing 0.1 molar tris maleate sodium hydroxide buffer at pH. 7.2. After 3 days, tissues less than 0.5 mm3 were pre-incubated in a reaction medium without ATP to allow for ionic equilibration. The medium contained a final concentration of 0.03 molar tris maleate–sodium hydroxide buffer at pH. 7.2, 0.10 molar sodium ions, 0.03 molar potassium chloride and 0.005 molar magnesium chloride, hexahydrate. Lead nitrate, 0.005 molar, was added just before 0.0025 molar ATP (sodium salt) was added. The reaction was run for 30 min at 30° C, both with and without substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2010953422,"IT has been suggested1,2, and repeated in textbooks3, that the size–weight illusion is due to differences in muscle tension while weights are being lifted. A large object is lifted with more initial force than a small object, and is judged lighter than a smaller object of the same weight because it can be raised more easily. Several authors4–8 have investigated the differences in muscular effort which accompany errors of weight judgment, but the reports are inconsistent. (Some of these studies1,5,6 were concerned with the “time error” rather than the size-weight illusion.) If certain tension changes were firmly established this would not be sufficient evidence that they were the cause of the illusion: both might be caused by some other factor. The illusion can be a result of pressure without lifting9,10. Uznadze10 demonstrated this by placing pyramids of equal base areas, but different heights, on an arm at rest. I also found that the illusion was experienced to its normal extent when the weights were hung by wire loops from a supported hand11."

https://openalex.org/W2075331110,"SEVERAL workers have reported the inactivation of human erythrocyte agglutinogens by enzymes1–3. Acylase from hog kidney, able to hydrolyse 20,000 µmoles of acetyl D,L-methionine/mg of protein nitrogen/h, specifically diminished agglutinability of human group A erybhro-cytes. A 2 per cent suspension of the erythrocytes in an isotonic veronal buffer solution of pH 7.35 containing 0.25 per cent of the enzyme was incubated at 37° C for 3 h. The erythrocytes were washed three times in the same buffer solution, to remove the enzyme, and tested for agglutinability with serial dilutions of human anti-A sera. Controls, consisting of erythrocytes from the same individuals, treated with the same amount of veronal buffer solution instead of the enzyme solution, were simultaneously tested. Weak or negative agglutination was observed with the treated erythrocytes of group A (A1, A2 and also A1B and A2B) at the higher dilutions of anti-A sera. Erythrocytes of the groups B, O, M, N, D, C, E, c and e did not show any alteration in agglutinability caused by a similar enzyme treatment."

A preliminary report is given here; the full population has not yet been sampled. Forty-four persons of mixed sexes and ages, of full blood Aboriginal stock, were sampled and tested for ABO, MNS, Rhesus, P, Lutheran (Lub), Lewis, Kidd and Vel types."

Both increase1,2 and decrease3–5 of DNA and protein synthesis have been demonstrated. This may be due to the use of different cell strains and stages of virus infection. The early stages of vaccinia virus infection, as yet little studied, were the subject of this investigation."
