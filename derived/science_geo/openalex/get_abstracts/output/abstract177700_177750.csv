https://openalex.org/W2062490010,"Mutations in anc-1 (nuclear anchorage defective) disrupt the positioning of nuclei and mitochondria in Caenorhabditis elegans. ANC-1 is shown to consist of mostly coiled regions with a nuclear envelope localization domain (called the KASH domain) and an actin-binding domain; this structure was conserved with the Drosophila protein Msp-300 and the mammalian Syne proteins. Antibodies against ANC-1 localized cytoplasmically and were enriched at the nuclear periphery in an UNC-84-dependent manner. Overexpression of the KASH domain or the actin-binding domain caused a dominant negative anchorage defect. Thus, ANC-1 may connect nuclei to the cytoskeleton by interacting with UNC-84 at the nuclear envelope and with actin in the cytoplasm."

Analysis of cell cycle processes in plants has been hampered by the lack of synchronizable cell suspensions for Arabidopsis, and few cell cycle-regulated genes are known. Using a recently described synchrony system, we have analyzed RNA from sequential samples ofArabidopsis cells progressing through the cell cycle using Affymetrix Genearrays. We identify nearly 500 genes that robustly display significant fluctuation in expression, representing the first genomic analysis of cell cycle-regulated gene expression in any plant. In addition to the limited number of genes previously identified as cell cycle-regulated in plants, we also find specific patterns of regulation for genes known or suspected to be involved in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and hormonal regulation, including key genes of cytokinin response. Genes identified represent pathways that are cell cycle-regulated in other organisms and those involved in plant-specific processes. The range and number of cell cycle-regulated genes show the close integration of the plant cell cycle into a variety of cellular control and response pathways.

However, plants have a number of special features that give the control of cell division particular importance, including an indeterminate mode of development, the absence of cell migration, and responsiveness of growth rate and development to changes in environmental conditions. Cell division therefore plays a role both in the developmental processes that create plant architecture and in the modulation of plant growth rate in response to the environment (4Cockcroft C.E. den Boer B.G.

It is therefore not unexpected that plant cell cycle control shows a number of novel aspects, together with conservation of the types of key regulators of cell cycle transitions such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs),1 CDK inhibitor genes, cyclins, retinoblastoma (Rb) protein homologs, and E2F (6Ferreira P.C.G.

However, important differences include the absence of direct CDC25 protein phosphatase homologs and the presence of cell cycle-regulated CDKs known as CDKB (17Hirayama T. Imajuku Y. Anai T. Matsui M.

As well as the presence of such novel regulators of the cell cycle, cell division control in plants might also show interactions with plant hormones and developmental regulators as well as with plant-specific processes such as cell wall metabolism. Regulation of gene expression in different phases is proposed to be an important mechanism for control of progression through the cell cycle in yeast and mammalian cells, and around 800 genes have been identified using microarray analysis in both systems as potentially cell cycle-regulated (23Spellman P.T.

The wide scale analysis of cell cycle-regulated expression in plants has been hampered to date by the lack of a suitable system for the synchronization of cells from a sequenced species, and rather few genes are documented as cell cycle-regulated (28Breyne P. Zabeau M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Almost all of these genes are directly involved in cell cycle progression, thereby giving few clues as to mechanisms by which cell cycle control may intersect with other cellular processes (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29Callard D. Mazzolini L.

Using a recently developed cell synchrony system forArabidopsis cells (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we have carried out an analysis of gene expression on high density Affymetrix microarrays (36Wodicka L. Dong H.L.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). 2Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the full data set and the analyzed regulated genes will be made available on the World Wide Web at www.biot.cam.ac.uk/jahm/cellcycle. 2Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the full data set and the analyzed regulated genes will be made available on the World Wide Web at www.biot.cam.ac.uk/jahm/cellcycle. Cell cycle progression was reversibly blocked using the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, and sequential RNA samples taken at two hourly intervals over a 19-h period were analyzed for gene expression. Expression of 4010 genes was detected and tested for statistically significant cell cycle regulation above the variation shown by a randomized data set, resulting in the identification of 463 candidate cell cycle-regulated genes, showing that cell cycle regulation of expression is found for a significant number of genes in plants. A close match was found for known regulated genes between the microarray expression analysis and RNA gel blots. Systematic analysis of their expression revealed common patterns of expression following release, suggesting coordinate regulation of a number of genes. Genes regulated in this experiment represent both processes known or suspected to be cell cycle-regulated in plants or other organisms and genes involved in a number of other cellular processes including hormone response, signal transduction, transcription control, and metabolic regulation (37White K.P.

The insights provided by the first wide scale analysis and identification of cell cycle-modulated gene expression in plants reflect the central role of cell division in plant development and responses and forms an important foundation for future studies in plant cell biology. A suspension culture of the fast growing cell line MM2d was maintained as described (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 27 °C in continuous darkness in a 300-ml flask rotated at 130 rpm and were diluted by adding 3.5–100 ml of fresh MSS medium (Murashige and Skoog salt, 3% sucrose, 0.5 mg/liter 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin) every 7 days. MM2d cells were reversibly blocked in late G1/early S phase with aphidicolin as described (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), with the exception that 20 ml of early stationary phase cell suspension was transferred into 100 ml of fresh MSS medium. After incubation for 24 h under conditions as described above in the presence of 4 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma), cells were gently washed with 1 liter of MSS medium through a nylon net, followed by centrifugation (387 × g for 1 min, no brake applied) to remove the drug. Cells were resuspended in a total volume of 120 ml of fresh MSS medium and incubated as above, and samples were taken hourly for analysis. To determine cell cycle distribution, a sample of frozen cell pellet was treated to release nuclei and analyzed as described (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). On average, 10,000 particles were counted with a flow cytometer (PASIII; Partec GmbH, Münster, Germany), and the cell cycle phases were analyzed using Multicycle for Windows (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells actively replicating DNA were determined using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and subsequent immunocytological detection of the incorporated BrdUrd as described previously (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Metaphase and anaphase cells were counted in the same samples by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining to determine the metaphase/anaphase index. Total RNA was extracted as described previously (33Riou-Khamlichi C. Menges M. Healy J.M.S. Murray J.A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4513-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 48Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, probes of marker genes were used for hybridization as described previously (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were exposed to autoradiography film, scanned, and quantified using NIH Image 1.62 (available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/index.html). Equal loading was controlled by methylene blue staining of the membranes. The level of expression (in arbitrary units) was first corrected against the quantified loading control and then normalized by expressing each value as a proportion (percentage) of the maximum found expression. Preparation of cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA were performed as recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization to Arabidopsis GeneChips®, detection of labeled cRNA using streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and reading of the arrays using a confocal scanner (Affymetrix) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Raw data were processed with Affymetrix MicroarraySuite 5.0. Based on results of the statistical algorithm of the MASuite 5.0 analysis software (Affymetrix), genes were selected for further analysis if they (i) were called at least once present (“present” call) in one of the 10 different experimental time points and (ii) were at least once changed among the samples (“difference” call) after comparative analysis of each experiment against the sample directly taken after release of the block (T0). Analysis was performed as described by Shedden and Cooper (49Shedden K. Cooper S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, data in the time series were compared with the first measurement to obtain relative expression values and were log-transformed. The measurements for each gene were centered across the chips. Suppose Y i(t) denotes the expression of gene i at time t. For all genes, the vector Y i(t) was fit with least squares to Y i(t) =a i S(t) +b i C(t) +R i(t), whereS(t) = sin(2π t/T) and C(t) = cos(2πt/T) with T = 22 h being the time required for one entire cell cycle.Y i(t) can be decomposed into a periodic component Z i(t) =a i Si(t) +b i C i(t) withT = 22 h and a componentR i(t) that is aperiodic or has a period substantially different from 22 h. The proportion of variance explained by the Fourier basis (Fourier proportion of variance explained (PVE)) is the ratio m i = var(Z i(t))/var(Y i(t)), which can range from 0 to 1. Values closer to 1 indicate greater sinusoidal expression with a period of 22 h, whereas values closer to 0 indicate a lack of periodicity or periodicity with a period that is substantially different. The fitted waveformZ i(t) resembles a sine wave. For each gene, the phase of Z i(t) (equal to time of maximal expression) was determined. Based on flow cytometric and cytological data, expression maxima between 0 and 5 h were considered as S phase, maxima between 5 and 10 h were considered G2, maxima between 10 and 17 h were considered M, and maxima between 17 and 22 were considered G1 phase. Because randomly distributed data will also show a certain tendency for periodicity, a random data set was constructed from the experimental data in which the variance for all time seriesY i(t) was conserved but not the order of the measurements. Data resampling was performed by allowing permutations of measurements for each gene. Subsequently, PVE valuesm i were calculated for all vectorsY i(t) in the artificial control data set. Expression patterns of genes defined as having a statistically significantly (p < 0.05) greater periodic expression in the experiment than the randomized data set were imported into GeneMaths (version 1.50; Applied Maths). Of the 4010 genes identified that passed the variation filter, a total of 493 gene expression profiles met the periodic fluctuation conditions (p < 0.05). All of the processed values for signal log ratios after comparative analysis against the sample directly taken after block release (T0) were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizing map (SOM) algorithms using GeneMaths 1.50 (50Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Prior PCA and SOM analysis genes were labeled (GeneMaths) according to the annotated peak of expression found after statistical analysis for each phase as follows: S phase peak (blue), G2(yellow), M phase (red), and G1 (green). Both the expression values of different genes (493 values) and different experiments (nine) were used as variables to calculate the PCA. Data were normalized across genes and experiments. SOM analysis was performed choosing as map (or matrix) the dimension 4 × 4. A dendrogram was created after the absolute expression pattern of each gene was normalized across the experiment by dividing the absolute signal at each time point by the maximum value for the same gene independently of whether it was called present or absent by MASuite. The hierarchical clustering analysis was performed by using as clustering algorithm the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (large N/p) (51Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13079) Google Scholar). The data base tool patmatch (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl) was used to search the promoter region 1 kb upstream of each open reading frame of the selected 493 genes. The following consensus sequences were used to search for regulatory motifs: E2F (TTTYYCGYY), mitotic-specific activation (YCYAACGGYY), Oct (CGCGGATC), and Hex (CCACGTCA). Analysis of gene expression during the cell cycle is predicated on effective synchronization and analysis of cell cycle progression. In many plant systems, the fungal toxin aphidicolin has been found to be an effective method of reversibly blocking cell cycle progression (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 52Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 53Reichheld J.P. Gigot C. Chaubet-Gigot N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It inhibits both DNA polymerase α and δ (54Sala F. Parisi B. Burroni D. Amileni A.R. Pedrali-Noy G. Spadari S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 117: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and therefore blocks cell cycle progression in early S phase. Removal of the inhibitor by washing leads to release of the block and the synchronous resumption of S phase and progression through the cell cycle. However, Arabidopsis cell culture systems have proven remarkably recalcitrant to efficient synchronization using this or other methods (29Callard D. Mazzolini L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 55Fuerst R.A.U.A. Soni R. Murray J.A.H. Lindsey K. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 56Richmond T. Somerville S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We recently developed techniques for aphidicolin synchronization of the Arabidopsis Landsbergerecta cell line MM2d (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which was used for the synchronization experiments reported here. After treatment of MM2d cells with aphidicolin for 24 h and subsequent washing to remove the block, cell cycle progression was followed by flow cytometry over a 19-h period (Fig.1, A and B). The majority of cells are arrested in G1/early S phase (G1/S, G1 = 1N) directly after release of the block. Within 1 h of removal of aphidicolin, a peak corresponding to a progressive increase in DNA content of S phase cells indicated that the majority of cells proceed synchronous through S phase (Fig. 1 A). The DNA content of this S phase peak constantly increased in size before reaching the G2 phase DNA content (2N) after 5 h. Peak analysis of the flow cytometry data shows that 77% of the cell population is in S phase 1 h after block release, and a maximum of more than 90% is found in G2 after 7–8 h (Fig. 1 B). At 8 h, a rapid increase in the number of metaphase cells is observed. Synchrony was also monitored by pulse labeling with BrdUrd and detection of newly synthesized BrdUrd-containing DNA using immunocytochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence to identify S phase cells actively synthesizing DNA (22Menges M. Murray J.A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The proportion of BrdUrd-positive cells observed is defined as the labeling index. Independent labeling index determination of the same samples confirmed the level of S phase synchrony measured by flow cytometry showing a labeling index peak of 76% observed 2 h after release (Fig. 1 C). The metaphase/anaphase index of cells in metaphase/anaphase reaches a peak value of around 11%, 11–12 h after release of the block. It should be noted that only cells in metaphase and anaphase were scored for the metaphase/anaphase index, which represent only around 35–40% of the total duration of mitosis, since it is difficult to score routinely other mitotic phases due to the small genome size and late condensation of Arabidopsis chromosomes in prophase (57Heslop-Harrison J.S. Maluszynska J. Meyerowitz E.M. Somerville C.R. Arabidopsis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 63-87Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from samples taken immediately after washing to remove aphidicolin (0 h) and at two hourly intervals until 16 h, followed by a final sample at 19 h. RNA was labeled and hybridized to high density Affymetrix GeneChip DNA arrays that contain ∼8250 gene sequences and expressed sequence tags according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). The hybridized chips were then analyzed, and genes were filtered as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Of the ∼8250 genes and expressed sequence tags represented on the chip, 4010 passed the biological variation filter, indicating that they were both reliably detected on at least one chip (“present” call), and showing a change from the expression level at time 0 (“difference” call). Previous analysis of microarray data has found that random variation can produce apparently systematic patterns of expression (49Shedden K. Cooper S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), throwing doubt on earlier identification of cell cycle-regulated genes in human fibroblasts (24Cho R.J. Huang M.X. Campbell M.J. Dong H.L. Steinmetz L. Sapinoso L. Hampton G. Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We therefore confirmed the existence of periodicity in our data set by creating a control set of randomized data (see “Experimental Procedures”) for the 4010 genes passing the first filter. Fourier-PVE values, indicating the degree of cyclicity in the data and phase of expression were determined. Fig.2 A shows a plot of the PVE values of the 1000 strongest expressed genes (highest mean expression; mean selection, left) or of the 1000 genes with the largest standard variation in expression (S.D. selection, right) against the similarly ranked genes from the random set. In such a plot, points close to or above the diagonal show that there is similar or even less periodicity in the experimental data than in the random data. In contrast, points below the diagonal indicate periodic expression. Fig. 2 A demonstrates considerable periodicity in the experimental data. Thus, the successful synchronization of the cell culture was confirmed and that indeed many genes are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Similar to observations of Shedden and Cooper (49Shedden K. Cooper S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we observe stronger periodic expression among the genes with the highest S.D. than among the genes with highest mean expression (Fig. 2 A, compare left andright). Similar observations were made with a plot of PVE values of the entire set of 4010 selected genes (data not shown). Subsequently, we compared the distribution of phases between experimental and randomized data. Data in Fig. 2 Bshow that the timing of maximal expression of the randomized data is relatively evenly distributed throughout the period of the experiment, as expected for effectively randomized data. In contrast, the distribution of phases in the experimental data strongly deviates from that of the random data. In particular, very few genes had expression maxima in G2 phase (Fig. 2 C). We then used the distribution of PVE values of the control data set to select those genes showing statistically significant higher periodic expression in the experiment than expected from the random data (p < 0.05), resulting in the definition of 493 (12%) gene signals of the total expressed (4010) as having a high probability of exhibiting significant regulation during the duration of the experiment. These included 213 gene signals with a peak of expression during S phase, nine genes peaking in G2, 135 in mitosis, and 136 in G1. The distribution of phases for the 493 selected signals was similar to that of the entire set of 4010 genes (data not shown). Although these genes were characterized by a low probabil"

https://openalex.org/W2021202712,"β-arrestins (βarrs) are two highly homologous proteins that uncouple G protein-coupled receptors from their cognate G proteins, serve as adaptor molecules linking G protein-coupled receptors to clathrin-coat components (AP-2 complex and clathrin), and act as scaffolding proteins for ERK1/2 and JNK3 cascades. A striking difference between the two βarrs (βarr1 and βarr2) is that βarr1 is evenly distributed throughout the cell, whereas βarr2 shows an apparent cytoplasmic localization at steady state. Here, we investigate the molecular determinants underlying this differential distribution. βarr2 is constitutively excluded from the nucleus by a leptomycin B-sensitive pathway because of the presence of a classical leucine-rich nuclear export signal in its C terminus (L395/L397) that is absent in βarr1. In addition, using a nuclear import assay in yeast we showed that βarr2 is actively imported into the nucleus, suggesting that βarr2 undergoes constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In cells expressing βarr2, JNK3 is mostly cytosolic. A point mutation of the nuclear export signal (L395A) in βarr2, which was sufficient to redistribute βarr2 from the cytosol to the nucleus, also caused the nuclear relocalization of JNK3. These data indicate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of βarr2 controls the subcellular distribution of JNK3. β-arrestins (βarrs) are two highly homologous proteins that uncouple G protein-coupled receptors from their cognate G proteins, serve as adaptor molecules linking G protein-coupled receptors to clathrin-coat components (AP-2 complex and clathrin), and act as scaffolding proteins for ERK1/2 and JNK3 cascades.

Whereas visual arrestin is exclusively expressed in the retina where it turns off the signal mediated by activated rhodopsin, βarrs are almost ubiquitous and play a critical role in desensitization and endocytosis of GPCRs. Phosphorylation of ligand-activated receptors by specialized GPCR kinases promotes the translocation of βarrs from the cytoplasm to activated GPCRs. The binding of βarrs to GPCRs uncouples them from their cognate G proteins, a process referred to as desensitization that terminates receptor signaling (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kallal L. Benovic J.L.

Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), the two major structural components of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (6Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and have therefore been proposed to target phosphorylated GPCRs for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their roles in termination of GPCR signaling, new roles for βarrs have recently been proposed because of the identification of novel βarr-interacting partners. Two isoforms of βarr exist, βarr1 and βarr2 (also known as arrestin 2 and 3, respectively), which were originally described in relation to β2-adrenerigic receptor desensitization (7Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 8Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that βarr1 acts as a scaffolding protein for the activation of tyrosine kinases such as Src (9Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) and Hck (10Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A.

In another role as adaptor proteins, βarr2 has been shown to interact with the component kinases of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) cascade, JNK3, and the MAP3K, ASK1, to facilitate JNK3 signaling (11McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, βarrs interact with the component kinases of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, Raf and ERK2, to facilitate GPCR-mediated ERK activation (12Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Although the βarrs share a high degree of homology (∼80%), it is becoming clear that there are differences between the regulation and function of the two isoforms. For example, βarr1 is phosphorylated by ERK, and following receptor activation and its recruitment to the plasma membrane it is dephosphorylated, which promotes Src binding and targets activated GPCRs to CCPs (13Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, βarr2 is phosphorylated by Casein kinase II under basal conditions, and its dephosphorylation upon receptor activation does not appear to alter its endocytic capacity but has instead been proposed to alter binding to an as yet unidentified βarr2-interacting protein(s) (14Kim Y.M. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16837-16846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, differences in the ability of the βarrs to promote sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptor in mouse embryo fibroblasts has been observed, and studies using enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged βarrs have highlighted differences in their relative capacities to translocate to activated GPCRs (15Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Another striking difference between βarr1 and βarr2 is their subcellular localization. While at steady state, βarr2 appears to be almost exclusively extranuclear; β-arrestin1 is found throughout the cell, both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Ref. 16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar and “Results and Discussion” section). Since previous structural studies (17Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 18Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and molecular modeling (19Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) confirmed that arrestins are not only very homologous but also structurally similar, the nuclear exclusion/localization of βarrs is likely to depend on specific molecular signals. Indeed, the bidirectional transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus is an important regulatory mechanism for various cellular processes, which is controlled by specialized nuclear localization signal (NLS) import or nuclear export signal (NES) signals. These signals are found on proteins that are actively transported through the nuclear pores by shuttling machineries, importins, and exportins, respectively, permitting their movement in and out of the nucleus (20Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting to note that other proteins involved in endocytosis, such as epsin and Eps15, were recently found to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (21Hyman J. Chen H., Di Fiore P.P., De Camilli P. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, the two related endocytic proteins, Eps15 and Eps15R, also demonstrate differential nuclear localizations similar to the βarrs, with Eps15R but not Eps15 being found in the nucleus at steady state (23Poupon V. Polo S. Vecchi M. Martin G. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf- Bensussan N., Di Fiore P.P. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized the molecular determinants that govern βarr2 localization within the cell. The predominant cytoplasmic localization of βarr2 at steady state was found to depend on the presence of a functional NES in its C-terminal extremity, which overrides an active nuclear import. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of βarr2, in turn, may control the sub-cellular distribution of signaling proteins bound to βarr2, such as JNK3. These studies indicate that βarrs may have isoform-specific and still undiscovered nuclear functions. Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and Calcium Phosphate transfection kit were from Invitrogen. TRH was from Sigma, and FuGENE 6 reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobin was obtained from Molecular Probes. The construction of pβarr2-GFP, pVSV-TRHR, pFLAG-JNK3, pNIA and pNIA-VirE2 have been described previously (26Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol.

Charest) upstream and in frame of GFP in pEGFPN1 (Clontech) using the ApaI andSacI sites of pEGFPN1. To create pGFP-βarr2/C1, pGFP-βarr2/C2, pGFP-βarr2/C3, pGFP-βarr2/C4, pGFP-βarr2/C5, and pEGFP-βarr2/N1, the following corresponding regions of βarr2 cDNA were amplified using PCR; amino acids 317–410, 317–400, 317–390, 317–380, 317–370, and 1–316. These PCR products were subsequently digested SacI (contained on upper primers) andKpnI (contained on lower primers) and introduced downstream and in frame of EGFP in pEGFPC1 (Clontech) using the same restriction sites. Similarly, DNA corresponding to amino acids 317–418 of βarr1 was amplified by PCR using primers containingHindIII (upper primer) and XhoI (lower primer) sites and cloned downstream and in frame of EGFP in pEGFPC1 using the same restrictions sites to create pGFP-βarr1/C1. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). βarr2-I387A-GFP, βarr2-L395A-GFP, βarr2-R396A-GFP, and βarr2-L397A-GFP were generated by replacing Ile-387, Leu-395, Arg-396, or Leu-397 of βarr2 in pβarr2-GFP, which contains the full-length βarr2 cDNA with alanine residues. βarr2-L395Q-GFP was generated by replacing Leu-395 of GFP-tagged βarr2 with a glutamine residue. Wild-type βarr2 and βarr2-L395A cDNAs were amplified by PCR and either cloned between SacI and SalI sites in pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene Europe) to generate pβarr2-FLAG and pβarr2-L395A-FLAG or between SmaI and SalI sites in pNIA to create pNIA-βarr2 and pNIA-βarr2-L395A. The integrase gene from HIV-1 Lai isolate was amplified by PCR and inserted between BamHI and PstI sites in pNIA to create pNIA-IN. All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing (Institut Cochin sequencing facility). Sequences of all the primers used are available on request. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Subconfluent HeLa cells were used for transient expression of the different constructs. Transfections were performed using the FuGENE 6 Transfection System or calcium phosphate transfection kits from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence studies, HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates, transfected with 1 μg plasmid on the following day, and used for immunofluorescence 1 day post-transfection. For translocation experiments HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg VSV-TRHR and 0.2 μg of a βarr2-GFP construct. When treatment with LMB was performed, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-2% fetal calf serum containing 20 nm LMB. Cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy as previously described (29Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Spot 2, Diagnostic Instruments). The L40 yeast reporter strain containing the two LexA-inducible genes, HIS3 andlacZ, was transformed with the pNIA-hybrid expression vectors and plated on selective medium. Transformants were subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity and histidine auxotrophy as previously described (28Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Internalization of TRHR was performed essentially as in (26Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent COS cells in 10 cm cell culture dishes were transiently transfected with 2.5 μg VSV-TRHR and either 2.5 μg of pCMV-Tag4A, 2.5 μg of βarr2-FLAG, or 2.5 μg βarr2-L395A-FLAG using FuGENE 6. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 12-well plates (one 10-cm dish was split into 16 wells). The day after, DMEM was removed from the cells and replaced with 0.5 ml HEPES-buffered HD medium (serum free DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH7.2) per well, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. 40 min later plates were placed on ice and cooled for 10 min. HD medium was removed and replaced with 200 μl of 50 nm [3H]TRH in HD medium, and cells were incubated on ice for 40 min. Subsequently, plates were shifted to 37 °C for 60, 30, or 10 min, replaced on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. Immediately after, membrane-bound [3H]TRH was stripped with 0.5 ml of an acid/salt wash (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH2.6) followed by 0.5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl wash. Internal [3H]TRH was determined after cell solubilization with 1% (w/v) SDS/1% (v/v) Triton X-100/10 mm Tris/HCl, pH8.0. Samples incubated in the presence of 10 μm cold TRH allowed the determination of nonspecific binding. Results are expressed as a percentage of surface receptors at 0 min (cells incubated on ice for the duration of the experiment). Changes in cytosolic-free calcium concentration were measured in HEK-293 cells loaded with Fura 2/AM as previously described (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent HEK-293 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of βarr2-FLAG, 5 μg of βarr2-L395A-FLAG, or pCMV-Tag4A empty control vector. 48 h after transfection, adherent cells were loaded at 37 °C with 2 μm Fura2/AM in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 50 min with gentle stirring. Cells were harvested after incubation for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and washed twice by centrifugation in Hanks balanced salt solution, pH 7,4. Fura 2 fluorescence assays were performed with 2.5 × 106 cells in 2 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution using a Jobin-Yvon three-dimensional fluorometer (Longjumeau, France) equipped with a thermally controlled cuvette holder and a magnetic stirrer. Excitation and emission wavelengths for Fura 2 assays were 340 and 510 nm, respectively. The concentrations of cytosolic-free calcium were calculated using the equation [Ca2+]i (nm) = 224 × (F-Fmin)/Fmax-F) as previously described (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To evaluate muscarinic acetylcholine receptor desensitization, cells were incubated with 100 μm carbachol for 20 min, washed, and then rechallenged with 1 mm carbachol. Previous studies, performed with βarrs fused to the GFP or its variant, yellow fluorescent protein, at either their N or C terminus showed an unanticipated difference in the subcellular localization of βarr1 and βarr2 (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Under steady-state conditions, the βarr2 constructs expressed in HEK-293 cells were almost exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas the βarr1 fusion proteins were evenly distributed throughout the cell including the nucleus. These results prompted us to study whether this phenomenon could be tag- or cell-dependent. The different subcellular localization of the two βarrs was conserved in HeLa cells (Fig.1, a and c). Furthermore, experiments performed using βarrs tagged with a short, eight-residue long FLAG-epitope gave similar results (data not shown). The distinct subcellular distribution of βarr1 and βarr2 thus appear to be tag- and cell-type independent and cannot be explained by differences in size or conformation, because the two proteins vary by less than 10 amino acids in length and are structurally similar. Therefore, we investigated whether active transport events between the cytosol and nucleus could be involved. LMB is a drug that specifically inhibits the constitutive nuclear export of proteins that contain classical leucine-rich NESs through inactivation of CRM1/exportin1 (31Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Incubation with LMB for 1 h caused the nuclear localization of βarr2-GFP (Fig. 1 b), whereas no effect was observed on βarr1-GFP (Fig. 1 d). These results indicate that βarr2, but not βarr1, undergoes constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and suggest the presence of a functional NES in βarr2. Previous studies suggested that some unidentified molecular determinants located in the C-terminal region of βarrs are responsible for their different nuclear localization at steady state (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the potential NES underlying the nuclear exclusion of βarr2 was contained within this region. A series of GFP-tagged βarr2 C-terminal tail constructs were generated by progressive deletion from the C terminus to test this hypothesis (Fig.2, top). We predicted that upon expression all of the constructs containing a functional NES would be cytoplasmic because of CRM1-mediated nuclear export. In contrast, truncations lacking NES would be found in both the nucleus and cytosol at steady state, since proteins of about 40 kDa or less are able to undergo passive diffusion through nuclear pores, as observed for the 27-kDa protein GFP (Fig. 2 a). The full-length C-terminal tail construct containing the last 94 amino acids of βarr2 (βarr2/C1) was excluded from the nucleus under steady-state conditions (Fig. 2 b) in keeping with the presence of a NES within this region. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the fact that βarr2/C1 was localized in the nucleus upon LMB treatment (Fig.2, top and data not shown). Similarly, the expression pattern of the 10-residue shorter βarr2/C2 construct was cytoplasmic at steady state (Fig. 2 c) and was found in the nucleus upon addition of LMB (Fig. 2, top and data not shown). In contrast with the βarr2/C3 construct, when an additional 10 amino acids were removed the nuclear exclusion of the βarr2 C-terminal tail was lost (Fig. 2 d), suggesting that a NES lies between amino acids 390 and 400 of βarr2. Similar distribution profiles were observed for βarr2/C4 and βarr2/C5 as with βarr2/C3 (Fig. 2,top and data not shown). The fact that βarr2/N1, a βarr2 construct lacking the last 94 C-terminal amino acids, was mainly nuclear (Fig. 2 e) suggests that there is no further NES in the protein. Finally, a construct encoding the last 94 amino acids of βarr1 was found in both the cytosol and nucleus like the full-length protein, further confirming the lack of a NES in βarr1. Taken together these results indicate that βarr2 is constitutively excluded from the nucleus because of the presence of a NES in its C terminus between amino acids 390 and 400. The 10-residue region of βarr2 that is responsible for its nuclear export is highly conserved between different species and contains two leucine residues (L395/L397; Fig. 3,top) that are characteristic of a typical CRM1-dependent NES. These residues were individually mutated to alanine in full-length βarr2-GFP, and the effect of the mutations on nuclear exclusion of the subsequent chimeras was tested (Fig. 3). Mutation of each leucine residue, at positions 395 or 397, to alanine (L395A and L397A) caused a complete loss of nuclear exclusion (Fig. 3, b and c) resulting in nuclear localization of the constructs similar to that of wild-type βarr2 in the presence of LMB (Fig. 1 b). Similar results were obtained using FLAG-tagged βarr2 constructs (data not shown). Mutation of the isoleucine residue at position 387 to alanine had no effect on nuclear exclusion (Fig. 3 d), indicating that this residue is not required for NES activity. Interestingly, the region between amino acids 390–400 is also highly conserved between mammalian βarr1 and βarr2, the only difference being the L395 residue in βarr2 that is replaced by a glutamine residue at the corresponding position in βarr1 (Fig. 3, top). To further test if this one residue difference could account for the different nuclear localizations of βarr1 and βarr2, L395 was replaced by a glutamine residue in βarr2-GFP (L395Q). As expected, the resulting construct was found to be mainly nuclear, similar to what was found for the L395A mutant (compare Fig. 3, b and e). Therefore, these results indicate that βarr2 contains a classical leucine-rich NES (L395/L397) responsible for its constitutive nuclear exclusion. They also demonstrate that a single amino acid difference between βarr2 and βarr1 (L395 and Q394, respectively) is responsible for the lack of a functional NES in βarr1. The aforementioned results clearly indicate that βarr2 is actively exported from the nucleus. In addition, the fact that the βarr2/N1, the NES βarr2 mutants, as well as wild-type βarr2 in the presence of LMB showed a stronger nuclear accumulation than GFP alone or βarr1 constructs suggests that βarr2 is actively imported in the nucleus (compare Figs. 1 b, 2 e, 3 b,c, and e to 1 c and 2 f). The analysis of the βarr2 primary sequence did not reveal any classical, lysine-rich or M9-type (32Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) NLS, preventing the precise characterization of its nuclear import. Therefore, we studied βarr2 using an in vivo assay in yeast that was developed to quantify the active nuclear import of exogenous proteins bearing functional nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signals (28Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this assay, proteins to be tested are fused to a chimeric protein consisting of the GAL4 activation domain fused to a modified LexA DNA binding domain in which its intrinsic NLS is abolished (Fig.4 A). If the tested protein undergoes active nuclear import the resulting fusion protein enters the nucleus and then activates two reporter genes, lacz andHIS3, inducing both β-gal activity and growth on histidine-deficient medium (28Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Such an activation was observed with both the L395A NES mutant of βarr2 and the human immunodeficiency virus integrase, a protein known to be actively imported into the nucleus (33Depienne C. Mousnier A. Leh H., Le Rouzic E. Dormont D. Benichou S. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18102-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but not with wild-type βarr2 or a negative control, VirE2, which encodes an agrobacteriumprotein without any NLS (28Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). These results are consistent with the respective intracellular localization of βarr2-GFP constructs and confirm that βarr2 is actively imported into the nucleus, although the NES in βarr2 appears to be functionally predominant at steady state. Taken together our data indicate that βarr2 undergoes constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling involving a yet undermined import mechanism and the classical CRM1-dependent export pathway via a NES in its C-terminal extremity. Several recent studies have highlighted the important role that the last 40 amino acids (Fig.5, top) of the βarrs play in their function and regulation. In this region both βarr1 and βarr2 share the same clathrin binding site (34Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the IVF regulatory motif, which is involved in the stabilization of βarr in its basal state (35Potter R.M.

Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Other regulatory sites are isoform specific, such as the βarr2 phosphorylation site for Casein kinase II (14Kim Y.M. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16837-16846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the ERK phosphorylation site for βarr1 (13Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the βarr2 NES (present study). Cytosolic βarr2 rapidly translocates to activated GPCRs and mediates their recruitment to pre-existing CCPs by interacting with the adapter protein AP-2. This phenomenon, which can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy as the colocalization of receptors βarr2 and AP-2 in punctate areas of the plasma membrane after agonist stimulation (26Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), constitutes the first step of receptor endocytosis. Since the two leucine residues required for NES activity (L395 and L397) are adjacent to the two arginine residues (R394 and R396) that were identified to be important for β-arrestin-binding to the AP-2 complex, we further investigated whether these residues were involved in only one specific function or if mutation of one functional motif would affect the other. The fact that the βarr2 R396A mutant, which demonstrates impaired AP-2 binding (37Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), remained localized within the cytoplasm under steady-state conditions (Fig. 5 a) indicated that the NES was still functional. This was confirmed by the observation that the R396A construct was found in the nucleus upon LMB treatment (Fig.5 b). However, in cells expressing the GPCR TRHR recruitment of the R396A βarr2 mutant to CCPs was greatly impaired, as evidenced by the lack of colocalization with the CCP marker AP-2 following receptor stimulation (Fig. 5, c and d). In contrast, both NES mutants L395A and L397A were efficiently targeted to CCPs upon agonist stimulation of the TRHR like wild-type βarr2 (26Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by their complete colocalization with AP-2 (Fig. 5,e and f and data not shown for the L397A mutant) and the receptor (Fig. 6 A,panels a and b and data not shown for the L397A mutant). In addition, the kinetics of TRHR endocytosis was similar in cells overexpressing either wild-type or NES mutant βarr2, as shown in Fig. 6 B. COS cells express low levels of endogenous β-arrestins that limit the amount and rate of GPCR endocytosis (38Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). COS cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the TRHR and plasmids coding for wild-type or NES mutant βarr2 or a control empty vector. TRH endocytosis reached ∼25% after 1 h of agonist stimulation in cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, in the presence of overexpressed wild-type or L395A βarr2, endocytosis was faster and reached 80% for both constructs (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that although the NES and AP-2 binding sites are in close proximity, the specific residues implicated in nuclear export and AP-2 binding are able to function independently for each process. For the majority of GPCRs receptor phosphorylation and subsequent binding of β-arrestins terminate coupling to G proteins in the continued presence of agonist, a phenomenon referred to as desensitization. Phosphorylation by specialized kinases, known as G protein receptor kinases, provides docking sites for β-arrestins on the intracellular regions of receptors. Upon binding to the receptor, β-arrestins sterically block further coupling between GPCRs and G proteins. We investigated whether mutation of the NES would hamper this process. HEK-293 cells express endogenous muscarinic receptors, which signal by increasing intracellular calcium (39Brydon L. Roka F. Petit L. de Coppet P. Tissot M. Barrett P. Morgan P.J. Nanoff C. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2025-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12900-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Desensitization of muscarinic receptor signaling was tested in HEK-293 cell overexpressing wild-type βarr2 or βarr2-L395A (Fig.6 C). The increase in intracellular calcium concentration promoted by the muscarinic agonist carbachol was compared in cells preincubated or not with the same ligand to induce desensitization. In cells transfected with the empty control plasmid, desensitization involving endogenous β-arrestins resulted in ∼50% decrease of the calcium signal. Overexpressed wild-type βarr2 and βarr2-L395A both significantly increased desensitization to comparable levels (∼75% decrease of the calcium signal), indicating that the NES mutation does not interfere with regulation of receptor function. All known biological functions of βarr2 were associated so far with its extra-nuclear localization. The existence of a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling indicates that this protein may have specific functions within the nucleus, which are likely not shared by βarr1 since the latter isoform is devoid of a NES. βarr2, but not βarr1, was reported to serve as a scaffold for the component kinases of the JNK3 cascade and also to retain JNK3 outside the nucleus under basal conditions (11McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of βarr2 could interfere with the subcellular distribution of JNK3, wild-type β-arrestins or NES mutant L395A βarr2 fused to GFP were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged JNK3 (Fig.7). In agreement with previous findings (11McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), under basal conditions JNK3 distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in cells expressing JNK3 alone or co-expressing JNK3 and βarr1 (data not shown), whereas it was mainly cytoplasmic in cells co-expressing wild-type βarr2 (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, in the presence of the L395A NES mutant of βarr2, JNK3 colocalized with βarr2 within the nucleus (Fig. 7 B), indicating that under basal conditions the two proteins remain associated in both nuclear and extra-nuclear compartments. Taken together, these data and previous observations (11McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with a model in which the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of βarr2 would serve to redirect nuclear JNK3 to the cytoplasm and to relocalize GPCR-activated JNK3 to the extra-nuclear compartment in the vicinity of specific substrates. Such a scenario was recently demonstrated for PEA-15, a protein that blocks ERK-dependent transcription by binding ERKs and preventing their localization in the nucleus (41Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, like βarr2, PEA-15 also contains a nuclear export sequence required for its capacity to anchor ERK in the cytoplasm. Therefore, βarr2 is likely to play such a role for JNK3. A number of proteins involved in endocytosis, such as epsin, Eps15, clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM), α-adaptin, and now βarr2 have been shown to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting the possibility that molecules of the endocytic machinery might also play some function in the nucleus. These proteins, which contain multiple protein-protein interaction surfaces and are characterized by self-assembling properties, were proposed to provide scaffold structures participating in the regulation of transcription factors (22Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Eps15 and CALM were reported to act as positive modulators of transcription in a GAL4-based transactivation assay (22Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas epsin was found to interact with the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia Zn (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar)+ finger protein (PLZF) (21Hyman J. Chen H., Di Fiore P.P., De Camilli P. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that βarr2 might also play the role of a transcription regulator, a potential function to be added to the growing list of biological functions carried out by β-arrestins.

Triggering of MH results in hypercontracture, hyperthermia, and eventually death. Therapeusis with dantrolene results from its effective suppression of skeletal muscle SR Ca2+ release, presumably by modulating the activity of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the primary Ca2+ release channel in skeletal muscle via that Ca2+ stored in the SR is released into the myoplasm to initiate muscle contraction in response to membrane depolarization (1Fruen B.R.

Given the controversy as to the mechanism and, hence, the targets of dantrolene action, we have embarked on a project to directly identify the molecular target(s) of dantrolene by photoaffinity labeling. Knowing the target(s) of dantrolene binding would allow genetic and physiological manipulation of these molecular entities to not only elucidate the mechanism of action of this drug but also provide insights into the in vivo mechanisms controlling the RYR1 Ca2+ release channel in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling and the pathophysiology of MH. Recently, we have demonstrated that [3H]azidodantrolene, a pharmacologically active, photoaffinity analog of dantrolene, specifically labels the N-terminal, 1400-amino acid residue fragment of RyR1 cleaved by n-calpain, a tissue-specific isoform of this Ca2+- and thiol-activated protease (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that this portion of the RyR plays a significant role in the regulation of channel function (14Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol.

Additionally, the nine, N-terminal mutations in RyR1 linked to MH alluded to above are localized within this region of the channel. The DHPR and RyR1 are intimate physiological partners during skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. The evidence indicates that the DHPR is the voltage sensor in the T-tubule membrane that upon sensing depolarization undergoes a conformational change associated with intramolecular charge movement. This is believed to result in the movement of the intracellular loop between transmembrane domains II and III (II–III loop) of the DHPR α-1 subunit, which physically contacts the RyR1, inducing its opening and resultant Ca2+ release from the SR (for reviews see Refs. 19Protasi F.

Previous studies have demonstrated the experimental utility of using synthetic domain peptides derived from the DHPR and RyR1 to define physiologically significant domains within the parent protein. In particular, peptides A and C of the DHPR II–III loop and domain peptides DP1 and DP4 of the RyR1 have been shown to be active in in vitro studies of excitation-contraction coupling (21El Hayek R.

Interestingly, DP1 and DP4 are from the N-terminal and central regions of the RyR1 that are “hot spots” for mutations conferring sensitivity to MH and/or the rare myopathy, central core disease (24Ikemoto N. Yamamoto T. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D671-D683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used these peptides as potential in vitro targets for [3H]azidodantrolene photoaffinity labeling, as well as others from RyR1 not demonstrated to have physiological activity as negative controls, in our attempt to define the dantrolene-binding sequence(s) in these proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate specific [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of two domain peptides containing the core sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 590–609 on RyR1-DP1 (amino acids 590–609) and DP1–2s, an elongated version of the skeletal sequence present in DP1 (590–628). A monoclonal anti-RyR1 antibody raised against rabbit terminal cisternae (25Campbell K.P. Knudson C.M. Imagawa T. Leung A.T. Sutko J.L. Kahl S.D. Raab C.R. Madson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6460-6463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that recognizes both the intact rabbit RyR1 and the 172 kDa, n-calpain-cleaved, N-terminal fragment of this channel (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), also recognizes these synthetic RyR1 peptides. This antibody specifically inhibited [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of RyR1 in SR in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate, therefore, that the dantrolene-binding site on RyR1 is comprised of amino acids 590–509. Dantrolene sodium·3.5H2O and azumolene sodium·2H2O were generous gifts of Proctor & Gamble (Norwich, NY). Polyclonal sheep anti-rabbit RyR1, monoclonal mouse (IgM) anti-rabbit RyR1 XA7 (mAb), and polyclonal rabbit anti-rabbit RyR1 C-terminal (raised against a synthetic C-terminal RyR1 peptide corresponding to amino acids 5023–5037) antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. K. P. Campbell (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle was supplied by Dr. H. Weiss (UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ). [3H]Azidodantrolene was synthesized, purified, and characterized exactly as described (26Palnitkar S.S. Bin B. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Paul-Pletzer K. Parness J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the specific activity was determined to be 28 Ci/mmol. Rabbit RyR1 domain peptides (DP1, DP1–2s, DP4, DP3, and DP7), DP1 scrambled peptide SCR1, and rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR α1 subunit peptides (PepA and PepC) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 A synthesizer and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described (21El Hayek R.

Scrambled DP1 sequences were generated by computer program, and SCR1 and SCR4 sequences were picked for subsequent synthesis. The entire cDNA of RyR1 was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRRS11 under the control of the SV40 promoter. Plasmid pRRS11 was introduced into CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE-mediated gene transfection method, as described previously (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar, 29Wabl M. Steinberg C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stable clones of CHO cells permanently transfected with RyR1 were selected using G418 (30Bhat M.B. Hayek S.M. Zhao J. Zang W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. Biophys.

Crude SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle in the presence of protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2.8 μm pepstatin A) as described in Ref. 32Hawkes M.J. Diaz Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Membr. Biochem. 1989; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Microsomal membranes from CHO cells were obtained by ultracentrifugation of cell lysates prepared after sonication of cultured cells, as described (30Bhat M.B. Hayek S.M. Zhao J. Zang W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 808-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Leupeptin was specifically omitted from buffers used in membrane preparation to specifically allow for n-calpain cleavage of RyR1 and subsequent identification of its 172-kDa, N-terminal fragment, if present (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Shevchenko S. Feng W. Varsanyi M. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SR vesicles (100 μg) and CHO microsomal membranes (200 μg) were photolabeled with [3H]azidodantrolene (100–200 nm) in binding buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7, containing 0.5 mm AMP-PCP) in the absence (T, total binding) or presence (N, nonspecific binding) of azumolene (150–300 μm), as described previously (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For inhibition of photolabeling by mAb anti-RyR1, mouse ascites were added to the binding buffer at dilutions of 1:50, 1:25, and 1:10 in the presence of protease inhibitors (see “Membrane Preparation” above) with the addition of 1 mm leupeptin. Synthetic peptides (12.5 μM) were photolabeled with 50–100 nm[3H]azidodantrolene in binding buffer containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in the absence of AMP-PCP. Following photolabeling, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (5% acrylamide for SR samples and 20% for synthetic peptides) (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). For autoradiography and Western blot analyses, the SDS-PAGE resolved proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Sequi-Blot; Bio-Rad) (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed as described (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Western blots, the membranes were probed with primary antibody at appropriate dilution/concentration (polyclonal anti-RyR1, 1:5000; mAb, 1:1000), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/p- nitro blue tetrazolium using standard procedures. The autoradiograph was scanned using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe) software and the image was saved as a tif file. The saved image was analyzed using ImageQuant for Windows NTTM software (Molecular Dynamics and AmershamBiosciences), and the radiolabeled bands were quantified. The arbitrary values were normalized after subtracting for background and nonspecific binding and expressed as percentages of control values. Of the 5037 amino acids that constitute the RyR1 sequence, we have shown that a dantrolene-binding site resides between amino acids 1 and 1400 of the N-terminal region of the channel (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In an attempt to devise a molecular biological approach to define the amino acids that comprise the dantrolene-binding site, we first asked whether RyR1 is capable of specifically interacting with dantrolene in the absence of a muscle cell background. We reasoned that if it did, (a) this would corroborate our finding that the RyR1 is a pharmacological target of dantrolene and (b) we might reasonably attempt to express a region of the N-terminal portion of the channel that would retain its ability to bind dantrolene and assist us in localization of the drug-binding site. We used recombinant RyR1, stably expressed in CHO cells, as a target for our photoaffinity labeling experiments. Microsomal membranes prepared from these cells, along with rabbit skeletal muscle SR vesicles as positive control, were photolabeled with [3H]azidodantrolene in the presence or absence of AMP-PCP and excess azumolene, as described under “Experimental Procedures”. As shown in Fig. 1 A, specific photolabeling of a 565-kDa protein corresponding to the RyR1 monomer in SR was observed in CHO microsomal membranes expressing RyR1. This photolabeling was dependent on the presence of AMP-PCP. This is identical to the requirements for photolabeling of RyR1 and its 172-kDa fragment in SR reported previously (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Western blot (Fig1 B) of the same membrane used for autoradiography, probed with a polyclonal anti-RyR1 antibody, demonstrates equivalent protein loading in all the experimental lanes and confirms that the radiolabeled band in CHO cell extracts is indeed RyR1. No specific photolabeling or anti-RyR1 immunoreactive bands were observed in membranes prepared from untransfected CHO cells. These results demonstrate that (a) dantrolene can bind to heterologously expressed RyR1 in the absence of other muscle-specific proteins and (b) this binding is pharmacologically specific and dependent on adenine nucleotide triphosphate, a known regulator of the channel protein. To determine the amino acids on RyR1 that constitute the binding site for dantrolene, we attempted to specifically photolabel a heterologously expressed, green fluorescent protein-tagged, RyR1-N-terminal fragment containing amino acids 182–1608. This fragment did not label, presumably because of incorrect folding or processing (data not shown). We then turned to synthetic domain peptides of RyR1 as possible surrogate targets for the dantrolene-binding site. We synthesized four peptides with amino acid residues from within the N-terminal, 1400-amino acid region of RyR1 (DP1, DP1–2s, DP3, and DP7), as well as peptides from the central region of RyR1 (DP4) and from the II–III loop of the DHPR-α1 subunit (PepA and PepC) (Fig. 2). These peptides were photoreacted with [3H]azidodantrolene in the presence or the absence of excess azumolene, and the peptides were analyzed for specific photolabeling by autoradiography. The autoradiograph in Fig. 3 Ademonstrates specific photolabeling of DP1 (amino acid residues 590–609) and an elongated version of DP1, DP1–2s (amino acid residues 590–628). DP7 (amino acid residues 543–576) was nonspecifically labeled, whereas the other peptides were not labeled at all. The pharmacological specificity of [3H]azidodantrolene labeling of DP1 was demonstrated by the ability of dantrolene and azumolene, but not the unrelated drug, atropine, to inhibit this interaction (Fig. 3 B). In addition, scrambling of the DP1 sequence (Fig. 3 D, SCR1 and SCR4) led only to nonspecific labeling of varying intensity (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that DP1 might represent an in vitromodel of the dantrolene-binding site on RyR1.Figure 3[3H]Azidodantrolene photolabeling of synthetic peptides. A, synthetic peptides were photolabeled with [3H]azidodantrolene in the absence (lanes T) or the presence of azumolene (lanes N), resolved on 20% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. B, pharmacological specificity of photolabeling of DP1 was determined in the absence (lane T) or presence of 150 μmazumolene (lane Az), 25 μm dantrolene (Dn), 150 μm atropine (lane At), an unrelated drug as negative control.

Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given the epitope specificity of monoclonal antibodies and that the epitope of this monoclonal seemed to be on the 172-kDa protein, we reasoned that it was possible that one of our domain peptides corresponding to sequences from the N-terminal region of RyR1 might interact with this antibody. If it did, it would demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic peptides to mimic a protein epitope in this channel. First, to confirm our earlier results described above, we demonstrated that only intact RyR1 and its 172-kDa N-terminal fragment were reactive with the monoclonal antibody by photolabeling duplicate SR samples with [3H]azidodantrolene, electroblotting these onto PVDF membranes after SDS-PAGE, and probing one sample with mAb anti-RyR1 and the other with polyclonal anti-RyR1 C-terminal antibody. Fig.4 A clearly demonstrates that the mAb recognizes [3H]azidodantrolene-labeled RyR1 monomer and its 172-kDa fragment but not the C-terminal, 410-kDa portion of the channel. The anti-RyR1 C-terminal antibody, on the other hand, recognizes the [3H]azidodantrolene-labeled RyR1 monomer and its 410-kDa, C-terminal fragment but not its 172-kDa N-terminal fragment (Fig. 4 B). This indicated to us that the epitope of mAb, hitherto unknown, must lie within the first 1400 residues of the N-terminal region of RyR1. To determine whether any of our RyR1 domain peptides could be recognized by this antibody, we resolved the peptides on a 20% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred them onto PVDF membrane, and probed the latter with mAb anti-RyR1. Only DP1 and DP1–2s, both of which share the same corresponding core of amino acid residues (590–609) of RyR1, were recognized by the mAb (Fig. 5 A). The scrambled DP1 peptides SCR1 and SCR4 were not recognized by the antibody (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that the epitope for the mAb is contained within the DP1 sequence.Figure 5Immunorecognition of DP1 sequence-containing peptides by mAb anti-RyR1. RyR1 domain peptides, DP1, DP1–2s, DP7, and DP4; DHPR II–III loop peptide; and PepA (A) and scrambled DP1 peptides SCR1 and SCR4 (B) were resolved on a 20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane and probed with mAb anti-RyR1. Only the DP1 sequence-containing peptides are recognized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Significantly, the results presented above demonstrate a parallelism between mAb recognition and specific [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of a sequence in the N-terminal of RyR1. The intersection of these two sets of data predicts that mAb anti-RyR1 should inhibit [3H]azidodantrolene labeling of RyR1 in SR. To test this hypothesis, we photolabeled SR in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of mAb-containing mouse ascites. The autoradiograph (Fig.6 A) reveals a concentration-dependent inhibition of specific photolabeling of both the RyR1 monomer, as well as its 172-kDa fragment; this was despite equivalent anti-RyR1 immunoreactive protein loading in each lane (Fig. 6 B). Quantitation of the inhibition of photolabeling revealed near linear inhibition over the mAb concentration range tested, particularly for the 172-kDa fragment (Fig. 6 C). The linearity of inhibition of photolabeling of intact RyR1 by mAb anti-RyR1 is less evident in this autoradiograph because of its high concentration and the degree of photolabeling relative to the N-terminal fragment. Optimizing exposure for the inhibition of photolabeling of the 172-kDa fragment results in near saturation of the sensitivity of the x-ray film for the labeling of the 565-kDa RyR1 monomer (data not shown). As a result, the two inhibition curves are not entirely parallel. This does not negate the phenomenon of specific inhibition of [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of both forms of the channel protein, n-calpain-cleaved and uncleaved. Moreover, inhibition of labeling is not due to nonspecific effects of IgM itself, because purified mouse IgM at the highest concentration used in mouse ascites did not affect photolabeling of either the intact channel or its 172-kDa fragment (Fig. 6 A). It is our hypothesis that understanding the molecular mechanism of action of dantrolene will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of MH, the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling, and the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ release from SR. A prerequisite for elucidating molecular mechanism requires the identification of molecular target(s). The biochemical identification of amino acids involved in drug binding allows for the design of mutational experiments to test their functional significance in drug action. Here, we have amassed evidence that the amino acid sequence of the dantrolene-binding site on RyR1 corresponds to amino acids 590–609, corresponding to the synthetic domain peptide DP1. The most compelling evidence for the DP1 sequence being the dantrolene-binding sequence in RyR1 comes from our experiments with the monoclonal antibody, mAb anti-RyR1. In 1987, Campbell et al.(25Campbell K.P. Knudson C.M. Imagawa T. Leung A.T. Sutko J.L. Kahl S.D. Raab C.R. Madson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6460-6463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) produced an IgM anti-RyR1 mAb, clone XA7, of uncharacterized epitope, that specifically immunoprecipitates [3H]ryanodine-bound RyR1. Our present studies demonstrate that this antibody recognizes its epitope not only on the RyR1 monomer and its 172-kDa, N-terminal, calpain cleavage fragment but also on the synthetic peptides, DP1 and DP1–2s, containing the core RyR1 sequence 590–609. Most significantly, this antibody specifically inhibits [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of RyR1 and its 172-kDa fragment in SR in a concentration-dependent manner. This result is consistent with our earlier experiments demonstrating the absence of a dantrolene-binding site on RyR1 C-terminal to the n-calpain cleavage site between amino acids 1400–1401 (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fact that we were able to demonstrate virtually complete inhibition of [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of the 172-kDa fragment with a monoclonal antibody is a strong argument that the epitope defined by this antibody, amino acids 590–609, represents the only dantrolene-binding site on RyR1. The relatively high concentrations (<1:50 dilution) of mouse ascites required to bring about inhibition of specific photolabeling is likely due to the low antigen affinities of IgM antibodies, which are part of the early immune response of the body, relative to mature IgG antibodies (29Wabl M. Steinberg C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data also strengthen the experimental evidence that, in vitro, synthetic domain peptides are capable of assuming the native conformation(s) of domains present in the parent protein, RyR1 in this case (35Villen J. Borras E. Schaaper W.M. Meloen R.H. Davila M. Domingo E. Giralt E. Andreu D. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36De Ferrari G.V. Canales M.A. Shin I. Weiner L.M. Silman I. Inestrosa N.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10447-10457Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 37Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies have already shown that heterologously expressed RyR1 in CHO cells forms functional channels (38Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and allowed us to address the question of whether dantrolene binding to RyR1 requires the presence of muscle-specific factors in heterologously expressed channels. Here, we have demonstrated that RyR1 can interact directly with dantrolene in the absence of a muscle-specific milieu. That this interaction is modulated by AMP-PCP, as it is in SR (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), substantiates our assertion that this drug-channel interaction is pharmacologically relevant. It further indicates that this nucleotide analog affects RyR1 directly in enhancing the ability of this channel to bind dantrolene. Specific photolabeling of the synthetic peptide, DP1, on the other hand, should be independent of all specific regulators of RyR1 activity, because none of the putative nucleotide or protein regulatory sites on RyR1 would be expected to be associated with this 20-amino acid peptide. Indeed, our data demonstrate that [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of the two DP1 sequence-containing peptides is independent of AMP-PCP (data not shown). Although we have presented strong evidence that the dantrolene-binding site on RyR1 is modulated by this nucleotide analog, it is not yet clear how ATP might modulate the activity of this drugin vivo. A recent, detailed examination of the possible physiological site(s) of dantrolene action in skeletal muscle has shown that dantrolene suppresses but never completely eliminates intracellular Ca2+ release in whole and skinned muscle fibers or from SR vesicles but has no effect on purified RyR1 incorporated into lipid bilayers (10Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results led those authors to conclude that RyR1 is not likely the site of action of dantrolene. This result is in stark contrast to our results above and those of Nelson and colleagues (11Nelson T.E. Lin M. Zapata-Sudo G. Sudo R.T. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Possible unifying explanations of these disparate results are likely to be methodologic and could include the following: (a) the dantrolene-binding site on RyR1 is uniquely sensitive to modification during the purification process rendering it dantrolene insensitive under certain as yet undefined conditions or (b) the physiological effects of dantrolene binding to RyR1 requires the interaction of other RyR1 interacting factors that might be removed during purification or whose interactions are not modeled well in the artificial lipid bilayer. Comparing the DP1 sequence in RyR1 with the other rabbit isoforms reveals that there is an identical sequence in RyR2 (601–619) and a nearly identical one in RyR3 (577–597), with a conservative amino acid substitution (Val to Leu) at position 596 (39Takeshima H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If this sequence is the dantrolene-binding site, all three should be sensitive to this drug. Yet, existing evidence indicates that only the RyR1 and RyR3 isoforms are sensitive to dantrolene. We have shown by [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of SR vesicles prepared from skeletal or cardiac muscle that only RyR1 is a good target for dantrolene, not RyR2 (13Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, other laboratories have shown that dantrolene can inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 and RyR3 but not RyR2 (1Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Zhao F., Li, P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). If the DP1 sequence is the dantrolene-binding site, why is the RyR2 isoform insensitive to this drug when it contains the identical sequence? The most likely explanation at our present state of knowledge is that the domain-domain interactions within RyR2 constrain the conformation around this sequence so that dantrolene is no longer able to bind with high affinity to this site. Other possible explanations include RyR2-associated proteins or post-translational modifications of the channel that block access to the site. The underlying reasons for the differences in dantrolene sensitivity of RyR2 relative to RyR1 are under active investigation in our laboratory. As noted above, the DP1 sequence of RyR1 is nearly identical in RyR3. Whether this isoform is responsive to dantrolene in the organs in which this isoform is expressed remains to be clarified. Early studies indicated that dantrolene has no effect on smooth muscle contractility (41Sengupta C. Meyer U.A. Carafoli E. FEBS Lett. 1980; 117: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although more recent studies contradict that (42Nasu T. Oosako H. Shibata H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, the latter studies are strongly supported by the demonstration that heterologously expressed RyR3 has been shown to be responsive to dantrolene (12Zhao F., Li, P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). If RyR3 is indeed a target of dantrolene, then this last result might explain the various effects of dantrolene seen in nonmuscle tissues that express RyR3, i.e. neuronal and immune cells (43Lokuta A.J. Komai H. McDowell T.S. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Hosoi E. Nishizaki C. Gallagher K.L. Wyre H.W. Matsuo Y. Sei Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4887-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, Ikemoto and co-workers (21El Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol.

These authors have postulated that DP1 may be assuming the native conformation of the identical sequence in the channel (domain x), thereby competing with this domain for its interacting or “mating” domain (domain y) on RyR1, resulting in “unzipping” of the native RyR1 domain x-domain y interactions (24Ikemoto N. Yamamoto T. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D671-D683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Ikemoto N. Yamamoto T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 45Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If, under normal resting conditions, domain x-domain y interactions would keep the channel in a closed state, unzipping these interactions should result in activation of the channel. It follows then that the insinuation of DP1 into the normal domain x position, mating or zipping to domain y of RyR1, would result in loss of the conformational constraints imparted by these zipped domains and lead to channel opening. If the above is true, then the most parsimonious explanation of the results to date is that dantrolene inhibits RyR1-mediated Ca2+ release by stabilizing the interdomain x-y interactions. Moreover, dantrolene stabilization of these interdomain interactions may even result in stabilization of other protein domain-domain interactions, either within RyR1 or with another interacting protein(s) or both, thus reducing the likelihood of channel openings and inhibiting Ca2+ release. Elucidation of the identity of the putative interacting domain(s) and modeling of the dantrolene-binding site in the three channel isoforms would greatly contribute to our understanding of the regulation of RyR channel function.

The biological consequences of this signaling pathway are important because the levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation are frequently elevated in cancer cells. In the classic paradigm, tyrosine kinases promote tumor cell growth, survival, and invasiveness, whereas tyrosine phosphatases negatively regulate these same behaviors. Here, we identify one particular tyrosine phosphatase, low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), which is frequently overexpressed in transformed cells. We also show that overexpression of LMW-PTP is sufficient to confer transformation upon non-transformed epithelial cells. Notably, we show that the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is a prominent substrate for LMW-PTP and that the oncogenic activities of LMW-PTP result from altered EphA2 expression and function. These results suggest a role for LMW-PTP in transformation progression and link its oncogenic potential to EphA2.

These biological behaviors often result from genetic and environmental abnormalities that work together to trigger specific signaling pathways that promote inappropriate cell growth and survival. In particular, increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation are understood to initiate powerful signals that govern many different aspects of cell behavior (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). A popular paradigm suggests that a balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities determines the cellular levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and thereby governs cellular decisions regarding growth, survival, and invasiveness (2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). This model predicts that tyrosine kinases are oncogenic, whereas tyrosine phosphatases negatively regulate transformation. Although this paradigm has generally been supported by the identification of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, emerging evidence reveals a more complex interplay between tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. For example, the PTP(CAAX) tyrosine phosphatase has been recently implicated as an oncogene (3Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzymatic activity of Src family kinases is liberated by phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues (4Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2897-2903PubMed Google Scholar, 5Liu X. Pawson T. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter situation, phosphatases can actually up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation by increasing the enzymatic activity of kinases. The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in a large number of human cancers. High levels of EphA2 apply to a large number of different cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, and lung carcinomas as well as metastatic melanomas (6Rosenberg I.M. Goke M. Kanai M.

The highest levels of EphA2 are consistently found on the most aggressive cell models of human cancer (9Walker-Daniels J. Coffman K. Azimi M. Rhim J.S. Bostwick D.G. Snyder P. Kerns B.J. Waters D.J. Kinch M.S. Prostate. 1999; 41: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3640-3648PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, EphA2 is not simply a marker of transformed disease as ectopic overexpression of EphA2 confers tumorigenic and metastatic potential upon non-transformed epithelial cells (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its overexpression, EphA2 is functionally altered in transformed cells as compared with non-transformed epithelia (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, EphA2 is prominently tyrosine phosphorylated in non-transformed epithelial cells. Yet, despite its overexpression, the EphA2 in transformed cells is not tyrosine phosphorylated (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Stewart J.C. Hansen R.K. Robinson D. Miao H. Wang B. Kung H.J. Bissell M.J. Kinch M.S. Clin.

Recent studies indicate that these differences in EphA2 phosphotyrosine content are important because tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 causes it to interact with downstream signaling components that function to negatively regulate cell growth and invasiveness (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S.

In contrast, unphosphorylated EphA2 appears to adopt a different subcellular localization and interacts with different substrates (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Stewart J.C. Hansen R.K. Robinson D. Miao H. Wang B. Kung H.J. Bissell M.J. Kinch M.S. Clin.

Most importantly, recent studies have shown that unphosphorylated EphA2 functions as a powerful oncoprotein, whereas restoration of EphA2 phosphotyrosine content is sufficient to reverse the oncogenic potential of EphA2 (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S.

Based on the differential behaviors of EphA2 in normal and transformed cells, our laboratory has been investigating the regulation of EphA2 phosphotyrosine content. Our recent studies have centered upon evidence that cancer cells often demonstrate decreased cell-cell contacts (17Birchmeier W. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Volberg T. Geiger B. Dror R. Zick Y. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which destabilize ligand binding (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Our present studies investigate an additional possibility, which is that the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 in transformed cells is negatively regulated by an associated phosphatase. We affirm this hypothesis and identify LMW-PTP1 as a phosphatase that regulates EphA2. Human LMW-PTP has been cloned, sequenced, expressed, and structurally characterized (20Wo Y.Y. Zhou M.M. Stevis P. Davis J.P. Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Bryson G.L. Massa H. Trask B.J. Van E. RL.

We also demonstrate that LMW-PTP is overexpressed in many transformed cell lines and that overexpression of LMW-PTP is sufficient to confer transformation upon non-transformed epithelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the oncogenic activities of LMW-PTP require EphA2. Human breast (MCF-10Aneo, MCF-10AneoST, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, SK-BR-3) epithelial cells were cultured as described previously (23Paine T.M. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Dawson P.J. Int. J.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (PY20) and β-catenin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (4G10) and EphA2 (clone D7) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against vinculin were purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Purified LMW-PTP was prepared as described (20Wo Y.Y. Zhou M.M. Stevis P. Davis J.P. Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were harvested and normalized for equal loading as described previously (18Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To confirm equal loading, blots were stripped as described previously and reprobed with antibodies specific to β-catenin or vinculin (18Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of EphA2 or LMW-PTP were performed using rabbit anti-mouse (Chemicon, Temecula, CA)-conjugated protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) as described previously (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm equal loading, blots were stripped as described previously and reprobed with EphA2- or LMW-PTP-specific antibodies (18Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were performed on normalized cell lysates and immunoprecipitations as detailed (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce) and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-OMAT; Eastman Kodak Co.). “Calcium switch” experiments were performed as described previously using MCF-10Aneo cells grown to 70% confluence in medium containing a final concentration of 4 mm EGTA (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Pervanadate was added to MDA-MB-231 in monolayer culture at a final concentration of 0, 1, 10, or 100 μm, and the treatment was allowed to incubate for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For the combined EGTA-pervanadate treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells were first treated with 100 μm pervanadate and were then subjected to the EGTA treatment. To evaluate LMW-PTP activity against EphA2, EphA2 was immunoprecipitated from MCF-10Aneo cells and incubated with purified LMW-PTP protein at a concentration of 0.45, 7.8, or 62 μg/ml for 0, 5, 15, or 30 min. The assay was terminated through the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphotyrosine content of the EphA2 in the treatments was then observed using immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to phosphotyrosine. To determine in vitro autophosphorylation activity, immunoprecipitated EphA2 was evaluated using in vitro kinase assays as detailed previously (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of MCF-10Aneo cells were grown to 30–50% confluence and were transfected with pcDNA3.1-LMW-PTP or pcDNA3.1-LMW-PTPD129A using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). As a control for the transfection procedure, empty pcDNA3.1 vector was transfected into the same cell line in parallel. Transient transfections were allowed to grow for 48 h after transfection. For stable lines, neomycin-resistant cells were selected in growth medium containing 16 μg/ml neomycin (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). To confirm LMW-PTP overexpression, immunoblot analysis was performed using LMW-PTP-specific antibodies. Parental cells and cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector were used as negative controls. To evaluate cell growth using monolayer assays, 1 × 105 cells were seeded into tissue culture-treated multiwell dishes for 1, 2, 4, or 6 days in triplicate experiments. Cell numbers were evaluated by trypsin suspension of the samples followed by microscopic evaluation using a hemacytometer. Soft agar colony formation was performed and quantified as detailed (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar,26Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Gilmer T.M. Burridge K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments with EphA2 antisense, cells were incubated with oligonucleotides prior to suspension in soft agar. The data shown are representative of at least three different experiments. Monolayers of MCF-10Aneo cells and MCF-10A cells stably overexpressing LMW-PTP were grown to 30% confluence and were transfected with EphA2 antisense oligonucleotides as detailed (13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar). Samples that had been transfected with an inverted EphA2 antisense oligonucleotide or with the transfection reagent alone provided negative controls. Several independent lines of investigation suggested that EphA2 is regulated by an associated tyrosine phosphatase. EphA2 was rapidly dephosphorylated in non-transformed MCF-10Aneo epithelial cells upon disruption of ligand binding. Immunoblot analysis with phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20 or 4G10) indicated lower levels of EphA2 phosphotyrosine content within 5 min following EGTA treatment, which destabilizes EphA2-ligand binding (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 decreased following incubation of non-transformed epithelial cells with dominant-negative inhibitors of EphA2-ligand binding (e.g. EphA2-Fc, not shown). Similar results were obtained using multiple non-transformed epithelial cell systems, including MCF-12A, MCF10-2, HEK293, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (not shown). Based on these findings, we asked whether tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors could prevent the loss of EphA2 phosphotyrosine content in response to EGTA treatment. Indeed, inhibitors such as sodium orthovanadate prevented the decrease in EphA2 phosphotyrosine following treatment of MCF-10Aneo cells with EGTA (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies by our laboratory have shown that the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 is greatly reduced in transformed epithelial cells as compared with non-transformed epithelia (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether tyrosine phosphatase activity could contribute to the reduced phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 in transformed cells. Although EphA2 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in transformed breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-435, MCFneoST, or PC-3 cells), incubation with increasing concentrations of sodium orthovanadate induced vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 (Fig. 1 C). As vanadate treatment of cells can often lead to exaggerated phosphorylation of physiologically irrelevant sites, we performed phosphopeptide mapping studies using EphA2 that had been labeled with [32P]ATP either in vitro or in vivo (not shown). These studies revealed identical patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation in non-transformed MCF-10Aneo cells and vanadate-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (not shown). Although the cytoplasmic domain contains multiple sites that could have been phosphorylated promiscuously, these were not phosphorylated under the conditions utilized here, suggesting that vanadate had not increased the phosphorylation of irrelevant sites. Altogether, these results indicate that EphA2 is regulated by an associated phosphatase that suppresses EphA2 phosphotyrosine content in transformed cells. To identify tyrosine phosphatases that might regulate EphA2 in transformed cells, we considered a recent report that LMW-PTP regulates a related molecule, EphB4 (27Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. VanEtten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments began by assessing the expression and function of LMW-PTP in non-transformed (MCF-10Aneo) and transformed (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231) mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analyses of whole cell lysates revealed relatively high levels of LMW-PTP in tumor-derived breast cancer cells as compared with non-transformed MCF-10Aneo mammary epithelial cells. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against a control protein (vinculin), verifying that the high levels of LMW-PTP did not reflect a loading error or a generalized increase in protein levels in the transformed cells. A transformed variant of MCF-10Aneo, MCFneoST, also demonstrated elevated LMW-PTP expression, which was intriguing based on a recent report that EphA2 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in those cells (11Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Stewart J.C. Hansen R.K. Robinson D. Miao H. Wang B. Kung H.J. Bissell M.J. Kinch M.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3640-3648PubMed Google Scholar). The use of a genetically matched system also precluded potential differences due to cell origin or culture conditions. Thus, the highest levels of LMW-PTP were consistently found in transformed epithelial cells and were inversely related to EphA2 phosphotyrosine content. The results suggested that LMW-PTP negatively regulates the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 in tumor cells. To explore this hypothesis further, we first asked whether the two molecules interactedin vivo. EphA2 was immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-231 cells using specific antibodies (clone D7), and these complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Subsequent immunoblot analyses revealed that LMW-PTP was prominently found within EphA2 immune complexes (Fig.3 A). The inverse experiment confirmed that EphA2 could similarly be detected in complexes of immunoprecipitated LMW-PTP (Fig. 3 B). Control immunoprecipitations with irrelevant antibodies confirmed the specificity of the interactions of the two molecules (not shown). The co-immunoprecipitation studies did not clarify whether EphA2 can serve as a substrate for LMW-PTP. To address this directly, EphA2 was immunoprecipitated from MCF-10Aneo cells, where it is normally tyrosine phosphorylated. The EphA2 immune complexes were then incubated with different concentrations of purified LMW-PTP before immunoblot analyses of EphA2 with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (PY20 and 4G10). These experiments demonstrated that purified LMW-PTP could dephosphorylate EphA2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Although in vitro studies indicated that EphA2 could be dephosphorylated by LMW-PTP in vitro, we recognized thatin vitro studies are not always representative of the corresponding situation in vivo. Thus, LMW-PTP was ectopically overexpressed in MCF-10A cells. This particular cell system was selected because non-transformed MCF-10A cells have low levels of endogenous LMW-PTP and because the EphA2 in these non-transformed epithelial cells is normally tyrosine phosphorylated. Ectopic overexpression of LMW-PTP was achieved by stable transfection, as determined by immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies (Fig.5 A). Importantly, overexpression of LMW-PTP was sufficient to reduce the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 as compared with vector-transfected negative controls (Fig. 5 B). Identical results were obtained using different experiments with different transfectants and in both stably and transiently transfected samples (not shown), thus eliminating potential concerns about clonal variation. Moreover, the decreased phosphotyrosine content was specific for EphA2 as the overall phosphotyrosine content of LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells was not decreased (Fig. 5 C). Tyrosine phosphorylated EphA2 negatively regulates tumor cell growth, whereas unphosphorylated EphA2 acts as a powerful oncoprotein (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar, 13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether overexpression of LMW-PTP would be sufficient to induce transformation. To address this question, we utilized the MCF-10A cells, described above, which had been transfected with either wild-type LMW-PTP or a vector control. Our initial studies evaluated the growth rates of control and LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells in monolayer culture. When evaluated using standard, two-dimensional culture conditions, the growth rates of LMW-PTP-overexpressing MCF-10A cells were significantly lower than the growth rates of matched controls (p < 0.05) (Fig.6 A). Two-dimensional assessments of growth often do not reflect the transformed character of tumor cells. Instead, three-dimensional analyses of cell behavior using soft agar and reconstituted basement membranes can provide a more relevant way of assessing transformed behavior. Whereas vector-transfected MCF-10Aneo cells were largely incapable of colonizing soft agar, LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells formed an average of 4.9 colonies per high powered microscope field (p < 0.01; Fig. 6 B). Based on recent findings with other three-dimensional assay systems, we also evaluated cell behavior using three-dimensional, reconstituted basement membranes. Consistent with a more aggressive phenotype, microscopic assessment of cell behavior in Matrigel confirmed the transformed character of LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells (not shown). When plated atop or within Matrigel, LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells formed larger colonies than vector-transfected cells (not shown). Altogether, consistent results with multiple and different systems suggest that overexpression of LMW-PTP is sufficient to induce transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 induces its internalization and degradation (13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that overexpression of LMW-PTP might increase the protein levels of EphA2. Indeed, immunoblot analyses of whole cell lysates revealed higher levels of EphA2 in MCF-10A cells that overexpress LMW-PTP as compared with vector-transfected controls (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, this EphA2 was not tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B). However, immunoblot analyses revealed that the reduced phosphotyrosine content was selective for EphA2 as the general levels of phosphotyrosine were not altered in LMW-PTP-transformed cells (Fig. 5 C). The finding that overexpression of LMW-PTP increased EphA2 protein levels and decreased its phosphotyrosine content was intriguing since this phenotype was reminiscent of highly aggressive tumor cells (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar,12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether selective targeting of LMW-PTP in transformed cells would impact EphA2. To accomplish this, the catalytically inactive (28Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutant LMW-PTPD129A was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, which have high levels of wild-type LMW-PTP (Fig. 2) and which also have elevated levels of EphA2 that is hypo-phosphorylated. Ectopic overexpression of LMW-PTPD129Awas found to decrease the levels of EphA2. Moreover, immunoblot analyses of immunoprecipitated material demonstrated that EphA2 was tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 5 D). These results indicate that overexpression of wild-type LMW-PTP is necessary and sufficient to confer the overexpression and functional alterations of EphA2 that have been observed in tumor-derived cells. Although the EphA2 in the LMW-PTP-overexpressing MCF-10A cells was not tyrosine phosphorylated, it retained enzymatic activity. In vitro kinase assays verified that the EphA2 from LMW-PTP-transformed MCF-10A cells had levels of enzymatic activity that were comparable with vector-transfected controls (Fig.7 A). To verify equal sample loading, two controls were performed. Equal amounts of input lysate were verified by immunoblot analyses with β-catenin antibodies (not shown). In addition, the immunoprecipitated EphA2 was divided, and half of the material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analyses with EphA2 and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (Fig. 7, B and C). Thus phosphorylated and unphosphorylated EphA2 were both capable of enzymatic activity. Having determined that the levels of EphA2 were elevated in LMW-PTP-transformed cells, we asked to what extent the oncogenic activity of EphA2 contributed to this phenotype. To address this, we utilized our experience with antisense strategies to selectively decrease EphA2 expression in LMW-PTP-transformed cells (13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar, 29Hess A.R. Seftor E.A. Gardner L.M. Carles-Kinch K. Schneider G.B. Seftor R.E. Kinch M.S. Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3250-3255PubMed Google Scholar). We verified the success of these strategies by immunoblot analyses (Fig.8 A) and then asked whether decreased EphA2 expression would alter soft agar colonization. Indeed, transfection with EphA2 antisense oligonucleotides decreased the soft agar colonization of LMW-PTP-transformed MCF-10A cells by at least 87% (p < 0.01; Fig. 8 B). As a control, transfection of these cells with an inverted antisense nucleotide did not significantly alter soft agar colonization. Thus, we were able to exclude that the results with the antisense oligonucleotides had resulted from nonspecific toxicities caused by the transfection procedure. Altogether, our results indicate that the oncogenic actions of overexpressed LMW-PTP require high levels of EphA2. The major finding of our present study is that EphA2 is regulated by an associated tyrosine phosphatase, and we identify LMW-PTP as a critical regulator of EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that LMW-PTP is overexpressed in metastatic cancer cells and that LMW-PTP overexpression is sufficient to confer transformation upon non-transformed epithelial cells. Finally, we demonstrate that LMW-PTP up-regulates the expression of EphA2 and that the oncogenic activities of LMW-PTP require this overexpression of EphA2. Recent reports from our laboratory and others have shown that many transformed epithelial cells express high levels of EphA2 that is not tyrosine phosphorylated (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we had related these depressed levels of EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation with decreased ligand binding. Transformed cells often have unstable cell-cell contacts, and we postulated that this decreases the ability of EphA2 to stably interact with its ligands, which are anchored to the membrane of adjacent cells (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). In part, our present data suggest a new paradigm in which the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 is also negatively regulated by an associated tyrosine phosphatase that is overexpressed in transformed cells. Given the relationship between EphA2 phosphorylation and cell-cell adhesion, we cannot exclude that cell-cell contacts could also regulate the expression or function of LMW-PTP, and future investigation should address this possibility. The fact that high levels of LMW-PTP were observed in several different cell models of metastatic cancer is notable given that LMW-PTP overexpression is sufficient to confer transformation. LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells gain the ability to colonize soft agar and acquire a transformed phenotype when cultured in three-dimensional basement membranes, such as Matrigel. Notably, however, LMW-PTP-overexpressing MCF-10A epithelial cells displayed reduced rates of cell growth as measured using two-dimensional assays of cell growth. This latter observation is consistent with recent reports that high levels of LMW-PTP similarly decrease the monolayer growth rates of other cell types (30Shimizu H. Shiota M. Yamada N. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Kim S. Miyazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Fiaschi T. Chiarugi P. Buricchi F. Giannoni E. Taddei M.L. Talini D.

Although such a finding had been interpreted to suggest that LMW-PTP might negatively regulate transformation, our findings support a very different conclusion. Consistent with this, recent studies by our laboratory and others have shown that transformation of MCF-10A cells is often accompanied by decreased monolayer growth rates and that the most aggressive variants of MCF-10A in vivo demonstrate the slowest growth in monolayer culture (10Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Stewart J.C. Hansen R.K. Robinson D. Miao H. Wang B. Kung H.J. Bissell M.J. Kinch M.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3640-3648PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have implications for the design and interpretation of tests of oncogene function when using non-transformed epithelial cell systems. The biochemical consequences of EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation remain largely unclear. Unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases, for which autophosphorylation is necessary for enzymatic activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 is not required for its enzymatic activity. Consistent with our present results, EphA2 retains comparable levels of enzymatic activity in non-transformed and tumor-derived cells, despite dramatic differences in its phosphotyrosine content (12Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, antibody-mediated stimulation of EphA2 autophosphorylation does not change the levels of EphA2 enzymatic activity (13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide analyses of the EphA2 cytoplasmic domain provide one potential explanation. Although EphA2 has a predicted activation loop tyrosine at residue 772 (33Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), neither in vitro nor in vivophosphopeptide analyses have identified phosphorylation of this site in normal or malignant cells. 2M. S. Kinch, unpublished information. Thus, the lack of a consensus activation loop tyrosine may account for the retention of EphA2 enzymatic activity in cells where it is not tyrosine phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 does not appear to be necessary for its intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, ligand-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation regulates EphA2 protein stability (13Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 62: 2840-2847Google Scholar). Specifically, tyrosine phosphorylation fates EphA2 to interact with the c-Cbl adapter protein and to subsequently be internalized and degraded within proteosomes. 3Walker-Daniels, J., Riese, D. J., and Kinch, M. S. (2002) Cell Growth & Differ., in press. Consequently, the phosphatase activity of LMW-PTP would be predicted to increase EphA2 protein stability. Indeed, the highest levels of EphA2 are consistently found in cells with high levels of LMW-PTP. One interesting implication of this finding is that it provides a mechanism, independent of genetic regulation of the EphA2 gene, to explain why high levels of EphA2 are found in many different tumors. An alternative possibility is that LMW-PTP up-regulates EphA2 gene expression, and our present findings do not formally eliminate this possibility. The fact that EphA2 antisense oligonucleotides reversed the transformed character of LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells suggests that the up-regulation of EphA2 is relevant to the cellular behaviors of LMW-PTP-mediated transformation. In summary, our present studies identify LMW-PTP as a new oncogene that is overexpressed in transformed cells. We also link the biochemical and biological actions of overexpressed LMW-PTP with EphA2. These findings have important implications for understanding the biochemical and biological mechanisms that contribute to the metastatic progression of epithelial cells. Moreover, our present studies identify an important signaling system that could ultimately provide an opportunity to target the large number of cancer cells that overexpress EphA2 or LMW-PTP.

We also thank the current members of the Kinch and Van Etten laboratories for critical reading of the manuscript."

Here we show that there was an anomalous increase in the average diurnal temperature range (that is, the difference between the daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperatures) for the period 11-14 September 2001. Because persisting contrails can reduce the transfer of both incoming solar and outgoing infrared radiation and so reduce the daily temperature range, we attribute at least a portion of this anomaly to the absence of contrails over this period."

The model, when fitted to an 8 angstrom map of the Neurospora proton pump determined by electron microscopy, reveals the likely path of the proton through the membrane and shows that the nucleotide-binding domain rotates by approximately 70 degrees to deliver adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the phosphorylation site.

Functions include the repair of replication forks halted at DNA barriers such as DNA lesions and breaks and the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA arising from nonreplication sources. Central steps in these processes are carried out by recombinases such as the bacterial RecA protein or the eukaryotic Rad51 protein. These proteins bind first to single-stranded DNA within a gap or a DNA terminal extension, forming an extended nucleoprotein filament. The filament then initiates a search for homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)1 and pairs the bound single-stranded DNA with the complementary strand of the incoming duplex in a process known as DNA strand exchange. Synapsis is the point at which homologous alignment of the two DNAs is achieved, and reactions are often divided into presynaptic (nucleoprotein filament formation) and postsynaptic (extension of the paired DNA segment) phases. The Rad51 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiaepromotes a very efficient DNA strand exchange reaction under the right reaction conditions (1Sung P.

Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, generally referred to as SSBs, have a multitude of roles in DNA metabolism. As part of their role in genetic recombination, SSBs stimulate recombinase-mediated in vitro DNA strand exchange reactions. The SSB of S. cerevisiae is replication protein A, or RPA. RPA has been implicated in the recombination pathway genetically (3Longhese M.P. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Mol. Cell.

Banerjee R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although RPA stimulates most in vitro DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by the Rad51 protein, RPA is not required for Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange in reactions with oligonucleotides (2Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When much longer DNA derived from bacteriophages is used, formation of exchanged products of any kind is strongly dependent on RPA (10Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 11Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 12Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The importance of both presynaptic and postsynaptic roles for an SSB in recombinase-mediated strand exchange is illustrated by work onEscherichia coli recombination proteins. The SSB of E. coli, when prebound to ssDNA, inhibits the nucleation stage of RecA protein filament formation (13Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, once successful nucleation of RecA occurs on the DNA (via binding to a region vacated by SSB, the action of the RecOR mediator proteins, or simply adding RecA before SSB), the role of SSB becomes that of a presynaptic facilitator (14Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). SSB binds to and helps denature regions of secondary structure in the ssDNA that would otherwise hinder RecA filament extension and is then displaced by the growing RecA filament. SSB thus permits the formation of a contiguous extended filament on the DNA. Furthermore, upon the initiation of DNA strand exchange, the E. coli SSB facilitates the postsynaptic phase of the reaction by binding to the displaced DNA strand (15Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the model proposed by Lavery and Kowalczykowski (15Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of SSB to the displaced strand can prevent a reverse branch migration reaction and prevent reinitiation of exchange by the displaced strand. Kodadek was the first to propose a postsynaptic role for an SSB during the strand exchange reaction, focusing on the protein homologues in the T4 bacteriophage system (16Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20966-20969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work with the Streptococcus pneumoniae RecA and its cognate SSB demonstrates that SSB simultaneously inhibits presynaptic filament formation and strongly stimulates strand exchange, suggesting that, for this system at least, the postsynaptic role is a major one (17Steffen S.E. Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14493-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of RPA, work published to date has focused on presynaptic roles in which RPA facilitates the formation of complete Rad51 filaments on ssDNA through removal of DNA secondary structure (18Namsaraev E. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B.W. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Kowalczykowski and co-workers demonstrated that RPA stimulates Rad51 binding to ssDNA unless the ssDNA is devoid of secondary structure (10Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, they noted that optimal strand exchange in their system requires twice as much RPA as that required to stimulate maximal ATPase activity and suggested that RPA may be acting postsynaptically. The alignment of homologous DNAs during DNA strand exchange does not always result in the formation of exchanged products that survive deproteinization. A pairing structure that is completely dependent upon the continued presence of recombinase, referred to here as an enforced pairing, has been described previously. The E. coli RecA protein can mediate the formation of paranemic joints, or joints that are formed away from a DNA end, that extend for thousands of base pairs (21Bianchi M. Das Gupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Umlauf S.W. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16898-16912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a free end is not available to allow interwinding of the paired strands, the paranemic joints are not stable when deproteinized. Human Rad51 can also form paranemic joints, but this reaction has only been demonstrated with oligonucleotides with heterology at the ends (23Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A second type of enforced pairing has been demonstrated for human Rad51 using GC-rich oligonucleotides. Rad51 will align oligonucleotide substrates that have a 40% GC content but will not complete the exchange reaction (23Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that the Rad51 protein does efficiently and extensively pair φX174 substrates without the assistance of RPA. This pairing, however, is unstable once Rad51 protein is removed. The pairing survives deproteinization if RPA is present. The RPA-independent but Rad51-enforced pairing can alternatively be stabilized via degradation of the strand displaced during strand exchange by a single-strand exonuclease. This indicates that RPA stabilizes Rad51-mediated pairing of long substrates through sequestration of the displaced strand. The significance of this postsynaptic role is demonstrated by performing reactions under conditions that include a low magnesium concentration, which coincidentally are the optimal reaction conditions for Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange. These conditions minimize the necessity of secondary structure removal by RPA and, thus, the presynaptic role of RPA. Under conditions where RPA addition does little to stimulate presynaptic filament formation, RPA still strongly stimulates the formation of stably paired DNA molecules. The work indicates that RPA has a critical postsynaptic role in Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange. The yeast Rad51 protein was purified from the yeast strain LP2749–9B harboring plasmid pR51.3, which was provided by Patrick Sung (University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, Texas (1Sung P.

The supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation to give fraction II.

Lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl (80% cation), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and stored at −20 °C. Concentrations of single-stranded oligonucleotides were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using the extinction coefficients of 691.9 mm−1 cm−1 for A, 375.4 mm−1 cm−1 for B, and 385.3 mm−1 cm−1 for C. The 39-mer oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled and annealed as previously described without further gel purification (2Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Circular single-stranded φX174 virion DNA (5386 bases in length) was purchased from New England Biolabs. M13mp8 cssDNA was prepared as described (25Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of ssDNAs were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient, 9.03 mm−1 cm−1. Heterologous DNA for strand exchange controls was generated using the plasmid pBIIt2, which is the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) modified to include a 1,427-bp insert in the EcoRI site to yield a DNA that is 4388 bp in length. The insert contains the sequence of theCaenorhabditis remanei tra2 gene (GenBankTM number AF187965) from the 2123 EcoRI site to the 3550 EcoRI site (26Haag E.S. Kimble J. Genetics. 2000; 155: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar). The pBIIt2 plasmid DNA was linearized using NotI. Nicked circular φX174 DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. Linear double-stranded φX174 DNA was generated from a restriction digestion of φX174 replicative form I DNA (from Invitrogen) with either PstI (producing four nucleotide 3′ overhangs) or StuI (producing blunt ends). Double-stranded DNA concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient, 6.50 mm−1 cm−1. All DNA concentrations are given in terms of total nucleotides. Standard three-strand DNA exchange reactions with φX174 DNA substrates were carried out in 35 mm K-MOPS buffer (pH 7.2) with 2 mm ATP, 2.4 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 38 °C. Reactions included 20.8 μm cssDNA substrate, 6.8 μm Rad51 protein, 0.6 μm RPA, 20.8 μm PstI-cut lds φX174 DNA, and 4 mm spermidine, all final concentrations. A preincubation mixture was assembled, including the cssDNA and Rad51 protein with the buffer and ATP in a volume of 9 μl. After 5 min at 38 °C, the RPA was added in a 1.5 μl aliquot. RPA storage buffer is substituted for RPA where noted. After another 10 min, the lds φX174 DNA and spermidine were introduced to initiate strand exchange, bringing the final reaction volume to 12.5 μl. Reactions were scaled up as required. For the strand exchange time courses, 12.5-μl aliquots of larger reaction mixtures were removed at the indicated times and stopped with the addition of proteinase K to 0.4 mg/ml, SDS to 1%, and EDTA to 7 mm in a final volume of 15.6 μl. Deproteinization was carried out for 30 min at 38 °C. Reaction samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (80% cation), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) at 27 V, constant voltage, for ∼16 h. The substrate, product, and joint molecule bands were distinguishable after staining with ethidium bromide and exposure to ultraviolet light. Images were captured with a digital CCD camera using the GelExpert software (Nucleotech). Reaction progress was calculated either as the DNA present as joint molecules plus nicked-circular DNA product or, in some cases, as the nicked circular DNA product alone as a percentage of the total duplex DNA present in a gel lane. Band intensities were quantitated with the TotalLab software (Phoretix). Reactions with oligonucleotides were carried out under the same solution conditions as the basic reaction described above. The reactions contained 2 mm ATP, 2.4 mmMgCl2, 37.3 μm 70-mer ssDNA substrate, 13.6 μm Rad51 protein, 0.6 μm RPA, and 20.8 μm32P-labeled 39-mer dsDNA substrate (in terms of molecular concentration, the single-stranded oligonucleotides are in 2-fold excess to the duplex substrate). In controls the appropriate storage buffer was substituted for Rad51 or RPA proteins. Mixtures containing buffer, ATP, MgCl2, Rad51 protein, and the 70-mer oligonucleotide were preincubated at 38 °C for 5 min. RPA was then added followed by a second incubation for 5 min. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of the duplex 39-mer substrate and spermidine to 4 mm. Aliquots of 9 μl were removed at the indicated time points and stopped with the addition of EDTA and SDS to final concentrations of 28 mm and 1.4%, respectively, in a final volume of 14 μl. A gel-loading buffer (2.5% Ficoll (type 400), 0.08% bromphenol blue, 0.08% xylene cyanol FF, all final concentrations) was then added to each stopped aliquot followed by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide, 1× Tris/boric acid/EDTA gels. Bands were visualized by exposing PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics) for 30 min and scanning with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (model 425E). ATP hydrolysis activity was measured using a coupled enzyme assay described previously (27Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To have smaller reaction volumes, the protocol was modified to use cuvettes that held 65 μl, with a 1-cm path length, and light mineral oil was added to prevent evaporation of the sample during the assay. The reaction was the same as the basic reaction described for the three-strand exchange reaction with φX174 DNA except that each included 8.4 units/μl pyruvate kinase, 8.4 units/μl lactate dehydrogenase,1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 1.5 mm NADH to couple ATP hydrolysis to the oxidation of NADH. Reactions were initiated in a test tube by preincubating Rad51 with either φX174 or M13mp8 cssDNA. After 5 min at 38 °C, either RPA or RPA storage buffer was added. The reactions were then transferred to pre-warmed cuvettes and covered with a layer of mineral oil, and absorbance data were collected at 38 °C at 380 nm. A background reading was obtained by substituting Tris-EDTA for DNA, and this background was subtracted from the raw data to obtain the final data set. An NADH extinction coefficient of 1.21 mmcm−1 was used to determine the rate of loss of NADH by conversion to NAD, which is equivalent to the conversion of ATP to ADP. Reaction conditions were the same as described for the basic three-strand exchange reaction with φX174 DNA, except that the incubations with RPA or RPA storage buffer were extended to 20 min to ensure stable filament formation. After the incubation with RPA or RPA storage buffer, reaction mixtures were diluted 200 times with 41.7 mm K-MOPS (pH 7.2), 2.9 mm MgCl2, 67 mm KCl, and 2.4 mm ATP and then immediately adsorbed to a glow discharge activated carbon film attached to an electron microscope grid. The grid was then touched to the surface of a drop of the same solution for 1 min. The sample was washed by touching the grid to the surface of a drop containing 20 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 5% (w/v) glycerol followed by floating the grid for 1 min on a drop of the same solution. The sample was then stained by touching and floating on drops containing 5% uranyl acetate and 5% glycerol for 30 s. Finally the carbon surface was washed by floating on a drop of 5% glycerol for 5 s. The grid was then picked up with cleaned forceps and sequentially submerged in two beakers of water and one beaker of ethanol and finally dried under a heat lamp for 5 min. This protocol is designed for visualization of complete reaction mixtures, and no attempt was made to remove unreacted material. Although this approach should yield results that give a true insight into reaction components, it does lead to samples with a high background of unreacted proteins. Rad51 filament lengths were measured by a procedure described previously for RecA filaments (29Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circular filaments formed in the absence of RPA were measured in two ways, by including the length of the protrusions (nibs) by measuring up and down the nib and by ignoring the nibs. Circular filaments formed in the presence of RPA usually possessed gaps. For these structures, only regions that were obviously filamented were included in the measurement. The reaction conditions were the same as for the basic reaction described for the three-strand exchange reaction with φX174 DNA, with reactions scaled up as needed for the number of samples planned. Where indicated, heterologous pBIIt2 linear dsDNA (ldsDNA) was substituted for homologous ldsDNA. At the indicated times, two 12.5-μl aliquots were removed. One aliquot was deproteinized immediately with proteinase K, SDS, and EDTA as described above for the basic reaction with φX174 DNA. The other aliquot was subjected to cross-linking of the DNA essentially as described (22Umlauf S.W. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16898-16912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AMT was added to the aliquot in 1 μl to yield a final concentration of 23 μg/ml. The sample was then irradiated under ultraviolet light at an intensity of ∼6 mW cm−2 for 5 min and then deproteinized as described above. Samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the reactions were quantified as described for the basic three-strand exchange reaction with φX174 DNA. Some samples were also analyzed by electron microscopy. These were treated as above through the deproteinization step, then dialyzed against 20 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA for 5 h at room temperature on Millipore type VM (0.05 mm) filters (29Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were then spread for electron microscopy as described previously (30Inman R.B. Schnös M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Photography and measurement of the DNA molecules were performed as described previously (31Littlewood R.K. Inman R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1691-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The length of hybrid DNA generated for a representative sample of intermediates was estimated. Because of the large numbers of samples, obtaining accurate measurements of significant numbers of intermediates in all of them was impractical; we have therefore estimated the degree of exchange as described earlier (29Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an internal standard, the entire length of the double-stranded DNA region was judged. The standard deviation resulting from these measurements was low (average length = 5.4 ± 0.1 kilobase pairs), as shown by the data denoted by the open bars of Fig. 5 D. The level of cross-linking used was determined to result in one cross-link approximately every 150 base pairs on average. This determination was made by cross-linking φX174 ldsDNA at a concentration of 29 μm with various concentrations of AMT and denaturing the cross-linked molecules as described previously (32Inman R.B. Schnos M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The number of cross-links per molecule was counted and plottedversus the AMT concentration to generate an equation for calculating the number of cross-links per molecule at a given AMT concentration and degree of exposure. The reaction conditions were the same as those used in the basic reaction described for three-strand exchange with φX174 DNA, with the following changes. The preincubation mixtures contained the Rad51 protein (or Rad51 storage buffer in control reactions lacking protein) plus cssDNA. After a 10-min incubation at 38 °C, reactions were initiated by simultaneous addition of spermidine, φX174 PstI-cut ldsDNA, either RPA or RPA storage buffer, and either ExoVII to 0.08 units/μl or ExoVII storage buffer. Incubations were continued at 38 °C to allow strand exchange. At the indicated time points, reactions were deproteinized, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and quantitated as described for the basic reaction. Alternatively, some samples were examined by electron microscopy as described above for the cross-linking experiments. The goal of these experiments was to evaluate the postsynaptic role of RPA in Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions. To this end, the experiments were performed at a low magnesium concentration, as developed by the Sung laboratory during optimization of the Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction with φX174 DNA substrates. 2P. Sung, personal communication. Free magnesium ion in excess of the ATP concentration was only 0.4 mm. Little secondary structure may form in ssDNA under these conditions, so that RPA might not be needed to facilitate presynaptic Rad51 filament formation. This would allow us to distinguish between the effects of RPA on the presynaptic and postsynaptic phases of Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange. In addition, the ratio of ssDNA to Rad51 protein is kept to three nucleotides/monomer to minimize the possibility that any observed effects of RPA could instead reflect an activity of excess Rad51 protein. The in vitro strand exchange reaction illustrated in Fig.1 A has been used extensively to monitor the recombinase activity of proteins such as the RecA protein from E. coli and the Rad51 protein from S. cerevisiae. The initial pairing of the circular ssDNA with the linear dsDNA (ldsDNA) results in a reaction intermediate called a joint molecule. Complete exchange throughout the length of the ldsDNA leads to formation of a nicked circular DNA and a linear ssDNA product. The reactions are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after deproteinization of the DNA. When long substrates such as φX174 DNA (5386 nucleotides/base pairs in length) are used, the reaction proceeds quite efficiently, but only if RPA is included (Fig. 1 B). A very low level of joint molecule formation can be detected when RPA is omitted, but only after 2 or more h of reaction. Almost no final product is detected even after 5 h.

By inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE) and, in particular, selective inhibition of PDE3 activity, stimulatory effects on insulin secretion have been observed. Molecular and functional information on β-cell PDE3 is, however, scarce. To provide such information, we have studied the specific effects of the PDE3B isoform by adenovirus-mediated overexpression. In rat islets and rat insulinoma cells, approximate 10-fold overexpression of PDE3B was accompanied by a 6–8-fold increase in membrane-associated PDE3B activity. The cAMP concentration was significantly lowered in transduced cells (INS-1(832/13)), and insulin secretion in response to stimulation with high glucose (11.1 mm) was reduced by 40% (islets) and 50% (INS-1). Further, the ability of GLP-1 (100 nm) to augment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited by ∼30% (islets) and 70% (INS-1). Accordingly, when stimulating with cAMP, a substantial decrease (65%) in exocytotic capacity was demonstrated in patch-clamped single β-cells. In untransduced insulinoma cells, application of the PDE3-selective inhibitor OPC3911 (10 μm) was shown to increase glucose-stimulated insulin release as well as cAMP-enhanced exocytosis. The findings suggest a significant role of PDE3B as an important regulator of insulin secretory processes. Cyclic AMP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin release and mediates the stimulatory effects of hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on pancreatic β-cells.

Treatment with adenylyl cyclase activators, e.g. forskolin, results in a potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release (1Malaisse W.J. Garcia-Morales P. Dufrane S.P. Sener A. Valverde I. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 2015-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as does stimulation with hormones and neurotransmitters known to act as stimulatory G-protein agonists (2Ahrén B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). An example of particular interest is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),1 one of the most potent enhancers of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and in current focus for treatment of type 2 diabetes (3Ahrén B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The GLP-1 effect is seen in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of glucose and is exerted through cAMP-induced activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (3Ahrén B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although this classic concept of cAMP/PKA signaling, leading to phosphorylation of protein substrates that regulate insulin release, still holds as the principal mechanism by which cAMP exerts its effects, apparent PKA-independent stimulation of β-cell exocytosis mediated by cAMP has also been observed (5Renström E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).In contrast to the involvement of cAMP in the insulin response to G-protein coupled-receptor agonist, it has not been established whether cAMP mediates glucose-stimulated insulin release. Such a function is supported by studies showing that cAMP levels are increased in β-cells stimulated with glucose (6Sharp G.W. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Grill V. Cerasi E. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, indicate that glucose-stimulated insulin release occurs efficiently regardless of β-cell PKA activity (8Howell S.L. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl 2: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Howell S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that even though cAMP can elicit insulin secretion it may not be necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin release. Therefore, the role of cAMP in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remains to be established.The cellular content of cyclic nucleotides is defined by the balance between activities of adenylyl cyclases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP. The enhancing effect of general inhibitors of PDE, such as isobutylmethylxanthine, on glucose-stimulated insulin release has been known for decades (10Grill V. Asplund K. Hellerström C. Cerasi E. Diabetes. 1975; 24: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and has contributed to the concept that cAMP and/or cGMP are functionally important in β-cells. Today, a complex pattern of interactions can be anticipated between different members of the large superfamily of PDE enzymes (PDE1–11) (11Manganiello V.C. Degerman E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and their substrates. PDE families are functionally diverse although structurally related; the carboxyl-terminal located catalytic domain is well conserved in all known PDEs, whereas the divergent amino-terminal portions form the basis for specific protein interactions and response to regulatory signals. The availability of family-selective PDE inhibitors has facilitated understanding of the roles of specific PDEs in different tissues. With the use of such inhibitors, activities belonging to, at least, PDE families 1, 3, and 4 have been recognized in β-cells (12Shafiee-Nick R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br. J.

The relative contribution of these PDEs to secretory events is not known, although in isolated rat islets inhibition of PDE1 (15Han P. Werber J. Surana M. Fleischer N. Michaeli T. J. Biol.

Diverging results have been obtained by use of insulinoma cells; in BRIN-BD11 cells, inhibition of PDE3 and 4, but not PDE1 (16Ahmad M. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. Tate R. Flatt P.R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br.

Data from in vivo experiments indicate that PDE3 inhibitors act as insulin secretagogues in rodents (13Parker J.C. VanVolkenburg M.A. Nardone N.A. Hargrove D.M. Andrews K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17El-Metwally M. Shafiee-Nick R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 324: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because use of selective PDE3 inhibitors has been discussed as a therapeutic approach for prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes (18Snyder P. Emerg. Ther. Targets. 1999; 3: 587-599Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is important to elucidate the functional differences between PDE families in β-cells.In the present study, we have aimed to elucidate the role of PDE3 in β-cell function. Two isoforms, PDE3A and -3B, are known. They are structurally closely related but are transcribed from different genes and are tissue-specifically expressed. Thus, whereas PDE3A is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, PDE3B is expressed in cells important for energy metabolism, such as white and brown adipocytes and hepatocytes (19Reinhardt R.R. Chin E. Zhou J. Taira M. Murata T. Manganiello V.C. Bondy C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The presence of the PDE3B isoform has also been shown in neonatal rat pancreatic islets and HIT-T15, a hamster β-cell line (14Zhao A.Z. Zhao H. Teague J. Fujimoto W. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To circumvent the ambiguity in results obtained using family-selective inhibitors, we have chosen to increase, specifically, the activity of PDE3B in β-cells. By employing adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, PDE3B was efficiently overexpressed, and the resulting, severalfold increased activity dramatically decreased insulin release. Notably, besides an evident suppression of cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion, an unexpectedly large decreasing effect on glucose-stimulated insulin release was observed. Accordingly, using the patch-clamp technique, we were able to demonstrate a substantial decrease in cAMP-potentiated exocytosis in single β-cells overexpressing PDE3B.DISCUSSIONThe principal finding in this work is that increased PDE3B activity results in pronounced inhibitory effects on insulin secretory processes. The effects, as studied after overexpression of the enzyme, are apparent in isolated pancreatic islets as well as cultured insulinoma cells and derive from a decreased exocytotic capacity in the single cell. A remarkable reduction of insulin secreted in response to high glucose is observed. In a similar fashion, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is potentiated by elevated cAMP concentrations is suppressed.PDE3B ectopically expressed from the recombinant adenovirus contributes to increased PDE3 activity in the transduced cells. This increase can either be explained solely by the greater amount of PDE3B proteinper se or reflect, in addition, activation of the enzyme. Hormonal regulation of PDE3B activity has been extensively studied in adipose cells, in which insulin and isoproterenol activate the enzyme through phosphorylation of specific serine residues (32Degerman E. Smith C.J. Tornqvist H. Vasta V. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In HIT-T15 insulinoma cells, PDE3B is acutely activated in response to stimulation by IGF-I and leptin (14Zhao A.Z. Zhao H. Teague J. Fujimoto W. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Zhao A.Z. Bornfeldt K.E. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. The same authors also report that PDE3B is activated by GLP-1, although to a lesser extent. We have noted a similar activation by GLP-1 in INS-1 cells. The mechanism behind this is not completely understood, but it is likely to occur through elevated cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA, thus representing a feedback regulation of the cAMP pathway. Phosphorylation of PDE3B by PKA has been reported elsewhere (37Rascon A. Degerman E. Taira M. Meacci E. Smith C.J. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Tornqvist H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11962-11966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also observed that PDE3B is activated by high glucose in rat islets and rat insulinoma cells. 2L. Härndahl and L. Stenson Holst, manuscript in preparation. Because in the present study clonal β-cells and islets are exposed to high glucose as well as cAMP, either directly supplied as in the single cell experiments or elevated by GLP-1 stimulation, it is conceivable that the increased PDE3B activity determined in AdPDE3B-infected cells is partially due to phosphorylation and activation by nutrients and hormones in the culture media.The finding that overexpression of PDE3B, leading to increased PDE3 activity, has a significant impact on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion brings forward the role of cAMP in nutrient-induced β-cell signaling. An early hypothesis proposed that cAMP is a prime mediator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (7Grill V. Cerasi E. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Cerasi E. Luft R. Horm. Metab. Res. 1970; 2: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by findings that glucose raises the islet content of cAMP (7Grill V. Cerasi E. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,39Charles M.A. Fanska R. Schmid F.G. Forsham P.H. Grodsky G.M. Science. 1973; 179: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 40Hellman B. Idahl L.Å. Lernmark Å. Täljedal I.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 372: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, compared with the cAMP-elevating capacity of, for example, nonspecific PDE inhibitors, glucose was found to be less effective in elevating cAMP although more efficient in releasing insulin. Because of such discrepancies between cAMP-promoting and insulin-releasing activities (39Charles M.A. Fanska R. Schmid F.G. Forsham P.H. Grodsky G.M. Science. 1973; 179: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 40Hellman B. Idahl L.Å. Lernmark Å. Täljedal I.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 372: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the notion that cAMP merely synergizes with high glucose to enhance insulin secretion (e.g. Ref. 41Brisson G.R. Malaisse-Lagae F. Malaisse W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the idea of an initializing role of cAMP in glucose-mediated insulin release was soon discarded. Instead, a prominent role of cAMP in amplifying glucose-induced insulin release was anticipated. However, such a role of cAMP for nutrient-induced insulin release has also been questioned, because inhibition of PKA activity by cAMP analogues (8Howell S.L. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl 2: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or pseudosubstrate for PKA (42Harris T.E. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) does not inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion, although the same tools efficiently block secretion in response to adenylyl cyclase activators. It has also been shown that subcellular targeting of PKA by association with anchoring proteins is required for hormone-mediated insulin release but not for glucose-mediated secretion of insulin (43Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14942-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, our results obtained by overexpression of PDE3B, thus lowering the cAMP concentration in β-cells, demonstrate a clear detrimental effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our data thus support the older idea that glucose may amplify its own action by elevating cAMP and are in line with data showing that cAMP deficiency in purified β-cells negatively influences nutrient-induced insulin release (44Pipeleers D.G. Schuit F.C. in't Veld P.A. Maes E. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Van de Winkel M. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting that a critical amount of cAMP may be required to preserve the full capacity of glucose. We therefore propose that cAMP has an important role in nutrient-induced insulin secretion as a potentiating feed-forward mechanism, increasing the efficacy of insulin release in a graded fashion related to elevations in extracellular glucose concentrations.The cAMP-elevating effect of GLP-1 is well known and proposed to be the mechanism by which this hormone potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (45Thorens B. Waeber G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Moens K. Heimberg H. Flamez D. Huypens P. Quartier E. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Gremlich S. Thorens B. Schuit F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 257-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known, however, how cAMP formed as a result of GLP-1-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase relates spatially or functionally to the isoforms of PDE that are present. To explain the simultaneous presence of different cAMP-degrading PDEs, it is believed that it is not only structural and kinetic differences between isoforms that are important but also their varying availability to regulators and substrates, because of their specific locations in the cell (47Erdogan S. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 48Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It can be anticipated that co-localization at different compartments is achieved through multienzyme complexes in which, for example, specific PDEs and PKA isoforms are anchored together. Given that such arrangements exist, this may be the mechanism whereby cyclic nucleotides are degraded by specific PDEs. The observation that PDE3B decreases Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in INS-1(832/13) cells continuously dialyzed intracellularly with cAMP indicates the existence of a tight spatial association between PDE3B and the exocytotic machinery. Although decrease of cAMP is observed as a result of higher PDE3 activity in homogenates of AdPDE3B-infected cells (Figs.3 C and 4 C), under the particular conditions used in single cell experiments (Fig. 5) increased PDE3B activity is unlikely to affect significantly the overall cytosolic cAMP concentration, which remains close to that of the pipette solution (0.1 mm). This is because cAMP, not being a buffered molecule, will equilibrate rapidly in the cytosol. Given this, an increase in PDE3B activity can be expected to affect insulin exocytosis only if the phosphodiesterase operates in the immediate vicinity of the exocytotic machinery. The nature of this interaction is currently the subject of further investigations. It is therefore interesting to note that in the β-cells where PDE3B is overexpressed, cAMP formed in response to GLP-1 stimulation is available to and degraded by PDE3B. Detailed information on the localization of PDE3B in β-cells is not yet available. In primary rat adipose and liver cells PDE3B is predominantly found as a membrane-associated protein (33Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); its association to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum has been demonstrated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Shakur Y. Takeda K. Kenan Y., Yu, Z.X. Rena G. Brandt D. Houslay M.D. Degerman E. Ferrans V.J. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38749-38761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The presence of PDE3 activity both in cytosolic and particulate fractions of rat islets has been reported (12Shafiee-Nick R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1486-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We show here, however, that in control as well as AdPDE3B-infected insulinoma cells PDE3B activity can be measured solely in the particulate fraction. It is therefore possible that the cytosolic PDE3 activity found in islets represents non-membrane-bound splice variants of PDE3A in islet α− or δ-cells. Such cytosolic forms of PDE3A have been identified in aortic smooth muscle cells, for example (48Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 49Choi Y.H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There are no reports on the presence of PDE3A in β-cells. Using immunodetection, we have found no evidence for its expression in rat islets or clonal β-cells. However, mRNA encoding PDE3A could be detected in islets but not in INS-1 cells. This agrees with the report by Ahmad et al. (16Ahmad M. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. Tate R. Flatt P.R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1228-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that mRNA encoding PDE3B but not PDE3A mRNA is present in clonal BRIN-BD11 cells and further supports the idea that PDE3A is expressed, perhaps at low levels, in islet cells other than β-cells.In summary, we have utilized several β-cell models and methods to modulate the activity of the PDE3B isoform and have been able to demonstrate a substantial impact of this enzyme on cAMP-dependent exocytosis and secretion of insulin. The phosphodiesterase-mediated tight regulation of intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides and the vital importance of these second messengers in many physiological aspects has drawn attention to PDE enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention. Considering this, the tissue-specific expression of approximately 30 known isoforms and splice variants of PDEs accentuates the need for specific targeting of inhibitors and further detailed knowledge on isoform-related function. Increases in the intracellular content of cAMP promote insulin synthesis and secretion from the β-cells of pancreatic islets. Treatment with adenylyl cyclase activators, e.g. forskolin, results in a potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release (1Malaisse W.J. Garcia-Morales P. Dufrane S.P. Sener A. Valverde I. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 2015-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as does stimulation with hormones and neurotransmitters known to act as stimulatory G-protein agonists (2Ahrén B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). An example of particular interest is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),1 one of the most potent enhancers of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and in current focus for treatment of type 2 diabetes (3Ahrén B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The GLP-1 effect is seen in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of glucose and is exerted through cAMP-induced activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (3Ahrén B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although this classic concept of cAMP/PKA signaling, leading to phosphorylation of protein substrates that regulate insulin release, still holds as the principal mechanism by which cAMP exerts its effects, apparent PKA-independent stimulation of β-cell exocytosis mediated by cAMP has also been observed (5Renström E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In contrast to the involvement of cAMP in the insulin response to G-protein coupled-receptor agonist, it has not been established whether cAMP mediates glucose-stimulated insulin release. Such a function is supported by studies showing that cAMP levels are increased in β-cells stimulated with glucose (6Sharp G.W. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Grill V. Cerasi E. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, indicate that glucose-stimulated insulin release occurs efficiently regardless of β-cell PKA activity (8Howell S.L. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl 2: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Howell S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that even though cAMP can elicit insulin secretion it may not be necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin release. Therefore, the role of cAMP in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remains to be established. The cellular content of cyclic nucleotides is defined by the balance between activities of adenylyl cyclases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP. The enhancing effect of general inhibitors of PDE, such as isobutylmethylxanthine, on glucose-stimulated insulin release has been known for decades (10Grill V. Asplund K. Hellerström C. Cerasi E. Diabetes. 1975; 24: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and has contributed to the concept that cAMP and/or cGMP are functionally important in β-cells. Today, a complex pattern of interactions can be anticipated between different members of the large superfamily of PDE enzymes (PDE1–11) (11Manganiello V.C. Degerman E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and their substrates. PDE families are functionally diverse although structurally related; the carboxyl-terminal located catalytic domain is well conserved in all known PDEs, whereas the divergent amino-terminal portions form the basis for specific protein interactions and response to regulatory signals. The availability of family-selective PDE inhibitors has facilitated understanding of the roles of specific PDEs in different tissues. With the use of such inhibitors, activities belonging to, at least, PDE families 1, 3, and 4 have been recognized in β-cells (12Shafiee-Nick R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br. J.

Diverging results have been obtained by use of insulinoma cells; in BRIN-BD11 cells, inhibition of PDE3 and 4, but not PDE1 (16Ahmad M. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. Tate R. Flatt P.R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Br.

To pursue the mechanism we analyzed their sensitivity to choline-containing lysolipids or drugs that could not be deacylated and/or reacylated. Our data showed that gat1 and gat2 yeast were resistant and sensitive to lysoplatelet activating factor, platelet activating factor, and the anti-tumor lipid edelfosine, respectively, indicating that their sensitivity to these compounds was not because of differences in rates of phosphatidylcholine deacylation. As growth of gat2 cells was impaired in the presence of ethanol, a phospholipase D (Spo14p) inhibitor, we inferred that phospholipase D may play important biologic and metabolic roles in phenotypes observed in gat yeast. Genetic inactivation of the SPO14 gene resulted in increased susceptibility, whereas expression of Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase relieved growth inhibition, to choline-containing lysolipids and drugs.

Glycerolipid synthesis is initiated by glycerol-3-phosphate (Gly-3-P) acyltransferase through the transfer of a fatty acid from fatty acyl-CoA to the sn-1 position of Gly-3-P to form lysophosphatidic acid (8Paulauskis J.D.

Increased expression of mitochondrial Gly-3-P acyltransferase increased TAG synthesis to 470% and decreased PC synthesis to 70% of controls (27Igal R.A. Wang S. Gonzalez-Baró M.R. Coleman R.A. J.

This study concluded that mitochondrial Gly-3-P acyltransferase synthesized downstream lipids required for TAG synthesis and this pool was relatively separate from those that contribute to the synthesis of PC. A gene/cDNA coding for a mammalian microsomal Gly-3-P enzyme has yet to be isolated. The recent identification of two Gly-3-P acyltransferases genes,GAT1 and GAT2, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reported and interestingly neither had a high degree of amino acid similarity to the mammalian mitochondrial Gly-3-P acyltransferase. In vitro substrate specificities were determined and the GAT1 gene product could use both Gly-3-P and dihydroxyacetone phosphate with similar efficiencies and had a broad fatty acyl-CoA specificity profile, whereas the GAT2gene product preferred Gly-3-P over dihydroxyacetone phosphate and had a marked preference for 16-carbon fatty acyl chains (28Zheng Z.

The precisein vivo metabolic and biological roles of the Gat1p and Gat2p enzymes are unknown. We provide evidence that yeast Gat1p and Gat2p represent the major Gly-3-P acyltransferases in yeast. The specific genetic inactivation of the GAT1 or GAT2genes allowed for examination of the metabolic role of each Gly-3-P acyltransferase activity in the metabolism of specific glycerolipidsin vivo. Differences in TAG synthesis, and PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway and its subsequent turnover were identified between wild type, gat1, and gat2cells. The studies on PC turnover revealed a key role for PA produced from the hydrolysis of PC by phospholipase D in the modulation of susceptibility to choline-containing lysolipid analogues and drugs. Radiolabeled [methyl-14C]choline was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and [1-14C]acetate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Edelfosine was the kind gift of Medmark Pharma GmbH. Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Whatman. T7 and V5 antibodies were purchased from Novagen. Standard molecular biology methods, yeast genetic techniques, and transformation methods were used (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Yeast complex medium supplemented to a final concentration of 2% glucose (w/v) (YPD) or galactose (w/v) (YPGal) and synthetic minimal medium using 2% glucose (w/v) (SD), 2% galactose (w/v) (SGal), 3% ethanol (SEtOH), or 3% glycerol (SGly) as carbon source supplemented as required for plasmid maintenance are described (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast strains W303-1a (a ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100) and W303-1A (αura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100) were the parental strains from which gat1 and gat2yeast were derived. Standard yeast one-step gene disruption cassettes were constructed that replaced the entire open reading frame ofGAT1 or GAT2 and were transformed into yeast to generate strains CMY201 (α ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat2Δ::HIS3), CMY202 (a ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat2Δ::HIS3), CMY203 (αura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat1Δ::TRP1), and CMY204 (a ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat1Δ::TRP1). A plasmid containing theGAT1 open reading frame fused to the coding region for the V5 epitope tag at its 3′ end and under control of the GAL1promoter with URA3 as selectable marker (purchased from Invitrogen) was transformed into CMY201 and CMY204 strains. Ura+ transformants were mated and a diploid strain bearing the plasmid was selected, sporulated, and meiotic progeny were isolated on YPGal plates to generate strain CMY228 (α ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat1Δ::TRP1 gat2Δ::HIS3[pGAL1::GAT1 URA3]). Strain BY5102 (aura3 his3 leu2 met15 spo14Δ::KanMx)was purchased from ResGen. BY5102 was mated to CMY201 and haploid progeny were generated to create strains CMY240-3A (α ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 gat2::HIS3 spo14::KanMx) and CMY240-3D (a ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 spo14Δ::KanMx).Strain CMY240-3D was transformed with thegat1::TRP1 disruption cassette to generate strain CMY241 (a ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 spo14Δ::KanMx gat1Δ::TRP1). Gene disruption events were confirmed through genomic PCR. The Escherichia coli DAG kinase open reading frame (dgkA) was amplified by PCR using Platinum Hi Fidelity TaqPolymerase (Invitrogen) from the DH5α E. coli strain, TA cloned into the TOPO-pcRII vector, and subcloned into pAH9 (a derivative of p416-GPD that expresses open reading frames using the constitutive glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase promoter) but adds the coding region for the 10-amino acid T7 epitope tag to the 5′ end of the subcloned open reading frame. Plasmids pKR325 (SPO14), pME910(spo14K→H), and pME419 (spo14ΔN) were previously described (31Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast cells growing in mid-log phase were labeled with [14C]choline (10 μm, 1 × 104 dpm/nmol) or [14C]acetate (30 μm, 5 × 104 dpm/nmol) for the indicated time points. Subsequent to incubation with radiolabel, cells were concentrated by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1/1, v/v). Cells were disrupted for 1 min at 4 °C using a BioSpec Multi-Bead Beater containing 0.5 g of 0.5 mm acid-washed glass beads. The beads were washed with 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2/1, v/v) and 1.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of CHCl3 were added to the combined supernatant to facilitate phase separation. Phospholipids in the organic phase were routinely analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Whatman Silica Gel 60A plates using the solvent system: CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/CH3COOH (70/30/4/2, v/v/v/v). Neutral lipids were separated using the solvent system: petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80/20/1, v/v/v). Choline containing metabolites in the aqueous phase were separated in a solvent system consisting of CH3OH, 0.6% NaCl, NH4OH (50/50/5, v/v/v). Some plates were sprayed with ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film, whereas others had their radioactivity located and analyzed using a BioScan radiolabel imaging scanner and the corresponding bands were scraped into vials for scintillation counting. Metabolite identity was based on the mobility of known standards. Yeast were grown to mid-log phase and serial diluted 1/10 starting with an A 600 of 1. The growth of the cells was monitored by spotting 5 μl of each dilution onto solid medium in the absence or presence of the indicated compounds. For the addition of lipids to the plates, the lipids were dried under N2 gas, resuspended in ethanol, and added to the medium. The final ethanol concentration in lipid containing plates never exceeded 0.5%. All compounds were added to the various media after autoclaving and cooling of the media to at least 60 °C. Yeast were grown to mid-log phase in minimal medium supplemented as required to maintain cell growth. Total yeast cellular membranes were prepared as described (32Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Gly-3-P acyltransferase and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase were assayed in membrane fractions as described (33Mishra S. Kamisaka Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). DAG kinase activity was measured by the method of Priess et al. (34Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with a V5 monoclonal antibodies coupled directly to horseradish peroxidase, or a T7 monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method as directed by the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). Lipid phosphorus was determined as described by Ames and Dubin (35Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein mass using the Lowry protocol (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAT1 (YKR067w) and GAT2 (YBL011w) genes share 54% similarity and 37% identity over the entire protein sequence including the presence of a putative acyltransferase motif. Other translated open reading frames in the yeast genome contain the same putative acyltransferase motif but lack similarity to Gat1p and Gat2p outside of this motif region. Inactivation of either the GAT1 or GAT2 gene in yeast did not affect cell viability. Mating ofgat1::TRP1 (gat1) andgat2::HIS3 (gat2) mutants and characterization of meiotic progeny by tetrad analysis did not result in the recovery of any progeny that were simultaneously lacking both GAT1 and GAT2 genes indicating that loss of function of GAT1 and GAT2 is synthetically lethal (data not shown and Ref. 28Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Synthetic lethality does not necessarily mean that Gat1p and Gat2p are the only Gly-3-P acyltransferases present in S. cerevisiae as there are several other yeast proteins that contain the acyltransferase motif. To address the combined role of Gat1p and Gat2p to total yeast Gly-3-P acyltransferase activity we designed an inducible expression system whereby a yeast strain with genetically inactivated GAT1 andGAT2 genes was maintained by using the GAL1galactose inducible promoter to drive GAT1 expression ingat1::TRP1 gat2::HIS3 yeast. Culturing the yeast on galactose allowed for cell growth, but shifting these cells to glucose containing medium (which suppresses transcription from theGAL1 promoter) resulted in cessation of cell growth after approximately three to four cell divisions. The level of Gat1p after a shift to glucose was monitored by Western blot (Fig.1) and indicated that Gat1p rapidly declined to very low levels after 3 h in glucose and was no longer detected at 12 h. Lipid analysis of the gat1::TRP1 gat2::HIS3 double knockout strain harboring the galactose-inducible GAT1 construct was assessed by labeling with [14C]acetate. Radiolabeled acetate is incorporated into de novo synthesized fatty acids for subsequent lipid acylation. Yeast were grown in galactose (which expressed Gat1p), or shifted to glucose for various time points, and were then labeled with [14C]acetate for 1 h. In cells grown in galactose, radioactivity was associated equally between phospholipids and glycerolipids with each incorporating 50% of the total radiolabel (Figs. 2 and3). Within the phospholipid fraction 37% of the label was associated with PC, 33% with phosphatidylethanolamine, 28% with phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine, and 2% with PA (Fig. 2). In the neutral lipid fraction 47% of the label was in steryl esters, 21% in TAG, 19% in DAG, and 13% in fatty acid (Fig. 3). After the shift to glucose medium radiolabeled acetate incorporation gradually shifted from the acylation of glycerolipids to sterol acylation. This indicates that fatty acids are made but cannot be incorporated into glycerolipids and are instead being stored as steryl esters. After 12 h of growth in glucose the cells took up 70% of the total radiolabeled acetate as compared with cells grown in galactose. Analysis of ratio of radiolabel indicated the label incorporated into phospholipids had decreased to 19% of the total with the neutral lipid fraction now containing 81% of the radiolabeled acetate. Within the phospholipid fraction 41% of the label was associated with PC, 33% with phosphatidylethanolamine, and 26% with phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine. Thus, cells deficient in Gat1p and Gat2p showed a proportional decrease in the labeling of each of these major phospholipid classes (Fig. 3). Almost all of the label that was not incorporated into phospholipids upon inactivation of both Gat1p and Gat2p was now found in steryl esters as they now comprised 87% of the label found in the neutral lipid class, with 11% of the label in TAG, 2% in DAG, and 2% in fatty acid (Fig. 2). The large and generalized decrease in the ability to incorporate fatty acid into glycerolipids upon simultaneous inactivation of GAT1 andGAT2 is consistent with these two genes coding for the main yeast Gly-3-P acyltransferases.Figure 3Acylation of phospholipids subsequent to inactivation of Gat1p expression in gat1 gat2yeast. Yeast strain CMY228 (α ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100 gat1Δ::TRP1 gat2Δ::HIS3[pGAL1::GAT1 URA3]) was maintained on minimal galactose medium containing the required supplements for cell growth and plasmid maintenance. Early log phase cells were washed with minimal glucose containing medium and maintained in glucose containing medium. Yeast were labeled with [14C]acetate for 1 h at the indicated time points. Lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography using the solvent system: chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (70/30/4/2, v/v/v/v).A, autoradiogram of the lipid separated by thin layer chromatography.

After 12 h in glucose the Gly-3-P acyltransferase activity was reduced to negligible levels while lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity was essentially unaffected (Table I). Our above metabolic and enzymatic data, coupled with the observed synthetic lethality upon simultaneous inactivation of GAT1 and GAT2, indicate that these two genes code for the principal Gly-3-P acyltransferases in S. cerevisiae.Table IGlycerol-3-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase enzyme activitiesActivity relative to wild type yeast grown on glucoseGlycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activityLysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity%Wild type grown on glucose1001-aWild type enzyme activities were 2.0 and 21.2 nmol min−1/mg−1 for glycerol-3-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, respectively.100gat1∷TRP1 gat2∷HIS3(GAL-GAT1) grown on galactose152135gat1∷TRP1 gat2∷HIS3(GAL-GAT1) grown on glucose for 12 h2115The results are the mean of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate.

Open table in a new tab The results are the mean of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate. Standard errors are less than 15% of the mean for each point. Although simultaneous inactivation of GAT1 andGAT2 prevented cell growth, inactivation of theGAT1 or GAT2 genes separately did not affect the rate of cell growth on rich or minimal yeast medium. The identical growth rates to wild type yeast allowed for the determination of the role of each Gly-3-P acyltransferases in the synthesis of specific glycerolipids through metabolic labeling analyses. We initially monitored flux through the CDP-choline pathway for synthesis of PC because increased GAT2 expression was previously shown to restore growth to a yeast strain that contained a mutated choline transporter that possessed an increasedK m for choline and relied exclusively on the CDP-choline pathway for PC synthesis (37Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study,GAT2 (referred to in the previous study as SCT1for suppressor of choline transport) was thought to directly alter the rate of uptake of choline by the choline transporter. However, if increased GAT2 allowed for higher flux through the CDP-choline pathway through an indirect route this could also allow for restoration of cell growth to this yeast strain. We determined the rate of metabolism of radiolabeled choline into PC and its subsequent turnover into glycerophosphocholine ingat1 and gat2 yeast. As shown in Fig.4, gat1 cells produced less radioactive phosphocholine and much higher levels of radioactive glycerophosphocholine than the wild type strain. Conversely, glycerophosphocholine labeling was almost undetectable ingat2 cells, whereas there was an increase in the radioactivity incorporated into phosphocholine. As glycerophosphocholine is an end product of PC deacylation these results indicate that flux through the CDP-choline pathway for subsequent PC deacylation is diminished in the gat2 mutant and is augmented in gat1 cells. The DAG produced downstream of the Gly-3-P acyltransferases could also be used for the synthesis of the neutral lipid TAG. The gat1and gat2 yeast were radiolabeled with acetate and its incorporation into de novo synthesized fatty acid for subsequent esterification into neutral glycerolipids was determined. Acetate labeling of DAG was slightly reduced in gat2 yeast and this was reflected by a 50% decrease in labeling of TAG (Fig.5). In gat1 yeast, DAG labeling was essentially unchanged, whereas TAG labeling was increased by 50%. The metabolism of radiolabeled ethanolamine, serine, and inositol into lipids was unchanged in gat1 and gat2 cells compared with wild type cells (data not shown). Consistent with the inositol metabolic labeling experiments was the observation thatgat1 and gat2 yeast were not inositol auxotrophs indicating that their ability to synthesize inositol and convert it into phosphatidylinositol was unperturbed. In yeast the major PC deacylating phospholipase genes thus far identified are encoded by the PLB1–3 genes (38Merkel O. Fido M. Mayr J.A. Prüger H. Raab F. Zandonella G. Kohlwein S.D. Paltuaf F. J.

An increase in the activity of PC/lyso-PC hydrolyzing phospholipase B (Plb2p) has been demonstrated to protect cells versus the cytostatic effects of exogenously added lyso-PC, and ablation of the PLB2 gene resulted in increased lyso-PC susceptibility (38Merkel O.

In searching for the putative β4GalNAcT required for LDN synthesis, we examined genes in Caenorhabditis elegans. The C. elegans genome contains three open reading frames that encode proteins with sequence homology to the β4GalT family. One of these open reading frames (ORF R10E11.4; sqv-3) is predicted to encode a protein involved in vulval invagination (47Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another of these open reading frames (ORF W02B12.11) encodes a protein for which no enzymatic activity has yet been reported. The third open reading frame (ORF Y73E7A.7) was identified more recently than the two mentioned above and therefore had not been reported in previous studies (27Van Die I. Bakker H.

In this study, we have cloned a cDNA corresponding to the latter open reading frame and demonstrate that it encodes a β4GalNAcT, which we have termed Ceβ4GalNAcT.

Open table in a new tab A BlastP search of the NCBI nonredundant protein data base for homologues of the human β4GalT I (accession number CAA39074) identified a hypothetical protein encoded by an open reading frame in the C. elegans genome designated Y73E7A.7. A cDNA was amplified by PCR from a mixed stage C. elegans cDNA library using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of this open reading frame (5′-GCCACCATGGCTTTTCGTCATTTGGC-3′; 5′-CTAAAAACACGTTGGAAAGTCC-3′). Amplification was carried out at 95 °C for 2:30 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 50 s, 53 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1:50 min and then at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified from an agarose gel slice using a QIA Quick gel extraction kit, cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector, and sequenced on both strands at the Sequencing Facility of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (Oklahoma City, OK). A PsiI (partial)/PvuII DNA fragment starting at bp 87 of the Ceβ4GalNAcT open reading frame and extending beyond the stop codon was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pcDNA 3.1(+)-TH vector. The resulting vector (pCMV-SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT) encodes a fusion protein, designated SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT, which consists of a signal peptide at the N terminus followed by an HPC4 epitope and then the catalytic domain of the Ceβ4GalNAcT (beginning at Lys30, the first amino acid after the transmembrane domain). The HPC4 epitope is recognized by the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 (49Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,50Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT is under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, which is present in the vector. CHO-Lec8 and CHO-Lec2 cells were transfected with pCMV-SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml Geneticin to select for stably transformed cells. After 4 weeks of culturing in medium containing Geneticin, the cells were cultured in the same medium without Geneticin, and the culture medium was harvested every 3 days and used to purify SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT. To assay intracellular β4GalNAcT activity and for Western blots, cells were washed with 75 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, and lysed in a buffer of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 20 mm MnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatants were used for further analyses. Medium containing SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT was centrifuged at 1,500 ×g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and then incubated with HPC4-UltraLink beads (5 mg of HPC4 antibody/ml of beads; 0.1 μl of beads/ml of medium) for 1 h at room temperature on a rotating platform. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 600 ×g for 3 min and washed three times with 10 ml of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 2 mmCaCl2. The beads were then resuspended in the same buffer with the addition of 20 mm MnCl2 and used as the enzyme source. For Western blot analysis, the bound material was released by incubating the beads in a buffer of 50 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 20 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature and then collecting the supernatant. Cell lysates were treated with N-glycanase in a buffer of 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS, 0.75% Nonidet P-40 for 3 h at 37 °C. Control treatments were carried out in the same way but without addingN-glycanase. The lysates were then mixed with loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 h at 4 °C. It was then incubated with the primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-LDN IgM SMLDN1.1 (16Nyame A.K. Leppanen A.M. DeBose-Boyd R. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or HPC4 IgG) in the same buffer (without bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in the same buffer, and incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG) as before. The membrane was then washed again, incubated in HighSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate for 2 min at room temperature, and exposed to a BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 min. The film was then developed using a processing machine (Konica SRX-101). Standard assays were performed essentially as described previously (45van Die I. van Tetering A. Bakker H. van den Eijnden D.H. Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 μmol of sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 12.5 nmol of UDP-[3H]GalNAc (2.5 Ci/mol), 1 μmol of MnCl2, 0.1 μmol of ATP, 0.1 μl of Triton X-100, 2 μl of beads, and acceptor substrate, containing 25 nmol of terminal GlcNAc at the nonreducing end unless otherwise indicated. Control assays lacking the acceptor substrate were carried out to correct for incorporation into endogenous acceptors, and all assays were carried out in duplicate. All assays were linear with time for up to 180 min. After incubation at 37 °C for 180 min, the reaction was stopped. When oligosaccharides or glycopeptides were the acceptor, the labeled product was separated from unincorporated label by chromatography on a 1-ml column of Dowex 1-X8 (Cl− form) according to Eastonet al. (51Easton E.W. Blokland I. Geldof A.A. Rao B.R. van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When oligosaccharide acceptors with hydrophobic aglycon (pNP) were used as the acceptor, the product was isolated using Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters) as described (52Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The isolated products were assayed for incorporation of radioactivity by liquid scintillation. The product catalyzed by SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT using GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP as acceptor was isolated using a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge (1 cm3) and lyophilized. Three nmol of the product (dissolved in water) were analyzed by a Dionex HPAEC-PAD system, using a PA-1 column with a 100 mm NaOH solution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The standard containing the authentic LDN structure GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP was synthesized using bovine β4GalT I and GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP as the acceptor for UDP-GalNAc in the standard assay described above. Commercially acquired GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-pNP (core 3-O-pNP) and GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAcα1-O-pNP (core 6-O-pNP) were also used as standards. Synthesis was carried out overnight at 37 °C in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 μmol of sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 300 nmol of GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP, 1 μmol of UDP-GalNAc, 20 μmol of MnCl2, 5 μmol of ATP, 3 μmol of NaN3, and 100 μl of beads. The product was then isolated using a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge (1 cm3) and lyophilized. 150 nmol of the product catalyzed by SH-Ceβ4GalNAcT using GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP as acceptor were treated with D2O (99.75 atom %; Merck) three times with intermediate lyophilization. Finally, the sample was redissolved in 400 μl of D2O (99.96 atom %; Sigma-Aldrich). 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker MSL 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz at a probe temperature of 300 K. Resolution enhancement was achieved by Lorentzian to Gaussian transformation. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from internal sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured by reference to internal acetone (δ = 2.225 ppm in D2O). A potential C. elegans open reading frame designated Y73E7A.7 was identified by a BlastP search as encoding a homologue of the human β4GalT I. An identical cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AY130767) was amplified by PCR from a mixed stage C. elegans cDNA library using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of this open reading frame, establishing that the gene is expressed in vivo. The cDNA of Y73E7A.7 encodes a predicted 383-amino acid protein with a single transmembrane domain in a type 2 topology, which is a common topological motif in glycosyltransferases. The protein encoded by Y73E7A.7 is predicted to contain six potentialN-glycosylation sites and two DVD motifs, which are thought to participate in metal ion binding (53Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Curiously, the last four potentialN-glycosylation sites share an identical sequon (NQT), the significance of which is not clear at this time. The protein sequence encoded by Y73E7A.7 is 35.5% identical to human β4GalT I (Fig.2 A) and is more closely related to the first four members of the β4GalT family (I, II, III, and IV) than to the other three (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Protein sequence comparisons between the protein encoded by Y73E7A.7 (Ceβ4GalNAcT) and members of the β4GalT family.

This construct was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary CHO-Lec8 cells. These cells are impaired in the transport of UDP-Gal into the Golgi (54Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently generate hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans containing terminal GlcNAc and O-glycans containing the simple Tn antigen GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (55Stanley P.

The transfected cells expressing Y73E7A.7, but not the control mock-transfected cells, acquired a novel intracellular GalNAcT activity in the cell extracts capable of utilizing UDP-GalNAc as the donor and GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP as the acceptor (Fig. 3 A). The recombinant protein containing the HPC4 epitope from extracellular medium was bound by HPC4-conjugated beads, confirming the β4GalNAcT activity of the enzyme encoded by the Y73E7A.7 (Fig. 3 A). A Western blot of the material bound to the HPC4-conjugated beads (Fig. 3 B) confirmed that it corresponded to the predicted size of the HPC4 epitope-tagged protein (43.1-kDa peptide plus N-glycans) as discussed below. These data demonstrate that Y73E7A.7 encodes an active β4GalNAcT and the enzyme was designated the C. elegansUDP-Gal"

Based on the well-recognized association of specific VHL mutations with partial VHL disease phenotypes, a likely hypothesis is that VHL missense mutations may disrupt some, but not necessarily all, VHL functional pathways. For example, VHL mutations that prevent HIF ubiquitination and therefore promote HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression are precisely those that correlate with hemangioblastoma development (35Clifford S.C.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To identify molecules potentially important in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cancer, we screened an adult human kidney library with human VHL p30 using a yeast two-hybrid approach. We have named the gene encoding a novel, strong VHL-interactor as Jade-1(gene for Apoptosis andDifferentiation in Epithelia). Jade-1 protein is short-lived and most highly expressed in kidney. It contains a candidate PEST degradation domain and plant homeodomain (PHD) motifs, which are not required for the VHL interaction. Jade-1 protein is directly stabilized by VHL protein, which is a new VHL function. Preliminary results suggest Jade-1 is also growth suppressive. Jade-1 may therefore participate in VHL-mediated renal tumor suppression. Plasmids pFLAG-cytomegalovirus (CMV)-2 VHL and derivatives have been described previously (18Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B.

Lerman (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) and subcloned similarly into pGilda. The Jade-1 5′-untranslated region and coding sequence were cut from pB42AD withNotI and XhoI and subcloned into NotI and SalI cut pFLAG-CMV2. The Jade-1 complete coding sequence (aa 1–509) and truncations (deletion 1 (del1), aa 202–509; deletion 2 (del2), aa 372–509; and double PHD deletion (dd), aa 1–201, 254–311, 372–509) (see Fig. 1, A andB) were PCR-amplified and inserted using NotI andXbaI into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as an untagged expression vector and into pCR3.1 uni (Invitrogen) that had been modified to contain an HA tag. Deletion of the Jade-1 PHD regions was performed by recombinant PCR. Additional details about plasmid constructs can be obtained from the authors.

Interaction strength in yeast was categorized by the amount of time post-cotransformation required for yeast colonies to appear blue on X-gal plates. Clones positive at 24 h were designated as the strongest (3+) interactors.

To generate Jade-1 antisera, 2 New Zealand White rabbits were injected with the same carboxyl-terminal 20 residue Jade-1 peptide amino terminally linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.

Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were from Bio-Rad. Cultured cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Tris 50 mm, pH 7.6, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 30 mm, Triton X-100 0.5%,) with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), precleared with protein A-agarose bead (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mixed with antibody at excess (18Mukhopadhyay D.

Complexes were pelleted with protein A-agarose, washed with lysis buffer, eluted with sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described using the antibodies above. For multitissue Western analysis, tissues were minced and homogenized with a Teflon pestle in lysis or KETN buffers (100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor. Human tissue lysates were obtained from Genotech (St. Louis, MO). Relative intensities of positive bands were assessed by densitometry using Image 1.62 (National Institutes of Health). Backgrounds were subtracted to assign densitometry values. Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol (TelTest) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A multitissue Northern blot was probed as recommended (CLONTECH) using a 1-kb 5′ Jade-1 coding sequence fragment. Northern analysis was otherwise performed as described earlier (19Cohen H.T. Zhou M. Welsh A.M. Zarghamee S. Scholz H. Mukhopadhyay D. Kishida T. Zbar B. Knebelmann B. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on Chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and fixed with 1:1 methanol and acetone for 2 min at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed with affinity-purified anti-Jade-1 serum or VHL monoclonal antibody followed by FITC- or cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies. Images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Optiphot) and digital imaging (RT Color camera, Diagnostic Instruments). Cells were starved in cysteine (Cys)- and methionine (Met)-free medium for 1–2 h, then fed deficient medium containing 100 μCi/ml 35S-Met and35S-Cys (EasyTag express, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by medium containing 100-fold excess unlabeled Met and Cys as chase for times indicated. Labeling times were 15 min or 1 h for Jade-1 in transiently transfected cells or 2.5 h for endogenous Jade-1 in renal cancer cells. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as above, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Correct identification of labeled endogenous Jade-1 was aided by control lanes of labeled untagged Jade-1 from transfected 293T17 cells immunoprecipitated with Jade-1 antiserum, with and without competitor peptide. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography, and bands were quantitated by densitometry using Image 1.62. Detection of labeled endogenous Jade-1 required 3 weeks of autoradiography. Protein half-life was determined by log densitometry plotting. Alternatively, protein half-life was estimated based on densitometry results at the 0- and 1-h chase times, using linear regression to identify the time point at which the initial signal strength would be halved. Errors are reported as ±1 S.D. The human Jade-1 gene was identified as a particularly strong VHL-interacting clone in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human VHL p30. VHL is a low abundance intracellular protein that resides in multiple subcellular compartments (22Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N.

Thus, the yeast screen was performed to identify potentially rare or short-lived VHL protein interactions. An adult human kidney library was chosen because half of the mass of an adult human kidney is composed of proximal tubule cells. One million library clones in pB42AD yeast expression vector were screened against human VHL aa 2–213 in LexA-expressing, inducible yeast expression vector pGilda. Positive yeast colonies were confirmed by restreaking under double-selection conditions. Library clones rescued from confirmed positive colonies were tested individually for interaction with human VHL aa 2–213 and 55–143 as well as full-length mouse VHL in pGilda. VHL aa 55–143 were chosen as a minimum substrate-binding VHL beta domain. Jade-1 was one of 14 strongest interactors (3+) in yeast of 40 different genes identified, because VHL-Jade-1-cotransformed colonies appeared blue at 24 h of incubation. Jade-1 also interacted convincingly with human VHL aa 55–143 (3+) as well as mouse VHL (2+) in yeast. VDU1 (10Li Z., Na, X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol.

Additional confirmed positive interactors in yeast include four other novel genes, 17 known genes encoding a wide range of proteins, and 14 known genes encoding chaperones or chaperone-like proteins, which are common false-positives. As reported in another screen, VHL-binding protein-1 (3+) and filamin (2+) were also recovered (49Tsuchiya H. Iseda T. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2881-2885PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other known VHL-interacting proteins were not. GenBankTM BLAST searches indicate that theJade-1 library clone contains the complete coding sequence of a novel, single gene (Fig.1 A). The 3570-nt clone was found in-frame with the B42 activation domain and has 178-nt 5′ untranslated, 1527-nt coding, and 1831-nt 3′ untranslated sequence, as well as a polyadenylation signal and poly(A)+ tail. The coding sequence is followed by several stop codons (Fig. 1 A). The deduced Jade-1 509 aa sequence (Fig. 1 A) has a predicted 58.4-kDa mass and 5.25 isoelectric pH. It has two consensus mid-molecule PHDs (50Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), also known as leukemia-associated protein (51Saha V. Chaplin T. Gregorini A. Ayton P. Young B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9737-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or trithorax consensus domains (52Koken M.H. Saib A. de The H. C R Acad. Sci. III. 1995; 318: 733-739PubMed Google Scholar), which are 50- to 70-aa C4HC3 zinc-binding motifs (Fig. 1, A andB). Alternatively, the second PHD may represent an extended PHD (53Linder B. Newman R. Jones L.K. Debernardi S. Young B.D. Freemont P. Verrijzer C.P. Saha V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and include aa 257–371. Jade-1 residues 5–28 comprise a strong candidate PEST domain (PESTfind score of +11) (Fig. 1,A and B), which is a charged, unstructured region that promotes susceptibility to degradation (54Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Jade-1 has no signal or transmembrane sequences. Candidate sites forN-glycosylation, myristoylation, and serine or threonine phosphorylation are shown, based on Prosite analysis, although the patterns found are short and not highly specific. No closely homologous proteins have been characterized. However, a transcript calledE9 was identified in a differential screen of genes induced with apoptosis in a breast cancer line and is predicted to encode a closely related PEST- and PHD-containing protein (55Szelei J. Soto A.M. Geck P. Desronvil M. Prechtl N.V. Weill B.C. Sonnenschein C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether transfected Jade-1 encodes a protein of the anticipated size, the protein coding sequence was subcloned into CMV promoter-driven tagged and untagged expression vectors. A 64-kDa expressed protein is consistently seen in Western blots ofJade-1 transfected but not untransfected or control transfected cells (see Figs.2 A, 3 A, and3 E), indicating production of Jade-1 protein that is just larger than the predicted 58.4-kDa molecular mass. Jade-1 may therefore be post-translationally modified.Figure 3Jade-1 and VHL proteins interact. A and B, cotransfected Jade-1 and VHL interact strongly.

W. G., Kanazawa, Y., Akanuma, Y., Yazaki, Y., and Kadowaki, T. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 20300–20307). To elucidate fully the metabolism-secretion coupling in these cells, we measured glucose oxidation, utilization, and lactate production. We also evaluated NADH autofluorescence in βHC9 cells using two-photon excitation laser microscopy. In addition, we recorded the membrane potential and determined the ATP and ADP contents of the cells. The results indicated 22.2 mm glucose oxidation to be severely decreased by EtBr treatment compared with control cells (by 63% on day 4 and by 78% on day 6; both p < 0.01). By contrast, glucose utilization was only marginally decreased. Lactate production under 22.2 mm glucose was increased by 2.9- and 3.5-fold by EtBr treatment on days 4 and 6, respectively (both p< 0.01). Cellular NADH at 2.8 mm glucose was increased by 35 and 43% by EtBr on days 4 and 6 (both p < 0.01). These data suggest that reduced expression of the mitochondrial electron transport system causes NADH accumulation in β cells, thereby halting the tricarboxylic acid cycle on one hand, and on the other hand facilitating anaerobic glucose metabolism. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was lost rapidly along with the EtBr treatment with concomitant losses of membrane potential depolarization and the [Ca2+]i increase, whereas glibenclamide-induced changes persisted.

This is the first report to demonstrate the connection between metabolic alteration of electron transport system and that of tricarboxylic acid cycle and its impact on insulin secretion. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate intracellular free Ca2+ concentration lactate dehydrogenase The mitochondrion has long been one of the main areas of interest for investigators in the field of insulin secretion because it is the primary organelle that metabolizes glucose and other nutrients eliciting insulin secretion. The notion that mitochondria play an important role in insulin secretion has become more feasible with cloning of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel/sulfonylurea receptor (1Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). This is because it is now clear that these channels important for insulin secretion are, in fact, governed by ATP produced mostly by mitochondria. This importance of mitochondria for insulin secretion is further confirmed by the fact that mutations in mitochondrial DNA are associated with some types of diabetes mellitus (2Ballinger S.W.

Considering that diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases, especially in developed countries (e.g. in both the United States (7King H. Aubert R.E. Herman W.H. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 1414-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (5064) Google Scholar) and Japan (8Akazawa H. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1994; 24: S23-S27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) ∼10% of people over 40 have this disease), the significance of the percentage must not be overlooked. Recently, we demonstrated (9Hayakawa T. Noda M. Yasuda K. Yorifuji H. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Sakura H. Terauchi Y. Hayashi J.-I. Sharp G.W.G. Kanazawa Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

Similar results have been obtained with other cell types (16Kennedy E.D. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Tsuruzoe K. Araki E. Furukawa N. Shirotani T. Matsumoto K. Kaneko K. Motoshima H. Yoshizato K. Shirakami A. Kishikawa H. Miyazaki J.-I. Shichiri M.

Oka Y. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the overall mechanism that elicits such alteration is still poorly understood, especially from a viewpoint of cellular metabolism. Herein, we investigated the changes in substrate metabolism and stimulus-secretion coupling caused by suppression of the transcription of mitochondrial DNA by EtBr, which exclusively encodes components of the electron transport system (complexes I, III, IV, and V) and mitochondrial transfer RNA molecules that are used for the synthesis of these components. We have found metabolic derangements, such as accelerated anaerobic metabolism with increased lactate production, indirectly caused by suppression of mitochondrial DNA transcription. Our observations provide insight not only into the physiological importance of mitochondrial function in insulin release from islet β cells, but also into the pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, resulting from dysfunctional mitochondria, and may further suggest clinical approaches to managing this disease. EtBr, glibenclamide, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, and sulfinpyrazone were purchased from Sigma. Nitrendipine was obtained from Research Biochemicals, norepinephrine from Fluka. Glibenclamide and nitrendipine were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (with final concentrations up to 0.1%), and the same final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the controls when they were used. βHC9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mmol/liter glucose, 1 mmol/liter pyruvate, 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 95% air plus 5% CO2 atmosphere. Supplemental pyruvate was added to ensure cell growth, as with ρ0 cells (cells lacking mitochondrial DNA) (19Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2. For the treated cells, 0.4 μg/ml EtBr was added to the culture medium 22–26 h after plating. This EtBr concentration was chosen based on the observation that culturing βHC9 cells with 0.4 μg/ml EtBr for 4–6 days resulted in an ∼90% decrease in the level of mitochondrial DNA transcription without changing its copy number (9Hayakawa T. Noda M. Yasuda K. Yorifuji H. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Sakura H. Terauchi Y. Hayashi J.-I. Sharp G.W.G. Kanazawa Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20300-20307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells at passages from 25 to 38 were used for the experiments. Insulin secretion experiments were performed as described previously (15Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, four (occasionally three) 16-mm-diameter wells containing cells were used for one test situation. Cells at a concentration of 0.2–0.3 × 106/well (0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2) were plated in each 16-mm-diameter well in a 24-well plate. Four (or occasionally 3) of the wells treated with or without EtBr were used for one test situation (usual cell concentrations for control wells at the time of the experiments were 0.5–1.0 × 106/well). In all experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB)1 buffer solution (pH 7.4) composed of (in mmol/liter) 129 NaCl, 5 NaHCO3, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 glucose and 0.2% bovine serum albumin before incubation. Then the medium was removed, and 1 ml of fresh KRB buffer (0.1 mm glucose) containing test substances was introduced. Incubation under the test conditions was then carried out for the indicated times (usually 60 min) at 37 °C. At the end of each incubation, media were sampled and centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for insulin radioimmunoassay. Rat insulin was used as the standard. For determination of insulin content in the cells, each well was suspended in a solution containing 77% (v/v) ethanol and 1% (v/v) HCl, and kept at −20 °C overnight. All samples were stored at −20 °C until the insulin radioimmunoassay. Insulin release was expressed as fractional release during the incubation time. The temporal profiles of insulin secretion from βHC9 cells were investigated using a perifusion system (20Kikuchi M. Rabinovitch A. Blackard W.G. Renold A.E. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 550-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as described previously (15Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips with attached cells were placed in each 0.6-ml perifusion chamber and perifused with KRB buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose at a rate of 1 ml/min at 37 °C. Experiments were started after 60-min perifusion equilibration periods with KRB buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose. At the end of the experiments, each coverslip was suspended in a solution containing 77% ethanol and 1% HCl and kept at −20 °C overnight for determination of the residual insulin content. Perifusate samples were collected every 1 or 2 min. Insulin release rates were expressed in terms of fractional secretion/content at each time point. The [Ca2+]i of the cells was measured fluorometrically using fura-2 as described previously (15Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells dispersed by trypsin and EDTA were suspended in KRB buffer (0.1 mm glucose) containing 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, then loaded with fura-2 by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with continuous shaking. The fura-2-loaded cells thus obtained were washed and resuspended in KRB buffer (containing 0.1 mm glucose and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone), and 3 ml of the suspension was introduced into individual quartz cuvettes held in a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5). The cell suspension in each cuvette was stirred continuously with a small magnetic bar within the cuvette during each experiment. The temperature of the cell suspension was maintained at 37 °C by circulating warm water through the cuvette holder. An excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm were used for the measurement. In some cases, an excitation wavelength of 380 nm was used for the reciprocal monitor and, to confirm the Ca2+ dependence of the fluorescence, the [Ca2+]i was calculated as described previously (15Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) employing values of auto- and extracellular fura-2-emitted fluorescence, which were determined using two of the four cuvettes applied for each experiment. For stimulation, a 100-fold concentration of the stimulus was added, gently, as an injection. Membrane potential was measured by the patch clamp method in a conventional whole cell mode. Pipettes were pulled from glass 1740 (Garner Glass Co.) using a two-stage puller, fire polished, tip filled with pipette solution (containing 70 mmK2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4), and then back filled with the same solution containing 200 μg/ml nystatin. Before each experiment, cells were transferred into a bath solution. A gigaohm seal was obtained within 10 min after transfer of the cells into an experimental chamber. A whole cell configuration was considered to be successfully established when the conductance observed was more than 30 microsiemens. Membrane potential was measured by patch clamps in the current clamp mode. Experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Nucleotide extraction was performed as described previously (21Deitemary P. Van den Gerghe G. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20559-20565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells at a concentration of 0.2–0.3 × 106/well (0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2) were plated onto each 16-mm-diameter well in a 24-well plate. Three of the wells treated with or without EtBr were used for one test condition. After the indicated culture periods, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in fresh KRB buffer (containing 0.1 mm glucose) after being washed twice with the same buffer. Then, the medium was removed, and 1 ml of fresh KRB buffer containing 22.2 mm glucose was introduced. Incubation was carried out for 5 or 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 5%); for determination of the initial nucleotide content, trichloroacetic acid was introduced just after preincubation. Then, the cells were scraped, and the buffer containing lysate was moved to a tube and centrifuged for 1 min. A fraction of the supernatant was mixed with 1.5 ml of diethyl ether, and the ether phase containing trichloroacetic acid was discarded. This step was repeated three times to ensure complete elimination of the trichloroacetic acid. The extracts were diluted with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 3 mmMgCl2, and KOH, as required to adjust pH to 7.75, and then frozen at −80 °C until the assay. Another set of three wells of cells, with or without EtBr treatment, was trypsinized, detached, and used to assay protein amounts. ATP and ADP contents of the cells were assayed in duplicate by the luminometric method as described previously (21Deitemary P. Van den Gerghe G. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20559-20565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using an ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma). For measurement of the sum of ATP + ADP, ADP was first converted into ATP as described previously (21Deitemary P. Van den Gerghe G. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20559-20565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and ADP levels were calculated by subtraction. Glucose utilization by βHC9 cells was measured as described previously (22Ashcroft S.J.H. Weeransinghe L.C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem.

In brief, ∼0.5 × 106 cells dispersed by trypsinization were first incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of KRB buffer containing 0.1 mm glucose (preincubation). At the end of preincubation, the cells were briefly centrifuged, supernatants were aspirated, 100 μl of KRB buffer containing 1 μCi of d-[5-3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity 16.8 Ci/mmol) was introduced, and incubation was continued for another 60 min. Then, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 3 n HCl and 40 μl of ethanol to the incubation mixture. Formed 3H2O was equilibrated with 0.5 ml of H2O in outer vessels, as described previously (23Miwa I. Murata T. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), for 24 h at room temperature. The glucose concentration (radioactive and nonradioactive combined) was set at 0.8 or 22.2 mm during the incubations. Glucose oxidation of βHC9 cells was measured as described previously (22Ashcroft S.J.H. Weeransinghe L.C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem.

In brief, ∼0.5 × 106 cells dispersed by trypsinization were first incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of KRB buffer containing 0.1 mm glucose (preincubation). At the end of the preincubation, the cells were briefly centrifuged, the supernatants were aspirated, 100 μl of KRB buffer containing 1 μCi ofd-[14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, specific activity 13.0 mCi/mmol) was introduced, and incubation was continued for another 60 min. Then, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 0.1 n HCl to the incubation mixture. Formed 14CO2 was trapped by 300 μl of 1m benzethonium hydroxide (Sigma) in methanol for 48 h at room temperature. The glucose concentration (radioactive and nonradioactive combined) was set at 0.8 or 22.2 mm during the incubations. Lactate production was measured by the lactate oxidase method using a Determiner LA assay kit (Kyowa Medics, Tokyo, Japan). Five 30-mm-diameter dishes of cells were used for one test condition. Cells at a concentration of 0.7–1.1 × 106/dish (0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2) were plated onto the 30-mm-diameter dishes. After the indicated culture periods, the cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 3 ml of a fresh KRB buffer solution (containing 0.1 mm glucose) after being washed twice with the same buffer. Then, the medium was removed, and 3 ml of fresh KRB buffer containing 0.1 or 22.2 mm glucose was introduced. Incubation under the test conditions was carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, media were sampled and centrifuged, and the supernatants were used to assay for lactate released during the incubation period. The cells were trypsinized, detached, and used to assay for protein amount. LDH activity was measured using LDH assay kit (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan). After the indicated culture periods, cells of four of the 32-mm-diameter wells at a concentration of 1.0–5.0 × 106/well, treated with or without EtBr, were used for measurement of one condition after trypsinization and resuspension. Briefly, lysate of 1.0–5.0 × 104 cells in a 100-μl final volume with 1% Triton X-100 were applied for photometric measurement in final volume of 200 μl of assay mixture as indicated by the manufacturer. LDH from rabbit muscle (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the standard. NADH autofluorescence (400–500 nm) of the monolayer-cultured cells was imaged using two-photon excitation microscopy (26Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa K. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Xu C. Zipfel W. Shear J.B. Williams R.M. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) at an excitation wavelength of 720 nm. Cells were plated at a density of 0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2 and cultured with or without EtBr for the indicated times on 5 mm-in-diameter glass coverslips. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's method unless otherwise indicated. For all comparisons in the figures, * and ** denote 0.01 ≤ p < 0.05 andp < 0.01, respectively. In static incubations, during suppression of the electron transport system by EtBr, glucose-induced insulin secretion was decreased by 4-day EtBr treatment and had almost disappeared by day 6, as shown in Fig.1 A. However, glibenclamide-stimulated insulin secretion was not reduced on day 2, 4, or 6 of EtBr treatment (Fig. 1 A). The concentration-secretion relationship curves (Fig. 1 C) showed a decrease in insulin release with glucose stimulation. These results are similar to our previous data (9Hayakawa T. Noda M. Yasuda K. Yorifuji H. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Sakura H. Terauchi Y. Hayashi J.-I. Sharp G.W.G. Kanazawa Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20300-20307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of the electron transport system ultimately abolished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 1, A and C), whereas insulin secretion elicited by glibenclamide was maintained (Fig. 1 A) because it does not employ metabolism for its effect, as discussed previously (9Hayakawa T. Noda M. Yasuda K. Yorifuji H. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Sakura H. Terauchi Y. Hayashi J.-I. Sharp G.W.G. Kanazawa Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20300-20307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the formerly observed increase in basal (nonstimulated) insulin secretion in EtBr-treated cells (9Hayakawa T. Noda M. Yasuda K. Yorifuji H. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Sakura H. Terauchi Y. Hayashi J.-I. Sharp G.W.G. Kanazawa Y. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20300-20307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was also seen in the current series of experiments on most occasions. However, the degree of the increase was much smaller, possibly because of the more dense initial cell concentration (0.03 × 106/cm2 versus 0.1–0.15 × 106/cm2) with which culture was started in this series of experiments. Perifusion experiments were performed on day 4 (Fig. 1 B), and in these experiments, both the first and the second phase of glucose-elicited insulin secretion were reduced, the latter being nearly abolished by the treatment. The [Ca2+]i measurement was performed on day 4 (Fig. 2). Basal (initial) [Ca2+]i at the start of stimulation did not differ significantly between EtBr-treated (189 nm; n = 13) and control conditions (212 nm; n = 23) by Student's ttest. Both glucose and glibenclamide increased [Ca2+]i under control conditions. However, in EtBr-treated cells, the mean ratio over the initial (start of stimulation) [Ca2+]i was decreased significantly under glucose stimulation at every time point 4 min after stimulation and thereafter. By contrast, the glibenclamide-induced [Ca2+]iincrease did not differ significantly except at 2 min after the start of stimulation. Membrane potential was measured by whole cell mode patch clamp on day 6 (Fig.3). In control cells, both glucose and glibenclamide elicited depolarization of the membrane potential with an action potential burst. Glibenclamide was still able to trigger the potential without being affected by EtBr treatment (Fig.3 D). By contrast, the glucose-induced change in membrane potential was abolished by EtBr treatment, as shown in Fig.3 C. ATP and ADP contents were measured on day 4 and day 6. As shown in Fig.4, the steady-state ATP and ADP contents of the cells (measured after a 30-min incubation in 0.1 mmglucose after continuous culture) were fairly well maintained even with EtBr treatment, i.e. they were equilibrated. The ATP/ADP ratio before stimulation did not differ significantly on either day 4 or 6 between EtBr-treated and control cells. After glucose stimulation, although no significant ATP increase was observed on either day in EtBr-treated cells or even in control cells, the ADP content was decreased significantly in control cells (days 4 and 6) and in EtBr-treated cells (day 4). As a result, the ATP/ADP ratio was increased significantly (at 30 min) in control cells. In EtBr-treated cells, however, this increase in the ATP/ADP ratio was not significant on either day. With 4- and 6-day EtBr treatment, glucose oxidation (Fig.5 B), measured by the rate of14CO2 formation fromd-[14C]glucose, was decreased severely compared with control cells (by 63% on day 4 and by 78% on day 6; both p < 0.01 by Student's t test) under the stimulatory (22.2 mm) condition; under the nonstimulatory (0.8 mm) condition, it was substantially decreased as well (p < 0.05 on day 4 andp < 0.01 on day 6; Student's t test). By contrast, glucose utilization was only marginally affected on both day 4 and day 6 of EtBr treatment, as measured by3H2O formation fromd-[5-3H]glucose, suggesting the glycolytic pathway to be intact (Fig. 5 A). The slight, but significant (Student's t test), difference in glucose utilization could represent a backward effect of suppressed mitochondrial metabolism (see “Discussion”). In control cells, the ratio of glucose oxidation to utilization under the stimulatory (22.2 mm glucose) condition was 10–15%. This percentage was similar to previous data obtained with βHC9 cells (14Liang Y. Bai G. Doliba N. Buetteger C. Wang L. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E846-E857PubMed Google Scholar), which was much smaller than those (∼70% of utilization) with mouse (28Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and rat (24Aizawa T. Sato Y. Ishihara F. Taguchi N. Komatsu M. Suzuki N. Hashizume K. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C622-C627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) islets at a stimulatory glucose concentration (16.7 mm) measured using the same methods for both oxidation and utilization. Lactate production under basal (0.1 mm glucose) conditions was not different on either day 4 or day 6 (Fig. 5 C). At 22.2 mm glucose, it was increased by 2.9- and 3.5-fold by EtBr on days 4 and 6, respectively (both p < 0.01; Student's t test) (Fig. 5 C). T"

These lesions cause replicational errors and can lead to cell death or cancer if left unrepaired (1Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Leffell D.J. Simon J.A. Sharma H.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 2Brash D.E. Rudolph J.A. Simon J.A. Lin A. McKenna G.J. Baden H.P. Halperin A.J. Ponten J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10124-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). One repair protein, DNA photolyase, incorporates a non-covalently bound FAD and requires blue light for repair (3Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that repair of the CPD proceeds by electron transfer from a photo-excited fully reduced FADH−to the CPD, which subsequently monomerizes within 2 ns (3Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Studies by Payne et al. (4Payne G. Heelis P.F. Rohrs B.R. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7121-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the oxidized enzyme can bind CPD-containing DNA but cannot efficiently repair the CPD lesion. As we show below, this differential behavior is extremely useful in understanding the substrate binding mode of photolyase. The crystal structures of the Escherichia coli andAspergillus nidulans holoenzymes were solved by Kim et al. (5Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and Tamada and co-workers (6Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A., De Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P.M. Miki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), respectively. These crystal structures revealed important structural elements that were both familiar and surprising. It was noted that the cavity has approximately the correct dimensions to enclose the CPD if the thymidines were folded in a coplanar geometry, leading to the prediction that photolyase would bind the CPD by “flipping out” the lesion from the double helical DNA (5Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The FADH− cofactor was found to lie at the bottom of this cavity, consistent with the ability of the cofactor to resist oxidation by molecular O2. The surface of the protein above the cavity incorporates a strip of positively charged amino acid residues that are thought to help orient the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the damaged DNA strand. Unfortunately, no crystal structure of the enzyme-substrate complex is available, but a recent crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus complexed with thymine was published by Komori and co-workers (7Komori H. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 98: 13560-13565Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which shows the thymine residing in the putative substrate cavity. While thymine is not a substrate, it can be thought of as a partial product of the repair reaction. This is the strongest evidence regarding the substrate binding mode of photolyase for CPDs. However, it does not clarify whether one or both of the thymine bases of the CPD is bound in the cavity. Other experimental evidence for the mode of substrate binding is available. Most notable are the ethylation and footprinting studies of Husain et al. (8Husain I. Sancar G.B. Holbrook S.R. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13188-13197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that the ethylation of the phosphates 3′ and 5′ to the CPD inhibit the binding of the lesion strand to photolyase. Ethylation of phosphate groups on the complementary strand had no effect on binding. Footprinting experiments showed that only 6–7 bases around the CPD were protected by the protein. This small footprint is significant in that it suggests that photolyase binds substrate in a structure-specific, as opposed to a sequence-specific manner. Binding studies using specific nucleotide sequences have shown that distortions of the backbone caused by the CPD aid in the recognition of the lesion by PL (9Kim S.T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution mutagenesis studies by Berg and Sancar (10Berg B.J.V. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20276-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also support this hypothesis. The question has sparked several computational studies as well, most of which support the base flipping hypothesis (11Hahn J. Michel-Beyerle M.-E. Rösch N. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 2001-2007Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Sanders D.B. Wiest O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 121: 5127-5134Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic studies suggest that there is little energy cost for flipping the CPD into solution (13Jing Y. Kao J.F.L. Taylor J.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3845-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are several DNA-binding proteins that appear to manipulate DNA by flipping out bases from the helical structure (14Roberts R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For example, DNA methyltransferase is thought to base flip an adenine into the enzyme for methylation (15Holz B. Klimasauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Another repair protein, T4 endonuclease V, has been shown to flip an adenine opposing the CPD lesion out of the helix (17McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Scharer O.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27210-27217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several of these studies have used a fluorescent adenine analog, 2-aminopurine (2-Ap), as a reporter of helical structure. 2-Ap can be incorporated into a DNA oligomer using automated synthesis and has a strong absorption band centered at 303 nm (ε = 6000m−1 cm−1 for the nucleotide) (18Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). High quantum yield emission peaks at about 370 nm for the nucleoside in aqueous solution (19Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 2-Ap is incorporated into oligomeric ss-DNA, the emission is significantly quenched and blue-shifted (20Law S.M. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When a 2-Ap containing ss-DNA oligomer is annealed to its complement, the 2-Ap fluorescence is further quenched by base stacking (16Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the quantum yield and emission maximum of 2-Ap are effective reporters of base stacking and solvent exposure (polarity), respectively. We have utilized these properties to probe base flipping in photolyase by incorporated 2-Ap opposite a thymidine dimer. Any structural changes that occur in the region of the lesion would be detected as changes in quantum yield and perhaps emission maximum. 2-Ap absorbs in the same spectral window as reduced photolyase. This will complicate the analysis of the experiment, because the 2-Ap emission will come from oligonucleotides in various stages of repair. The rate of repair of CPDs by DNA photolyase is in the nanosecond range (although the turnover rate is much slower (21Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). To circumvent this difficulty theoxidized enzyme (PLox) is used, which can bind the CPD lesion without repairing it. The results using oxidized enzyme show that base flipping is operative in DNA photolyase. Experiments using the reduced enzyme demonstrate that the 2-Ap-containing CPD duplex is a substrate for photolyase. E. coli DNA Photolyase was overexpressed from JM109 cells transformed with the pMS969 plasmid containing the phr gene (the plasmid was a generous gift of Professor Aziz Sancar, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The purification of the protein was based on the method of Payneet al. (4Payne G. Heelis P.F. Rohrs B.R. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7121-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and modified as described in detail in a previous paper (22MacFarlane A.W., IV Stanley R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15203-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli photolyase was isolated in the blue semiquinone form. The apoprotein was made by stripping the FAD and folate chromophores using low pH buffers containing saturated KBr (23Jorns M.S. Wang B. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The apoprotein was reconstituted with oxidized FAD and purified on a phenyl-Sepharose column. The purity of the reconstituted protein was determined by the ratio of absorbances at λ = 280 nm (protein) and 450 nm (FAD). The ratio ofA 280/A 450 was typically around 20–25. Pure protein would have a ratio of about 12 based on the known extinction coefficients of the apoprotein and FAD-reconstituted protein (24Wang B. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein purity was about 60%. Further purification was deemed unnecessary as apophotolyase will not bind substrate (25Payne G. Wills M. Walsh C. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5706-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two HPLC-purified 11-mer oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The 2-Ap-containing oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-CTCCAACTTGC-3′ (“2-Ap,” whereA = 2-Ap) and its complement, 3′-GAGGTTGAACG-5′ (“T-T”) were resuspended in HPLC-grade water and used without further purification, though their purity was checked by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (data not shown). The T-T oligonucleotide was irradiated with UV-A light to produced the CPD-containing complementary oligonucleotide (“T<>T”). Irradiation of a solution of 8.4 × 10−2mm T-T 11-mer and 1 mm acetophenone/ethanol was performed in a 10-mm quartz fluorescence cell sealed with a septum. The cuvette was first purged with argon for 30 min to remove oxygen and subsequently placed on ice. The cell was covered with a Petri dish to filter out wavelengths below ∼310 nm and irradiated for 4.25 h using 2 Philips Ultraviolet-B 40-watt bulbs at a distance of about 20 cm. Following irradiation, the solvent was removed using a Savant Speed Vac® SC110. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of HPLC-grade water. The T<>T oligonucleotide was purified using a Rainin HPLC with a Waters 8 × 100 mm Radial Compression Nova-Pak C18column. A linear gradient of 7.8–9.0% acetonitrile was used against 100 mm tetraethylammonium acetate over 20 min at 1 ml/min with detection at 254 nm (26Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The T<>T oligonucleotide was collected and desiccated to dryness, resuspended in HPLC-grade water, and desalted using a Bio-Rad P6 mini-gel filtration column. It was stored at −20 °C following desiccation until used. The purified T<>T oligonucleotide was subjected to photorepair by photolyase to show that it was the substrate of the protein. A mixture of 0.50 μmoxidized photolyase in buffer T (50 mm phosphate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) was reduced under anoxic conditions with 1.2 × 10−2 mm sodium dithionite. Excess dithionite was allowed to react with water to produce bisulfate. 1.0 μm T<>T oligonucleotide was added to the assay mixture. Repair of the T<>T oligonucleotide was initiated with exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet light from a Spectroline® model ENF-240C hand lamp. Repair was monitored at 260 nm with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-visible spectrometer following 5-s exposures to the UV light. Samples were prepared fresh for each scan to 1 ml total volume in buffer T. Mixtures of oligonucleotides were placed in a sterile Eppendorf tube in minimal volume, typically less than 50 μl. These samples were heated in a 60 °C water bath for 6 min and allowed to cool to room temperature on the laboratory bench for 30 min. The annealed samples were then brought to a total volume of 1 ml in buffer T, taking into account any extra volume incurred if PL was added to the sample. The fluorescence cuvette containing the sample was sonicated briefly in a small ultrasonic cleaner to remove bubbles. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a Spex Fluoro-Max-2® fluorimeter. Each emission spectrum are averages of four scans in the range of 330–510 nm with excitation at 317 nm. The scans were set at an integration time of 0.2 s, increment of 2 nm, and the excitation and emission band pass of 8 and 4 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission light were unpolarized. Spectra are corrected for the background fluorescence and Raman scattering of the buffer or control sample. A 0.50 × 1.0-cm fluorescence quartz cell was used. For temperature-dependent measurements the fluorimeter cuvette holder was connected to a temperature-variable circulating water bath. The cuvette was allowed to equilibrate in the holder for 10 min in the dark prior to a scan. The duplexes used in this study were as follows, T­T:5′­GCAAGTTGGAG­3′ 2­Ap:3′­CGTTCAACCTC­5′and T⋄T:5′­GCAAGTTGGAG­3′ 2­Ap:3′­CGTTCAACCTC­5′where the underlined A indicates the position of the 2-aminopurine base in the 2-AP containing ss-DNA, T-T stands for the complementary strand, and T<>T indicates the cyclobutylthymidine dimer-containing oligonucleotide (the position of the lesion is indicated by TT). UV-A lamps were used to generate the CPD lesion in the TT-containing 11-mer oligonucleotide, and HPLC purification of the photoproduct was performed as described by Banerjee et al. (26Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the complementary strand sequence is a subset of that used by Husain et al. (8Husain I. Sancar G.B. Holbrook S.R. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13188-13197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their ethylation studies. To verify that the HPLC-purified DNA photoproduct contained the cis-syn dimer, a 1 μm solution of this oligomer was mixed with 0.50 μm “blue” photolyase (the holoenzyme containing both folate and flavin chromophores) in buffer T. The mixture was deoxygenated and then reduced with 12 μm sodium dithionite. Irradiation of this mixture with 365 nm light from a UV hand lamp (∼500 μW/cm2) resulted in photoreactivation of the dimer lesion as measured by the recovery of absorbance at 265 nm (data not shown) (23Jorns M.S. Wang B. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Payne G. Wills M. Walsh C. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5706-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The absorbance change at this wavelength corresponds to the reappearance of the C5 = C6 and C5′ = C6′ double bonds in the thymidine nucleotides, which were lost upon dimerization. The negative absorbance at ∼230 nm is due to the greater extinction coefficient of the CPD relative to the repaired thymines (27Fisher G.J. Johns H.E. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. 1. Academic Press, New York1976: 226-294Google Scholar). It is important to ascertain whether changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of the 2-Ap probe are due to conformational changes of the helix produced by protein binding or a partial melting of the duplex due to perturbations introduced by the CPD and/or 2-Ap base. Fig.1 shows the melting curves obtained for the 2-Ap/T-T and 2-Ap/T<>T duplexes by monitoring the 2-Ap fluorescence as a function of temperature. Melting points were derived by finding the temperature corresponding to the maximum of the derivative of the melting curve. The melting point of the 2-Ap/T-T duplex is T m = 48 °C, while the 2-Ap/T<>T duplex has a Tm = 42 °C (±2 °C). The 6 °C difference between the melting points agree well with that obtained for a decamer duplex with and without a CPD (56 and 48 °C) (28McAteer K. Jing Y. Kao J. Taylor J.S. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), although the absolute T m is about 8 °C lower than for the decamer without the 2-Ap. We ascribe this difference to the aminopurine itself, which has been shown to lead to lower melting points, as much as 10 °C (29Xu D. Evans K.O. Nordlund T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the melting points for the duplexes used in this study are well above the temperature at which the quenching experiments were done (23 °C) where any melting artifacts would be small. Other experiments performed at 15 °C in our laboratory have given similar results (data not shown). The emission spectra of ss- and ds-DNA oligomers were measured with excitation at 317 nm. The buffered samples consisted of (a) 0.50 μm 2-Ap oligonucleotide, (b) 0.50 μm 2-Ap oligonucleotide annealed to 0.50 μmT-T oligo, and (c) 2-Ap containing oligonucleotide annealed to 0.50 μm T<>T oligonucleotide. The spectra are shown in Fig. 2 a. Each spectrum is the average of three separate experiments and preparations. Quantification of the changes in fluorescence in these scans are reported for the peak fluorescence intensity and the integrated intensity of the fluorescence spectrum between 350–400 nm. This range was chosen to reduce the potential influence of Rayleigh scattering of the excitation wavelength into the emission spectrum. These quantities are ratioed to the 2-Ap oligonucleotide value in each case to get the relative quenching. The values are shown in TableI. Good agreement between peak and area values were obtained.Table IFluorescence emission of DNA oligonucleotidesSampleλ emmaxI max(λ emmax)I max/I max(2-Ap)Area (350–400 nm)Area/area(2-Ap) (350–400 nm)nm2-Ap368 ± 25.6 (± 0.6) × 10511.2 (± 0.1) × 10712-Ap/T-T368 ± 28.3 (± 2.4) × 1040.15 ± 0.031.8 (± 0.6) × 1060.15 ± 0.042-Ap/T<>T374 ± 21.36 (± 0.05) × 1050.25 ± 0.033.1 (± 0.1) × 1060.26 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab The single-stranded 2-Ap 11-mer in buffer had the highest fluorescence yield, with an emission maximum of 368 ± 2 nm. Addition of one equivalent of its complementary T-T oligonucleotide followed by heating to 62 °C with slow cooling (2-Ap/T-T) quenched the 2-Ap fluorescence by a factor of about 7 (I 2-Ap/T-T/I2-Ap = 0.15 ± 0.03). The emission maximum was unchanged within experimental error. We take this as evidence for double-helix formation and Watson-Crick base pairing between the 2-Ap and the opposing thymidine on the complementary strand, as 2-Ap is known to undergo significant quenching due to base stacking facilitated by favorable Watson-Crick base pairing (15Holz B.

A. 1994; 91: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When one equivalent of the T<>T complementary oligonucleotide was annealed with the 2-Ap oligonucleotide, fluorescence emission was quenched by a factor of about 4 (I 2-Ap/T<>T /I 2-Ap = 0.25 ± 0.03) when compared with the ss-2-Ap 11-mer. The slight increase in fluorescence yield compared with 2-Ap/T-T can be ascribed to a reduction in base stacking at the 2-Ap site due to the perturbation introduced by the CPD on the opposing strand. This interpretation is consistent with the results from a solution state NMR structure of a CPD-containing dodecamer DNA duplex (28McAteer K. Jing Y. Kao J. Taylor J.S. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in which the 3′-side of the CPD is perturbed relative normal B-DNA structure. In that study, a decided propeller twist of the T· · · A planes across the helix was observed, resulting in a loss of base stacking of the 5′-adenine opposing the CPD. The hydrogen bond length between these two bases is also slightly longer than that for other base pairs in the dodecamer. Nordlund and co-workers (29Xu D. Evans K.O. Nordlund T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have explored the changes in duplex structure and rigidity due to the incorporation of a 2-Ap base in a decamer duplex. They found that 2-Ap is less rigidly constrained and more prone to spontaneous excursions out of the duplex, leading to less base stacking. Both a loss of base stacking and base pairing are consistent with the increase in fluorescence yield in our experiments. Interestingly, the 2-Ap/T<>T duplex exhibited a 6 nm red shifted emission maximum compared with the 2-Ap 11-mer. In terms of solvatochromism, a red shift is expected if a chromophore goes from a less polar to a more polar solvent, as would be the case if 2-Ap suffered more solvent exposure (31Liptay W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1969; 8: 177-188Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). An additional requirement for the red shift is that the permanent dipole moment of the excited state is greater than the ground state dipole moment, which has been verified experimentally (32Rachofsky E.L. Ross J.B.A. Krauss M. Osman R. Acta Phys. Pol. 1998; A94: 735-748Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, this red shift is not apparent in the emission spectrum of the single-stranded 2-Ap oligonucleotide, which suggests that the 2-Ap base opposing the thymidine dimer has neither flipped out into solvent nor retained its normal interactions in the double helix. One possible explanation is that the 2-Ap undergoes enough of a rotation that its difference dipole moment relative to the helix electric field produces the observed red shift, although this is only a speculation. The samples for the protein-duplex studies consisted of (d) 0.50 μm 2-Ap, 0.55 μmPLox, (e) 0.50 μm 2-Ap, 0.50 μm T-T, 0.55 μm PLox, and (f) 0.50 μm 2-Ap, 0.50 μmT<>T, 0.55 μm PLox. A control sample of 0.55 μm PLox was also scanned and subtracted from samples d–f to remove buffer and protein fluorescence and Raman scattering (scan not shown). The results are shown in Fig.2 b and the quantitative analysis summarized in TableII. Addition of photolyase to the ss-2-Ap oligonucleotide gave essentially no change in the fluorescence yield or wavelength. This shows that there is little interaction between the 2-Ap oligonucleotide and PLox, which is consistent with the low association constant for a single stranded oligo without a CPD lesion (K A = 103m−1) (10Berg B.J.V.

Photolyase is known to bind undamaged duplex DNA with higher affinity than ss-DNA (9Kim S.T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For the normal duplex 11-mer (K A = 104m−1) only about 0.003 μm will bind (nonspecifically) to photolyase. The crystal structure shows that the substrate binding cavity is in the middle of a positively charged strip of amino acid residues (5Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). These residues undoubtedly attract and bind the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the duplex whether or not it has a CPD (9Kim S.T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The increased fluorescence may be the result of small structural changes to the helix bound to the protein surface. When reconstituted oxidized photolyase was added to the 2-Ap/T<>T duplex, the fluorescence increased by a factor of about 5 relative to the 2-Ap/T-T/PLox sample and is very close to the emission yield obtained for the single-stranded 2-Ap/PLox sample. The emission maximum of the enzyme-bound duplex shifted back to 368 ± 2 nm from the 374 nm peak for 2-Ap/T<>T in buffer alone. Using an association constant of K A = 109m−1 for a DNA duplex containing a CPD (10Berg B.J.V. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20276-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the concentration of protein-substrate complex will be about 0.49 μm (or about 98%) of the duplex is bound. Such a large change in fluorescence yield indicates that a severe distortion of the local helical structure has occurred around the 2-Ap base. The band shape of the emission spectra for the duplexes with PLox was somewhat different from that of the duplexes alone. Part of the fluorescence increase occurs below and above the 2-Ap emission range (roughly 340–460 nm). It is possible that this may be due to energy transfer from the excited 2Ap base to the FAD cofactor, which has significant absorption below 490 nm. However, oxidized photolyase alone show very little fluorescence when excited directly with 317 nm light (data not shown), and its fluorescence emission is peaked at about 520 nm. It is more likely that the broad fluorescence signal is due to a distribution of conformations experienced by 2-Ap as the duplexes bind non-specifically to the photolyase protein. Using the oxidized enzyme for these experiments has the advantage that base flipping can be observed without significant repair of the CPD during the fluorescence scans. However, to verify that the 2-Ap/T<>T duplex is a true substrate for photolyase, we performed fluorescence experiments after reduction of the photolyase by dithionite. A sample consisting of 0.50 μm 2-Ap, 0.50 μm T<>T, 0.55 μm PLox was transferred to the 10-mm fluorescence quartz cuvette and subsequently purged with argon to achieve anoxic conditions. Four equivalents (in a 2-μl volume) of sodium dithionite was added to reduce the photolyase. The sample was allowed to sit for 1 h to allow any excess dithionite to react to form bisulfate. All preparative steps were performed under yellow lights, and all subsequent measurements were done in the dark so that no unwanted photorepair occurred. The cuvette containing the reduced enzyme-substrate was exposed to 365 nm light over 30 min, and fluorescence emission spectra were taken at 5-min intervals. The results can be seen in Fig.3, where I(t) − I(0) is plotted versus emission wavelength. As repair proceeds the 2-Ap fluorescence is quenched. This is consistent with repair of the CPD lesion and subsequent dissociation of the protein-substrate complex. No shift in the emission maximum was observed. The 2-Ap fluorescence decreases to about 3.7 × 105 at λ emmax, which is roughly equal to the difference between the fluorescence yield of I(2-Ap/T<>T/PLox) and I(2-Ap/T-T/PLox) (=3.4 × 105). Reduction of the photolyase protein with dithionite in the presence of the 2-Ap/T<>T duplex showed no effect on the 2-Ap fluorescence as long as the sample was not exposed to blue light (data not shown). Dithionite treatment of a 2-Ap/T<>T sample had no effect on its fluorescence yield (data not shown). These experiments show that binding of the CPD substrate byE. coli DNA photolyase is accompanied by a substantial conformational change to the duplex around the 2-Ap probe base. This local disruption of helical structure is strong evidence that local melting has occurred and suggests that the CPD has been flipped out of the helix into the cavity of the protein, exposing the complementary 2-Ap base to solvent and destroying base stacking interactions. Other studies have suggested that base stacking will be disrupted by photolyase at the 5′-A opposite the 3′-T of a CPD. The work of Husainet al. (8Husain I. Sancar G.B. Holbrook S.R. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13188-13197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is particularly noteworthy in that it shows that the N3 of the complementary adenine opposing the 5′-T of the CPD can be methylated. The accessibility of this adenine points to the kind of duplex disorder observed in our fluorescence experiments. Unfortunately, no mention is made of whether the adenine opposing the 3′T shows similar accessibility, as this adenine has been replaced by 2-Ap in our experiments. The mutagenesis and ethylation experiments of Berg and Sancar (10Berg B.J.V. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20276-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were used by these authors to justify a model where the CPD is flipped into the photolyase cavity and stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The authors predict that the 3′-T of the CPD interacts more strongly with the protein binding pocket. This prediction agrees with our observation that stacking interactions with 5′ 2-Ap probe opposing this thymine base are disrupted. Our results are also consistent with an NMR study of a CPD-containing dodecamer duplex, which shows that the 3′-T of the CPD is more perturbed than the 5′-T, although binding to the protein will undoubtedly change the solution-state conformation. We are currently performing measurements using a 3′ 2-Ap oligonucleotide to determine how far the structural distortion propagates along the duplex, particularly in the protein-substrate complex. Stivers (33Stivers J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and Rachofsky and co-workers (34Rachofsky E.L. Seibert E. Stivers J.T. Osman R. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that destabilization of base stacking occurs if a 2-Ap base is positioned opposing an abasic site (AB). The fluorescence increase for this case (I2Ap-AB/I2Ap-N, where N is A, G, T, or C) fell in a range from about 1.2 to 2.3 and was sequence-dependent (33Stivers J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). If base flipping occurs in photolyase then it would somewhat mimic an abasic site for the opposing 2-Ap base. Our results show a factor of 5 increase in fluorescence when the target duplex is bound by photolyase. This suggests that the deformation of the duplex by base flipping is considerably greater than that generated by an abasic lesion, supporting the base flipping model. The computational work of Sanders and Wiest (12Sanders D.B. Wiest O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 121: 5127-5134Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) agrees well with our results. They performed molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-substrate complex, which predicts that a base-flipped CPD, is stabilized by the protein binding site over the duration of the simulation. Specifically, their simulation shows that the 3′-T will experience disruption of base pairing and stacking, whereas the 5′-T is much less perturbed. Zhao et al. (35Zhao X. Liu J. Hsu D.S. Zhao S. Taylor J.-S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32580-32590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) used mismatched bases opposing the (6-4) DNA lesion as a target duplex to probe whether (6-4) photolyase base flips this substrate for repair. Since a mismatched sequence would give greater conformational flexibility to the lesion, it was expected that the binding affinity for this target would be higher than for the completely complementary sequence if base flipping were operative. They observed that the mismatch duplex had a factor of two higher affinity than the complementary duplex. Given the high homology between (6-4) and CPD photolyase (36Kanai S. Kikuno R. Toh H. Ryo H. Todo T. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to presume that both (6-4) and CPD photolyases use base flipping for substrate binding. Allan et al. (37Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have also used mismatched base pairs to confirm that base flipping occurs in EcoRI DNA methyltransferase. This DNA-modifying enzyme transfers a methyl group from S-adennosyl-l-methionine to adenine N6. By replacing the target adenine with 2-Ap they showed that prior to the methylation step the target adenine is flipped out into a hydrophobic pocket of the protein. As in the work of Zhaoet al. (35Zhao X. Liu J. Hsu D.S. Zhao S. Taylor J.-S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32580-32590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) they measured a 2-fold increase on equilibrium binding affinity for a 2-Ap-containing duplex versus the complementary duplex. They measured the dynamics of the base flipping reaction using fluorescence stopped-flow methods, obtaining a flipping rate of about 21 s−1. It will be interesting to see whether the rate of flipping a CPD or (6-4) lesion differ from single nucleotide rate. Finally, base flipping has been observed for T4 endonuclease V, which repairs CPDs in a light-independent manner (17McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Scharer O.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27210-27217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this protein it is thought that the 3′-A base opposing a CPD is flipped into the endonuclease protein cavity, exactly the opposite behavior hypothesized for photolyase. McCullough and co-workers (17McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Scharer O.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27210-27217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) observed no change in 2-Ap fluorescence when the 2-Ap opposed the 3′-T of the CPD, in sharp contrast to our results. We have preliminary data that show a similar fluorescence increase using a 3′-2-Ap probe as compared with the 5′-2-Ap case presented herein (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the 3′-2-Ap results will provide more detailed information on how photolyase flips its substrate into the protein cavity, where it is repaired with nearly unit quantum efficiency. Taken together, these data show that photolyase distorts the CPD-containing DNA duplex to such an extent as to disrupt base stacking around the lesion, strongly supporting the base flipping model originally proposed by Park et al. (5Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The intriguing photolyase-thymine cocrystal structure introduces an ambiguity as to whether one or both thymines in the CPD actually enters the cavity. In another study, we have shown that both thymines are necessary to produce an apparent electrochromic shift in the PLox-CPD absorption spectrum (22MacFarlane A.W., IV Stanley R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15203-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus we expect that the entire CPD is accommodated by the protein cavity. Further experiments are planned to extend our knowledge of the extent to which the duplex is deformed to repair the CPD. The 2-Ap approach used in this study can be extended into the time domain by stopped-flow and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. Such experiments are under way in our laboratory. We thank Professor Christopher Lawrence (University of Rochester) for helpful advice on making and purifying the thymidine dimers."

Erythropoietin receptors have also been identified on neuronal cell lines and Epo stimulated calcium influx in these cells as well (15Masuda S. Nagao M. Takahata K. Konishi Y. Gallyas F., Jr. Tabira T. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11208-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated an important neuroprotective and neurotropic effect of erythropoietin on brain tissue (16Dame C. Juul S.E. Christensen R.D. Biol.

Epo stimulated an increase in cell viability in nerve growth factor-deprived cells, as well as increases in45Ca2+ uptake and [Ca]i. These effects were inhibited by nicardipine, suggesting that Epo may stimulate neuronal function and viability through activation of calcium channels (19Koshimura K. Murakami Y. Sohiya M. Tanaka J. Kato Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a broader role for Epo as a growth factor capable of maintaining proliferation and preventing apoptosis during differentiation and emphasize the importance of understanding the mechanism of erythropoietin regulation of calcium influx. A major impediment in determining the mechanisms through which erythropoietin modulates calcium entry and understanding the impact of this on cell growth and differentiation has been the difficulty in identifying and cloning the calcium-permeable channel(s) involved. Recently, a transient receptor potential (TRP) protein superfamily was identified, consisting of a diverse group of calcium-permeable cation channels expressed in nonexcitable cells, based on the archetypal TRP cloned in Drosophila (21Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, 2001(90):RE1Google Scholar). Drosophila TRP is predominantly expressed in the visual system, is required for phototransduction, and is coupled via a G protein to phospholipase C. Based on sequences from Drosophila TRP, a large number of mammalian isoforms have been cloned, which have been divided into six subfamilies (22Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, 2001(90):RE1Google Scholar). All mammalian isoforms share six putative transmembrane domains similar to the core structure of many pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated channels except that they lack positive charged residues necessary for the voltage sensor. The classical (22Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, 2001(90):RE1Google Scholar) or short (21Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) TRP channels (TRPC) were selected for our initial studies, reported here, because these channels have many characteristics similar to the voltage-independent, Epo-modulated calcium-permeable channels identified in human erythroblasts. These TRPC proteins all contain ankyrin repeat domains, which may be important in protein/protein interactions, and amino acid sequence identity greater than 30% in their N terminus but high variability in their carboxyl-terminal region beyond the conserved TRP domain. This diverse family of channels has both store-operated and receptor-modulated members, which function through intracellular second messenger systems (21Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, 2001(90):RE1Google Scholar). The mechanism of regulation of [Ca]i by erythropoietin has previously been examined at the single cell level using fluorescence microscopy coupled to digital video imaging (4Miller B.A Scaduto R.C., Jr. Tillotson D.L.

In this report, we used RT-PCR to determine the expression pattern of TRPC on murine erythroid cell lines HCD-57 and Ba/F3 Epo-R, in which Epo stimulates a rise in [Ca]i (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L. Bell L.L. Beattie B.K. Zhang M.-Y. Neel B.G. Yoakim M. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20465-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TRPC2 was the only TRPC detected in these cells under conditions that identified the presence of all TRPC in brain. Two of four TRPC2 splice variants were expressed in these hematopoietic cells. The expression and function of the longest isoform, TRPC2 clone 14 (24), was examined. Cell fractionation and immunolocalization using an antibody specific for TRPC2 clone 14 demonstrated plasma membrane expression. The ability of erythropoietin to modulate calcium influx through TRPC2 was determined using a digital video imaging system in which single cells that expressed transfected Epo-R were identified by detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP), cells that express transfected TRPC were identified by detection of blue fluorescent protein (BFP), and [Ca]i changes were simultaneously measured by Rhod-2 or Fura Red fluorescence. Tissues were obtained from C57Bl/6 mice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until use. Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with wild type murine Epo-R were cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 500 pg/ml IL-3. HCD-57 cells (Dr. Sandra Ruscetti) were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium with 30% FCS, 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 units/ml Epo. CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FCS. Splenic erythroblasts were obtained by injecting mice with phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally on days 1 and 2. Mice were sacrificed on day 5 by cervical dislocation, the spleen was removed, and a single cell suspension was prepared (25Barber D.L. Beattie B.K. Mason J.M. Nguyen M.H.-H. Yoakim M. Neel B.

To isolate erythroid lineage cells (27Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Hematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the spleen cell suspension was washed and labeled with Ter-119 Microbeads (10 μl/1 × 107cells; Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Ter-119+ cells were selected by magnetic sorting with the VarioMACS (Miltenyi). Wright’s staining of the Ter-119+ cell fraction revealed that greater than 95% of nucleated cells were erythroblasts. RNA was prepared from murine brain, heart, kidney, spleen, Ba-F3 Epo-R, HCD-57, and CHO cells. cDNA was prepared from RNA using the Superscript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) for RT-PCR. Primers were designed for each TRPC based on coding sequences, and specificity for each TRPC primer set was confirmed using the NCBI data base. RT-PCR was typically performed for 35 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 45–60 s). The following 5′ and 3′ primers were used in RT-PCR: mTRPC1, 5′ primer (5′-GATTTTGGGAAATTTCTGGGAATG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TTTATCCTCATGATTTGCTATCA-3′); mTRPC2, 5′ primer (5′-GACATGATCCGGTTCATGTTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CATCAGCATCATCCTCGATCT-3′); mTRPC3, 5′ primer (5′-GACATATTCAAGTTCATGGTTCTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′- ACATCACTGTCATCCTCGATCTC-3′); mTRPC4, 5′ primer (5′-CTGCAGATATCTCTGGGAAGG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCTTTGTTCGAGCAAATTTCC-3′); mTRPC5, 5′ primer (5′-GATGATACCAATGACGGCAGTG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CAGATGCCGGATGCTCAGTGAAG-3′); mTRPC6, 5′ primer (5′-ATGAAGCATTCACAACAGTTGAG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GAAAGGTCTTCGTGACTTCCTGA-3′). To obtain RT-PCR bands to distinguish each of the mTRPC2 splice variants, the following primers were used: mTRPC2 α, 5′ primer (5′-ACCTTCCTGGTCCCAGTGCCCTATC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCAGCTGGGCAATCTCATACAGGTC-3′); mTRPC2 β, 5′ primer (5′-GAGGCAGAGCTGGAGTTCAAGCATTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCAGCTGGGCAATCTCATACAGGTC-3′); mTRPC2 clone 14, 5′ primer (5′-GCCACCATGCTAATGTCCCGCACTG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TTTGGGCTTACCACACTGGCTGGAG-3′); mTRPC2 clone 17, 5′ primer (5′-CTGCTGTTGATATTTCTCAAGGACAAG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TCGAGTTG GACAACGATCTCCTTG-3′). Control primers used in RT-PCR were as follows: 18 S rRNA, 5′ primer (5′-GGGGCCCGAAGCGTTTACT-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCCACGGAATCGAGAAAGAGC-3′); β-actin, 5′ primer (5′-GGACCTGACAGACTACCTCATGAA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated to an epitope in the first 100 amino acids unique to the N terminus of mTRPC2 clone 14 (LNQNSTDVLESDPRPWLTN, aa 79–98) and affinity-purified. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed using in vitro translation products prepared with cDNAs for mTRPC2 clone 14 (24), mTRPC2 clone 17 (24), and mTRPC6 (28Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), cloned into pcDNA3. The in vitroproducts were prepared with the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). HCD-57 cells (3 × 105 cells/chamber) were placed in each well of Lab-Tek Permanox Chamber Slides precoated with fibronectin. After 30 min, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Incubation for 10 min in 20% normal goat serum preceded staining with primary antibody (anti-TRPC2 clone 14) for 20 min at room temperature followed by secondary antibody (FITC donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 20 min in the dark. Slides were stained with DAPI in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to visualize DNA. Cells were viewed using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Images were acquired with an air-cooled CCD SenSys digital camera from Photometrics (Tucson, AZ) and processed using IPLab and Enhanced Photon Reassignment software programs obtained from Scanalytics, Inc. (Fairfax, VA). Cell pellets from CHO cells nontransfected or transfected with mTRPC2 clone 14 in pcDNA3 (see below), Ba/F3 Epo-R cells, HCD-57 cells, and Ter-119+ splenic erythroblasts were removed from storage at −80 °C, and 1 ml of Buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) was added. Fresh murine brain, heart, kidney, and spleen were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer on ice to create a cell suspension retaining intact cells (confirmed by microscopy) and centrifuged, and Buffer I was added to each pellet. Lysates were sonicated, and an equal volume of Buffer II (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 20% sucrose, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) was added. Cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Crude membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol. Protein was quantified using the DC Bio-Rad Protein Assay to analyze diluted samples. Conditions for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with ECL were as described previously (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L. Bell L.L. Beattie B.K. Zhang M.-Y. Neel B.G. Yoakim M. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. J. Biol.

After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-TRPC2 clone 14 (1:500) or anti-mEpo-R (sc697; diluted 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000) was used as the secondary antibody. The pTracer-CMV vector (Invitrogen) containing an SV40 promoter driving expression of a GFP gene and a CMV promoter driving expression of mEpo-R was reported previously (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L. Bell L.L. Beattie B.K. Zhang M.-Y. Neel B.G. Yoakim M. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20465-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TRPC2 clone 14 (24), TRPC2 clone 17 (24), and mTRPC6 (28Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) in pcDNA3 were subcloned into pQBI50 (QbioGene, Carlsbad, CA). The pQBI50 vector contains a CMV promoter, which drives expression of SuperGlo BFP fused through a flexible linker to TRPC2 or TRPC6. CHO cells at 50% confluence were transfected with pTracer-CMV vector (3 μg/ml), pQBI50 vector (3 μg/ml), and LipofectAMINE (8 μl/ml; Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM 1 for 5 h at 37 °C. One ml was added to each 35-mm dish. At 5 h, an equal volume of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 20% FCS was added, and 18 h later this medium was replaced with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FCS. Successful transfection of CHO cells with Epo-R and TRPC was verified by detection of GFP (excitation, 478 nm; emission, 535 nm) and BFP (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 435 nm), respectively, in the cells with digital video imaging (4Miller B.A Scaduto R.C., Jr. Tillotson D.L.

The optimal time for expression of pTracer CMV Epo-R and pQBI50 TRPC2 was 48–72 h after transfection, and this time interval was selected to examine the response of transfected CHO cells to Epo. At this time, 20–40% of individual CHO cells expressed both GFP and BFP. Successful transfection was also confirmed by Western blotting using whole cell lysates of nontransfected and transfected CHO cells (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L. Bell L.L. Beattie B.K. Zhang M.-Y.

Anti-TRPC6 was obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel).

To study changes in [Ca]i in transfected cells, we were not able to use Fura-2 as the detection fluorophore because its excitation and emission wavelengths overlap with those of GFP. Instead, we used the fluorescent Ca2+ indicators Rhod-2 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L. Bell L.L. Beattie B.K. Zhang M.-Y. Neel B.G. Yoakim M. Rothblum L.I.

Rhod-2 is a single wavelength excitation Ca2+ fluorophore (excitation, 540 nm; emission, 600 nm), and its fluorescence intensity is proportional to [Ca]i, fluorophore concentration, optical path, and excitation light intensity. The ratio Ft(fluorescence at time t) divided by Fo(fluorescence at base line) was used to reflect changes in [Ca]i in Rhod-2-loaded CHO cells. CHO cells were loaded with Rhod-2 (2 μm, 20 min, 37 °C) and stimulated with recombinant erythropoietin (2000 units/ml; Amgen). Rhod-2 fluorescence was measured at base line and at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after Epo stimulation. In later experiments, to minimize errors associated with fluorphore leakage and variation in lamp intensity, we used Fura Red (excitation, 460 and 490 nm; emission, 600-nm long pass) (32Wu Y. Clusin W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2161-H2169PubMed Google Scholar,33Kurebayashi N. Harkins A.B. Baylor S.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1934-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a dual wavelength excitation probe whose fluorescence intensity ratio is related to [Ca]i. In these experiments, transfected CHO cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura Red-AM, in the presence of Pluronic F-127 to enhance loading, for 30 min at 37 °C. Epifluorescence collected at 460-nm excitation was divided by that collected at 490-nm excitation to obtain the fluorescence intensity ratio, which was measured at base line and over a 20-min interval as described for Rhod-2. In some experiments, cells were incubated immediately prior to and during Epo stimulation with PBS containing 0.5 mm probenecid (Sigma) to block fluorophore exit from the cell. [Ca]i measurements were performed in PBS either with (0.7 mm) or without external calcium (2 mmEGTA). The ability of erythropoietin to stimulate calcium influx in murine erythroid cells and erythroleukemia cell lines has been demonstrated previously (7Misiti J. Spivak J.L. J. Clin.

Here, to explore whether this influx occurred through the classical TRP channels, the expression of TRPC1 to -6 was examined in HCD-57 murine erythroleukemia cells and in Ba/F3 Epo-R cells, a hematopoietic cell line stably transfected with murine Epo-R and previously shown to respond to Epo with a rise in [Ca]i (23Miller B.A. Barber D.L.

Expression was compared with that found in several other murine tissues, and brain was used as a positive control, since most TRPC are expressed in the brain. RT-PCR was performed using RNA isolated from murine brain, heart, kidney, spleen, Ba/F3 Epo-R, and HCD-57 cells. Results are shown in Fig.1. TRPC2 mRNA was expressed in Ba/F3 Epo-R cells and in HCD-57 cells. No TRPC2 bands were observed when PCR was performed without the reverse transcriptase step, demonstrating that these products did not result from contaminating DNA. The identity of PCR bands was confirmed by sequencing. In contrast, no expression of other classical TRPC was detected in these hematopoietic cell lines. Four splice variants of murine TRPC2 have been cloned: mTRPC2 clone 14 (24) (GenBankTM accession number AF111108), mTRPC2 clone 17 (24) (accession number AF111107), mTRPC2 α (34Hofmann T.

https://openalex.org/W2142787391,"We previously reported (Rani, M. R., Asthagiri, A. R., Singh, A., Sizemore, N., Sathe, S. S., Li, X., DiDonato, J. D., Stark, G. R., and Ransohoff, R. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 44365–44368) that IFN-β induction of β-R1in fibrosarcoma cells required transcription factors ISGF-3 and NF-κB. IFN-β treatment did not augment the abundance of NF-κB, but led to phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and induced a nuclear activity capable of phosphorylating a p65-GST fusion construct in the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), residues 354–551. We now present evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in this pathway. Pretreatment of HT1080-derived fibrosarcoma cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin or LY294002) selectively inhibited IFN-β-induced β-R1 mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. In stably transfected cell lines, bovine p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signaling via PI3K and selectively suppressed IFN-β-mediated induction ofβ-R1. Overexpression of PTEN (phosphatase andtensin homologue mutated on chromosome ten), an antagonist of PI3K, blocked induction of a β-R1promoter-reporter construct. Studies with PTEN mutants suggested that the lipid kinase activity of PI3K was essential for IFN-β-induced transcription of β-R1. Consistent with this finding, a dominant-negative mutant of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K, selectively blocked IFN-β-mediated induction of the β-R1 promoter reporter. Furthermore, IFN-β-mediated phosphorylation of GST-p65 was blocked by pretreatment with LY294002. These data suggest that IFN-β acts through PI3K to enhance the transactivation competence of NF-κB complexes through phosphorylation of p65 within the TAD. The results provide novel insight into the role of PI3K in the transcriptional response to IFN-β. We previously reported (Rani, M. R., Asthagiri, A. R., Singh, A., Sizemore, N., Sathe, S. S., Li, X., DiDonato, J. D., Stark, G. R., and Ransohoff, R. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 44365–44368) that IFN-β induction of β-R1in fibrosarcoma cells required transcription factors ISGF-3 and NF-κB. IFN-β treatment did not augment the abundance of NF-κB, but led to phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and induced a nuclear activity capable of phosphorylating a p65-GST fusion construct in the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), residues 354–551. We now present evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in this pathway. Pretreatment of HT1080-derived fibrosarcoma cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin or LY294002) selectively inhibited IFN-β-induced β-R1 mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. In stably transfected cell lines, bovine p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signaling via PI3K and selectively suppressed IFN-β-mediated induction ofβ-R1. Overexpression of PTEN (phosphatase andtensin homologue mutated on chromosome ten), an antagonist of PI3K, blocked induction of a β-R1promoter-reporter construct. Studies with PTEN mutants suggested that the lipid kinase activity of PI3K was essential for IFN-β-induced transcription of β-R1. Consistent with this finding, a dominant-negative mutant of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K, selectively blocked IFN-β-mediated induction of the β-R1 promoter reporter. Furthermore, IFN-β-mediated phosphorylation of GST-p65 was blocked by pretreatment with LY294002. These data suggest that IFN-β acts through PI3K to enhance the transactivation competence of NF-κB complexes through phosphorylation of p65 within the TAD. The results provide novel insight into the role of PI3K in the transcriptional response to IFN-β. signal transducers and activators of transcription phosphoinositide 3-kinase interferon phosphatase and tensin homologue mutated on chromosome ten transactivation domain interferon-stimulated gene nuclear factor-κB phosphatidylinositol a serine-threonine kinase glutathione S-transferase epidermal growth factor Janus kinase The IFN-α/β receptor consists of two transmembrane chains (IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2) that specifically pre-associate with intracellular signaling kinases, including TYK2 and JAK1, and latent non-phosphorylated transcription factors called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT).1 Following engagement of ligand with the receptor, the kinases become activated and phosphorylate STATs. Activated STAT complexes translocate to the nucleus and bind with high affinity to target sequences and enhance transcription initiation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M.

The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is clearly necessary but not sufficient for the universe of IFN-mediated responses. Cells expressing kinase-deficient JAK1 were competent for IFN-γ-inducible JAK-STAT signaling and gene induction, yet lacked antiviral response (2Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D.

PI3K is a dual-specificity cytoplasmic enzyme, possessing both serine and lipid kinase activity (20Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates the D3 position of the inositol ring of PI. PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and a 85-kDa regulatory subunit that provides SH-2-dependent adapter function, recruiting the catalytic subunit to phosphotyrosine residues on activated cellular components. Roles for PI3K and the serine-threonine kinase Akt have been defined recently in cytokine signaling. In particular, these components are required for generating phosphorylated p65 and for enhancing the transactivation function of NF-κB complexes in response to IL-1 or TNF-α (21Sizemore N. Leung S.

Since we had found that p65 TAD was phosphorylated in IFN-β-treated cells and that PI3K activity was induced by IFN-β, we addressed the requirement of PI3K for induction of the β-R1 gene by IFN-β.

In vitro phosphorylation was performed using the GST-fused p65 substrate and nuclear extracts from U1.wt cells as described (7Rani M.R. Asthagiri A.R. Singh A. Sizemore N. Sathe S.S., Li, X.

We previously showed that PI3K was activated in response to IFN-β. As PI3K responses are commonly associated with activation of Akt, a downstream effector, we determined if Akt was activated in IFN-β-treated cells. IFN-β induced phosphorylation of Akt. It was first detected at 5 min with a peak at 30 min, decaying after one hour (Fig.1 a, top panel). The activation of Akt in response to IFN-β was inhibited by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1 b). Phosphorylation of p65 was increased in cells treated with IFN-β (7Rani M.R. Asthagiri A.R. Singh A. Sizemore N. Sathe S.S., Li, X. DiDonato J.D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44365-44368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To address the role of IFN-β-induced PI3K in the phosphorylation of p65 by IFN-β, cells were pretreated for 30 min with LY294002 followed by addition of IFN-β. Then, phosphorylation of GST-p65 was examined. IFN-β induced phosphorylation of p65 (Fig.1 c), whereas pretreatment with LY294002 blocked the IFN-β-induced phosphorylation of p65 (Fig. 1 c). This result suggested that IFN-β-induced phosphorylation of p65 required PI3K activity. The role of PI3K activity in endogenous gene induction by IFNs has not been elucidated. To address the requirement of PI3K for transcriptional induction of β-R1, we treated cells with IFN-β in the presence of chemical inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin, or LY294002. Total cellular RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNase protection assay. Treatment with either inhibitor resulted in a selective inhibition of β-R1 gene induction (Fig.1 d). Induction of 6–16, a type I IFN-induced gene that has an ISRE but lacks a κB site in its promoter, was unaffected by treatment with either inhibitor. Wortmannin caused significant β-R1 inhibition at a concentration of 10 nm and inhibited β-R1 gene induction in a dose-dependent fashion with 99% suppression at 100 nm. Accumulation of 6–16 mRNA was inhibited only modestly, and this effect was not concentration dependent. LY294002 also selectively abrogated β-R1 induction by IFN-β in a dose-dependent fashion with 95% inhibition at a dose of 25 μm. Chemical inhibitors such as wortmannin can exert nonspecific effects. To further address the role of PI3K in IFN-β signaling, we constructed stable cell lines overexpressing wild-type bovine p85α (wt-p85α) or a mutant bovine p85α that lacks the binding site for the p110 catalytic subunit of P13K because of a deletion of 35 amino acids (residues 479–513) (Fig. 2,a and b). Based on prior reports that addressed signaling from insulin receptors to PI3K in rat adipocytes (30Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that mutant p85 would act as a dominant negative toward PI3K signaling. In representative clonal isolates of stably transfected cell lines, mRNAs encoding bovine p85 were present (Fig.2 a), and antibodies to bovine anti-p85 detected either wild-type (in cell line w14) or mutant forms (in cell line Δ7) of bovine p85 but not human p85 (in untransfected cell line U1.wt) (Fig.2 b, top). Bovine p85 in Δ7 cells migrated at a lower position on SDS-PAGE because of the 35 amino acid deletion. The abundance of human p85 was unaffected by overexpression of bovine p85 (Fig. 2 b, bottom). Unexpectedly, wild-type but not mutant bovine p85 exerted a dominant-negative function toward activation of PI3K by either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or type I IFN (Fig. 2, c andd). In particular, Akt was activated in response to EGF in Δ7 cells after 2 min, with peak activation at 8 min and decaying after 15 min (Fig. 2 c and TableI). Further, the time course of Akt activation by IFN-β was equivalent in U1.wt Δ7 cells (compare Figs.1 a and 2 d, Table I). However, IFN-β-mediated Akt activation was not detected in w14 cells (overexpressing wild-type bovine p85) (Fig. 2 d, Table I).Table IPhosphorylation of Akt by EGF or IFN-β in w14 and Δ7 cellsLigandTime (mins)Densitometric ratio1-aRatio of phosphorylated Akt to total Akt protein for Fig. 2, c and d.

Quantitation was done by densitometry using NIH Image analysis v1.65. Open table in a new tab This unexpected dominant-negative effect of wild-type bovine p85 was characterized further. Initial experiments confirmed that bovine p85 and human p110α were found to be associated only in w14 cells (Fig.2 e). Taken together with the failure of EGF- or IFN-β-induced Akt activation (Fig. 2, c and d, Table I), this result suggested that wild-type but not mutant bovine p85 might sequester human p110α in nonfunctional complexes. A corollary of this prediction was that nonfunctional bovine p85/human p110 complexes might exert dominant-negative effects toward IFN signaling to PI3K by displacing human p85/p110 complexes from association with human IFNAR-1. To address this issue, we immunoprecipitated IFNAR-1 and examined its association with human p85 by Western analysis. Anti-IFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates contained human p85 only in Δ7 and wild-type (untransfected) cells, but not w14 cells (Fig. 2 f). These results suggested that bovine p85/human p110α complexes were not functional for signaling to Akt. Interestingly, it appeared that human p85 did not associate with IFNAR-1 unless complexed with p110. These results (Fig. 2,a–f) indicated that w14 cells could be used as a genetic model for disruption of signaling from the type I IFN receptor to PI3K. RNase protection assays revealed induction of β-R1 in Δ7 but not in w14 cells (Fig. 3,a). Expression of the 6–16 gene was induced in both cell lines, with a 2-fold higher induction in Δ7 cells. These results were representative of those obtained in two clones expressing wild-type bovine p85 and two clones expressing mutant p85. Also, IFN-β-mediated induction of the β-R1 gene but not the6–16 gene in Δ7 cells was sensitive to inhibition by LY294002 (results not shown). Taken with observations using chemical inhibitors of PI3K (Fig. 1 d), these results supported the hypothesis that IFN-β-mediated signaling through PI3K to Akt was selectively required for the induction of β-R1. These stable transfectants also provided an opportunity to address the role of IFN-β-induced PI3K activity in the phosphorylation of the p65 TAD. To examine this question we prepared nuclear extracts from w14, Δ7, and wild-type cells. IFN-β induced a nuclear activity that increased p65 TAD phosphorylation in Δ7 and wild-type cells, but not in w14 cells (Fig. 3, b and c). Additional genetic approaches were taken to disrupt either signaling by PI3K to Akt or events downstream of Akt. These experiments permitted us to evaluate the effects on IFN-β-induced expression of aβ-R1 promoter reporter. To block PI3K signaling to Akt, we transfected cells with an expression construct encoding PTEN, a dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 at the 3 position in vitro and in vivo (31Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 32Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). This activity precludes signaling downstream of PI3K to Akt. Overexpression of PTEN blocked IFN-β-mediated stimulation of luciferase activity directed by theβ-R1 promoter-reporter construct (Fig.4 a). PTEN also encodes a protein phosphatase activity. None of three PTEN mutants that lacked lipid phosphatase activity suppressed induction of β-R1(Fig. 4 a), although two mutants, G129E and D92A, retained protein phosphatase activity. Therefore, the ability of PTEN to suppress IFN-β-dependent transcription ofβ-R1 depended on its lipid phosphatase activity. This result suggested that signaling by PI3K to Akt was specifically involved in the pathway by which IFN-β induced β-R1transcription. This hypothesis was addressed by overexpression of a dominant-negative catalytically inactive Akt mutant. Overexpression of catalytically inactive Akt selectively suppressed induction of the wt-β-R1 promoter reporter by IFN-β (Fig. 4 b), indicating a dominant-negative effect in this system. As a control for nonspecific effects of Akt inhibition, we analyzed IFN-β-mediated induction of a promoter-reporter construct derived from thep561 gene (a type I IFN-induced gene). Induction of the561 promoter reporter was unaffected by overexpression of catalytically inactive Akt (Fig. 4 b). Similar results were obtained by overexpression of a separate dominant-negative Akt mutant (results not shown). Recent published reports delineated a role for PI3K and Akt in phosphorylating p65 in cytokine signaling pathways (21Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

Our previous work showed that the p85 subunit of PI3K was associated with IFNAR-1 and that an inducible PI kinase activity could be co-precipitated with IFNAR-1 after IFN-β treatment. We also showed that β-R1 induction by IFN-β required NF-κB and was associated with phosphorylation of the p65 TAD. Taken together, these observations raised the question of whether PI3K played a similar role in type I IFN signaling, an issue that is addressed in this report. In this regard PI3K activity is induced by IFN-α/β by a mechanism that appears to differ in various cell lines (8Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

This conservation of PI3K activation despite varied mechanisms suggests an important function in IFN signaling. In Daudi cells, STAT3 serves as an adapter and recruits PI3K to the interferon-alpha receptor (IFNAR) complex in an SH2-dependent interaction (15Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A.

In other cells of hematopoietic origin, association of PI3K with activated STAT3 could not be demonstrated (17Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Wang P.C. Modi S. Khan M.K. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a role for IRS-1 in recruiting p85/p110 PI3K was demonstrated in these cells (18Platanias L.C. Uddin S.

In HT1080-derived fibrosarcoma cells, IFN-inducible PI kinase activity was detected in anti-IFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates (19Rani M.R. Leaman D.W. Han Y. Leung S. Croze E. Fish E.N. Wolfman A.

Activation of PI3-kinase increases intracellular phosphatidylinositol-3,4-P2 and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3. The phosphorylated lipid products act as second messengers. Various intracellular downstream targets of PI3K have been identified (33Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 34Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Among them, the serine-threonine kinase Akt has received special attention because of its central role in regulation of cell survival or death (35Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Akt is encoded by the Akt proto-oncogene and has an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is essential for binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-P2. Activation of Akt by PI3K is dependent on the integrity of the PH domain (36Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar) and is susceptible to wortmannin (36Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R.

In vitro incubation of inactive Akt from serum-starved NIH3T3 cells with synthetic PPIs activated Akt in a dose-dependent manner, indicating Akt is a direct target of PI3K (36Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that IFN-β-induced activation of Akt is sensitive to blockade by LY294002 (Fig.1 b), placing it downstream of PI3K. Functional significance for this signaling pathway was documented by showing that overexpression of catalytically inactive Akt selectively abrogated induction of a β-R1 promoter-reporter construct (Fig.4 b). Pretreatment of cells with either of two different pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K inhibited the induction of endogenousβ-R1 mRNA by IFN-β (Fig. 1 d). The effect was selective since a variety of other IFN-induced genes including6–16 (Fig. 1 d), p56,ISG-54, and 9–27 (results not shown) were unaffected by PI3K inhibition. To exclude nonspecific effects of chemical PI3K inhibitors and further address the mechanism by which PI3K promotes induction of β-R1, we constructed stable cell lines expressing the full-length cDNA of bovine p85 or a mutant cDNA of bovine p85 (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The mutant Δp85 lacks the ability to bind p110 and functions as a dominant negative toward the rodent insulin receptor in adipocytes (30Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We found that the Δ7 cell line expressing Δp85 was fully permissive for induction of Akt activation and β-R1 by IFN-β (Figs. 2 d and3 a) in contrast to its phenotype in other systems (30Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the w14 cell line expressing wt-p85 failed to support the Akt activation or induction of β-R1 by IFN-β (Figs.2 d and 3 a), indicating that wild-type bovine p85 acted as a dominant negative for IFN signaling to PI3K. These results suggested that bovine p85/human p110 complexes were nonfunctional in the IFN signaling pathway. Further, PI3K was not activated in w14 cells after treatment with EGF (Fig. 2 c), raising the possibility that bovine p85/human p110 complexes were non-responsive to various cytokines and growth factors. Additional analysis revealed that bovine p85 was co-precipitated with human p110 (Fig. 2 e), supporting the possibility that the dominant-negative effect was mediated by sequestering endogenous p110 in inactive complexes. It remained to be determined if human p85 could associate with IFNAR-1 alone or only in complex with p110. We found (Fig. 2 f) that human p85 was not detected in IFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates from w14 cells, although levels of the protein in cytosolic extracts were not reduced (Fig. 2 b, bottom panel). Our results indicate that bovine wild-type p85 protein associates in nonfunctional complexes with the human IFNAR-1 and p110 (Fig. 2, e andf) and exerts dominant-negative function for type I IFN signaling to PI3K and downstream mediators (Figs. 2 d and3 b). In these experiments Δ7 cells expressing bovine Δp85 protein provide a useful negative control, as the mutant protein, being unable to associate with p110 (Fig. 2 e), leaves PI3K signaling by cytokines and growth factors (Figs. 2,c and d and 3, a and b) unaffected. We speculate that activation of the PI3K pathway in fibrosarcoma cells is unlikely to utilize IRS-1 as an adaptor, since the bovine deletion mutant Δp85 acts as a dominant negative in signaling through the insulin receptor in both rat adipose cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (30Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Clarke J.F. Young P.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other genetic experiments supported this model of IFN signaling to PI3K through Akt. PTEN is a natural antagonist of PI3K activity. Lipid products of PI3K, critical for activation of Akt, are dephosphorylated at the 3-OH position by the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN (40Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Lipid products of PI3K activity target Akt to the plasma membrane where it is fully activated through phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308. PTEN possesses activity toward both phospholipid and protein. Overexpression of wild-type PTEN abrogated the induction of aβ-R1 promoter reporter in IFN-β-treated cells (Fig.4 a). By comparing the suppressive effects of overexpressing wild-type PTEN, D92A mutant PTEN, G129E mutant PTEN, and C124A mutant PTEN (41Tamura M., Gu, J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) we addressed whether the phosphoprotein or phospholipid products of PI3K activity were essential for IFN-β-mediated induction of β-R1 (Fig. 4 a). The C124A mutant is catalytically inactive, retaining neither lipid nor protein phosphatase activity. Both the G129E and D92A mutations result in loss of lipid phosphatase activity with retention of protein phosphatase activity (41Tamura M., Gu, J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Only wild-type PTEN suppressed IFN-β induction ofβ-R1, indicating that phospholipid products of PI3K were essential for the induction of β-R1. This result suggested that Akt activation would also prove to be required forβ-R1 induction by IFN-β. This hypothesis was tested by co-transfecting a plasmid encoding a catalytically inactive Akt mutant along with the β-R1 promoter reporter. Expression of the dominant-negative Akt also suppressed induction of theβ-R1 promoter reporter by IFN-β (Fig. 4 b). Furthermore, nuclear extracts prepared from IFN-β-treated w14 cells did not mediate phosphorylation of the p65 TAD (Fig. 3, band c). These results delineated an accessory signaling pathway that supplements JAK-STAT signaling and show that this pathway is essential for the induction of one gene, β-R1, by IFN-β. The accessory signaling pathway involves the activation of PI3K and one downstream effector, Akt, and leads to the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This scheme is summarized in Fig.5. As shown in Fig. 5, it remains unclear how PI3K/Akt mediated signals lead to cytokine-induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Akt mediates IKKα phosphorylation at Thr-23, and mutation of this Thr residue blocked both phosphorylation by Akt and liberation of NF-κB by TNF-α (42Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The interaction of Akt with IκB kinase can be constitutive (42Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) or induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (43Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFN-β treatment leads to phosphorylation but not degradation of IκBα in HT1080-derived cells (7Rani M.R. Asthagiri A.R. Singh A. Sizemore N. Sathe S.S., Li, X. DiDonato J.D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44365-44368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that signaling through IKKα may occur in this pathway. In summary, we provide evidence that IFN-β signals to PI3K with Akt as a downstream effector to enhance the transactivation competence of NF-κB through phosphorylation of p65 within the TAD. Along with ISGF-3, this pathway is required for the transcriptional induction of the β-R1 gene by IFN-β. The downstream effectors of PI3K and Akt required for the transactivation of p65 remain to be identified."

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms responsible for swelling-mediated hepatocellular Ca2+ mobilization. Swelling of HTC rat hepatoma cells, evoked by exposure to hypotonic medium, elicited transient increases in intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and cytosolic [Ca2+]. The latter was attenuated by inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 and by IP3 receptor blockade with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, but it was unaffected by ryanodine, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release channels. Hypotonic swelling was associated with a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, with kinetics that paralleled the increases in intracellular IP3levels and cytosolic [Ca2+]. Confocal imaging of HTC cells exposed to hypotonic medium revealed a swelling-induced association of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ with the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that activation of PLCγ by hepatocellular swelling leads to the generation of IP3 and stimulates discharge of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum via activation of IP3 receptors. By extension, these data support the concept that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ represents a critical step in adaptive responses to hepatocellular swelling.

For example, under physiological conditions, postprandial uptake of amino acids by hepatocytes results in significant swelling, with subsequent recovery of cell volume (1Haussinger D. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 29-53PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological recovery of cell volume requires the opening of plasma membrane K+ and Cl− channels with consequent fluid and electrolyte efflux (2Dunkelberg J.C. Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This process provides a safeguard against irreversible swelling, which, in pathological states, is manifested by ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes (3Scheuer P.J. Lefkowitch J.H. Liver Biopsy Interpretation. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 303Google Scholar). Despite the importance of volume-sensitive ion channel regulation in maintenance of normal liver function, the mechanisms that couple hepatocellular swelling to channel activation remain largely undefined. We have recently shown that K+ and Cl− channel opening evoked by hepatocellular swelling is triggered by an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i)1and that this increase is critical for volume recovery (4Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The initial increase in [Ca2+]i results from Ca2+mobilization from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores, which suggests the involvement of the endoplasmic reticulum in this process. How Ca2+ is mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to hepatocellular swelling is as yet unknown. In extrahepatic tissues, diverse modes of volume-sensitive Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum exist. In airway epithelium, swelling leads to generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ discharge through IP3 receptors (5Felix J.A. Woodruff M.L. Dirksen E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It would be anticipated that swelling-mediated IP3 generation is a consequence of cleavage of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C (PLC). In support of a role for PLC, it has been shown in arterial endothelium that inhibition of PLC prevents swelling-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (6Shinozuka K. Tanaka N. Kawasaki K. Mizuno H. Kubota Y. Nakamura K. Hashimoto M. Kunitomo M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Four major families of PLC isoforms (β, γ, δ, and ε) have been recognized, each with distinct modes of activation. In general, PLCβ is stimulated in response to activation of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, PLCγ is stimulated by tyrosine kinases, PLCδ is stimulated by localized increases in [Ca2+]i, and PLCε is stimulated by activation of the monomeric G protein Ras (7Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The nature of swelling-activated PLC isoforms has not yet been elucidated. A second pathway for swelling-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, described in corneal epithelium, involves Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptors (8Wu X. Yang H. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms responsible for this remain undefined. A third pathway, reported in vascular smooth muscle cells, involves processes that are independent of both IP3 and ryanodine receptors (9Missiaen L., De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms for swelling-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in these cells have not been further delineated. In hepatocytes, prolonged exposure to hypotonic solution or amino acids (which would tend to increase cell volume) is associated with a small increase in intracellular IP3 levels (10Baquet A. Meijer A.J. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although this raises the possibility that hepatocellular swelling evokes Ca2+mobilization via activation of IP3 receptors, it remains to be determined whether this mechanism is involved, and if so, which isoform of PLC is responsible for formation of IP3. In the present study, we have addressed these unresolved issues concerning the origins of volume-sensitive hepatocellular Ca2+ signaling. Here we report in HTC rat hepatoma cells that swelling evoked by hypotonic challenge elicits Ca2+mobilization by a sequence of events that involve: (a) activation of PLCγ, (b) generation of IP3, and (c) activation of IP3 receptors. We propose that PLCγ is a pivotal mediator of adaptive responses to increases in liver cell volume and serves a critical role in protection against organ level injury that results from pathological swelling. HTC rat hepatoma cells were cultured as previously described (4Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell swelling was elicited by exposure to hypotonic medium. Prior to study, cells were incubated in standard extracellular solution (SES, ∼300 mosm). SES contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). The hypotonic solution (HES, ∼240 mosm) was identical to SES, except that the concentration of NaCl was 84 mm. Acetoxymethyl esters of fluo-3 and Fura Red were obtained from Molecular Probes. Ryanodine, U73122, andU73343 were purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) and monoclonal paxillin antibody (clone 5H11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and phosphotyrosine-specific (Tyr-783) PLCγ1 rabbit antibody was from Cell Signaling. Unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. IP3 levels were measured in cultured HTC cells by radioreceptor assay (AmershamBiosciences). Briefly, cells grown on 10-cm culture plates were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then removed with nonenzymatic Cell Stripper (Mediatech). Suspended cells were washed once with SES. Following the wash, cells were centrifuged at 260 × gand then resuspended in SES. Aliquots of 3.6 × 106cells in SES were placed in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min before swelling with HES. At specific times following hypotonic exposure, cellular IP3 was extracted by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10% perchloric acid followed by neutralization with an equal volume mixture of freon and tri-n-octylamine (11Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 90-97PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular IP3was measured according to the manufacturer’s directions. [Ca2+]iwas determined in individual cells by dual wavelength microfluorimetry, using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes fluo-3 and Fura Red as described previously (4Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Measurements of fluo-3 and Fura Red fluorescence emission intensity were acquired every 10 s, from which the ratio R of fluo-3 to Fura Red fluorescence was calculated. Changes in [Ca2+]i were inferred from changes in the relative fluorescence ratio, calculated by dividingR at each time point by R0, the mean fluorescence ratio averaged over the initial 2 min of data acquisition. For studies involving inhibitors, comparisons were made with same day controls. Studies were performed on cells that were plated onto 10-cm dishes and cultured overnight. Prior to hypotonic exposure, cells were equilibrated with SES for 10 min at room temperature. Following this, SES was removed and replaced with either 10 ml of SES (basal) or 10 ml of HES (hypotonic). At designated times, the solutions were replaced with 500 μl of ice cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plates were left on ice for 10 min, and the lysates were harvested. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations with phosphotyrosine antibody were performed according to the manufacturer’s directions, with minor modifications. Phosphotyrosine antibody (3 μl) was bound to 50 μl of a slurry of washed Protein A-agarose beads by rotating the mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 1 ml of whole cell lysate (1 mg of protein) was added to the beads and gently rocked overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with PLCγ1 (Tyr-783) antibody, as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were detected by exposure to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal, Pierce), and densitometric analysis was performed using an Alpha Imager 2000 (Alpha Innotech). Studies were performed in cells that were seeded onto glass coverslips and cultured overnight. After equilibration with SES for 10 min at room temperature, SES was replaced with either SES (basal) or HES (hypotonic). At designated times, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 25 mm, pH 7.4) for 10 min, then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose in TBS, and gently rocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were washed twice with TBS and rocked overnight at 4 °C with PLCγ1 (Tyr-783) antibody and in selected studies with paxillin antibody. Coverslips were washed three times with TBS and rocked for 1 h at room temperature with Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit Ig F(ab′)2 and/or Cy5-labeled donkey anti-mouse Ig F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were washed three times with TBS and then mounted on slides with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences). Prepared slides were analyzed on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES laser scanning confocal microscope as previously described (12Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C836-C842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All results are presented as means ± S.E., where n represents the number of cells studied. Statistical comparisons were made with the use of Student’s paired or unpairedt test (as appropriate), and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We have previously reported that hepatocellular swelling evoked by hypotonic challenge produces a transient increase in [Ca2+]i that peaks at 1–2 min and falls to basal values within 10 min (4Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, in cultured hepatocytes, prolonged exposure to hypotonic solution causes modest increases in intracellular levels of IP3 (10Baquet A. Meijer A.J. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although these findings raise the possibility that swelling-activated elevations in intracellular IP3 levels lead to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, the kinetics of IP3 generation and the temporal relation to increases in [Ca2+]i have not been delineated. It has thus remained unresolved whether IP3 is a volume-sensitive signaling molecule for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. To investigate this further, we determined the time course of IP3 generation in response to hepatocellular swelling. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of HTC cells to hypotonic medium elicited a transient increase in intracellular IP3 levels. The increase in IP3 levels occurred within 30 s, and these levels approached basal values within 10 min. These kinetics are consistent with the concept that IP3 elicits intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to hepatocellular swelling. The results above suggest that if hepatocellular swelling elicits intracellular Ca2+mobilization in response to increased intracellular levels of IP3, then such Ca2+ increases would be dependent on activation of IP3 receptors. To test this, we determined the effect of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an IP3 receptor inhibitor, on changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by hypotonic challenge. As shown in Fig. 2A, 2-APB markedly attenuated swelling-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. However, it is possible that the effects of 2-APB were not confined to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization because 2-APB has been suggested to inhibit store-dependent Ca2+influx in addition to IP3 receptor blockade (13Gregory R.B. Rychkov G. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To clarify this, we examined, in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+, the effects of 2-APB on swelling-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i. Under these conditions, contributions to such changes in [Ca2+]i that arose from Ca2+ influx would be disabled. In the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+, 2-APB ablated increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by hypotonic challenge (peak relative fluorescence ratio 1.15 ± 0.06, n = 46 in the presence of 2-APB versus 3.66 ± 0.31,n = 45 in its absence, p < 0.05). These findings indicate that 2-APB prevented intracellular Ca2+ mobilization elicited by hepatocellular swelling and are consistent with a role for IP3 receptors in this process. In addition to IP3 receptors, it is possible that swelling-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization involved ryanodine receptors, as has been reported in corneal epithelial cells (8Wu X. Yang H. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effect of ryanodine, which blocks ryanodine receptors, on changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by hypotonic exposure. In contrast to 2-APB, ryanodine did not inhibit swelling-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig.2B). This observation suggests that ryanodine receptors do not play a role in Ca2+ mobilization evoked by hepatocellular swelling, and it is consistent with the absence of expression of known ryanodine receptor isoforms in hepatocytes (14Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1088-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The findings thus far support the concept that hepatocellular swelling elicits intracellular Ca2+mobilization via generation of IP3 and activation of IP3 receptors. It would thus be predicted that swelling-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i would require stimulation of phospholipase C, which cleaves IP3from phospholipid precursors. To test this, we applied the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 and determined its effect on changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by hypotonic challenge. U73122prevented such increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig.3). By contrast, U73343, an inactive analog of U73122, did not prevent swelling-mediated [Ca2+]i increases (Fig. 3). Although these findings are consistent with a role for PLC, U73122 has been suggested to inhibit store-dependent Ca2+influx in addition to inhibition of PLC (15Berven L.A. Barritt G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To minimize contributions arising from Ca2+ influx, we examined, in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+, the effects of U73122 on swelling-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i. Under these conditions, U73122 ablated increases in [Ca2+]ievoked by hypotonic challenge (peak relative fluorescence ratio 1.08 ± 0.01, n = 69 in the presence of U73122versus 1.43 ± 0.08, n = 41 in its absence, p < 0.05). These findings indicate thatU73122 prevented intracellular Ca2+ mobilization elicited by hepatocellular swelling and are consistent with a requirement for PLC in this process. Activation of PLC by cell swelling has been implicated in airway and intestinal epithelium and in vascular endothelium (5Felix J.A. Woodruff M.L. Dirksen E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Shinozuka K. Tanaka N. Kawasaki K. Mizuno H. Kubota Y. Nakamura K. Hashimoto M. Kunitomo M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar), but neither the mechanisms of activation nor the responsible PLC isoforms have been determined. In liver, selected downstream responses to cell swelling, such as endosomal alkalinization and stimulation of bile flow, have been linked to activation of tyrosine kinases (17Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that PLCγ, an effector of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways, could be involved in volume-sensitive hepatocellular Ca2+ signaling. When activated by tyrosine kinases, PLCγ undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and becomes associated with the plasma membrane (19Matsuda M. Paterson H.F. Rodriguez R. Fensome A.C. Ellis M.V. Swann K. Katan M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Wang X.J. Liao H.J. Chattopadhyay A. Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we tested whether hepatocellular swelling elicited time-dependent changes in the abundance or localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ. Extracts of HTC cells, taken before and after exposure to hypotonic medium, were analyzed for abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ. Increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ were evident within 1 min after exposure to hypotonic medium and had fallen to basal values within 10 min (Fig.4). To localize tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ within the cell following swelling, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5A, at the base of the cells (i.e. within the plane of adherent membrane), under isotonic conditions, tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ was detected in peripheral structures that also labeled for the focal adhesion protein paxillin (21Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ to focal adhesions is consistent with observations by others (22Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to hypotonic medium, the focal adhesion structures labeled by PLCγ progressively enlarged over the following 8 min, a time at which [Ca2+]i was approaching basal values. Midway through the cells, well above the focal adhesion plane, diffuse intracellular staining for tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ could be seen under basal conditions (Fig. 5B). Among cells that stained positively for tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ, plasma membrane localization of this protein was evident within 1 min following exposure to hypotonic solution. This would be consistent with a site of action where activated PLCγ would generate IP3 from membrane phospholipid substrates. After 1 min, tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ staining in most cells was found to be in a diffuse intracellular pattern, consistent with rapid activated PLCγ internalization that has been reported by others (19Matsuda M. Paterson H.F. Rodriguez R. Fensome A.C. Ellis M.V. Swann K. Katan M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Wang X.J. Liao H.J. Chattopadhyay A. Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This study tested whether PLC could act as a trigger for Ca2+ mobilization evoked by hepatocellular swelling. We found that hypotonic swelling of HTC cells elicited a transient increase in IP3 levels, and swelling-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i were attenuated by the PLC inhibitorU73122 and by the IP3 receptor blocker 2-APB. Moreover, hypotonic exposure led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and plasma membrane localization, consistent with PLCγ activation. The onset of increased PLCγ phosphorylation paralleled the onset of IP3 generation, and these events preceded the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by cell swelling. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that Ca2+mobilization evoked by hepatocellular swelling involves a cascade of events that include: (a) activation of PLCγ, (b) production of IP3, and (c) release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum via activation of IP3 receptors (Fig.6). Because Ca2+ mobilization is essential for volume recovery after hepatocellular swelling, these data suggest that PLCγ is a critical mediator of cell volume regulation in liver. Several important caveats merit comment. First, the compound U73122 has been reported to have effects on [Ca2+]i that are independent of inhibition of PLC, in particular inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ influx (15Berven L.A. Barritt G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Second, 2-APB has also been reported to inhibit store-operated Ca2+ influx and thus appears to have effects on [Ca2+]i that are independent of IP3 receptor blockade (13Gregory R.B. Rychkov G. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the results of control experiments performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ demonstrate that U73122 and 2-APB each inhibited Ca2+ mobilization (and not Ca2+influx per se) and are thus consistent with blockade of PLC activity and IP3 receptors, respectively. This interpretation is further supported by two independent assays of PLC activation: measurement of IP3 levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. It should be noted that although the onset of the increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ paralleled the initial increase in IP3 levels, it is evident that the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation are not exactly identical to those of swelling-mediated changes in intracellular levels of IP3. The most likely explanation for this is that the IP3 assays and analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ were not performed under strictly comparable conditions (e.g. temperature, substrate adherence), and these differences may have influenced the kinetics of PLCγ phosphorylation and IP3 generation. Nonetheless, the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is that intracellular Ca2+mobilization evoked by swelling results from activation of IP3 receptors in response to PLCγ-mediated production of IP3. Precedent for swelling-mediated activation of PLC exists in airway and intestinal epithelium as well as vascular endothelium (5Felix J.A. Woodruff M.L. Dirksen E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Shinozuka K. Tanaka N. Kawasaki K. Mizuno H. Kubota Y. Nakamura K. Hashimoto M. Kunitomo M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the latter two tissues, volume-sensitive PLC activation appears to involve autocrine stimulation of P2Y purinergic receptors. Although it is known that P2Y receptors can activate PLCβ and PLCγ (23Strassheim D. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39767-39772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Puceat M. Vassort G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the identity of PLC isoforms that mediate volume-sensitive purinergic Ca2+ signaling has not been elucidated. As we have shown that swelling-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i in HTC cells are independent of purinergic receptor stimulation (4Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is likely that distinct mechanisms are involved in volume-sensitive PLC activation in liver. It should be emphasized that we have not excluded a potential role for PLCβ, PLCδ, or PLCε in swelling-evoked [Ca2+]i increases, but our findings clearly demonstrate that PLCγ is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon swelling and thus implicate its involvement in hepatocellular volume regulation. Activation of PLCγ by swelling would not only account for generation of IP3, as we have shown in the present study, but it could be responsible for stimulation (via liberation of diacylglycerol) of protein kinase Cα, which mediates activation of volume-sensitive hepatocellular Cl− channels (25Roman R.M. Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Raymond J.R. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is good reason to consider PLCγ as a transducer of signaling events elicited by hepatocellular swelling as several potential upstream activators of PLCγ, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (26Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and tyrosine kinases (7Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar), have been implicated in volume regulatory responses in liver. PI 3-kinase is required for volume recovery after hepatocellular swelling (27Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but it is uncertain whether it is involved in swelling-mediated PLCγ activation. Specifically, activation of PLCγ by PI 3-kinase appears to be independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (26Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); yet tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was seen in the present study. Thus, regulators of PLCγ other than PI 3-kinase warrant consideration. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon hepatocellular swelling (28Kim R.D. Darling C.E. Roth T.P. Ricciardi R. Chari R.S. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 100: 176-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but its cellular localization in response to swelling has not been delineated. If FAK is involved in volume-sensitive PLCγ activation, our observations would suggest that focal adhesions may not be the sole site of the swelling-activated interaction between these two proteins because the bulk of plasma membrane-bound tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ, as detected by immunofluorescence, did not appear to be present in focal adhesions during times corresponding to maximal swelling-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ as determined by immunoblot analysis. Members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which can associate with PI 3-kinase (29Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar) as well as FAK (30Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A., Ji, Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), mediate volume recovery from swelling in lymphocytes (31Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Laun T. Kaba N.K. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and play important roles in mechanotransduction (32Lehoux S. Tedgui A. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In lung, mechanical strain elicits Src-mediated PLCγ activation as a consequence of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (33Liu M. Qin Y. Liu J. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because dynamic actin rearrangements occur in response to hepatocellular swelling (34Theodoropoulos P.A. Stournaras C. Stoll B. Markogiannakis E. Lang F. Gravanis A. Haussinger D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), this could serve as a mechanism to couple Src to PLCγ activation in liver. Whether Src kinases, FAK, or PI 3-kinase are involved in volume-sensitive PLCγ activation remains to be determined. It is of interest that PLCγ has been found to be mislocalized or down-regulated in experimental models of liver injury (35Zhang B.H. Farrell G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Leoni S. Brambilla D. Risuleo G. de Feo G. Scarsella G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 204: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that are associated with hepatocellular swelling (37Wondergem R. Davis J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Wills E.J. Findlay J.M. McManus J.P. J. Clin. Pathol. 1976; 29: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that PLCγ, through its effects on hepatocellular volume regulation, plays a pivotal role in cytoprotection against pathological swelling. In this way, PLCγ and its upstream regulators may represent important therapeutic targets for the prevention of organ level injury in pathological conditions associated with disordered control of liver cell volume.

Northern blot analysis revealed that Clasp mRNA was highly expressed in brain, andin situ hybridization of a mouse brain sagittal section hybridized with antisense probes revealed that both Clasp and Clk4 mRNAs were expressed in the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb. Two forms of Clasp were produced by a frameshift following alternative splicing. The staining of an HA-tagged short form of Clasp (ClaspS) showed a nucleoplasmic pattern, while the long form of Clasp (ClaspL) was localized as nuclear dots. In vitroprotein interaction assay demonstrated that Clk4 K189R was bound to Clasp while wild Clk4 was not. Overexpression of ClaspL promoted accumulation of Clk4 K189R in the nuclear dots and the exon EB inclusion from CR-1and CR-2pre-mRNA of Clk1.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In mammals, Clk is a member of a protein kinase subfamily that contains at least four isoforms Clk1, Clk2, Clk3, and Clk4 (19Hanes J. von der Kammer H. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). mRNAs for all four Clk isoforms are alternatively spliced to produce proteins in which the kinase domain is missing (16Duncan P.I.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21524-21531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Clk1 was independently isolated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody screens as a prototypical dual-specific kinase, termed STY (22Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Howell B.W. Afar D.E. Lew J. Douville E.M. Icely P.L. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Clk autophosphorylates with dual specificity in vitro, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Clk1 was proposed to be an important determinant of the kinase activity as the majority of Clk1 activity can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (23Howell B.W. Afar D.E. Lew J. Douville E.M. Icely P.L. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of Clk2, tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Clk2 was undetectable in Friend murine erythroleukemia cells (24Nayler O. Schnorrer F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Actually, incubation of Clk1 with tyrosine phosphatases did not affect the kinase activity, while treatment of Clk1 with the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase 2A resulted in a 2- to 6-fold increase in enzymatic activity (25Menegay H.J. Myers M.P. Moeslein F.M. Landreth G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3241-3253PubMed Google Scholar). The Ser-141 of Clk2 was identified as an autophosphorylation site (24Nayler O. Schnorrer F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved among all Clk proteins. Site-directed mutation of this autophosphorylation site influenced the subnuclear localization of the kinase (24Nayler O. Schnorrer F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Clk1 containing this autophosphorylation site has been proposed to comprise a putative regulatory domain and includes a bipartite nuclear localization signal (21Duncan P.I. Howell B.W. Marius R.M. Drmanic S. Douville E.M. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21524-21531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Menegay H.J. Myers M.P. Moeslein F.M. Landreth G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3241-3253PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal truncation of Clk1 resulted in a 45-fold increase in V max with no change ofK m, suggesting that this domain does not contain a pseudo-substrate motif but may act to conformationally constrain the catalytic activity of enzyme (25Menegay H.J. Myers M.P. Moeslein F.M. Landreth G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3241-3253PubMed Google Scholar). These data gave us an idea that Clk is associated with a regulatory protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Colwill et al.(13Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and Nayler et al. (20Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) observed that overexpressed Clk proteins were largely found in the soluble fraction of a Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer, whereas the catalytically inactive mutant kinases were found almost exclusively in the pellet, suggesting the presence of nuclear anchoring protein(s) that specifically recognize the inactive Clk. Actually Nayler et al. (26Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Clk2 associates with nuclear scaffold attachment factor, although it is not clear whether the interaction is regulated by phosphorylation or not. We recently found that SRPK interacts with SF2/ASF only when its RS domain was not phosphorylated (27Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this paper we cloned a novel nuclear protein Clasp as a binding partner of inactivated Clk4 by a two-hybrid screen. As ClaspL could promote exon EB inclusion ofClk and increase the kinase active form of Clk in vivo, Clasp may play a regulatory role on Clk. Mouse Clk4 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using a forward primer incorporating aSalI restriction site at the 5′ end and a reverse primer incorporating a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end, followed by subcloning into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The Clk4 K189R has a lysine to arginine mutation in the ATP-binding site introduced with the in vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct pME-hemagglutinin (HA)-Clk4 wild type (WT) and pME-HA-Clk4 K189R, pGEM-T-cloned vectors were digested withSalI-NotI, releasing the coding region and then ligated into SalI-NotI-digested pME-HA (28Kojima T. Zama T. Wada K. Onogi H. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33247-33256Google Scholar). Construction of pME-HA-SRPK2 and pME-HA-SRPK2 K108R were described previously (27Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To generate pHybcIHK-Clk4 WT, pHybcIHK-Clk4 K189R, pHybcIHK-SRPK2 WT, and pHybcIHK-SRPK2 K108R, the pME-HA-ligated vectors were digested with NotI (Clks) or SacII (SRPKs), blunt-ended with Klenow (NotI) or T4-DNA polymerase (SacII), digested with XhoI (Clks) orSalI (SRPKs), and inserted into theXhoI-SalI blunt-ended vector of pHybcIHK (Invitrogen). To generate all truncated Clasp, constructs were amplified from pB42AD-clone79 obtained by two-hybrid screening with a forward primer having an EcoRI restriction site and a reverse primer containing a XhoI restriction site, digested with EcoRI-XhoI, and ligated into theEcoRI-XhoI site of pB42AD. The full-length ClaspS and ClaspL cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR with the forward primers that have first methionine and EcoRI-SalI site and the reverse primers containing the stop codons andNotI-XhoI site using a mouse total brain cDNA as a template. The products of about 1.7 kb (ClaspS) and 2.0 kb (ClaspL) were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. To generate pME-HA-, pME-glutathione S-transferase (GST)-, and pET28 (Qiagen) -Clasp constructs, pGEM-T-ClaspS and pGEM-T-ClaspL were digested withSalI-NotI and the released full-length cDNAs of ClaspS or -L were ligated into SalI-NotI digested vectors. To construct pFastBacHT-Clasp, pME-GST-ClaspS and pME-GST-ClaspL were digested with XhoI-NotI and ligated into the SalI-NotI site of pFastBacHT (Invitrogen). To generate pGEX-Clk4 WT and pGEX-Clk4 K189R, pGEM-T-Clk4 WT and pGEM-T-Clk4 K189R were digested withSalI-NotI and released cDNAs were ligated into SalI-NotI-digested pGEX5X-3 (AmershamBiosciences). The N (1–127), C-WT (128–481), and C-K189R (128–481) regions of Clk4 were amplified by PCR with a forward primer having aSalI restriction site and a reverse primer containing aNotI restriction site using pGEM-T-Clk4 WT or pGEM-T-Clk4 K189R as templates, and the PCR fragments were digested withSalI-NotI and ligated into theSalI-NotI site of pGEX5X-3. The plasmids of cytomegalovirus (CMV) CR-1 and CR-2 were kindly gifted from Dr. J. C. Bell (Ottawa). All PCR products were sequenced by Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (PE Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems) to confirm their sequence integrity. Yeast strain SKY48/pLacGUS (Invitrogen) was transformed with pHybcIHK-Clk4 K189R. Expression of the construct was confirmed by Western blotting with cIantibody (Invitrogen). The resulting strain was co-transformed with Mouse Brain MATCHMAKER LexA cDNA library (Clontech) in which cDNAs were fused to the coding sequence for B42 DNA activation domain and transformants were selected by the use of appropriate media according to the manufacturer's instructions. Putative interacting clones were purified in bacteria selecting for their ampicillin resistance and retransformed into the SKY48/pLacGUS with pHybcIHK or pHybcIHK-Krev (Invitrogen) to eliminate false positives. GST-Clk4 and its derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before (28Kojima T. Zama T. Wada K. Onogi H. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33247-33256Google Scholar). For preparation of His-GST-tagged Clasp, we used the Bac-to-Bac Expression System (Invitrogen). DH10Bac, the host strain of E. coli was transformed with the plasmid of pFastBacHT-ClaspS or pFastBacHT-ClaspL, and the recombinant bacmid was prepared. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fatal bovine serum (FBS) and transfected with recombinant bacmid. After 6 days, the viral supernatant was collected, and the virus was amplified twice. For protein preparation, Sf9 cells were infected, lysed at 3 days postinfection, harvested, resuspended in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmimidazole), and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation and solubilized in buffer B (8m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), sonicated, and subsequently rotated 2 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 6 h at room temperature. The resin was washed five times with lysis buffer B. The resin-bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (250 mmimidazole in lysis buffer B). For renaturation of Clasp protein, the eluted protein was dialyzed in 500 ml of buffer C (4 murea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF) for 2 h. Subsequently 5 liters of buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm PMSF) was added at a speed of 4 ml/min. Finally, the protein was dialyzed against buffer D. All steps in the renaturation of Clasp proteins were performed at 4 °C. Any aggregated material formed during the dialysis was removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatant was stored at −80 °C until required. Clasp full-length cDNA probe or β-actin probe were labeled with radioactive [α-32P]dCTP using the multiprime DNA labeling system from Amersham Biosciences. A mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech) membrane was used. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in hybridization mixture (6× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl plus 15 mm sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml). The membrane was washed three times at room temperature in washing buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS), and the hybridized transcripts were observed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). For in situ hybridization, three male mice (ICR, 4 weeks after birth) were used in this study. Clasp and Clk4 full-length cDNA were used to make sense and antisense riboprobes.In situ hybridization was carried out as described with a few modifications (29Yoshida K. Imaki J. Okamoto Y. Iwakabe H. Fujiwasa H. Matsuda A. Nakanishi S. Matsuda H. Hagiwara M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 57: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen sections (10-μm thick) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and acetylated. The sections were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and air-dried. The 35S-labeled probes (5× 105dpm/glass) were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 12 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 50% formamide, 10% dextran, 1× Denhardt's solution and 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA. 100 μl of probe solution was applied to each slide for 16 h at 65 °C. Washing was conducted in 2× SSPE containing 50% formamide twice for 30 min each time and then in 0.2× SSPE, 30 min each for two times all at 65 °C before finally being dehydrated again. The sections were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak) for 2 days, the films were developed, and then slides were exposed to NTB-2 (Kodak) emulsion for 4–5 weeks. After development, sections were counterstained with crystal violet and coverslipped. For image analysis of hybridized sagittal brain sections, x-ray film autoradiograms and brain sections developed with silver grains were imaged with a charge-coupled device camera (DIAGNOSTIC instruments) coupled to a microscope (Leica DM RXA2). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. For transfection, COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with mammalian expression vectors. After culturing for 24 h, cells were washed in PBS twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and washed twice in PBS. The fixed cells were permeabilized with the 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min at room temperature and washed four times in PBS. The cells were incubated in blocking solution (10% FBS in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with 25 μg/ml of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with 1:50 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG Texas Red-Conjugated (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) in blocking solution for 4 h at room temperature. The stained coverslips were washed four times in PBS, then dried and mounted with PermaFluor (Lipahw Immunon). The images were visualized by confocal microscopy (Radiance, BioRad). For in vitro binding assays with GST fusion proteins, 3 μg of the GST fusion proteins were incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1% Triton X-100) for 2 h at 4 °C. All the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer. In vitro translated His-T7-tagged proteins were prepared in a rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) using either ClaspS or ClaspL in pET28 with T7 RNA polymerase. The 30 μl of in vitro translated His-T7-tagged proteins were added to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins in 1 ml of binding buffer and rotated overnight at 4 °C. All the beads were washed three times in a binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer before separation by 8.5% SDS-PAGE. As a standard, one-twelfth of the His-T7-tagged translated products before pull-down were run in parallel on the gel. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen). The blot was stripped and then reprobed with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) to examine GST fusion proteins. Western blot analysis was performed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In the protein kinase assays employed in these studies we utilized 0.5 μg of bacterially expressed recombinant Clk4 in the presence of 0.5 μg of baculovirus-expressed recombinant Clasp as a substrate. The reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 40 ml of kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EGTA, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by boiling with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and subjected to autography. CMV CR-1 and CMVCR-2 plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells (60-mm diameter dish) with indicated amounts of expression vectors of Clk4, ClaspL, or ClaspS using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as per the manufacture's instructions. Cells were harvested at 24 h posttransfection, and total RNA and protein were extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). The 5 μg of RNA was used for RT and 1/50 (100 ng) was used for PCR amplification with the primers as reported by Duncanet al. (30Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PCR conditions, including the number of cycles and template concentrations, were optimized to maintain the linearity during amplification. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Simultaneously prepared protein samples were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz), anti-HA polyclonal antibody (MBL) and anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma). To search for regulatory proteins of Clk, yeast two-hybrid screen (31Serebriiskii I. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17080-17087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was performed. Full-length cDNA of mouse Clk4 K189R was fused to a cDNA encoding the cI repressor DNA binding domain to generate the pHybcIHK-Clk4 K189R construct as a bait of this two-hybrid screen. Ten million colonies containing both Clk4 and mouse brain cDNA library plasmids were screened for stimulation of the reporter LYS2 gene. To eliminate false positives, it was confirmed that the encoded proteins did not stimulate the reporter for themselves. The reporter was activated when the yeast strain SKY48/pLacGUS was transformed with one of the positive cDNA clones (clone79) and pHybcIHK-Clk4 K189R, though it was not stimulated with Clk4 WT or SRPK2 (another SR protein kinase as described, Kuroyanagiet al.) (14Kuroyanagi N. Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein encoded by clone 79 specifically interacts with Clk4 K189R (Fig.1 A). The clone 79 was sequenced, and the resulting sequence partially overlapped with registered cDNAs (DDBL/EMBL/GenBankTM accession no. NM016680 and AF042799). Comparing with the registered cDNAs, clone 79 seemed to lack the 127 amino acids of the N terminus. As this protein has two characteristic arginine/serine dipeptide repeat domains (RS1 and RS2 in Fig. 1 B), we designated it Clasp (Clk4-associating SR-related protein). To identify the domain required for the binding to Clk4 K189R, we prepared its truncated mutants and examined the interaction with Clk4 K189R in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.1 B). Clk4 K189R interacted with clone 79 (Clasp 128–573), Clasp 249–573, and Clasp 321–573 but did not interact with Clasp 354–573 and Clasp 354–527, indicating that both regions of amino acids 321–354 and 527–273 of Clasp are required for the interaction. In the course of the sequencing of full-length cDNA of Clasp, we obtained two independent clones that differ in the presence or absence of four bases insertion (the portion between two triangles in Fig.2 A), which are predicted to have differential C-terminal ends due to the frameshift. The clone 79 obtained in our yeast two-hybrid screen was corresponding to the short form (ClaspS). The long form Clasp (ClaspL) has an additional RS domain (RS3, striped in Fig. 2 B) on its C terminus. Schematic diagrams of the ClaspS and ClaspL are shown in Fig. 2 B. Because the nucleotide sequences of ClaspS and ClaspL at the N terminus are identical, they seemed to be driven from one gene by an aberrant alternative splicing. Because two isoforms of Clasp proteins had characteristic RS repeat motifs, we next introduced the HA-tagged expression vectors of ClaspS and ClaspL into COS-7 cells and checked the subcellular distribution of these proteins under a confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 2 C, HA-tagged ClaspS was located in the nucleoplasm, while HA-tagged ClaspL was concentrated in the nuclear dots with the clear margins. Characteristic amino acid sequences of ClaspL at their C terminus may affect the intranuclear localization of the protein. We next examined the expression of Clasp mRNAs by Northern blot using a Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot membrane (Clontech). As shown in Fig.3 A, upper panel, major transcripts with approximate sizes of 2.7 and 2.5 kb were highly expressed in brain and moderately expressed in lung and liver. Smaller transcripts (2.2 and 1.2 kb) were specifically expressed in testis. In addition, two longer transcripts (∼5 and 6 kb) were visible in heart, brain, and testis. These suggest to us that more transcripts than those coding ClaspS and ClaspL are transcribed from the Clasp gene. The same blot was reprobed with β-actin as a control to verify that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). As the expression patterns of 2.7- and 2.5-kb transcripts seems to correspond to that of Clk4 (20Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we further examined the cell type-specific expression of Clasp and Clk4 by in situhybridization. Sagittal section of a mouse brain hybridized with antisense probes revealed that both Clasp and Clk4 mRNAs were highly expressed in the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the olfactory balb (Fig. 3 B, a for Clasp, b for Clk4). Moreover, on the crystal violet staining, Clasp and Clk4 mRNA were expressed in neuron-like cells with high-volume nuclei in the hippocampus CA1 region (Fig. 3 B, c for Clasp,d for Clk4) and cerebellum (Fig. 3 B, efor Clasp, f for Clk4), supporting our hypothesis that Clasp is a binding partner of Clk4. To verify the two-hybrid interactions and the binding domain of Clk4 K189R to Clasp biochemically, we carried out an in vitro pull-down assay.In vitro translated His-T7-tagged ClaspS and ClaspL proteins were incubated with recombinant GST or GST-Clk4 and its truncated proteins (see Fig. 4 A), respectively, and pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. In this assay, ClaspS and ClaspL interacted efficiently with Clk4 K189R (Fig.4 B, lanes 4 and 11) but did not interact with Clk4 WT (lanes 3 and 10) as observed in the two-hybrid analysis. Deletion analysis of Clk4 revealed that Clasp was bound to the catalytic domain of the inactivated kinase (lanes"

The largest flavoprotein subunit (SdhA) contains the dicarboxylate active site at a covalently linked FAD via 8α-[N(3)-histidyl] linkage, and the second largest FeS protein subunit (SdhB) contains a high potential [2Fe-2S] cluster (Center S-1), a low potential [4Fe-4S] cluster (Center S-2), and a high potential [3Fe-4S] cluster (Center S-3) (1Ackrell B.A.C.

The membrane anchor subunits bind quinones involved in the electron transfer reactions of the enzyme, and in some cases, they contain one or two protohemes IX as prosthetic groups (1Ackrell B.A.C.

Recently, the crystal structures of closely related enzymes, fumarate reductase (Frd) complexes of Escherichia coli and Wolinella succinogenes, which are key terminal enzymes in the bacterial anaerobic respiratory chains and catalyze fumarate reduction, were solved at 3.3- and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively (5Iverson T.M.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These structures revealed the presence of a covalently bound FAD and three FeS clusters in a nearly linear cofactor arrangement with the common sequence, FAD-[2Fe-2S]-[4Fe-4S]-[3Fe-4S] (4Ohnishi T.

In contrast, marked variation was noted between the membrane anchor subunits involved in the electron transfer reactions, which bind two menaquinone molecules in the E. coli complex (5Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and two protoheme centers in the W. succinogenes complex (6Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A.

Previously, we have solubilized and purified the archaeal respiratory complex II by following the succinate:ubiquinone-1 oxidoreductase activity from the membranes (11Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme consists of four different subunits (SdhA, B, C, D) with apparent molecular masses of 66, 37, 33, and 12 kDa, respectively (11Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and can be reconstituted to afford the succinate-O2respiratory chain in the presence of the cognate respiratory terminal oxidase super-complex and Qcal in vitro (9Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). ThesdhABCD gene cluster encoding the archaeal respiratory complex II has been cloned, sequenced, and initially characterized (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar) (DDBJ accession number, AB055061) (see Fig. 1 A). These studies showed that the SdhA subunit has a consensus binding site for flavin and that the SdhB subunit has one [2Fe-2S] and two [4Fe-4S] cluster binding motifs (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar). Some catalytically important residues in these subunits are well conserved. EPR analysis of the FeS centers in the purified complex revealed the presence of at least one high potential [2Fe-2S] and more than one lower potential [4Fe-4S] clusters, and the absence of any [3Fe-4S] cluster in a stoichiometric amount (11Iwasaki T.

Spin coupling between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and a semiquinone radical was observed in the succinate-reduced state. Based on the reported crystal structures of bacterial Frd complexes (5Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the S. tokodaii SdhAB subcomplex has a similar nearly linear cofactor arrangement with the sequence FAD-[2Fe-2S]-[4Fe-4S]-[4Fe-4S] (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar). Despite these studies, little is known about the putative electron acceptor subunits, SdhC and SdhD, of the respiratory complexes II of the Sulfolobales (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T.

Previously, we have shown that the S. tokodaii Qcal-utilizing complex II contains no heme cofactor (9Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol.

Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar). In place of regular membrane-spanning subunits of bacterial enzymes with bound protoheme groups, the S. tokodaii complex II has two unrelated hydrophilic subunits (see Fig. 1 A), as reported for other respiratory complexes II of the Sulfolobales (15Janssen S. Schäfer G. Anemüller S. Moll R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5560-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gomes C.M. Lemos R.S. Teixeira M. Kletzin A. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Schäfer G. Anemüller S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is a small hydrophilic protein (104 amino acids) of unknown function (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar); SdhC (290 amino acids) is homologous to some archaeal and bacterial heterodisulfide reductase subunit B (13Iwasaki T.

Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar). Of particular interest in the Sulfolobales respiratory complex II is the SdhC subunit carrying the unique cysteine motifs of unknown function. At question is whether SdhC serves as a true membrane anchor (17Lemos R.S. Gomes C.M. Teixeira M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and which cofactors, if any, are bound to the unique cysteine motif. In this study, we heterologously overexpressed theS. tokodaii sdhC gene in E. coli to characterize the gene product in greater detail by various spectroscopic techniques (CD, resonance Raman (RR), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and EPR). Our results demonstrate the presence of a novel redox “Center C” with a [2Fe-2S] cluster core structure in the archaeal SdhC family. E. coli strain DH5α and strain HB101, which were purchased from TaKaRa Biomedicals and used for cloning, were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) or Terrific Broth medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin when required. Plasmids pGEMT and pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) were used for cloning and sequencing. Expression vector pET28a was purchased from Novagen. DNA was manipulated by the standard procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Water was purified by a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals mentioned in this study were of analytical grade. Native respiratory complex II was purified from the membrane fraction ofS. tokodaii strain 7 (formerly Sulfolobussp. strain 7, JCM 10545 (7Suzuki T. Iwasaki T. Uzawa T. Hara K. Nemoto N. Kon T. Ueki T. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) in the presence of Lubrol-PX (Nacalai Tesque) as a detergent, as described previously (11Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The entire gene sequence of the S. tokodaii respiratory complex II operon sdhABCD has been determined (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar) and deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (DDBJ accession numberAB055061). The sequence determination was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method with an automatic DNA sequencer, ABI model 373A and 370A (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The DNA sequence was processed with the DNASIS ver. 3.6 software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). The homology search against databases was performed with the BEAUTY and BLAST network service (19Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were performed using a CLUSTAL X graphical interface (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35300) Google Scholar) with minor manual adjustments. The PCR was carried out to amplify the sdhC gene coding for the archaeal SdhC subunit, using the S. tokodaii strain 7 genomic DNA and the following oligonucleotide primers (designed based on the nucleotide sequence AB055061 (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar)): SdhC-N primer, 5′-GGG CCC GCT AGC ATG AGC TAT GCG TAT TAT-3′ and SdhC-C primer, 5′-GGG CCC CTC GAG TTA AAC TAC ACC CTT CGA-3′. The PCR product thus amplified was subcloned into an NheI/XhoI site in a pET28a vector (Novagen), and the nucleotide sequence was determined with vector-specific T7 promoter and T7 terminator. The resultant vector was named a pET28aSdhC. The pET28aSdhC vector was transformed into the host strain, E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). The transformants were grown overnight at 25 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and recombinant protein was produced by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at 25 °C in the presence of 100 μmFeCl3. The cells pelleted by centrifugation were stored at −80 °C until use. Purification of the recombinant SdhC was performed as follows: frozenE. coli cells were thawed, suspended in 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by brief sonification on ice. The supernatant collected by ultracentrifugation was immediately incubated at 65 °C for 20 min, and heat-denatured proteins from the host cells were pelleted by ultracentrifugation using a Hitachi 42-135 rotor at 26,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and discarded. The supernatant thus obtained was passed through a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and the column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through fraction was then applied to a small nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) at 4 °C, and the column was extensively washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. The recombinant holoprotein, still adsorbed as a brown band at the top of the column, was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. When required, the protein was further purified by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified recombinant holoprotein was stored at −80 °C until use. Recombinant SdhC was concentrated by pressure filtration with an Amicon YM-10 membrane. Further concentration was achieved by placing the samples under a stream of dry argon gas. The resultant samples (∼1 mm), containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, were frozen in 24 × 3 × 2 mm polycarbonate cuvets with a Mylar-tape front window for XAS and solid-state cryoreduction studies. XAS data were collected at 10 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), beamline 7-3, with the SPEAR storage ring operating at 3.0 GeV. A monochromator containing a Si[220] crystal and a 30-element germanium solid state x-ray fluorescence detector (provided by the National Institutes of Health Biotechnology Research Resource) were employed for data collection. The first inflection of the edge of zinc and iron foils (assumed to be 7111.3 and 9660.7 eV, respectively) were used for energy calibration. All other data collection parameters were as reported previously (21Cosper N.J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Saari R.E. Hausinger R.P. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EXAFS analysis was performed with the EXAFSPAK software (www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html) according to standard procedures (22Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-459Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Curve-fitting analysis was performed as described previously (21Cosper N.J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Saari R.E. Hausinger R.P. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The γ-irradiation of purified SdhC (∼0.8 mm) containing glycerol (final concentration, ∼40% v/v) was performed in the XAS cuvets fully immersed in liquid nitrogen in a Dewar flask that was exposed to γ-rays in a 60Co source at the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Ookayama, Japan). The irradiation Dewar flask was refilled after every 90–120 min to maintain the samples at 77 K. Glycerol is an efficient electron hole-trapping agent (23Davydov R. Kuprin S. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11120-11128Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and is present in the irradiated samples to facilitate the solid-state cryoreduction of the FeS center at 77 K. EPR measurements were made on samples in XAS cuvets that had been exposed to a dose of ∼3 megarads and kept fully immersed in liquid nitrogen at 77 K when not in use. The resulting cryoreduced samples in the cuvets were carefully manipulated in liquid nitrogen throughout the experiments and directly transferred at 77 K to the JEOL liquid nitrogen Dewar/cavity for the EPR measurements performed with a JEOL JEX-RE3X spectrometer. The cognate soluble Rieske protein called sulredoxin (14Iwasaki T. Oshima T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was spontaneously γ-irradiated under the same conditions at 77 K as a positive control for EPR-monitored cryoreduction of FeS cluster at 77 K (24Iwasaki T. Kounosu A. Dikanov S.A. Kawamori A. Yamauchi J. Ohta H. EPR in the 21st Century. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2002: 488-493Crossref Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded with a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter with 0.5-cm cells. CW EPR measurements were performed by using a JEOL JES-FE3XG or JEOL JEX-RE3X spectrometer equipped with an ES-CT470 Heli-Tran cryostat system and a Scientific Instruments digital temperature indicator/controller Model 9650. The spectral data were processed using KaleidaGraph v.3.05 (Abelbeck Software) and IgorPro v.3.02 (Wave Metrics, Inc.). RR spectra were recorded at 77 K using a Spex 750M Raman spectrometer fitted with a Spectrum-One 2048 × 512 CCD camera and a Spectra-Physics 2017 Ar+ laser (output, 500 mW) by collecting 45° backscattering off the surface of a frozen sample in a glass cylindrical cell with sintered glass cap. The slit width of the spectrometer is 80 μm and the wavelength reproducibility is guaranteed by ±0.005 nm (±0.2 cm−1). Multiscan signal-averaging technique was employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Protein was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The archaeal sdhABCD gene cluster of S. tokodaii strain 7 has been cloned and sequenced (13Iwasaki T. Aoshima M. Kounosu A. Oshima T. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 779-781Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To characterize the properties of SdhC subunit in greater detail and to assign its possible function, we heterologously overproduced the sdhC gene product with a hexa-His tag at the N terminus in E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL strain. Although the isolation of the archaeal native respiratory complex II requires the presence of mild detergent for solubilization (11Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the recombinant SdhC subunit was obtained as a water-soluble protein (data not shown). The purified soluble protein shows a brown color, indicating the presence of bound cofactor(s). Metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry suggested an iron:zinc ratio of 2.3:1.0 mol/mol in the purified recombinant SdhC. In accordance, the optical spectra of the air-oxidized protein shows absorption maxima at 279, 323, and 417 nm and broad shoulders at 460 and ∼570 nm (Fig.2 A, solid trace), which are reminiscent of the plant ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters. This FeS chromophore is stable under aerobic conditions at least for 2–3 days as judged by visible absorption spectroscopy but irreversibly degraded within a week, suggesting that it is much less stable than the FeS clusters in the cognate zinc-containing ferredoxin (25Iwasaki T. Watanabe E. Ohmori D. Imai T. Urushiyama A. Akiyama M. Hayashi-Iwasaki Y. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25391-25401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the visible near UV CD spectra of the air-oxidized SdhC and the effect of dithionite reduction. The oxidized protein has three negative troughs at 355, 495, and ∼560 nm, a dominant positive peak at 411 nm, and a weak positive peak at around 620 nm (Fig. 2 B, solid trace). These features are similar to plant- or vertebrate-type [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters, but the positions of these dominant positive and negative features are markedly blue-shifted in SdhC, indicating some differences in the bondings and/or dipoles in the oxidized cluster environment. Upon either aerobic or anaerobic addition of dithionite, the brown color of purified protein gradually fades away due to the irreversible degradation of the FeS cluster, giving completely featureless visible absorption and CD spectra (Fig. 2, dashed traces). Addition of ferricyanide after dithionite treatment of SdhC rapidly caused aggregation and apoprotein precipitation (data not shown). The instability of the dithionite-treated cluster in SdhC makes determination of its midpoint redox potential impractical (data not shown). RR spectroscopy is a highly sensitive probe for the microenvironment of oxidized FeS clusters, and vibrational comparisons can be used to confirm cluster type and assess cluster ligation (26Han S.

The 77 K RR spectra in the Fe–S stretching region are clearly indicative of a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster in recombinant SdhC (Fig.3). The frequencies of the Agt mode at 324 cm−1 and the B3ut mode at 287 cm−1 have predominantly Fe–S(Cys) stretching character and can be interpreted in terms of complete cysteinyl ligation to the [2Fe-2S]2+cluster (26Han S.

The [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster environment in SdhC is similar to that of a vertebrate-type ferredoxin with the lower frequency shifts of 2–7 cm−1 for all bands observed in the Fe–S stretching region, implying weakening of Fe–S bonds in SdhC. These shifts may reflect different compression effects of the polypeptide surroundings and hydrogen bonding to the S atoms from nearby donor groups in the protein, presumably ascribed to the unique cysteine motifs (Fig. 1 A). In conjunction with visible CD spectra in Fig. 2 B, we concluded that the FeS chromophore in recombinant SdhC has a [2Fe-2S]2+ core structure with complete cysteinyl ligation. We designated this novel center of the S. tokodaii SdhC as Center C to distinguish it from another [2Fe-2S] cluster ("

In this study, we identified the DNA elements and nuclear factors responsible for the basal and PKA-induced activities of the upstream promoter. By using a luciferase reporter assay with HepG2 cells, DNase I footprinting analysis, and gel shift experiments, we identified the binding sites for Sp1 and AP-2 within the regions −125 to −89 and −14 to +10, respectively. Mutational analyses indicated that these regions are essential for the transcription factor binding and the SPT promoter activity. Expression of AP-2 caused a marked increase in the basal promoter activity to about the same level as that achieved by PKA. On the other hand, both the basal and PKA-induced activities were elevated by overexpression of Sp1, its effect on PKA-induced activity being more pronounced with coexpression of CBP and repressed by E1A oncoprotein. These results suggest that AP-2 and Sp1 regulate basal promoter activity, and Sp1 is also involved in PKA-mediated expression of the rat SPT gene in concert with the transcriptional coactivator CBP.

Use of the upstream transcription start site (+1) results in production of mitochondrial SPT mRNA (SPTm-mRNA) in response to a rise in intracellular cAMP level, whereas the downstream transcription start site (+66) is responsible for continuous generation of peroxisomal SPT mRNA (SPTp-mRNA) without notable induction by stimulants (1Uchida C.

SPTm-mRNA is 65 bases longer than SPTp-mRNA and has an extra 5′ sequence that encodes an N-terminal mitochondria-targeting signal, whereas SPTp-mRNA lacks this sequence and the translated product is translocated into peroxisomes, presumably being directed by an intramolecular peroxisomal targeting sequence (5Montley A.

Thus, the unique feature of this gene is that the alternative usage of two transcription start sites eventually determines organelle localization of the expression product. The 5′-sequences of the SPT genes are well conserved up to 25–28 bp upstream from the downstream start sites, but the upper region is relatively diverse among different animal species (10Lumb M.J. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem.

Our previous studies showed that SPT is involved in both serine and glyoxylate metabolism (13Xue H-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16020-16027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Xue H-H. Sakaguchi T. Fujie M. Ogawa H. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16028-16033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of SPT in glyoxylate metabolism is important, because glyoxylate can be oxidized to oxalate, a useless and toxic end product of metabolism, unless it is efficiently metabolized to glycine. The major pathways of hepatic glyoxylate production in herbivores and carnivores seem to be oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes and metabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria, respectively (15Ichiyama A. Xue H-H. Oda T. Uchida C. Sugiyama T. Maeda-Nakai E. Sato K. Nagai E. Watanabe S. Takayama T. Mol. Urol. 2000; 4: 333-340PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important that the organelle localization of SPT is food habit-dependent. The marmoset, like the rat (16Noguchi T. Minatogawa Y. Takada Y. Okuno E. Kido R. Biochem. J. 1978; 170: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), has SPT in both of the organelles in the liver (12Purdue P.E. Lumb M.J. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Carnivores, such as cats and dogs, have the enzyme largely in mitochondria, whereas it is located entirely in peroxisomes in herbivores and man (10Lumb M.J. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Danpure C.J. Guttridge K.M. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop T. Purdue P.E. Cell. Sci. 1990; 97: 669-678PubMed Google Scholar). As for cat SPT, Lumb et al.(10Lumb M.J. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed that transcription of the gene occurred almost entirely from a site corresponding to the upstream start site in the ratSPT gene, consistent with mitochondrial localization. In the human and rabbit SPT genes, the transcription start site is also a site corresponding to the upstream site in the rat gene, but the first ATG codon for translation of the N-terminal mitochondria-targeting signal in these species is mutated to ACA or AUA (11Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Purdue P.E. Lumb M.J. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the methionine codon first encountered in translation should be the downstream AUG that corresponds to the N-terminal methionine of SPT (18Nishiyama K. Berstein G. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the case of the rat and marmoset, it seems that the downstream start site had been prepared to distribute SPT to peroxisomes in addition to mitochondria to adapt their metabolism to their omnivorous food habits. Thus, regulation of transcription of the SPT gene is closely linked to its specific organelle localization and proper function of the enzyme in the liver. We have been particularly interested in how the two transcription start sites are controlled in response to physiological stimuli in the rat. To elucidate the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation responsible for the alternative subcellular destinations of rat SPT, we recently investigated the downstream promoter and possible activators including C/EBP α/β that regulates transcription from the downstream start site (19Ohbayashi K. Funai T. Uchida C. Takahashi Y. Oda T. Ohno R. Ichiyama A. Biomed. Res. 1995; 16: 141-153Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 20Sugiyama T. Uchida C. Oda T. Kitagawa M. Hayashi H. Ichiyama A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that Sp1 and AP-2β activate the upstream promoter responsible for the generation of rat SPTm-mRNA. Various fragments of the ratSPT gene were prepared by complete or partial enzyme digestion of cRGspt1 (4Oda T. Nishiyama K. Ichiyama A. Genomics. 1993; 17: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a genomic DNA clone of rat SPT, and inserted into the HindIII or XhoI-NheI site of pGV-B (Nippongene), a luciferase reporter plasmid without promoters and enhancers. Nucleotide positions of the 5′-ends (the upstream transcription start site is numbered +1) of the digested fragments inserted into corresponding reporter constructs are as follows: −5500 (BamHI) for pGBBN550, −4300 (PstI) for pGBPN430, −2700 (NcoI) for pGBNN270, −2400 (PstI) for pGBPN240, −1256 (HindIII) for pGBHN129, −386 (NheI) for pGBNN42, −276 (SmaI) for pGBSN31, −191 (PvuII) for pGBPN23, −102 (EcoNI) for pGBENN13, and −50 (BanIII) for pGBBN9. The 3′-ends of theSPT gene in these constructs are all +36 (NheI). The pTA-Sp1-Luc, pTA-AP-2-Luc, and pTA-Sp1AP-2-Luc plasmids were prepared by insertion of the −125 to −89 region, the −14 to +10 region, and both of these regions of the SPT gene into pTA-Luc plasmid (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis for construction of reporter plasmids containing mutant SPT promoters, M1 and M2, was performed by PCR-mediated splicing after overlap extension. In the initial steps, the left arm of the PCR product was generated from the wild-type SPT gene encompassing the −386 to +36 region using a sense-SPT primer with a HindIII site at the 5′-end and an antisense primer containing the desired mutations. Similarly, the right arm of the PCR product was generated using an antisense-SPT primer with an NheI site at the 3′-end and a sense primer containing the mutations. Amplified DNAs were gel-purified and subjected to the second step of PCR using the sense-SPT primer and the antisense-SPT primer. The amplified products were then digested with HindIII andNheI and were subcloned into theHindIII-NheI site of pGV-B. Other site-directed alterations (for M3–M9) were made in wild-type pGBNN42 by the LA-PCR method (21Nelson M. McClelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using two complementary oligonucleotides with the desired mutations, followed by DpnI digestion. A wild-type AP-2β expression vector, pCMX-AP-2β, was kindly donated by Dr. Reinhard Buettner, University Hospital RWTH, Germany (22Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schul R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Dr. Hitoshi Okazawa, University of Tokyo, Japan (23Takeuchi S. Imafuku I. Waragai M. Roth C. Kamazawa I. Buettner R. Mouradian M.M. Okazawa H. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 74: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a wild-type Sp1 expression vector, RSV-Sp1, was a generous gift from Dr. Naoko Tanese, New York University Medical Center. To make another AP-2β expression vector, AP-2β cDNA within pCMX-AP-2β was excised and subcloned into a different expression vector, SP(RSV), which was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, CA, because the pCMX vector itself severely suppressed the luciferase expression derived from the reporter constructs. An expression vector for the N-terminal truncated AP-2β, AP-2βΔN291, was generated by PCR amplification using a 5′-primer containing a FLAG sequence followed by subcloning into the SP(RSV) vector. For preparation of an Sp1ΔN expression vector, an Sp1 cDNA fragment corresponding to the DNA-binding domain at amino acids 516–696 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-FLAG, which was a generous gift from Dr. Toshiaki Suzuki, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan (24Shimura H.

All PCR-mediated constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing to verify the clones. Mutant oligonucleotides for the individual sites (mutant bases are in boldface and underlined) are as follows: M1, 5′-GCTATGGAATACTGGGACTCAGGTG-3′, with mutation of the inverted repeat (GAACCCCGGGGCTC, located at bp −280 to −272); M2, 5′-CTTGCTCTCACACACTTGAAAC-3′, with mutation of the first AP-1-like site (TGACTCT, located at bp −218 to −212); M3, 5′-ACCAGAGGCGTCCCTTCTCCTGTGGAAG-3′, with mutation of the Sp1 site (TCCCCTCCCCC, located at bp −116 to −106); M4, 5′-GGTCAAATTGACTGTAGAAGGGCTGGAG-3′, with mutation of the TATA-like site (AATAAAA, located at bp −31 to −25); M5, 5′-ATAAAAGGGCACGACCAAGCAACAGG-3′, with mutation of the C/EBP-like site (TGGAGCAAG, located at bp −20 to −12); M6, 5′-AAGCAACAGGTACGCACCAACCAG-3′, with mutation of the second AP-1-like site (GGACTCA, located at bp −4 to +2); M7, 5′-AAGCAACAGGGACTTGCCAACCAG-3′, with mutation of the transcription start site (CA); M8, 5′-CAACAGGGACTCATTAGCCAGGCCT-3′, with mutation of the AP-2 site (TCACCAACCA, located at bp −1 to +9); and M9 (antisense primer), 5′-CCAGCTAGCTCTGGGCTAAACCTAGCGGCG-3′, with mutation of the CRE-like site at bp +21 to +28. Expression vectors for CBP were described previously (25Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C-G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone of E1A was provided by Dr. Marc Montminy, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, (26Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and subcloned into the expression vector pRC/CMV. Expression vectors for E1AΔN and E1AΔCR2 were generated by PCR amplification on the basis of information on the domain structure of E1A reported by Wang et al. (27Wang H-G.H. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (19Ohbayashi K. Funai T. Uchida C. Takahashi Y. Oda T. Ohno R. Ichiyama A. Biomed. Res. 1995; 16: 141-153Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting assay was performed according to the protocol described by Johnson et al. (28Johnson A.D. Meyer B.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the end-labeled DNA fragment (10–20 fmol) was incubated on ice for 30 min with the indicated amounts of nuclear extracts in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmKCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Five mm CaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2 were then added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was preincubated at room temperature for 5 min, after which 0.07–0.1 units of DNase I was added to digest the DNA at room temperature for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of a stop buffer (0.3 m sodium acetate, 25 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml tRNA), and the mixture was then subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and electrophoresis on a sequencing gel. In the gel mobility shift assay, a32P-labeled double-strand DNA probe (10 fmol) was incubated with 4 μg of nuclear extracts under previously described conditions (19Ohbayashi K. Funai T. Uchida C. Takahashi Y. Oda T. Ohno R. Ichiyama A. Biomed. Res. 1995; 16: 141-153Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For oligonucleotide competition and supershift experiments, 50–200-fold molar excess of annealed oligonucleotides, 1 μg of antibody against AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, or Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or preimmune IgG was preincubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 20 min before addition of a labeled DNA probe. The mixture was then incubated with the probe on ice for another 30 min and applied to a nondenaturing gel (5% polyacrylamide, 10% glycerol, 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer), followed by electrophoresis at 10–12.5 mA at 4 °C for 1.5 h. For preparation of probes and competitors for gel mobility shift analysis, the following complementary oligonucleotides were used: −14/+10 region, 5′-AAGCAACAGGGACTCACCAACCAG-3′; −125/−98 region, 5′-ACCAGAGGCTCCCCTCCCCCTGTGGAAG-3′; initiator region of adenovirus major late promoter, 5′-TCGTCCTCACTCTCTTCCCCT-3′. Double-strand oligonucleotides for the binding sites of AP-1, AP-2, YY-1, USF-1, CTF/NF1, Sp1, C/EBP, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, and that for a mutated binding site of Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Transfection of DNAs into rat hepatocytes was performed by the electroporation method. Primary rat hepatocytes were prepared by liver perfusion with collagenase as described previously (1Uchida C. Funai T. Oda T. Ohbayashi K. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8849-8856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocyte suspensions were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline(−) and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline(−). Then 0.8 ml of the suspension was mixed with equal moles of a reporter construct (15–25 μg, total amount of DNA being equalized to 25 μg by the addition of the pGV-B plasmid), 10 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase (an expression vector for β-galactosidase), and 50 μg of salmon testis DNA in a Gene Pulser cuvette with a 0.4-cm electrode (Bio-Rad) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After resuspending the mixture gently, hepatocytes were exposed to a pulse at 280 V/960 microfarads and incubated on ice for 10–15 min for recovery. Cells were then transferred carefully into 7.2 ml of an ice-cold maintenance medium (Williams E medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 25 μg/ml Cefamezin, 1 nm insulin, and 25 μg/ml epidermal growth factor), suspended very gently, seeded into 4 wells of a 6-well dish, and incubated in 5% CO2, 30% O2 at 37 °C for 6 h. The medium was then changed to a fresh maintenance medium with (8-Br-cAMP) or without (control) 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and the culture was continued for another 24 h, followed by measurement of the luciferase activity. For transfection into HepG2 cells, cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish, cultured overnight, and transfected with plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (29Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) or with FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). The RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (0.05 μg) and an expression plasmid (0.2 μg) for a catalytic subunit of wild-type PKAα (wt-PKA) or a mutant catalytic subunit of PKAα (control) were included in the transfection medium in all experiments with HepG2 cells. Where indicated, other plasmids were also used. Total amounts of plasmids were equalized by adding the pGV-B plasmid or backbone vector plasmids. Cells were cultured for another 24 h after transfection and then harvested for measurement of luciferase activity. The luciferase activity in the cell extracts was measured using Pikka gene assay reagent (NIPPON GENE Co., Ltd., Japan) or luciferase assay system (Promega Biosciences, Inc.) and normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The relative luciferase activity represents the relative fold value versus that of pGV-B (Fig. 1) orversus that of pGBNN42 (Figs. 2, 4, 6, and 7) when transfected with the mutant PKA vector. The mutant PKA vector expresses the catalytic subunit of PKAα lacking ATP binding ability but does not act in a dominant negative manner. All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.Figure 2Determination of the proximal promoter region of the upstream promoter. Sequential deletion fragments of the ratSPT gene (solid bar) were fused to the luciferase gene, and an equal mole of the construct was transiently transfected with 0.02 μg of a mutant PKA (control) or a wild-type PKA (wt PKA) expression plasmid.

Wild-type (WT) or a mutant (M1-M9) pGBNN42 plasmid (1.5 μg each) was transfected into HepG2 cells, and the reporter gene assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative LUC activity represents the relative -fold value versus the control activity of wild-type pGBNN42 (−).B, effects of mutations within the putative Sp1 or AP-2 site on protein-DNA binding. Gel mobility shift assays were performed with HepG2 nuclear extracts and the −125 to −89 region (−125/−89) or the −14 to +10 (−14/+10) region of the SPT gene as a probe. For the competition assay (lanes 3, 4, and7–9), the nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled annealed oligonucleotides of the wild-type sequence (−125/−89wt, −14/+10wt) or mutant sequences having mutations shown in A (−125/−89m3, −14/+10m7, and −14/+10m8) prior to the addition of the probe. C, functional involvement of Sp1 in the promoter activity through binding to the −125 to −89 region. One μg of wild-type or mutant (M3) pGBNN42 was transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for Sp1 (0.25 μg), AP-2β (0.125 μg), CBP (0.3 μg), or CBP in combination with the Sp1 or AP-2β plasmids. The reporter gene assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative LUC activities represent the relative fold value versus the control activity of wild-type pGBNN42 (−).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the region that controls the upstream promoter activity, we performed reporter gene assays using various deletion mutants of the ratSPT gene fused to the luciferase gene. These constructs carry only the upstream transcription start site (+1) as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. In our preliminary experiments with primary rat hepatocytes, low transfection efficiency and weak promoter activity of the SPT gene made it difficult to obtain reproducible data. Therefore, we tested transfections into three cell lines, human hepatoma HepG2 and rat hepatoma H4IIE and FAA3T3 cells, to select cells in which theSPT promoter activity can be detected more efficiently with a similar pattern to that in primary rat hepatocytes. In HepG2 cells, all of the 5′-deletion constructs from −5500 ∼ +36 to −1256 ∼ +36 (Fig. 1 A) showed higher basal and cAMP/PKA-induced promoter activities with a similar pattern to that in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1 B). In the other two cell lines, however, transcription efficiencies were as low as that in primary hepatocytes (data not shown). Based on these observations, we decided to use HepG2 cells in all of the following experiments. Because the region from −1256 to +36 (pGBNN42 plasmid) maintained a significant PKA responsiveness with 10–12-fold induction, we examined the effect of further deletion to determine the proximal region involved in the upstream promoter activity of the SPT gene (Fig. 2). Deletions to position −387 slightly increased the PKA-induced promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a weak inhibitory element. Deletions to −277 resulted in about a 30% decrease in the activity, but the −191 to +36 region (pGBPN23) maintained almost the same level of activity as that of the −276 to +36 region. Further deletions up to −103 caused ⅓-¼-fold reductions. On the other hand, the basal promoter activity was almost unchanged until the 5′-end of the gene was shortened to −50; i.e. the −50 to +36 region (pGBBN9) showed only a very low activity in both control and PKA-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP instead of the introduction of PKA (data not shown). These data indicate that the −191 to −51 region contains elements that play important roles in the upstream promoter activity of the SPT gene. To characterize cis-elements regulating the SPT promoter activity, we performed DNase I footprinting analysis using HepG2 nuclear extracts and various SPT gene fragments, including the −386 to −277 region and the −191 to +36 region, as probes. Three main protected regions were detected, two of which (I and II, Fig.3 A) were located close to or over the transcription start site, and the other was at −125 to −89 (cf. Fig. 5 A). No protected region was observed within the −386 to −277 region (data not shown), although deletion of this region caused a small but obvious reduction in the luciferase activity as shown in Fig. 2.Figure 5Identification of the Sp1-binding site in the −125 to −89 region. A, DNase I footprint analysis (left). A radiolabeled fragment (−191 to +36) of the ratSPT gene was preincubated with various amounts (0–40 μg) of HepG2 nuclear extracts prior to DNase I digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2061367136,"To the uninitiated it may seem that bioinorganic chemistry is a new field although, on the other hand, reports on metals bound to proteins or enzymes date way back into the 19th century and may probably be found in earlier centuries if we replace the terms “proteins” and “enzymes” with “animal or plant tissues.” Potassium ferricyanide was prepared from blood, McMunn described what he called histohematins (now cytochromes) in tissues, Hoppe-Seyler made spectroscopic investigations on hemoglobin, G. Bertrand worked on what he called an oxidase from plant tissues, which he named laccase; he recognized that it was a metal protein and even proposed that the metal was a “coenzyme,” with which he may have been the first to propose the idea of a catalytic metal protein. Spitzer drew attention to the involvement of iron bound to protein or nucleic acid nitrogen in tissue respiration, Warburg and Keilin and their collaborators described polyphenol oxidase, a copper protein, and ferritin was described as an iron storage protein. In the 1930s Keilin and Hartree found copper in cytochrome c oxidase. By the middle of that century, zinc and molybdenum were discovered in enzymes, and non-heme iron was recognized as a necessary component in mitochondrial preparations that are active in substrate oxidation. Thus there is a long trail of discovery of metals in proteins or in other components of living creatures, metals that were required for their structure or function, although details of what the functions implied were initially missing and hard to come by. At this point it seems worthwhile to define what is actually meant by the terms “inorganic” and “organic” in connection with our present theme or in the context of chemistry as a scientific discipline. Although the term “organic” will for many evoke the connotation that it has to do with life (the counterpart “inorganic” then referring to lifeless matter) in chemistry “organic” has come to mean merely pertaining to the chemistry of carbon compounds. Inorganic, on the other hand, is generally perceived as referring to the chemistry of metal compounds, whereas other non-carbon non-metal elements are not specifically excluded. Because metals of many kinds are found in living matter, e.g.sodium, potassium, and calcium in considerable quantities, and because all metals are subjects of inorganic chemistry, there must then, by definition, always have been an inorganic component of biochemistry. Thus, according to this reasoning, “inorganic biochemistry” and “bioinorganic chemistry” certainly are no new subjects; rather they may only be new words. Nevertheless, the terms obviously had to be justified. The editor of the first volume of Inorganic Biochemistry, Gunter L. Eichhorn, says in 1974 in the preface to the book: “Until recently, the title Inorganic Biochemistry would have appeared paradoxical to most, and it may even now appear so to many, because biochemistry sounds organic”; and this was about 30 years ago! As I have witnessed this period and also some decades before that, I will briefly describe my experiences. When I was a student in the 1930s, what Eichhorn calls paradoxical would doubtless have been considered outright ridiculous, certainly in Germany. When I studied chemistry there it was the great period of the development of organic chemistry, synthetic and analytical, of natural products chemistry, the time of the discovery of “factors” (some of them later called vitamins), and I heard it said often in chemical circles that biochemistry was in essence nothing but organic chemistry. Actually even the word biochemistry was frowned upon, as it had acquired some taste of quackery through the use of the word by some eager promoters of what may today be called “alternative medicine.” The term “biochemistry,” as far as I know, was in some sense generally established when Sir Frederic Gowland Hopkins named his department in Cambridge by that title in 1914, although the actual building that had this name was only occupied in 1924. In Germany this subject, “biochemistry,” was not taught within a faculty of the Naturwissenschaften but had the designation “physiological chemistry” and was only accessible to medical students, and not to chemistry students, as I was. When I inquired whether I might get an exceptional permission, I was advised by friends in the faculty that physiological chemistry was actually largely a “Gemurkse,” which means a messy business, going under the slogan, “Tierchemie ist Schmierchemie,” and I would do better to concentrate on chemistry. It was only Felix Hoppe-Seyler who was influential enough to be allowed to establish an Institute of Applied Chemistry within the Faculty of Medicine at Tübingen, which then was soon renamed physiological chemistry and was assigned to a separate Faculty of Science. As such it has survived Hoppe-Seyler for many years as well as his journal, which now goes under the title “Biological Chemistry.” Feodor Lynen was the first to have a Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Munich in 1954, after which biochemistry departments then started sprouting up elsewhere. However, even in the United States the departments of physiological chemistry only slowly disappeared. It is true that the major polymers in living matter are carbon compounds, whereas the transition metals are only present in traces (except e.g. for iron in the globins or in ferritin); however, there is no life without transition metals, which are required as catalysts. From what was said above, there was a gap of about 30 years between the 1940s and the 1970s when there must have been a great step forward in appreciating the significance of transition metals in biology. I experienced the transition during that period most vividly in two typical examples. I had the fortune to meet Edward Hartree during a visit to Oxford and I asked him, of course, about his work with Keilin in the 1930s on copper in cytochrome c oxidase, which had also been the object of my studies (1Beinert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). He said that they were absolutely sure copper was there and was bound tightly to the protein; they determined how much was there in comparison to heme, but after that what else could they do? As spectroscopy was not applicable to copper, 1The broad 830 nm absorption of cytochromec oxidase was only discovered in 1961 (2Griffiths D.E. Wharton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1850-1856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was probably not observable with Keilin's microspectroscope. they had no method to tell them about its function. Thus Keilin decided not to pursue this aspect further. I may call this the “Keilin-Hartree dilemma”; almost all of metal biochemistry suffered from this shortcoming. The second example came with my good fortune to be invited to all seven sessions in the series on copper proteins, usually referred to as the “Manziana Conferences,” initiated and perpetuated by Bruno Mondovı̀ of Rome, Jack Peisach of New York, and Bo Malmström of Göteborg and their colleagues until 1995 (3Beinert H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 64: 79-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 1972 to 1976 meetings still were under the spell of the Keilin-Hartree dilemma. The aspect of function largely eluded us. In the copper field the advent of EPR clearly broke the ice. With this technique (and thereafter with other spectroscopies) much more sense could be made of the metal-to-protein stoichiometry and the electronic absorption spectra that had been available so far. Now, all of a sudden, those designations, such as CuA and CuB in cytochrome oxidase or Type I, II, or III copper in ceruloplasmin assumed distinct character. Things were not as simple with iron, because there a new type of iron protein had to be discovered, the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins. The discovery predates somewhat the developments just presented, but the more detailed exploration of this new field approximately also falls into the same period. The coordination chemistry of copper is relatively simple as compared with that of iron, and it eventually took several different types of spectroscopies such as Mössbauer (MB), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and NMR, which were just developed in those years to a state such that it became feasible to apply them to biological material with relatively low concentrations of the target structures and with limited stability. In those copper protein meetings it was a most stimulating get together of groups that had barely talked to each other before: the chemical physicists that were trained in ligand field theory and were on speaking terms with pioneers such as Carl Ballhaüsen (4Ballhaüsen C.J. Introduction to Ligand Field Theory. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1982Google Scholar) and on the other side us, the enzyme chemists, used to getting our hands dirty with awkward messes of animal, plant, or bacterial origin, from which our objects had to be purified. We could not understand our data without the wisdom of the spectroscopists, and they were anxious to get their minds on the challenging and fascinating problems in metal coordination that nature had to offer. This fortunate mutual approach between these disciplines (the coordination chemists, the spectroscopists or chemical physicists, and the biochemists) took place in that 10–20-year span starting around the 1970s. There followed a period of intensive research on the functions of these proteins, and, no wonder, enzymes played a dominant role in this as compared with other metal proteins that serve other roles with the result that biological inorganic chemistry was often identified with the biochemistry of metal enzymes. This, of course, led to some resentment (5Sigel H. Chem. Eng. News. 2002; 80: 2Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) in the ranks of those interested in metal proteins with other functions such as transport, as e.g. hemocyanins, or metals involved in geological processes or stabilization of biological structure (6Williams R.J.P. Fraústo da Silva J.J.R. The Natural Selection of the Elements. Clarendon Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar). In this period as more structural and spectroscopic data became known, chemists started taking considerable interest in complex biological structures such as hemocyanin for instance or polyphenol oxidases, exploring their copper-oxygen chemistry. This then led to similar investigations on iron-oxo-systems, which eventually opened up the whole new field of Fe-oxo-proteins (7Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2625-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). A strong relationship of the chemistry of the metal-oxygen reactions to those involving free radical mechanisms soon became apparent (8Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). A similar relationship was found in the Fe-S protein field (9Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). During that period, starting with the 1970s, the flood of volumes on inorganic biochemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, metals in biological systems or whatever they were called started pouring out and there soon was also a Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry, starting in 1972, joined more recently, in 1996, by the Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry. A particularly good example of the rapid progress in that period is the role that x-ray crystallography played in the meeting series on copper proteins that we have followed above. At the 1979 meeting we all listened with awe to the only crystallographer present, Hans Freeman of Sydney, who showed the structure of poplar plastocyanin, one of the smallest blue copper proteins containing a single copper ion. The data on the immediate environment of the copper confirmed the conclusions drawn by the spectroscopists. At the 1985 meeting, Freeman presented further detail such as structures of reduced plastocyanin and of plastocyanins from different plant sources. Then, at the 1990 meeting, there were five crystallographers in the audience who presented three new structures, namely those of the considerably more complicated multicopper enzyme ascorbate oxidase, bacterial nitrite reductase, and galactose oxidase. Finally, at the 1995 meeting there were presented such impressive accomplishments as the structure of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase, of human ceruloplasmin, and amine oxidase of Escherichia coli. Of course, it must also be mentioned that it was not only the development of crystallographic methods and of more efficient light sources, it was also the progress in the preparation of proteins in high purity and quantity and the possibility of introducing new groups or exchanging amino acids (all this via molecular genetic procedures) that contributed to the remarkable advances. An example here is the preparation and structure determination of the CuA module of cytochrome c oxidase through such approaches (10Wilmanns M. Lappalainen P. Kelly M. Dauer-Eriksson E. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11955-11959Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similar advances were made in other areas using spectroscopy with radiation all over the range of energies from γ rays to radio frequencies. As my personal experience was mainly with spectroscopy, I may be forgiven if, among examples, I will mainly draw on those that I was directly involved in or that are in my field of interest. Before we leave the realm of high energy radiation, we must mention the relatively recent development of x-ray absorption spectroscopy, which became feasible when sufficiently powerful beam lines became more generally available at the reactor sites. Various features of these spectra have attracted attention: XANES, x-ray absorption near edge structure and more recently also pre-edge structure, and EXAFS, from which distances to neighboring nuclei can be determined or estimated, or certain types of nuclei can be excluded, depending on the quality of the spectra. EXAFS, for instance, has played a decisive role in the discovery and structure determination of the 3Fe cluster of Fe-S proteins (11Beinert H. Emptage M.H. Scott R.A. Hahn J.E. Hodgson K.O. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and particular attention has been paid recently to the pre-edge features in XANES (12Glaser T. Rose K. Shadle S.E. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), as it can furnish quantitative information on the degree of covalency of metal-ligand bonds (13Anxolabéhère-Mallart E. Glaser T. Frank P. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This has been successfully accomplished for Fe-S proteins and has given new insights into the electronic structure of Fe-S proteins. After this consideration of x-ray spectroscopy in connection with the discussion of the development of x-ray diffraction and crystallography, I will now briefly mention examples of the successful use of spectroscopy at other frequencies, starting from the low energy end. After a slow start, as far as application to proteins goes, NMR has undergone a very impressive development after the introduction of two- and higher-dimensional techniques, in combination with elaborate pulsing techniques and Fourier transform analysis, particularly also by the use of isotopes of a nuclear spin different from that of the naturally occurring atoms, such as 2H, 15N,13C, 17O, and 57Fe. For use with metal proteins the exploration of “paramagnetic NMR,” that is NMR on paramagnetic substances, has had great success (14Bertini I. Luchinat C. Parigi G. Current Methods in Inorganic Chemistry. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2001: 1-372Google Scholar) and has now become a routine procedure and the method of choice for answering specific questions. When the sequence of a protein is known and preferably also the three-dimensional structure around the metal site, the unpaired spin density on specific atoms can be determined. It has even been possible to observe the migration of spin density between sites (15Banci L. Bertini I. Ciurli S. Ferretti S. Luchinat C. Piccioli M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9387-9397Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moving on to the millimeter and centimeter range, EPR has been mentioned above as one of the first decisive tools in approaching the aspects of the function of copper proteins. It has played the decisive role in the discovery of Fe-S proteins and the exploration of the electronic structure and other properties of these proteins (16Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The hybrid methods such as ENDOR and ESEEM or optical detection of magnetic resonance are making use of the relatively slow relaxation of electron spins, so that saturation with incident radiation (microwaves in EPR) may occur, which can then be relieved through energy transfer by exciting neighboring atoms with other frequencies (radiowaves in ENDOR or ESEEM). Again, by the use of isotopes of different nuclear spin, very specific information can be obtained on the kind of neighboring atoms, on interatomic distances, and even on the mutual orientation of interacting species. Thus, for instance, we have been able to determine that in the 4Fe cluster of aconitase the specific iron atom (Fea) that has no cysteine ligand has a hydroxyl bound in the absence of substrate, which becomes protonated on addition of substrate to the enzyme (17Werst M. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10526-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We could also show with this enzyme and with substrate labeled with 17O or13C in different positions that the α-hydroxyl of isocitrate and the β-carboxyl of citrate bind to Fea(18Kennedy M.C. Werst M. Telser J. Emptage M.H. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8854-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ESEEM method is applicable for the detection of more distant neighboring atoms. Again pulse and Fourier transform techniques are required in this instance. An example of the combined use of both ENDOR and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) is the identification of the sequence of radicals formed in the conversion of α-lysine to β-lysine by 2,3-lysine aminomutase (19Magnusson O.T. Reed G.H. Frey P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9764-9765Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A condition necessary for all the work mentioned here is that a measurable EPR signal can be observed. In the cases cited it was the EPR signal of a reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster or of a free radical. Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is based on the enhancement of ordinarily observed Raman lines by a transition metal ion present in a molecule. This technique is therefore able to provide specific information concerning the ligands of the metal center and their position with respect to the metal. Again the use of specific isotopes of different molecular mass, such as 2H, 13C,15N, 18O, 34S, and 54Fe is very helpful and decisive. For instance it has been argued early on the basis of RR (20Johnson M.K. Czernuszewicz R.S. Spiro T.G. Fee J.A. Sweeney W.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6671-6678Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that the newly discovered 3Fe cluster could not have the [3Fe-3S] benzene-like ring structure first assumed but must have a structure closely related to the 4Fe cluster, as was shown by EXAFS and chemical analysis (11Beinert H. Emptage M.H. Scott R.A. Hahn J.E. Hodgson K.O. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An impressive example of the analytical power of infrared spectroscopy when applied to proteins was furnished when it was discovered that hydrogenases have CO and CN ligands bound to their 2Fe cluster (21Pierik A.J. Roseboom W. Happe R.P. Bagley K.A. Albracht S.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3331-3337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It has also been possible to detect subtle changes in substrates by infrared (22Lamb D.C. Nienhaus K. Arcovito A. Draghi F. Miele A.E. Brunori M. Nienhaus G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11636-11644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among the methods relying on magnetism the simplest may seem to be direct measurement of magnetic susceptibility. However, it is technically quite difficult to achieve the desired sensitivity. MCD and more so yet VTMCD, namely variable temperature MCD, has taken a prominent position for discriminating different components ine.g. a protein containing a number of different heme groups. This technique furnished the clue in the determination of the different Fe-S clusters in succinate dehydrogenase (23Johnson M.K. Morningstar J.E. Bennett D.E. Ackrell B.A.C. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7368-7378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been useful in the determination of the spin state of a substance when EPR is ambiguous. An example here is the determination of the spin state of the reduced [3Fe–4S]0 cluster (24Thomson A.J. Robinson A.E. Johnson M.K. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Xavier A.V. LeGall J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At about the middle of the 1960s I was invited to give a lecture at the Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. It was there in the Physics Division where Rudolf Mössbauer as a graduate student had discovered the effect now bearing his name. Richard Kuhn, the director of the Institute, introduced me in his unmistakable Viennese accent and his at such occasions usually somewhat pompous way: “Warburg has given us, who are interested in biological oxidations, the heme iron; you have now given us the non-heme iron” (referring to my work on Fe-S proteins). There happened to be in the audience Ekkehard Fluck, a young “Dozent” at the university, who was one of the early explorers of the MB effect in chemistry; he jumped up and commented that I should use MB to find out what these non-heme iron compounds were. When I asked how much iron (and that was to be57Fe) and in what volume was needed for this, his answer made it clear that this was definitely not the method to use. Nevertheless, it was not even 10 years before my friend Richard H. Sands and others (25Dunham W.R. Bearden A.J Salmeen I.T. Palmer G. Sands R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 253: 134-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) indeed successfully used MB on purified ferredoxins of relatively low molecular weight (though not on mitochondria yet), but it was then 20–30 years later that MB could be applied with success to identify iron in whole bacterial cells (26Boehnke R. Matzanke B.F. Biometals. 1995; 8: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar) and that specific compounds could be recognized and quantitatively determined (27Popescu C.V. Bates D.M. Beinert H. Münck H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There was an effect of mutual stimulation, similar to what I described above, when the first EPR data appeared but, of course, at a much more advanced level. Although we biochemists learned something about our proteins and enzymes, so did our challenge stimulate the spectroscopists to optimize the conditions and particularly also to dig out from the literature applicable theoretical concepts that could explain the observations, extend them, or even develop new ones of their own. This led to a closer approach between theoreticians and us at the bench, which turned out to be very productive. Thus, for instance, the concept of “spin-dependent delocalization (SDD)” (also called “double exchange” or “resonance”) was so clearly demonstrated, first by the reduced 3Fe cluster [3Fe-4S]0 (28Papaefthymiou V. Girerd J.-J. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 4703-4710Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and then also for the 4Fe cluster that it is now one of the main features considered important for understanding the electronic structure and reactivity of these clusters. The concept was, of course, not new but was hidden in mathematical equations and under designations that are not easily understood. It is the merit of the colleagues whose names appear in the given references that has brought these concepts to our attention in terms understandable to us (29Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The electronic structure of the clusters with more than two iron atoms can now be understood in terms of these interacting forces: 1) SDD, which favors a parallel spin orientation and thus formation of mixed valence (MV) pairs with one shared electron; 2) J, which favors antiparallel coupling as in the 2Fe cluster; and 3) what is called vibronic coupling, which has to do with the symmetry of the surrounding protein environment (e.g. a non-Cys ligand) and may favor one or the other spin arrangement. Cases for this are documented, with one of the simplest and most impressive examples being the 2Fe ferredoxin from a mutant of Clostridium pasteurianum in which one serine replaces one of the cysteine ligands of the native structure (30Achim C. Golinelli M.-P. Bominaar E.L. Meyer J. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8168-8169Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All the in some way related areas of endeavor mentioned above have, in their own way, become specialty fields, encompassing already a voluminous literature. Thus, definitions of fields are becoming blurred, and we must recognize the fallacy of trying to categorize with any rigidity while still preserving real meaning. Fig.1 may represent a possible way to depict the situation, as seen from the horizon of a biochemist. The fact that biochemistry occupies a space larger than the others does not mean that it is more important, but it was necessary for practical reasons, namely to provide enough space for demonstrating the overlap."
https://openalex.org/W1982534371,"We describe a photographic medium that uses acid-amplified imaging (AAI) rather than silver halide development to amplify a latent image. The latent image is captured when small amounts of superacid are generated by the photolysis of iodonium salts sensitized by cationic dyes. During thermal processing, the quantity of acid is multiplied in a process catalyzed by strong acid, resulting in a much larger amount of a weaker acid. Acid-sensitive indicator dyes that diffuse into regions where acid has been produced form a colored image. The AAI system is not sufficiently sensitive for direct use in cameras but is suitable for many printing applications."
https://openalex.org/W1998691277,"Glucose is well known to cause a rapid, reversible activation of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, very likely mediated by phosphorylation of two or more Ser/Thr residues near the C terminus. Recent mutagenesis studies have shown that glucose-dependent activation can be mimicked constitutively by amino acid substitutions in stalk segment 5 (S5), an α-helical stretch connecting the catalytic part of the ATPase with transmembrane segment 5 (Miranda, M., Allen, K. E., Pardo, J. P., and Slayman, C. W. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22485–22490). In the present work, the fluorescent maleimide Alexa-488 has served as a probe for glucose-dependent changes in the conformation of S5. Experiments were carried out in a “3C” version of the ATPase, from which six of nine native cysteines had been removed by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate background labeling by Alexa-488. In this construct, three of twelve cysteines introduced at various positions along S5 (A668C, S672C, and D676C) reacted with the Alexa dye in a glucose-independent manner, as shown by fluorescent labeling of the 100 kDa Pma1 polypeptide and by isolation and identification of the corresponding tryptic peptides. Especially significant was the fact that three additional cysteines reacted with Alexa-488 more rapidly (Y689C) or only (V665C and L678C) in plasma membranes from glucose-metabolizing cells. The results support a model in which the S5 α-helix undergoes a significant change in conformation to expose positions 665, 678, and 689 during glucose-dependent activation of the ATPase.

P2-type ATPases are a widespread family of cation pumps found throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar). Actively studied members of the family include the plasma membrane H+-ATPases of yeast, Neurospora, and higher plants, as well as the Na+,K+-; H+,K+-; and Ca2+-ATPases of animal cells. All of these examples are abundant membrane proteins, and in many cases they hydrolyze 25% or more of total cellular ATP (e.g. 2). It is thus not surprising that regulatory mechanisms have evolved to adjust ATPase activity to the physiological needs of the cell. The yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which is encoded by the PMA1 gene (3Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Google Scholar), has been known for almost two decades to be strongly regulated by glucose (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Google Scholar). When yeast cells are placed in carbon-free medium, there is a rapid, 5- to 10-fold decrease in Pma1 ATPase activity, and when glucose is added back, activity rebounds completely in less than 5 min. Although the mechanism is not yet fully understood, there is growing evidence to implicate the C terminus of the ATPase, acting as an autoinhibitory domain (reviewed in Ref. 5Portillo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 31-42Google Scholar). Mutations at two potential phosphorylation sites within this region, Ser-899 and Thr-912, affect the ability of glucose to stimulate ATPase activity (6Portillo F. Eraso P. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 71-74Google Scholar), and thermolysin digests of the 100-kDa H+-ATPase polypeptide have revealed two (as yet unidentified) phosphopeptides that decrease in amount during carbon starvation and increase again upon glucose addition (7Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 115 (]): 289-295Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the C terminus becomes dephosphorylated during carbon starvation, allowing it to interact in an inhibitory way with one or more catalytically important parts of the ATPase; upon addition of glucose, the C terminus is rephosphorylated, and the inhibition is released (5Portillo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 31-42Google Scholar, 8Goossens A., De La Fuente N. Forment J. Serrano R. Portillo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7654-7661Google Scholar). Recently, genetic evidence has suggested that stalk segment 5 (S5) 1The abbreviations used are: S5, stalk segment 5; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotetraacetic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. of the H+-ATPase polypeptide may take part in this regulatory interaction. S5, which stretches from Pro-669 to Tyr-689, is one of several α-helical segments that connect the cytoplasmic domains of the ATPase to the membrane-embedded domain. The overall shape of the stalk was first seen by cryoelectron microscopy of theNeurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (9Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Google Scholar, 10Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Google Scholar); a 2.6 Å x-ray crystallographic structure of the latter enzyme has since provided a high-resolution view (11Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). Remarkably, S5 and its related transmembrane segment (M5) appear as a continuous α-helix, 60 Å long, around which the rest of the polypeptide is organized. It was thus of considerable interest when scanning mutagenesis of S5 identified seven periodically spaced positions at which single amino acid substitutions led to strong, constitutive activation of the yeast H+-ATPase (Phe-666, Leu-671, Ile-674, Ala-677, Ile-684, Arg-687, Tyr-689, Ref.12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar). At each of these positions, which lie along one face of the α-helix, replacement by a Cys residue increased ATPase activity in starved cells to levels usually seen only in glucose-metabolizing cells. Furthermore, at two additional positions on the same face of S5, Portillo and co-workers (13Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Google Scholar) have described mutations that suppress the effect of amino acid substitutions at Ser-899 and Thr-912 in the C terminus. With this information as background, the present study was designed to look directly at S5 of the yeast Pma1 H+-ATPase, using a fluorescent maleimide (Alexa-488) to probe the previously constructed set of Cys mutants (12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar). The goal was to identify cysteines that can react with Alexa-488 and to ask whether reactivity varies with experimental conditions in a way that might signal a glucose-dependent conformational change in or near S5. Two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used in this study: SY4 (MAT a, ura3–52, leu2–3,112, his4–619, sec6–4ts GAL2, pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1) and NY13 (MAT a, ura3–52). In strain SY4, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene has been placed under control of the GAL1 promotor by gene disruption (14Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-111Google Scholar) using the integrating plasmid, YIpGAL-PMA1 (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). SY4 also carries the temperature-sensitive sec6-4 mutation which, upon incubation at 37 °C, blocks the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (16Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Google Scholar). Yeast strains bearing Cys substitutions in stalk segment 5 of the Pma1 ATPase have been described previously (12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar). For the present study, theBglII-SalI restriction fragment carrying each mutation was moved into a modified version of plasmid pPMA1.2 (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar) or plasmid pGW201 (17Wang G. Tamas M. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 271: 25438-25445Google Scholar). Both plasmids were designed to add a 10-histidine tag to the N terminus of the ATPase and to replace all but three of the nine original Cys residues (Cys-376, Cys-409, and Cys-472) with Ala. To express the mutant ATPase in secretory vesicles, the 3.8-kbHindIII-SacI fragment from PMA1.2-3C, which contains the entire pma1 coding region, was cloned into the yeast expression vector YCp2HSE (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar), placing the mutant allele under control of two tandemly arranged heat-shock elements. Plasmids were then transformed into yeast according to the method of Ito et al. (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). To integrate the Cys mutations into the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene, the 6.1-kb HindIII fragment from pGW201-3C, containing the mutant allele linked to URA3, was excised from the plasmid and transplaced into strain NY13 using the Alkali-Cation Yeast transformation kit (Bio 101). In both cases, the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Secretory vesicles were prepared from SY4-derived strains by the method of Ambesi et al. (19Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Google Scholar) and suspended in 0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmTEA/acetic acid, pH 7.2. To isolate plasma membranes from glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing cells, NY13-derived strains were grown to mid-exponential phase in supplemented minimal medium containing 4% glucose, washed, and incubated with or without glucose as described by Miranda et al. (12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar), A microsomal membrane fraction was then prepared by the method of Perlin et al.(20Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Google Scholar), washed with 1 mm EGTA/Tris, and resuspended in a small volume of the same buffer. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Unless otherwise noted, ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C in 0.5 ml of 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.7 or 6.25, 5 mm KN3, 5 mmNa2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and an ATP regenerating system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase). The reaction was terminated after 20–40 min with 50 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, and the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP was determined by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (21Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated as the difference between ATP hydrolysis in the absence and in the presence of 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, a potent inhibitor of P-type ATPases. To examine the reactivity of the introduced Cys residues, Alexa-488 (Alexa-Fluor-488 C5maleimide sodium salt; Molecular Probes) was used as a probe. Secretory vesicles were suspended at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.8m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm TEA, pH 7.2; plasma membranes were suspended at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. In both cases, Alexa-488 was added from a fresh stock solution to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the suspension was incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots were removed at intervals and diluted 100-fold into ATPase reaction mixture containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Inorganic phosphate was determined as described above (21Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). The rate constants for inactivation were calculated by fitting the data to Equations 1 and2, A(t)=A0×exp(−k×t)Equation 1 A(t)=A1×exp(−k1×t)+A2×exp(−k2×t)Equation 2 when Alexa-488 brought about a monophasic or biphasic, complete inactivation of the ATPase, or to Equation 3, A(t)=A0×((1−F)×exp(−k×t)+F)Equation 3 when inactivation was not complete. A0,k, and F correspond to the activity at zero time, the pseudo-first order rate constant of inactivation, and the final residual activity, respectively. Labeling of the ATPase with Alexa-488 was carried out under native and denatured conditions. To label the native enzyme, secretory vesicles and plasma membranes were suspended as described above. In both cases, Alexa-488 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the suspension was incubated for either 8 or 20 min at 30o. The reaction was stopped by 30-fold dilution into 5 mmHEPES, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. The membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. The ATPase was then solubilized by the addition of 0.5% SDS and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described below. For complete labeling of sulfhydryl groups in the ATPase, secretory vesicles (1 mg/ml) or plasma membranes (0.5 mg/ml)) were first denatured with 1% SDS and then exposed to 1 mmAlexa-488 for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the ATPase was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. To purify the ATPase, the SDS-solubilized membrane fraction was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with continuous shaking. The mixture was then transferred to a disposable column (Poly-Prep Chromatography colums, Bio-Rad), the flow-through was discarded, and the column washed with 20 ml of 10 mm Tris, 25 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0. Finally, the His-tagged ATPase was eluted with 0.3–0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris, 25 mm Na2HPO4, 250 mmimidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.3. Purified ATPase was concentrated to 50–100 μl with a Biomax-30K filter (Millipore) and precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone. The protein was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in 0.15 ml of 2m urea, 0.15 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0. The ATPase was then digested with trypsin (2.5 μg) for 4 h at 30 °C and for a further 2 h after a second addition of trypsin (2.5 μg). At the end of the incubation, trypsinolysis was stopped by the addition of 1 mm DFP. To separate labeled peptides by HPLC, the tryptic digest was injected into a Vydac C18 column and eluted with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously (22Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 427-434Google Scholar). The absorbance of the eluate was measured at 210 nm to detect all peptides and at 493 nm to detect Alexa-labeled peptides. Peptides were purified using either a C18 aquapore column with the same acetonitrile gradient or the original C18Vydac column with a different gradient. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified fluorescent peptides were determined by MALDI-MS and/or Edman degradation. HPLC, mass spectrometry, and peptide sequencing were performed in Yale University's Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) as modified by Ambesi et al. (19Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. As described in the Introduction, the initial goal of this study was to ask whether Alexa-488 can react with any of the Cys residues previously introduced into stalk segment 5. For this purpose, we began with a well characterized expression system that uses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the SEC6 gene to arrest newly synthesized H+-ATPase in secretory vesicles, just prior to fusion with the plasma membrane (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). Because the vesicles are oriented inside-out, the impermeant Alexa dye should in principle have access to cytoplasmically exposed regions of the H+-ATPase, including S5 (Fig.1). In an early control experiment, wild-type ATPase was tagged with 10 histidine residues at the N terminus to allow for subsequent purification (24Janknecht R., De Martynhoff G. Lou J. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Google Scholar); it was then expressed in secretory vesicles and exposed to 1 mm Alexa-488 for 0–10 min. The ATPase was rapidly inactivated under these conditions (Fig.2 A), indicating that one or more of its 9 native cysteines must be reactive with Alexa-488. We therefore turned to the set of mutant strains constructed by Petrov and Slayman (25Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Google Scholar), in which varying numbers of native Cys residues were replaced by Ala or Ser. In that study, a totally Cys-free H+-ATPase was found to possess little or no enzymatic activity in secretory vesicles, and versions containing one or two cysteines were markedly less active than the wild-type control. However, a mutant with three cysteines (Cys-376, Cys-409, and Cys-472; see Fig. 1) was able to split ATP and pump protons at close to 80% of the wild-type rate. 2V. Petrov, unpublished experiments. Furthermore, in the experiment of Fig. 2 A, the His-tagged version of this 3C construct proved to be virtually insensitive to Alexa-488. It was thus well suited for the present study. As a critical control, secretory vesicles containing His-tagged, 3C H+-ATPase were incubated with Alexa-488 for 8 min. The ATPase was then solubilized, purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by HPLC. None of the three cysteines was significantly labeled under these conditions (Fig. 3, panel B), even though labeled peptides corresponding to all three could be readily identified in ATPase that had been denatured with SDS before exposure to the Alexa dye (Fig. 3, panel A and TableI). Thus, Cys-376, Cys-409, and Cys-472 do not react appreciably with Alexa-488 in the native, fully folded ATPase, and the His-tagged 3C construct could be adopted as background for all of the experiments to be described.Table IMALDI-MS analysis and amino-terminal sequence of peptides labeled with Alexa-488Peak fractionMajor spectral peakCalculated massaThe calculated mass was obtained by addition of the protonated mass of the peptide and the mass for Alexa-488 C5 maleimide (697.67).

Open table in a new tab The recent study by Miranda et al. (12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar) yielded a complete set of mutant H+-ATPases with Cys substitutions at individual positions along stalk segment 5. When these mutations were placed one at a time into the His-tagged 3C background and the mutant ATPases were expressed in secretory vesicles, 12 of them had sufficient activity to be studied further: V665C, A668C, S672C, A673C, D676C, L678C, K679C, T680C, Q683C, H686C, M688C, and Y689C. Fortunately, these 12 cysteines were scattered throughout the length of S5, where in principle they could give useful information about structure and reactivity. To look directly at the reactivity of the S5 cysteines, secretory vesicle preparations were incubated with 1 mm Alexa-488 for 8 or 20 min. The mutant ATPases were then purified and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 100-kDa ATPase band was analyzed for fluorescence (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results described above, native 3C ATPase was essentially unreactive under these conditions. When its labeling was compared with that of denatured 3C enzyme, which was assumed to contain 3.0 mol of Alexa dye per mol of 100-kDa polypeptide (lane 1), the corresponding stoichiometry was only 0.1 for native 3C ATPase after 8 min of incubation (lane 5) and 0.2 after 20 min of incubation (lane 7). Most reactive among the cysteines introduced into stalk segment 5 was D676C. This residue could be completely labeled to a stoichiometry of 1.1 in only 8 min (lane 6). Two other cysteines, A668C and S672C, reacted more slowly, reaching stoichiometries of 1.0 and 1.1 after 20 min (lanes 8 and 9). The remaining nine cysteines displayed little if any reactivity with Alexa-488 (not shown). As expected, denaturation of the mutant ATPases before exposure to Alexa-488 gave stoichiometries corresponding to 4 Cys residues per mol of 100-kDa polypeptide (lanes 2–4). To confirm the identity of the labeled residues, the mutant ATPases were purified, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3 D, a new fluorescent peptide (peak 4) was seen in the digest of D676C ATPase that had been exposed to Alexa-488 under native conditions; the same peptide was also labeled under denaturing conditions (Fig. 3 C). This peptide was identified by N-terminal sequence analysis as Ser-660–Lys-679 (Table I, peptide 4). Corresponding results were obtained for A668C and S672C (not shown). A parallel set of experiments was carried out to examine the effect of Alexa-488 on ATPase activity. As illustrated in Fig. 2 D and Table II, D676C ATPase was rapidly inhibited by the Alexa dye, with a rate constant of 0.757 min−1. Interestingly, the inhibition was not complete; ∼40% residual activity remained even after 8 min of exposure. As expected based on the time course of labeling, the A668C and S672C ATPases were inhibited much more slowly, with rate constants of 0.028 and 0.063 min−1, respectively (Fig. 2, B andC and Table II). The inhibition of S672C approached completion at the later time points, while ∼70% residual activity remained in A668C.

Open table in a new tab Thus, in the secretory vesicle form of the H+-ATPase, three of the Cys residues introduced into stalk segment 5 could clearly react with Alexa-488, and modification led to partial (A668C, D676C) or complete (S672C) inhibition of ATPase activity. The next step was to ask whether Cys-668, Cys-672, Cys-676, or any of the other Cys residues placed along stalk segment 5 might undergo glucose-dependent changes in reactivity with Alexa-488. For this purpose, it was necessary to express the mutant ATPases at the plasma membrane, where glucose regulation is known to have its full effect. Accordingly, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 coding sequence was replaced with each of the His-tagged, 3C mutant constructs described above. Gene replacement was carried out in cells possessing a normal copy of theSEC6 gene, so when the mutant ATPase was expressed constitutively under control of the PMA1 promoter, it could move uninterruptedly from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. As expected, all 12 mutant ATPases, which had specific activities in secretory vesicles ranging from 28 to 72% of the wild-type level (Table II), were able to support normal or near normal growth. In the experiment of Table III, plasma membranes were prepared from glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing cells expressing each of the His-tagged, 3C-based mutant alleles, and assayed for ATPase activity. As found previously for untagged, 9C-based constructs (12Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Google Scholar), Y689C was constitutively activated at the plasma membrane, hydrolyzing ATP equally well under glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing conditions (14.60 and 14.46 units/mg). All but one of the other mutants gave activation ratios between 2.0 and 5.1, and thus were clearly regulated by glucose. A673C was intermediate in its behavior, with an activation ratio of 1.4.Table IIIEffect of cysteine substitutions on ATPase expression, activity, and inhibition by Alexa-488: studies on plasma membranes from glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing cellsMutationExpressionaThe amount of H+-ATPase in isolated plasma membranes was determined by quantitative immunoblotting and calculated as a percent of the wild-type control.ATPase activitybVanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was measured at pH 6.25 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit is defined as 1 μmol of P/min.InhibitiondInhibition of ATPase activity by Alexa-488 C5 maleimide in glucose-metabolizing and glucose-starved cells.

Open table in a new tab With this background information in hand, the next step was to examine the reactivity of S5 Cys residues with Alexa-488 in plasma membranes from glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing cells (Fig.5). Not surprisingly, the three cysteines already found to react with Alexa-488 in secretory vesicles (A668C, S672C, D676C; see above) gave comparable results in plasma membranes, and the stoichiometry of labeling under glucose-starved conditions (1.0–1.2; see lanes 9, 11, and13) was very close to that under"
