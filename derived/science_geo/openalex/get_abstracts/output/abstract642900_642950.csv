https://openalex.org/W2987957259,"Development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts is critical for practical fuel cells. We report one-dimensional bunched platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) alloy nanocages with a Pt-skin structure for the oxygen reduction reaction that display high mass activity (3.52 amperes per milligram platinum) and specific activity (5.16 milliamperes per square centimeter platinum), or nearly 17 and 14 times higher as compared with a commercial platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. The catalyst exhibits high stability with negligible activity decay after 50,000 cycles. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal the existence of fewer strongly bonded platinum-oxygen (Pt-O) sites induced by the strain and ligand effects. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers a current density of 1.5 amperes per square centimeter at 0.6 volts and can operate steadily for at least 180 hours."

To better understand common genetic variation associated with brain diseases, we defined noncoding regulatory regions for major cell types of the human brain. Whereas psychiatric disorders were primarily associated with variants in transcriptional enhancers and promoters in neurons, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) variants were largely confined to microglia enhancers. Interactome maps connecting disease-risk variants in cell-type-specific enhancers to promoters revealed an extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer harboring AD-risk variants ablated BIN1 expression in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the list of genes likely to be influenced by noncoding variants in AD and suggest the probable cell types in which they function."

With a focus on global change as it affects soils, Rillig et al. point out that nearly all published studies consider just one or two factors at a time (see the Perspective by Manning). In a laboratory experiment, they tested 10 drivers of global change both individually and in combination, at levels ranging from 2 to 10 factors. They found that soil properties, processes, and microbial communities could not be predicted from single-effect responses and that multiple factors in combination produced unsuspected responses. They concluded that single-factor studies remain important for uncovering mechanisms but that global change biology needs to embrace more fully the multitude of drivers impinging on ecosystems.

However, their lifetime is limited because the electrons and holes tend to quickly recombine. One way to extend this lifetime is to physically separate electrons and holes—for example, by having them reside in different layers of a van der Waals heterostructure. Jauregui et al. used this strategy to form long-lived interlayer excitons in a heterostructure made out of monolayers of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2 ) and tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ). Through electrical control of the layers in the heterostructure, the researchers further increased exciton lifetime and formed and manipulated charged excitons. Science , this issue p. 870"

Activated T helper (T H ) cells that recognize myosin heavy chain 6–derived peptides are thought to play a central role in this pathogenesis. Using a mouse model of myocarditis, Gil-Cruz et al. found that cardiac myosin–reactive T H cells are initially primed by myosin-peptide mimics derived from commensal Bacteroides species in the gut (see the Perspective by Epelman). Unlike heathy controls, human myocarditis patients also showed detectable immune reactivity to both Bacteroides and cardiac myosin antigens. Treatment with antibiotics dampened inflammatory responses and prevented lethal heart disease. Science , this issue p. 881 ; see also p. 806"

DS causes intellectual disabilities, among other health issues, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying the memory deficits in DS. Zhu et al. used a multidisciplinary approach to show that a defect in integrated stress response, a conserved pathway that controls protein homeostasis, can explain the cognitive and neuronal deficits in a mouse model of DS (see the Perspective by Halliday and Mallucci). These insights into the biological basis underlying DS could potentially help in the design of treatments for this condition. Science , this issue p. 843 ; see also p. 797"

Around a million are occurring at any moment, even during periods of low solar activity. The mechanism responsible for launching spicules remains unknown, as is their contribution to heating the solar corona. Samanta et al. observed emerging spicules and the magnetic fields in the adjacent solar surface. They found that many spicules appear a few minutes after a patch of reverse-polarity magnetic field and that the overlying corona is heated shortly afterward. This result provides evidence that magnetic reconnection can generate spicules, which then transfer energy to the corona. Science , this issue p. 890"

One familiar feature of glass is that it fractures and shatters when rapidly deformed, limiting the number of potential uses. However, Frankberg et al. found that they could deform thin films of glassy alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) with high strain rates at room temperature (see the Perspective by Wondraczek). This surprising observation is supported by simulations of the material that show that dense and flawless glassy alumina samples can deform this way.

In between the superconducting and insulating regimes, an intermediate metallic state has been observed whose nature remains unresolved. To study the superconductor–metal insulator transition, C. Yang et al. patterned a film of the high-temperature superconductor yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) into a network of triangular superconducting islands connected by bridges (see the Perspective by Phillips). The reactive ion-etching process used for patterning reduced the quality of the film in a controlled manner. By increasing the etching time, the film's transport properties could be tuned from superconducting, through metallic, to insulating. The metallic phase exhibited a bosonic character.

https://openalex.org/W2984253303,"Cross-linking a range of alkyl polymers Some alkyl polymers, such as polyethylene, can be cross-linked by using peroxides or high-energy radiation or through the addition of a radical forming agent. Others, like polypropylene, are likely to undergo chain scission, and this process tends to be uncontrolled in the distribution of the cross-links. Lepage et al. developed a widely applicable approach using bis -diazirine molecules as cross-linking agents (see the Perspective by de Zwart et al. ). These molecules can be thermally or photochemically activated to form carbenes that readily insert into the polymer carbon-hydrogen bonds, thus leading to cross-linking. The bis -diazirine is nonexplosive, nonvolatile, and easily activated at relatively mild temperatures and thus could be used to fine-tune the properties of existing polymers through small chemical modifications.

We demonstrate coherent control over electrons in a tunnel junction of a scanning tunneling microscope by means of precise tuning of the carrier-envelope phase of two-cycle long (<6-femtosecond) optical pulses. We explore photon and field-driven tunneling, two different regimes of interaction of optical pulses with the tunnel junction, and demonstrate a transition from one regime to the other. Our results show that it is possible to induce, track, and control electronic current at atomic scales with subfemtosecond resolution, providing a route to develop petahertz coherent nanoelectronics and microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2988368053,"Memory of cues associated with threat is critical for survival and a leading model for elucidating how sensory information is linked to adaptive behavior by learning. Although the brain-wide circuits mediating auditory threat memory have been intensely investigated, it remains unclear whether the auditory cortex is critically involved. Here we use optogenetic activity manipulations in defined cortical areas and output pathways, viral tracing, pathway-specific in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, and computational analyses of population plasticity to reveal that the auditory cortex is selectively required for conditioning to complex stimuli, whereas the adjacent temporal association cortex controls all forms of auditory threat memory. More temporal areas have a stronger effect on memory and more neurons projecting to the lateral amygdala, which control memory to complex stimuli through a balanced form of population plasticity that selectively supports discrimination of significant sensory stimuli. Thus, neocortical processing plays a critical role in cued threat memory."
https://openalex.org/W2987363920,"Change in plants as bicarbonate rises Freshwater plants can be broadly divided into two major categories according to their photosynthetic traits: Some use carbon dioxide as their carbon source, whereas others use bicarbonate. Iversen et al. found that the relative concentrations of these two inorganic carbon forms in water determine the functional composition of plant communities across freshwater ecosystems (see the Perspective by Marcé and Obrador). They created global maps revealing that community composition is structured by catchment geology and not climate (in contrast to the terrestrial realm, where the trait composition is structured by temperature and rainfall). Anthropogenic influences from land-use change are causing large-scale increases in bicarbonate concentrations in freshwater catchments and are thus leading to wholesale changes in the composition of their aquatic plant communities.

https://openalex.org/W2983619165,"Tubulins play crucial roles in cell division, intracellular traffic, and cell shape. Tubulin concentration is autoregulated by feedback control of messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation via an unknown mechanism. We identified tetratricopeptide protein 5 (TTC5) as a tubulin-specific ribosome-associating factor that triggers cotranslational degradation of tubulin mRNAs in response to excess soluble tubulin. Structural analysis revealed that TTC5 binds near the ribosome exit tunnel and engages the amino terminus of nascent tubulins. TTC5 mutants incapable of ribosome or nascent tubulin interaction abolished tubulin autoregulation and showed chromosome segregation defects during mitosis. Our findings show how a subset of mRNAs can be targeted for coordinated degradation by a specificity factor that recognizes the nascent polypeptides they encode."

Hence, auditory cortex representations contribute to sound discriminations by refining decisions from parallel routes. The role of primary sensory cortical areas in perceptual decisions is complex. Primary sensory areas are often viewed as necessary links between peripheral sensory information and decision centers, but multiple observations challenge this simplified model. For example, human subjects with primary visual cortex lesions display residual visual abilities, a phenomenon termed “blindsight” (Sanders et al., 1974Sanders M.D. Warrington E.K. Marshall J.

This apparent contradiction is particularly evident in hearing, for which involvement of auditory cortex (AC) is controversial even for discrimination of two distinct sounds. Indeed, lesions or reversible silencing of auditory cortex lead to deficits or have little effect, depending on task conditions, silencing methods, and animal models (Diamond and Neff, 1957Diamond I.T.

Role of mammalian auditory cortex in the perception of elementary sound properties.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 2350-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, auditory cortex does not seem to be always necessary for sound discrimination. Moreover, the requirement of auditory cortex, in particular task settings, points toward two alternative mechanistic implications. One alternative is that AC requirement reflects a permissive role for the task (Otchy et al., 2015Otchy T.M. Wolff S.B. Rhee J.Y. Pehlevan C. Kawai R. Kempf A. Gobes S.M. Ölveczky B.P. Acute off-target effects of neural circuit manipulations.Nature. 2015; 528: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), for example, by providing some global gating signals to other areas, which is not informative about the decision to be taken but without which the behavioral decision process is impaired. The second alternative is that AC actually provides for each stimulus distinct pieces of information that contribute to drive the discriminative choices. Optogenetic manipulations of AC activity can modulate auditory discrimination performance (Aizenberg et al., 2015Aizenberg M. Mwilambwe-Tshilobo L. Briguglio J.J. Natan R.G. Geffen M.N. Bidirectional regulation of innate and learned behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination by cortical inhibitory neurons.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which could be both explained by a permissive or a driving role of AC in the task. Targeted manipulation of AC outputs in the striatum can bias sound frequency discrimination toward the sound frequency corresponding to the preferred frequency of the manipulated neurons (Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013Znamenskiy P. Zador A.M. Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination.Nature. 2013; 497: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This indicates that AC output can be sufficient to drive discrimination, but as the effect of complete AC inactivation was not tested in this task, it remains possible that this manipulation does not reflect the natural drive occurring in the unperturbed behavior. In support of this, targeted manipulation of generic AC neurons failed to drive consistent biases in this task (Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013Znamenskiy P. Zador A.M. Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination.Nature. 2013; 497: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, necessity and sufficiency of precise auditory cortex activity patterns in a sound discrimination behavior remain to be established. Here, we combine optogenetic silencing and patterned activation techniques in head-fixed mice to show that AC is not required in a simple frequency discrimination task but is necessary for a difficult discrimination involving sounds with frequency overlap. We also show, based on a discrimination of distinct optogenetically driven AC activity patterns, that specific AC information is sufficient for driving a discrimination, and decisions in this case also take longer than choices made in the simple task. Last, we show that focal stimulation of AC is able to modify the animal’s choice in the difficult task, but not in the simple one. We also show that the AC region most sensitive to focal stimulation encodes auditory features used by the mouse to discriminate the two trained sounds. These results indicate that auditory cortex provides necessary and sufficient information to drive decisions in difficult sound discriminations, although other pathways bypass it in simple discriminations. Lesion studies in gerbils, rats, cats, and monkeys (Diamond and Neff, 1957Diamond I.T. Neff W.D. Ablation of temporal cortex and discrimination of auditory patterns.J.

Effect of auditory cortex lesions on the discrimination of frequency-modulated tones in rats.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that the involvement of auditory cortex in sound discrimination could be related to the sound features that have to be discriminated and thus potentially to the difficulty of the discrimination. To test this idea, we trained different groups of mice to perform a head-fixed Go/NoGo task: one group was trained to discriminate pure frequency features (a 4-kHz against a 16-kHz pure tone; PTvsPT task), and a second group had to integrate frequency variations over time in order to discriminate a linearly rising, frequency-modulated sound (4- to 12-kHz) against a pure tone (4-kHz; FMvsPT task; Figure 1A). Although the PTvsPT task was rapidly learned, the FMvsPT task was more challenging, as it required much longer training (82 ± 12 trials, n = 34 mice for the PTvsPT against 416 ± 54 trials, n = 28 mice, for FMvsPT task to reach 80% performance; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p = 2.5 × 10−8; Figures 1B and 1C). We thus wondered whether this difference in task difficulty could relate to differential involvement of AC. To address this question, we decided to silence AC by activating parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) expressing channelrhodopsin2 (hChR2-tdTomato). Electrophysiological calibration in awake, passive mice (Figures 2A and S1) showed that this manipulation strongly disrupted cortical activity (e.g., Figure 2B), decreasing population firing rates to target sounds by ∼70%, with about 50% of putative PV-negative neurons displaying a complete suppression of their response (Figures 2C and S1). To evaluate the effect of PV activation on task performance, we trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate the two target sounds based on the population activity of putative PV-negative neurons (n = 125 neurons; recorded in 14 separate populations across 4 mice). We then measured the performance of the classifier with AC responses to the same sounds during PV activation. For the pure tones, the SVM performance dropped from almost perfect classification to less than 70%, and for the pure tone versus FM sound, SVM performance dropped to chance levels (Figure 2D), suggesting that the optogenetic manipulation perturbs sound encoding, although, given the small size of our neuronal sample, we cannot verify to what extent the information remains at a broader scale.Figure 2Cortical Requirement for Sound Discrimination Depends on Discrimination ComplexityShow full caption(A) Sketch of the optogenetic inactivation strategy through a cranial window covering the primary and secondary auditory cortex.

Bar plots show the mean and SEM throughout the figure. When bilaterally applying this PV activation protocol through cranial windows in behaving mice, we indeed observed a drop of performance down to chance level (50%) in the FMvsPT task, independent of whether the FM sweep was the rewarded or non-rewarded stimulus (Figure S2), while mice lacking ChR2 expression performed normally (Figure 2E). However, the same manipulation during the PTvsPT task yielded less than a 10% performance drop (Figure 2E), which is significantly lower than the ∼30% performance drop to chance level observed for the FMvsPT task (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0.002; n = 6 and 7 mice). This mild impact was not due to the wide difference in frequency in our PTvsPT task, as mice were not more impaired by optogenetic AC silencing when discriminating 4-kHz versus 8-kHz or 4-kHz versus 6-kHz (Figure S2), but we do not exclude AC involvement for even finer discriminations. Because the same inactivation strategy applied to the inferior colliculus, an earlier stage of the auditory system, fully abolished PTvsPT performance (Figure 2F), we suspected that the continued performance of the PTvsPT task after AC perturbation was not due to incompleteness of the silencing (Figures 2C and S1) but rather to the absence of AC involvement. We thus performed bilateral lesions that covered the entire AC and observed only a ∼10% drop in behavioral performance, even for a smaller frequency difference, on the day following lesion (Figures 2G and S2). In summary, AC is dispensable for a simple pure tone discrimination, but it is necessary for the more difficult FMvsPT task. Necessity alone does not prove that AC activity patterns causally drive decisions in the FMvsPT task (Hong et al., 2018Hong Y.K. Lacefield C.O. Rodgers C.C. Bruno R.M.

Seeking to establish a proof of sufficiency for AC activity in this task, we first tested whether two distinct activity patterns unilaterally delivered to AC can provide enough information to drive a discrimination task, as so far, cortical stimulation studies have only demonstrated detection of a single cortical stimulation (Houweling and Brecht, 2008Houweling A.R.

We chose to trigger the two discriminated activity patterns with light disks of 0.4 mm diameter at two distinct positions. To make sure that optogenetic patterns were qualitatively similar to sound-evoked activity, we calibrated them in awake mice by recording isolated single units with multi-electrode silicon probes while targeting the light disks to many locations within the cranial window (Figures 3A and 3B). In this procedure, we observed that recorded single units tended to respond only to a subset of the tested locations (e.g., Figure 3C). Pooling together the activity of all recorded neurons, we observed that optogenetically and sound-triggered responses had similar latencies and time courses above a 50-ms timescale (Figure 3B; note that optogenetic responses followed the 20-Hz modulation of the light stimulus below the 50-ms timescale). Moreover, response amplitudes were similar in particular for the lowest light intensity tested (12 mW; Figure 3B), reflected by a high correlation of response amplitudes to the preferred sound and the optogenetic pattern (Figure 3D). Last, the spatial extent of optogenetic responses (600–800 μm diameter, depending on light intensity; Figure 3E) matched the extent of pure tone responses in primary auditory cortex (e.g., Figure S3) and changed little with depth (Figures 3F and 3G), although evoked population firing rates were clearly reduced in the deepest layers. Together, these measurements indicated that the chosen cortical stimulation patterns yielded response characteristics within the range of natural sound responses. Using the same behavioral protocol as for the sound discrimination tasks, we trained mice to discriminate between unilateral cortical stimulations (32 mW.mm−2) in low- versus high-frequency tonotopic areas of the primary auditory field of AC (Figures 4A–4C). The locations of these areas with respect to blood vessel patterns were identified using intrinsic imaging (Figures 4C and S3) as previously established (Bathellier et al., 2012Bathellier B.

Blood vessels were then used as landmarks to robustly target the same regions across days. We observed that mice could learn to discriminate these artificial AC patterns within hundreds of trials (Figures 4D and S3), showing AC activity can drive a discrimination task. Strikingly, however, discrimination of cortical patterns was executed about four times slower than the cortex-independent discrimination of real pure tones ("

Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases 1 and 2 (ACAT1/2) convert cholesterol into its storage form, cholesteryl esters, regulating a key step in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Adipose tissue can store >50% of whole-body cholesterol. Interestingly, however, almost no ACAT activity is present in adipose tissue, and most adipose cholesterol is stored in its free form. We therefore hypothesized that increased cholesterol esterification may have detrimental effects on adipose tissue function. Here, using several approaches, including protein overexpression, quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and various biochemical assays, we found that ACAT1 expression is significantly increased in the adipose tissue of the ob/ob mice. We further demonstrated that ACAT1/2 overexpression partially inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In mature adipocytes, increased ACAT activity reduced the size of lipid droplets (LDs) and inhibited lipolysis and insulin signaling. Paradoxically, the amount of free cholesterol increased on the surface of LDs in ACAT1/2-overexpressing adipocytes, accompanied by increased LD localization of caveolin-1. Moreover, cholesterol depletion in adipocytes by treating the cells with cholesterol-deficient media or β-cyclodextrins induced changes in cholesterol distribution that were similar to those caused by ACAT1/2 overexpression. Our results suggest that ACAT1/2 overexpression increases the level of free cholesterol on the LD surface, thereby impeding adipocyte function.

https://openalex.org/W2986846745,"Empathic concern and personal distress are empathic responses that may result when observing someone in discomfort. Even though these empathic responses have received much attention in past research, it is still unclear which conditions contribute to their respective experience. Hence, the main goal of this study was to examine if dispositional empathic traits or rather situational variables are more likely to evoke empathic concern and personal distress and how the two empathic responses influence motor responses. We presented pictures of persons in psychological, physical, or no pain with matched descriptions of situations that promoted an other-focused state. Approach-avoidance movements were demanded by a subsequently presented tone. While psychological pain led to more empathic concern, physical pain led to higher ratings of personal distress. Linear mixed-effects modelling analysis further revealed that situational factors, such as the type of pain but also the affect experienced by the participants before the experiment predicted the two empathic responses, whereas dispositional empathic traits had no significant influence. In addition, the more intensely the empathic responses were experienced, the faster were movements initiated, presumably reflecting an effect of arousal. Overall, the present study advances our understanding of empathic responses to people in need and provides novel methodological tools to effectively manipulate and analyze empathic concern and personal distress in future research."
https://openalex.org/W2987075106,"Background In comparison to the non-pregnant state, the first trimester of pregnancy is characterized by systemic adaptation of the mother. The extent to which these adaptive processes are reflected in the maternal blood metabolome is not well characterized. Objective To determine the differences between the plasma metabolome of non-pregnant and pregnant women before 16 weeks gestation. Study design This study included plasma samples from 21 non-pregnant women and 50 women with a normal pregnancy (8–16 weeks of gestation). Combined measurements by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry generated molecular abundance measurements for each sample. Molecular species detected in at least 10 samples were included in the analysis. Differential abundance was inferred based on false discovery adjusted p-values (FDR) from Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U tests <0.1 and a minimum median abundance ratio (fold change) of 1.5. Alternatively, metabolic data were quantile normalized to remove sample-to-sample differences in the overall metabolite abundance (adjusted analysis). Results Overall, 637 small molecules met the inclusion criteria and were tested for association with pregnancy; 44% (281/637) of small molecules had significantly different abundance, of which 81% (229/281) were less abundant in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Eight percent (14/169) of the metabolites that remained significant in the adjusted analysis also changed as a function of gestational age. A pathway analysis revealed enrichment in steroid metabolites related to sex hormones, caffeine metabolites, lysolipids, dipeptides, and polypeptide bradykinin derivatives (all, FDR < 0.1). Conclusions This high-throughput mass spectrometry study identified: 1) differences between pregnant vs. non-pregnant women in the abundance of 44% of the profiled plasma metabolites, including known and novel molecules and pathways; and 2) specific metabolites that changed with gestational age."
https://openalex.org/W2988684934,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes multiple proteases that are implicated in its pathogenesis, and most of them are regulated by quorum sensing (QS). In this study, we found that the activities of three major extracellular proteases, protease IV (PIV), elastase A (LasA), and elastase B (LasB), are reduced considerably when expressed in a QS mutant (MW1). PIV and LasA expressed in MW1 exhibited little activity, even when purified, and their activities were inhibited by noncleavage or binding of their propeptides. LasB was activated by a QS-dependent factor, indicating that, unlike what has been proposed previously, LasB is not autoactivated. When LasB was relieved from inhibition, it activated PIV, which then sequentially processed pro-LasA to mature LasA. When activated, LasB was not inhibited by exogenous addition of its propeptide, but LasA and PIV were inhibited by their propeptides, even after prior activation. These differences may be explained by the fact that LasB can degrade its own propeptide but PIV and LasA cannot. We also found that, although PIV is the preferred LasA-activating factor, LasB can also partially activate LasA. Overall, LasB, PIV, and LasA were activated postsecretionally in a cascading manner in which the initial activation of LasB was controlled tightly by QS at the protein level in addition to the well-known transcriptional control of these proteases by QS. Interestingly, human elastase also activated LasA, indicating that the activation cascade is triggered by host factors during infection.

Interestingly, PIV, LasB, and LasA have a common domain organization without similarity in the amino acid sequence. They have a signal peptide (SP) at the N terminus, a propeptide (PP) domain in the middle, and a mature protease domain at the C terminus (Fig. S1). These proteases are expressed initially in their prepro-form with all three domains and processed twice from the N terminus during secretion to generate their mature forms (8.Kessler E. Safrin M.

The current model regarding the processing and activation of LasB is that, after PP-mediated folding in the periplasm, pro-LasB is cleaved by autoproteolysis and further secreted to the extracellular space via the Xcp machinery, which is a T2SS of P. aeruginosa (8.Kessler E.

Interestingly, the LasBpp released during processing has been proposed to bind to and inhibit mature LasB (13.Kessler E. Safrin M.

Although this model has greatly expanded our understanding of LasB, our new findings in this study show that this model needs to be somewhat modified. LasA was discovered originally as a second protease with elastolytic activity, but it was later characterized as a protease with high staphylolytic activity, causing rapid lysis of Staphylococcus aureus (14.Kessler E. Safrin M. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Secreted LasA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a staphylolytic protease.J. Biol.

Similar to PIV and LasB, LasA is encoded as a 45.5-kDa protease precursor by the lasA gene (Fig. S1B), and mature LasA (20 kDa) is produced by two successive cleavages from the N terminus during secretion (8.Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. Elastase and the LasA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are secreted with their propeptides.J. Biol.

Although LasB has been found to be secreted as a noncovalent complex with its PP, LasA has been detected to be exported in its incompletely processed pro-form (pro-LasA), which has been suggested to be processed by other proteases, such as LasB or a serine protease, rather than by autoprocessing (8.Kessler E.

Similar to LasB, LasA has also been suggested to be secreted extracellularly via the Xcp system (8.Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E.

A recent study elucidated the extracellular activation mechanism of PIV; PIV is inhibited by its own PP (PIVpp) and activated postsecretionally through degradation of PIVpp by LasB (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This mechanism was revealed during the process of identifying the cause of PIV inactivation in a quorum-sensing (QS) mutant (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LasB, LasA, and PIV are under transcriptional control of QS in P. aeruginosa (17.Park S.J. Kim S.K. So Y.I. Park H.Y. Li X.H. Yeom D.H. Lee M.N. Lee B.L. Lee J.H. Protease IV, a quorum sensing-dependent protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa modulates insect innate immunity.Mol.

QS is a bacterial cell-to-cell communication system that regulates a large number of genes encoding these virulence factors in a cell density–dependent manner (21.Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P. Listening in on bacteria: acyl-homoserine lactone signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 (12209128): 685-69510.1038/nrm907Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa has multiple QS systems, and acyl homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL)–based QS systems, las and rhl, trigger the entire QS regulation. LasR, QscR, and RhlR receive N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-HSL (3oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-l-HSL (C4-HSL) as the signal molecules that activate their regulon genes (21.Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P.

Regulation by QS is believed to occur at the transcription level, but a previous study reported that artificial expression of PIV under control of a non-QS promoter (arabinose-inducible promoter) failed to complement the PIV-deficient phenotype of the QS mutant. This suggests that, even when PIV is overexpressed to a sufficient level, the activity of PIV was barely detected in the QS mutant (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, PIV overexpressed in the QS mutant was processed normally, but released PIVpp released has been found to bind to and inhibit PIV, indicating that the cleaved PIVpp is degraded rapidly in the WT, whereas it is not degraded in the QS mutant (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results showed not only how PIV was activated but also that the QS mutants could be useful for studying the mechanism of protease activation because many proteases are not expressed in the QS mutant, so the proteases that should be processed proteolytically are not or incompletely processed. Indeed, this study found that, in the QS mutant, even when overexpressing LasB and LasA artificially, the activities of LasB and LasA do not appear. Therefore, this study attempted to identify how LasB, LasA, and PIV interact with each other for their activation using this QS mutant system. The mechanism of LasA activation was examined first. LasA activity is usually measured using staphylolytic activity (14.Kessler E. Safrin M. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Secreted LasA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a staphylolytic protease.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (8463280): 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Folders J. Tommassen J. van Loon L.C. Bitter W.

Tommassen J. van Loon L.C. Bitter W. Identification of a chitin-binding protein secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 (10671445): 1257-126310.1128/JB.182.5.1257-1263.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24.Park S. Galloway D.R.

To confirm that LasA is the only enzyme with significant staphylolytic activity in the WT strain (PAO1) used in this study, a lasA mutant (ΔlasA) was constructed, and staphylolytic activity was measured (Fig. S2 and Table S1). Staphylolytic activity was fully abolished in the culture supernatants of the lasA mutant (CSΔlasA), showing that LasA is the only factor for staphylolytic activity in PAO1 (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). The LasA activity in the QS mutant (MW1; lasI−, rhlI−) was also measured, and there was little LasA activity in the culture supernatants of MW1 (CSMW1), to a similar extent as that observed in culture supernatants of the lasA mutant (Fig. 1). This result might be explained by the current model because lasA expression is regulated tightly by QS at the transcription level (20.Schuster M. Lostroh C.P. Ogi T. Greenberg E.P. Identification, timing, and signal specificity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-controlled genes: a transcriptome analysis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185 (12644476): 2066-207910.1128/JB.185.7.2066-2079.2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). However, when LasA was overexpressed artificially in MW1 using pSP101, which has a QS-independent and arabinose-inducible promoter (Table S1), the LasA activity in the culture supernatants of the LasA-overexpressing MW1 (CSMW1-LasA) was still very low (Fig. 1). In the lasA mutant, however, LasA activity was restored completely by complementation with pSP101 (CSΔlasA-LasA) to WT levels (Fig. 1), confirming that pSP101 is working properly. This suggests that, like PIV, LasA also requires the QS system for activation, even after transcription. Previous studies have suggested that LasB and PIV play key roles in extracellular processing of pro-LasA in P. aeruginosa (8.Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. Elastase and the LasA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are secreted with their propeptides.J. Biol.

Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This study examined whether LasB or PIV could restore the activity of overexpressed LasA in CSMW1-LasA. When purified LasB and PIV were added to CSMW1-LasA, LasA activity was fully restored by both LasB and PIV in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). This shows that LasA activity does not appear in the QS mutant despite sufficient expression of LasA. Therefore, LasA is inactive without the QS system, even though it is transcribed independently of QS, and both LasB and PIV can activate this inactivated LasA. Both LasA and LasB have been suggested to be secreted in a two-step manner and transported through T2SS in the second step (10.Braun P. Ockhuijsen C. Eppens E. Koster M. Bitter W. Tommassen J. Maturation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase: formation of the disulfide bonds.J. Biol.

Because the expression of xcpP, the key component of the T2SS of P. aeruginosa, is QS-regulated (25.Chapon-Hervè V. Akrim M. Latifi A. Williams P. Lazdunski A. Bally M. Regulation of the xcp secretion pathway by multiple quorum-sensing modulons in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24 (9218766): 1169-117810.1046/j.1365-2958.1997.4271794.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we examined whether LasA was secreted from the QS mutant. The results showed that LasB mostly restored the activity of LasA overexpressed in MW1 in the extracellular fraction, not in the periplasmic fraction, suggesting that overexpressed LasA was normally secreted from the QS mutant (Fig. 2C). Previous studies have shown that LasA is initially secreted in the form of pro-LasA (8.Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. Elastase and the LasA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are secreted with their propeptides.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (9804780): 30225-3023110.1074/jbc.273.46.30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, PIV is secreted in the processed state, but in the QS mutant, the cleaved PIVpp is not degraded and inhibits PIV by specific binding (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine the precise processing status of LasA in the QS mutant, LasA was purified from PAO-T7 and PAO-T7-MW1 harboring a His-tagged, LasA-overexpressing plasmid (pQF21c-LasA, Table S1), called P-LasA and M-LasA, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). In the case of PIV, the PIV from PAO-T7-MW1 (M-PIV) was copurified with cleaved PIVpp in a noncovalently bound complex (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unlike PIV, most of the M-LasA was in its pro-LasA form (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that processing of LasA did not occur in the QS mutant. Therefore, purified M-LasA showed significantly lower activity than P-LasA (Fig. S3), explaining the result shown in Fig. 1. Our results showed that both LasB and PIV could activate LasA, and an attempt was made to determine which of them was the primary factor to activate LasA. Because the staphylolysis method requires long incubation time with S. aureus cells (~1.5 h), it was inappropriate to accurately compare the efficiency of LasA activation. Instead, purified pro-LasA (M-LasA) was mixed with LasB or PIV, and processing of M-LasA was monitored directly by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that PIV converted M-LasA to P-LasA (mature LasA) more quickly by cutting off and degrading LasApp than LasB (Fig. 3, A and B). During this conversion, both LasB and PIV generated the intermediate form of LasA, which has been observed by other groups (8.Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. Elastase and the LasA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are secreted with their propeptides.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (9804780): 30225-3023110.1074/jbc.273.46.30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). With PIV, the intermediate form and PP of LasA disappeared rapidly, within 3 min, quickly generating mature LasA, whereas they persisted after 10 min, and the mature LasA was generated slowly with LasB (Fig. 3C). Overall, inactivation of LasA in the QS mutant is due to incomplete processing, and PIV is a primary LasA-activating factor that preferentially processes LasA. A previous study showed that LasB activates PIV by degrading PIVpp (19.Oh J. Li X.H. Kim S.K. Lee J.H. Post-secretional activation of protease IV by quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28667333): 441610.1038/s41598-017-03733-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and this study also showed that activated PIV, in turn, activates LasA by processing pro-LasA. To confirm these results in vivo, a lasB mutant (ΔlasB) was constructed (Table S1 and Fig. S4), and the activities of LasB, PIV, and LasA in the lasB mutant were measured. The mutation on lasB could fully abolish the activities of both LasA and PIV, confirming that LasB activates both LasA and PIV (Fig. 4, A and B). In particular, more than 60% of total LasA activity was abolished in Δpiv (Fig. 4A), suggesting that PIV is more important in LasA activation and that LasB alone cannot sufficiently activate LasA. However, this result shows that LasB also contributes to LasA activation to some extent. This result is consistent with the in vitro results showing that PIV converted the pro-LasA preferentially to mature LasA (Fig. 3). The mutation on lasA did not affect PIV activity (Fig. 4B), and the mutation on piv did not affect LasB activity (Fig. 4C), suggesting that LasA is not involved in PIV activation and PIV is not involved in LasB activation. This means that three proteases are activated sequentially in the order LasB, PIV, and LasA. In addition, LasB triggers this cascade activation of PIV and LasA. Remarkably, LasB activity was reduced partly by a lasA mutation (Fig. 4C), indicating that LasA may contribute to LasB activity to some extent. This result is probably related to the previous finding that LasA can increase the activity of some elastases (26.Peters J.E. Galloway D.R. Purification and characterization of an active fragment of the LasA protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: enhancement of elastase activity.J.

That study suggested that LasA interacts with the elastin substrate rather than modifying elastase because LasA enhances the elastolytic activity of several elastases, including LasB, thermolysin, proteinase K, and human neutrophil elastase (NE) in vitro, and does not enhance the proteolytic activity of LasB (26.Peters J.E.

Excellent sensitivity and a wide working range of the sensor material are important requirements for distinguishing dynamic human motion. In this study, a highly stretchable strain sensor was fabricated via inkjet printing of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films on a stretchable polydimethylsiloxane substrate. The sensor was attached to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the hand in 12 healthy male subjects. The subjects placed their hands next to a conventional goniometer and flexed the MCP joint to predetermined angles. A linear relationship was found between the change in the length of the strain sensor and the intended angle of the MCP joint. The fabricated thin films showed high durability during repeated cycling (1,000 cycles) and good sensitivity with a gauge factor of 2.75. This study demonstrates that the newly developed stretchable CNT strain sensor can be used for effectively measuring MCP joint angles. This sensor may also be useful for the analysis of complex and dynamic hand motions that are difficult to measure using a conventional goniometer."

A SBIRT programme, adopted by the Western Cape provincial government within an alcohol harm reduction strategy, employed various implementation strategies executed by a diverse team to translate an evidence-based intervention into services at three demonstration sites before broader programme scale-up. This paper evaluates the implementation of this programme delivered by facility-based counsellors in South African emergency centres. Method Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, this mixed methods study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness and adoption of this task-shared SBIRT programme. Quantitative data were extracted from routinely collected health information. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 40 stakeholders in the programme’s second year. Results In the first year, 13 136 patients were screened and 4 847 (37%) patients met criteria for risky substance use. Of these patients, 83% received the intervention, indicating programme feasibility. The programme was adopted into routine services and found to be acceptable and appropriate, particularly by stakeholders familiar with the emergency environment. These stakeholders highlighted the burden of substance-related harm in emergency centres and favourable patient responses to SBIRT. However, some stakeholders expressed scepticism of the behaviour change approach and programme compatibility with emergency centre operations. Furthermore, adoption was both facilitated and hampered by a top-down directive from provincial leadership to implement SBIRT, while rapid implementation limited effective engagement with a diverse stakeholder group. Conclusion This is one of the first studies to address SBIRT implementation in low-resourced settings. The results show that SBIRT implementation and adoption was largely successful, and provide valuable insights that should be considered prior to implementation scale-up. Recommendations include ensuring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and early stakeholder engagement to improve implementation readiness and programme compatibility in the emergency setting."
https://openalex.org/W2987179055,"Disulfide-rich plant peptides with molecular masses of 2–6 kDa represent an expanding class of peptidyl-type natural products with diverse functions. They are structurally compact, hyperstable, and underexplored as cell-penetrating agents that inhibit intracellular functions. Here, we report the discovery of an anionic, 34-residue peptide, the disulfide-rich roseltide rT7 from Hibiscus sabdariffa (of the Malvaceae family) that penetrates cells and inhibits their proteasomal activities. Combined proteomics and NMR spectroscopy revealed that roseltide rT7 is a cystine-knotted, six-cysteine hevein-like cysteine-rich peptide. A pair-wise comparison indicated that roseltide rT7 is >100-fold more stable against protease degradation than its S-alkylated analog. Confocal microscopy studies and cell-based assays disclosed that after roseltide rT7 penetrates cells, it causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, inhibits human 20S proteasomes, reduces tumor necrosis factor-induced IκBα degradation, and decreases expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Structure-activity studies revealed that roseltide rT7 uses a canonical substrate-binding mechanism for proteasomal inhibition enabled by an IIML motif embedded in its proline-rich and exceptionally long intercysteine loop 4. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into a novel disulfide-rich, anionic, and cell-penetrating peptide, representing a potential lead for further development as a proteasomal inhibitor in anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapies. Disulfide-rich plant peptides with molecular masses of 2–6 kDa represent an expanding class of peptidyl-type natural products with diverse functions. They are structurally compact, hyperstable, and underexplored as cell-penetrating agents that inhibit intracellular functions. Here, we report the discovery of an anionic, 34-residue peptide, the disulfide-rich roseltide rT7 from Hibiscus sabdariffa (of the Malvaceae family) that penetrates cells and inhibits their proteasomal activities. Combined proteomics and NMR spectroscopy revealed that roseltide rT7 is a cystine-knotted, six-cysteine hevein-like cysteine-rich peptide. A pair-wise comparison indicated that roseltide rT7 is >100-fold more stable against protease degradation than its S-alkylated analog.

https://openalex.org/W2987638723,"Adherence to antihypertensive drugs in patients with diabetes is important. To support adherence, attention should be paid to the dynamic process of implementation, persistence and reinitiation of these drugs. We assessed non-adherence, non-persistence and reinitiation patterns for antihypertensive drugs in patients on oral diabetes drugs and identified pharmacy-based predictors of these processes.We conducted a cohort study in patients on oral diabetes drugs who initiated antihypertensive drugs between 1995-2015, as registered in the IADB.nl pharmacy database. Non-adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio < 80% and non-persistence as a gap > 180 days. We defined reinitiation as the dispensing of an antihypertensive drug within one year following discontinuation. We provide descriptive statistics for different time periods and applied logistic and Cox regressions to assess associations with sociodemographic and drug-related factors.Of 6,669 initiators, non-adherence rates in persistent patients decreased from 11.0% in the first year to 8.5% and 7.7% in the second and third years, respectively. Non-persistence rates decreased from 18.0% in the first year to 3.7% and 2.9% in the second and third years, respectively. Of the 1,201 patients who discontinued in the first year, 22.0% reinitiated treatment within one year. Non-adherence and non-persistence rates were lower in the more recent time period. Predictors of non-adherence were secondary prevention (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10-1.93) and diuretics as initial drug class (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.08-1.74). Predictors of non-persistence were female gender (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05-1.32), older age (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08-1.63) and diuretics, beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers as initial drug class. Longer duration of persistence was a predictor of reinitiation.Adherence to antihypertensive drugs in patients on oral diabetes drugs has improved over time. The first year after initiation is the most crucial with regard to non-adherence and non-persistence, and the risk groups are different for both processes. Early non-persistence is a risk factor for not reinitiating treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2983854075,"Post-operative delirium (POD) is the most common complication following major surgery in non-demented older (>65 y/o) patients. Patients experiencing POD show increased risk for future cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and, conversely, patients with cognitive decline at surgery show increased risk for POD. Here, we demonstrate that a previously established panel of AD-driven MCI (ADMCI) autoantibody (aAB) biomarkers can be used to detect prodromal AD pre-surgically in individuals admitted into the hospital for hip fracture repair (HFR) surgery. Plasma from 39 STRIDE (STRIDE: A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients) HFR patients and sera from 25 age- and sex-matched non-demented and non-surgical controls were screened using human protein microarrays to measure expression of a panel of 44 previously identified MCI aAB biomarkers. The predictive classification accuracy of the aAB biomarker panel was evaluated using Random Forest (RF). The ADMCI aAB biomarkers successfully distinguished 21 STRIDE HFR patients (CDR = 0.5) from 25 matched non-surgical controls with an overall accuracy of 91.3% (sensitivity = 95.2%; specificity = 88.0%). The ADMCI aAB panel also correctly identified six patients with preoperative CDR = 0 who later converted to CDR = 0.5 or >1 at one-year follow-up. Lastly, the majority of cognitively normal (CDR = 0) STRIDE HFR subjects that were positive for CSF AD biomarkers based on the A/T/N classification system were likewise classified as ADMCI aAB-positive using the biomarker panel. Results suggest that pre-surgical detection of ADMCI aAB biomarkers can readily identify HFR patients with likely early-stage AD pathology using pre-surgery blood samples, opening up the potential for early, blood-based AD detection and improvements in peri- and postoperative patient management."

https://openalex.org/W2989245520,"Malaria is endemic in Darién and an assessment of the different factors affecting its epidemiology is crucial for the development of adequate strategies of surveillance, prevention, and disease control. The objective of this study was to determine the main characteristics of the epidemiological behavior of malaria in the Darien region.This research was comprised of a retrospective analysis to determine the incidence and malaria distribution in the Darien region from 2015 to 2017. We evaluated malaria indicators, disease distribution, incidence (by age group and sex), diagnostic methods, treatment, and control measures. In addition, we examined the cross-border migration activity and its possible contribution to the maintenance and distribution of malaria.During the period of 2015-2017, we examined 41,141 thick blood smear samples, out of which 501 tested positive for malaria. Plasmodium vivax was responsible for 92.2% of those infections. Males comprised 62.7% of the total diagnosed cases. Meanwhile, a similar percentage, 62.7%, of the total cases were registered in economically active ages. The more frequent symptoms included fever (99.4%) and chills (97.4%), with 53.1% of cases registering between 2,000 and 6,000 parasites/μl of blood. The annual parasitic incidence (API) average was 3.0/1,000 inhabitants, while the slide positivity rate (SPR) was 1.2% and the annual blood examination rate (ABER) 22.5%. In Darién there is a constant internal and cross-border migration movement between Panama and Colombia. Malaria control measures consisted of the active and passive search of suspected cases and of the application of vector control measures.This study provides an additional perspective on malaria epidemiology in Darién. Additional efforts are required to intensify malaria surveillance and to achieve an effective control, eventually moving closer to the objective of malaria elimination. At the same time, there is a need for more eco-epidemiological, entomological and migratory studies to determine how these factors contribute to the patterns of maintenance and dissemination of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2988495413,"Although the extracellular ATP-gated cation channel purinergic receptor P2X5 is widely expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and immune and nervous systems in mammals, little is known about its functions and channel-gating activities. This lack of knowledge is due to P2X5's weak ATP responses in several mammalian species, such as humans, rats, and mice. WT human P2X5 (hP2X5Δ328-349) does not respond to ATP, whereas a full-length variant, hP2X5 (hP2X5-FL), containing exon 10 encoding the second hP2X5 transmembrane domain (TM2), does. However, although rat P2X5 (rP2X5) has a full-length TM2, ATP induces only weak currents in rP2X5, which prompted us to investigate the mechanism underlying this small ATP response. Here, we show that single replacements of specific rP2X5 residues with the corresponding residues in hP2X5 (S191F or F195H) significantly enhance the current amplitude of rP2X5. Using a combination of engineered disulfide cross-linking, single-channel recording, and molecular modeling, we interrogated the effects of S191F and F195H substitutions on the allostery of the left flipper (LF) domain. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the bound ATP-induced distinct allostery of the LF domain with that of other functional subtypes has caused the weak ATP response of rP2X5 receptors. The findings of our study provide the prerequisite for future transgenic studies on the physiological and pathological functions of P2X5 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2982988894,"Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common childhood skin diseases that can affect the quality of life (QoL) of children. The QoL of Montenegrin children with AD has not been sufficiently explored. The aim of this study was to assess their QoL with special emphasize on age differences. Methods This cross-sectional study included children with AD seen at the Clinic of Dermatology and Venereology, Clinical Center of Montenegro (CCM) in Podgorica between August 2017 and July 2018. The QoL was assessed with the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) and the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI). Disease severity was measured by the Three Item Severity (TIS) score. Results A total of 386 children with AD aged from newborn to 16 years took part in this study. The mean total score of the QoL was 14.7 in infants (0–4 years old), 19.4 in younger children (5–9 years old), and 16.6 in older children (10–16 years old). Age was in negative correlation with the CDLQI score, leisure domain of the CDLQI and CDLQI sleep, and in positive correlation with the IDQOL child mood. TIS score was in positive correlation with both the IDQOL and CDLQI score. Conclusions The QoL measured by CDLQI was more impaired in younger children, whilst IDQOL child mood was more impaired in older infants. The most impaired QoL was seen in children in the age group 5–9 years. Regardless of disease severity, treatment and counseling of children suffering from AD should be tailored specifically to their age."
https://openalex.org/W2985636184,"Objective Delirium is associated with poor outcomes among critically ill patients. However, it is not well characterized among patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (IS and HS). We provide the population-level frequency of in-hospital delirium and assess its association with in-hospital outcomes and with 30-day readmission among IS and HS patients. Methods We analyzed Nationwide in-hospital and readmission data for years 2010–2015 and identified stroke patients using ICD-9 codes. Delirium was identified using validated algorithms. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay, unfavorable discharge disposition, and 30-day readmission. We used survey design logistic regression methods to provide national estimates of proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for delirium, and odds ratios (OR) for association between delirium and poor outcomes. Results We identified 3,107,437 stroke discharges of whom 7.45% were coded to have delirium. This proportion significantly increased between 2010 (6.3%) and 2015 (8.7%) (aOR, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.03–1.05). Delirium proportion was higher among HS patients (ICH: 10.0%, SAH: 9.8%) as compared to IS patients (7.0%). Delirious stroke patients had higher in-hospital mortality (12.3% vs. 7.8%), longer in-hospital stay (11.6 days vs. 7.3 days) and a significantly greater adjusted risk of 30-day-readmission (16.7%) as compared to those without delirium (12.2%) (aRR, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.11–1.15). Upon readmission, patients with delirium at initial admission continued to have a longer length of stay (7.7 days vs. 6.6 days) and a higher in-hospital mortality (9.3% vs. 6.4%). Conclusion Delirium identified through claims data in stroke patients is independently associated with poor in-hospital outcomes both at index admission and readmission. Identification and management of delirium among stroke patients provides an opportunity to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2986616908,"Therapeutic mAbs are used to manage a wide range of cancers and autoimmune disorders. However, mAb-based treatments are not always successful, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the factors influencing mAb efficacy. Increased levels of oxidative stress associated with several diseases are counteracted by the activities of various oxidoreductase enzymes, such as thioredoxin (Trx), which also reduces allosteric disulfide bonds in proteins, including mAbs. Here, using an array of in vitro assays, we explored the functional effects of Trx-mediated reduction on the mechanisms of action of six therapeutic mAbs. We found that Trx reduces the interchain disulfide bonds of the mAbs, after which they remain intact but have altered function. In general, this reduction increased antigen-binding capacity, resulting in, for example, enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) neutralization by two anti-TNF mAbs. Conversely, Trx reduction decreased the antiproliferative activity of an anti-tyrosine kinase-type cell-surface receptor HER2 mAb. In all of the mAbs, Fc receptor binding was abrogated by Trx activity, with significant loss in both complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of the mAbs tested. We also confirmed that without alkylation, Trx-reduced interchain disulfide bonds reoxidize, and ADCC activity is restored. In summary, Trx-mediated reduction has a substantial impact on the functional effects of an mAb, including variable effects on antigen binding and Fc function, with the potential to significantly impact mAb efficacy in vivo.

Two of the pol I subunits, yeast RPA34.5 and RPA49, form a heterodimer with still poorly-defined roles in rDNA transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2983430850,"Patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) are often diagnosed with spread tumour disease and the development of better systemic treatment options for these patients is important. Treatment with the radiolabelled somatostatin analogue 177Lu-octreotate is already a promising option but can be optimised. For example, combination treatment with another substance could increase the effect on tumour tissue. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that has been shown to sensitise tumour cells to radiation. The aim of this study was to investigate potentially additive or synergistic effects of combining radiation with gemcitabine for treatment of MTC. Nude mice transplanted with patient-derived MTC tumours (GOT2) were divided into groups and treated with radiation and/or gemcitabine. Radiation treatment was given as 177Lu-octreotate or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The volume of treated and untreated tumours was followed. The absorbed dose and amount of gemcitabine were chosen to give moderate tumour volume reduction when given as monotherapy to enable detection of increased effects from combination treatment. After follow-up, the mice were killed and tumours were immunohistochemically (IHC) analysed. Overall, the animals that received a combination of EBRT and gemcitabine showed the largest reduction in tumour volume. Monotherapy with EBRT or gemcitabine also resulted in a clear detrimental effect on tumour volume, while the animals that received 177Lu-octreotate monotherapy showed similar response as the untreated animals. The GOT2 tumour was confirmed in the IHC analyses by markers for MTC. The IHC analyses also revealed that the proliferative activity of tumour cells was similar in all tumours, but indicated that fibrotic tissue was more common after EBRT and/or gemcitabine treatment. The results indicate that an additive, or even synergistic, effect may be achieved by combining radiation with gemcitabine for treatment of MTC. Future studies should be performed to evaluate the full potential of combining 177Lu-octreotate with gemcitabine in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2984507973,"Cancer is one of the leading cause of death, worldwide. Many believe that genomic data will enable us to better predict the survival time of these patients, which will lead to better, more personalized treatment options and patient care. As standard survival prediction models have a hard time coping with the high-dimensionality of such gene expression data, many projects use some dimensionality reduction techniques to overcome this hurdle. We introduce a novel methodology, inspired by topic modeling from the natural language domain, to derive expressive features from the high-dimensional gene expression data. There, a document is represented as a mixture over a relatively small number of topics, where each topic corresponds to a distribution over the words; here, to accommodate the heterogeneity of a patient’s cancer, we represent each patient (≈ document) as a mixture over cancer-topics, where each cancer-topic is a mixture over gene expression values (≈ words). This required some extensions to the standard LDA model—e.g., to accommodate the real-valued expression values—leading to our novel discretized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (dLDA) procedure. After using this dLDA to learn these cancer-topics, we can then express each patient as a distribution over a small number of cancer-topics, then use this low-dimensional “distribution vector” as input to a learning algorithm—here, we ran the recent survival prediction algorithm, MTLR, on this representation of the cancer dataset. We initially focus on the METABRIC dataset, which describes each of n = 1,981 breast cancer patients using the r = 49,576 gene expression values, from microarrays. Our results show that our approach (dLDA followed by MTLR) provides survival estimates that are more accurate than standard models, in terms of the standard Concordance measure. We then validate this “dLDA+MTLR” approach by running it on the n = 883 Pan-kidney (KIPAN) dataset, over r = 15,529 gene expression values—here using the mRNAseq modality—and find that it again achieves excellent results. In both cases, we also show that the resulting model is calibrated, using the recent “D-calibrated” measure. These successes, in two different cancer types and expression modalities, demonstrates the generality, and the effectiveness, of this approach.

This experiment strongly indicates that the largest metacentric chromosome in the karyotype with n = 5 originated from a particular fusion between the only acrocentric and a smaller metacentric chromosome of the set with n = 6, therefore confirming our previous hypothesis based on the karyotypic analysis using chromosome morphometrics. This study represents the first successful application of both microdissection and whole chromosome painting for the reconstruction of karyotypic rearrangements in closely related species of parasitoids, as well as in the order Hymenoptera in general."
https://openalex.org/W2985141703,"We investigated the presence of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) compared to control subjects without NAION to identify the association between NAION and cerebral SVD. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 63 patients with NAION and 2749 control subjects without any neurologic and ocular diseases including NAION who underwent careful medical interviews, ophthalmic examinations, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain. We assessed and compared the degree of cerebral SVD on the MRIs. The patients with NAION presented with cerebral SVD more frequently than controls (68% versus 37%, respectively, p<0.001), which was also observed after adjusting for age, sex, comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and smoking using the standardized mortality ratio (68% vs. 37%, p<0.001). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of cerebral SVD were 4.86 (95% CI, 2.10 to 11.24, p<0.001) times higher in patients with NAION than in the controls. We found that there was an association between cerebral SVD and NAION even after adjusting for age, sex, and medical histories. Clinicians should consider brain MRI scans in patients with NAION to prevent neurological impairment after cerebral SVD."
https://openalex.org/W2989076188,"Ubiquitin-like proteins play important roles in the regulation of many biological processes. UBL5 (Ubiquitin-like protein 5)/Hub1 (Homologous to ubiquitin 1), a member of the ubiquitin family, acts as a ubiquitin-like modifier on a specific target, the spliceosomal protein Snu66, in yeast and human cells. The 22nd aspartic acid (Asp22) is involved in the attachment of Hub1 to the Hub1 interaction domain (HIND) of Snu66 in yeast to modulate spliceosomal activity. Hub1 differs from other modifiers which interact covalently with their targets. It modulates pre-mRNA splicing by binding to Snu66 non-covalently in both yeast and human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of Hub1-mediated pre-mRNA splicing in plant systems remains unclear. To better understand the function of Hub1 in plants, we examined the role of this ubiquitin-like modifier in Arabidopsis thaliana, which has two Hub1 homologues. Arabidopsis UBL5/Hub1(UBL5) is highly conserved at the amino acid level, compared to eukaryotic homologues in both plants and animals. In this study, phenotypic analysis of A. thaliana with reduced UBL5 gene expression, generated by RNA interference of AtUBL5a and AtUBL5b were performed. Interestingly, knock down plants of AtUBL5 showed abnormalities in root elongation, plant development, and auxin response. AtUBL5b is highly expressed in the vascular tissue of the leaf, stem, and root tissue. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that AtUBL5a and AtUBL5b interact with the putative splicing factor AtPRP38 through its C-terminal domain (AtPRP38C). Knock down of AtUBL5b resulted in a pattern of insufficient pre-mRNA splicing in several introns of AtCDC2, and in introns of IAA1, IAA4, and IAA5. Defects of pre-mRNA splicing in an AtPRP38 mutant resulted in an insufficient pre-mRNA splicing pattern in the intron of IAA1. Based on these results, we showed that AtUBL5b positively regulates plant root elongation and development through pre-mRNA splicing with AtPRP38C in A. thaliana."
https://openalex.org/W2987156745,"Deficits in cognitive control have been found in depression, but how they contribute to depressive symptoms remains unknown. The present study investigated whether the regulatory efficacy of cognitive control on negative emotion varies with depression level and whether the regulatory efficacy affects depressive symptoms via the mediation of rumination. Fifty participants screened by the Zung Self-Rating Depressive Scale (SDS) with high and low depression levels were selected. They were instructed to controlled-process different semantic representations of aversive pictures, and the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) evoked by the pictures was used as the measure of electrocortical response. We found that controlled-processing neutral representations of aversive pictures significantly decreased the amplitude of LPP relative to that under controlled-processing unpleasant ones in an early window in the low depression group and that this regulatory effect was impaired in the high depression group. Furthermore, a mediation analyses indicated that the regulatory efficacy of controlled-processing different semantic representations was associated with SDS score via the mediation of rumination. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the association between the function of cognitive control in emotion generation and depressive symptoms and indicated a pathway from the regulatory efficacy of cognitive control to depression via rumination."
https://openalex.org/W2987161929,"Many studies have reported that housing tenure (HT) is associated with health, but little is known about its association in Japan. We investigated the cross-sectional association between HT and self-rated health (SRH) among Japanese adults, taking demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status (SES) into consideration.We used data from a nationally representative survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (28,641 men and 31,143 women aged ≥20 years). HT was divided into five categories: owner-occupied, privately rented, provided housing, publically subsidized, and rented rooms. SRH was evaluated using a single-item inventory and dichotomized into poor (very poor/poor) and good (very good/good/fair). We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for poor SRH with logistic regression models. Covariates included demographic factors (i.e., age, gender, marital status, family size, smoking status, and chronic medical conditions) and SES factors (i.e., education, equivalent household expenditures, and occupation).Among analyzed participants, 75.9% were owner-occupiers and 14.6% reported poor SRH. After adjustment for all covariates, compared with owner-occupiers, private renters (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.26-1.47), publically subsidized renters (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.19-1.48), and residents in rented rooms (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.22-1.62) were more likely to report poor SRH. Stratified analyses by SES factors showed that the association between HT and poor SRH was stronger in the socially disadvantaged than in the higher socioeconomic group.Our results show a significant association between HT and SRH, independent of socio-demographic factors. HT may deserve greater attention as an indicator of socioeconomic position in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2986046359,"To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combined treatment (image guided thrombectomy and endovascular therapy with open femoral access) for acute lower limb ischemia.From 2009 to 2017, 52 patients (44 men, eight women, mean 67.2 years) underwent combined treatment for acute thrombotic occlusion of lower extremity arteries. The patients presented with acute limb ischemia and we selectively perform combined treatment in the cases with challenging clinical considerations (e.g. various spectrum of thrombus, underlying atherosclerotic lesions). Combined treatment included cutdown of common femoral artery, thrombectomy using a Fogarty balloon catheter, balloon angioplasty, stenting, and catheter-introduced thrombus fragmentation and aspiration. Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed and follow-up data were collected. The technical and clinical success rates and limb salvage were assessed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze primary patency rates and overall survival rates. Univariate analyses were performed to determine the factors related to clinical outcomes.Technical and clinical success rate was 90.4% and 80.8%, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 26.5 ± 25.8 months. Primary patency was 91.4%, 86.1%, and 74.6% at six months, 1-, and 2-year, respectively. Limb salvage without amputation was 88.5% (46/52). The overall survival rates at six months, 1-, and 3-year were 82.6%, 80.2, and 56.9%, respectively. The 30-day mortality was 5.8% (3/52). Univariate analysis showed that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) type (balloon versus stent) was related to clinical failure.Combined treatment can be effective and safe for ALI patients even under challenging clinical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2988523129,"Background Macaque models of simian or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SIV or SHIV) infection are critical for the evaluation of antiretroviral (ARV)-based HIV treatment and prevention strategies. However, modelling human oral ARV administration is logistically challenging and fraught by limited adherence. Here, we developed a protocol for administering daily oral doses of ARVs to macaques with a high rate of compliance. Methods Parameters of positive reinforcement training (PRT), behavioral responses and optimal drug delivery foods were defined in 7 male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Animals were trained to sit in a specified cage location prior to receiving ARVs, emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), in a blended food mixture, which was followed immediately with a juice chaser. Consistency of daily oral adherence was evaluated in 4 trained macaques receiving clinically equivalent doses of FTC and TAF (20 and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively) in a short-term (1 month) and an extended (6 month) trial. Adherence was monitored using medication diaries and by quantifying intracellular FTC-triphosphate (FTC-TP) and tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). Results Trained macaques quickly and consistently took daily oral ARVs for 1 month with an average 99.8% observed adherence. Intracellular concentrations of TFV-DP (median = 845.8 fmol/million cells [range, 620.8–1031.3]) and FTC-TP (median = 367.0 fmol/million cells [range, 289.5–413.5) in PBMCs were consistent with high adherence. Extended treatment with select subjects yielded similar observations for three months (99.5% adherence, 352/356 complete doses taken), although a sudden drop in adherence was observed after splenic biopsy surgery. Conclusions We demonstrate that trained macaques reliably adhere to a daily oral ARV regimen, although unexpected adherence issues are possible. Our approach, using clinical doses of oral FTC and TAF daily, further refines macaque models of HIV treatment and prevention by mimicking the human route and timing of ARV administration."
https://openalex.org/W2985731010,"We performed a series of bioinformatics analysis on a set of important gene expression data with 76 samples in early stage of non-small cell lung cancer, including 40 adenocarcinoma samples, 16 squamous cell carcinoma samples and 20 normal samples. In order to identify the specific markers for diagnosis, we compared the two subtypes with the normal samples respectively to determine the gene expression characteristics. Through the multi-dimensional scaling classification, we found that the samples were clustered well according to the disease cases. Based on the classification results and using empirical Bayes moderation and treat method, 486 important genes associated with the disease were identified. We constructed gene functions and gene pathways to verify our result and explain the pathogenicity factor and process. We generated a protein-protein interaction network based on the mutual interaction between the selected genes and found that the top thirteen hub genes were highly associated with lung cancer or some other cancers including five newly found genes through our method. The results of this study indicated that contrast on the gene expression between different subtypes and normal samples provides important information for the detection of non-small cell lung cancer and helps exploration of the disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2987361629,"Adequate iodine status of women of childbearing age is essential for optimal growth and development of their offspring. The objectives of the current study were to assess the iodine status of non-pregnant women, availability and use of commercial salt, extent to which it is iodised, and availability of other industrially processed foods suitable for fortification with iodine. This prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in 2018 in a remote area in Gulf province, Papua New Guinea. Multistage cluster sampling was used to randomly select 300 women visiting local markets. Of these, 284 met study criteria of being non-pregnant and non-lactating. Single urine samples were collected from each of them. Discretionary salt intake was assessed; salt samples were collected from a sub-sample of randomly selected households. A semi-structured, pre-tested questionnaire to assess use and availability of commercial salt and other processed foods was modified and used. Salt was available on the interview day in 51.6% of households. Mean iodine content in household salt samples was 37.8 ± 11.8 ppm. Iodine content was below 30.0 ppm in 13.1% and below 15.0 ppm in 3.3% of salt samples. Mean iodine content of salt available at markets was 39.6 ± 0.52 ppm. Mean discretionary intake of salt per capita per day was 3.9 ± 1.21 g. Median UIC was 34.0 μg/L (95% CI, 30.0-38.0 ppm), indicating moderate iodine deficiency. For women with salt in the household, median UIC was 39.5 μg/L (95% CI, 32.0-47.0 μg/L), compared to median UIC of 29.0 μg/L (95% CI, 28.0-32.0 μg/L) for those without salt. This community has low consumption of iodised salt, likely due to limited access. Investigation of other industrially processed foods indicated salt is the most widely consumed processed food in this remote community, although 39.8% of households did use salty flavourings."
https://openalex.org/W2986523800,"I arrived home from work, my mind racing. I was scheduled to perform an experiment using a pricey piece of equipment—one that I'd be unlikely to gain much access to again during my Ph.D.—and I needed it to go flawlessly. “Will the x-rays transmit correctly?” I wondered. “What's my backup plan if things go wrong?” I had spent the whole day fretting about the experiment, and I wanted to shut off my anxious thoughts. So after dinner, I made a cup of hot chocolate, curled up on my sofa, and cracked open a novel I'd been reading. Almost immediately, my mind left behind the details of experimental design and parachuted into a land of daemons, magic dust, and armored bears. It was exactly what I needed.

> “When I'm engrossed in a good book, I can temporarily switch off and explore a different world.” 

Growing up, I was a voracious reader but never a big fan of novels. My classmates would rave about the latest Harry Potter book, while my copy sat collecting dust on a shelf. I saw those kinds of books as a waste of time. “Why read a made-up story when I could read a book that actually teaches me something?” I reasoned.

As an undergraduate, keen to learn something at every opportunity, I would reject typical holiday reads in favor of educational books. On a trip to Portugal, my friends took turns reading a Dan Brown mystery novel. Meanwhile, I couldn't put down a Malcolm Gladwell book that took a deep dive into social science research.

After I started graduate school, though, that approach to extracurricular reading didn't work for me anymore. I spent my time on campus digesting research papers and textbooks—trying to become an expert in my field—and my mind couldn't handle processing fact-filled nonfiction books at home, too. I knew that I needed to find a way to enjoy reading again.

My partner had a bookcase full of novels, so I figured, “Why not try fiction?” To help me stick with it, I made a New Year's resolution: I would read two fiction books per month for the entire year. The result was an almost instantaneous appreciation of fiction, along with many unintended consequences—including ones that have benefited my work.

What surprised me the most was how much I learned. Some of the best books I read were historical fiction—fictional stories that take place in a realistic historical setting. I learned about life in Afghanistan and Ghana, as well as struggles people there faced during difficult periods in those countries' histories. The books have helped me build empathy and understanding, with an unexpected side benefit: I've started to think more deeply about inclusion and diversity issues in the scientific community.

My foray into fiction also introduced me to new writing styles. The no-frills prose that's typical of journal articles doesn't always make for compelling reading. Scientific authors, it seems, often assume that interest in the science will be enough to hold the reader's attention. Fiction authors don't have that luxury, so they work hard to build intrigue and draw out a compelling story arc—concepts that I've begun to implement when presenting my science in written form and in talks. I now aim to keep my readers and audience members engaged by laying out a dynamic story, taking care to clearly describe the context of my research and to eliminate potentially confusing details.

Beyond those benefits, I've discovered that reading fiction is good for my mental health. Life as a grad student is taxing, and it's often difficult to distance yourself from work, with the day's worries stealthily following you home. But when I'm engrossed in a good book, I can temporarily switch off and explore a different world. It's an excellent way to gain distance from stress so that I can rejuvenate myself and regain energy for my work.

So, if you haven't done so already, give fiction a try. You'll be surprised how much it brings to your life.
