https://openalex.org/W2088768972,"Despite the very active deforestation of the last decade, the Amazon Basin is still primarily covered with trees and is a system in equilibrium. The Andes form a barrier at the western end of the basin and, coupled with the prevailing easterly winds, ensure an almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime. On average 50 percent of the precipitation is recycled, and in some areas even more. The soils are poor. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus is found in the soil, and the remaining nutrient elements are found in the standing biomass. There is some nutrient recycling and little loss from the intact ecosystem, and the small input of nutrients from precipitation maintains a small positive nutrient balance. Continued large-scale deforestation is likely to lead to increased erosion and water runoff with initial flooding in the lower Amazon, together with reduced evapotranspiration and ultimately reduced precipitation. Reduced precipitation in the Amazon could increase the tendency toward continentality and adversely affect climate and the present agriculture in south-central Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W1971822376,"The average concentrations of potassium, rubidium, strontium, thorium, and uranium in oceanic tholeiitic basalt are (in parts per million) K, 1400; Rb, 1.2; Sr, 120; Th, 0.2; and U, 0.1. The ratio Sr(87) to Sr(86) is about 0.702, that of K to U is 1.4 x 10(4), and of Th to U is 1.8. These amounts of K, Th, U, and radiogenic Sr(87) are less than in other common igneous rocks. The ratios of Th to U and Sr(87) to Sr(86) suggest that the source region of the oceanic tholeiites was differentiated from the original mantle material some time in the geologic past."
https://openalex.org/W2010759696,"Single cells isolated from pith callus of fresh stem of hybrid tobacco (Nicotiana glutinosa male symbol x N. tabacum female symbol) gave rise to small colonies of cells in microcultures which upon transfer to agar medium produced clones of callus tissue. These single-cell clones differentiated roots, and shoots with green leaves, on a completely defined nutrient medium. The rooted shoots developed into normal plants after transfer to soil in pots in the greenhouse. Buds and flowers were produced by these plants."

The disjected drops, falling away from the smaller drops, separate free charge to establish electric fields as large as those observed in thunderstorms."

https://openalex.org/W1967410248,"A radio map of the Andromeda galaxy, M 31, made with the 400-foot (122 m) radio telescope at the University of Illinois has been extended northward to cover the full optical extent of the galaxy. Several condensations of radio emission appear along the major axis of the galaxy, and other radio features are resolved."
