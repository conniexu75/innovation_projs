https://openalex.org/W2028248159,"Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules with peptides occurs in a series of endocytic vacuoles, termed MHC class II-enriched compartments (MIICs). Morphological criteria have defined several types of MIICs, including multivesicular MIICs, which are composed of 50–60-nm vesicles surrounded by a limiting membrane. Multivesicular MIICs can fuse with the plasma membrane, thereby releasing their internal vesicles into the extracellular space. The externalized vesicles, termed exosomes, carry MHC class II and can stimulate T-cells in vitro. In this study, we show that exosomes are enriched in the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 and in several tetraspan proteins, including CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, and CD82. Interestingly, subcellular localization of these molecules revealed that they were concentrated on the internal membranes of multivesicular MIICs. In contrast to the tetraspans, other membrane proteins of MIICs, such as HLA-DM, Lamp-1, and Lamp-2, were mainly localized to the limiting membrane and were hardly detectable on the internal membranes of MIICs nor on exosomes. Because internal vesicles of multivesicular MIICs are thought to originate from inward budding of the limiting membrane, the differential distribution of membrane proteins on the internal and limiting membranes of MIICs has to be driven by active protein sorting.

The αβIi complexes are transported to the trans-Golgi network, from which they are diverged from the secretory pathway and targeted to the endocytic pathway (Refs. 6Bakke O. Dobberstein B.

Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) studies revealed that in a variety of antigen-presenting cells, the majority of intracellular MHC class II molecules localize to a heterogeneous set of endocytic compartments, collectively termed MIICs (MHC class II-enriched compartments) (Refs.13Neefjes J.J.

MIICs are endocytic vacuoles with internal membrane vesicles and sheets, reminiscent of late endosomes and lysosomes in non-antigen-presenting cells (17Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The internal vesicles of MIICs probably originate from inward vesiculation of its limiting membrane (18Riberdy J.M. Avva R.R. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1225-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), analogous to the formation of multivesicular bodies in other cell types (19Van Deurs B. Holm P.K. Kayser L. Sandvig K. Hansen S.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 208-224PubMed Google Scholar). MIICs are thought to represent the subcellular site at which MHC class II molecules bind peptides (20Harding C.V. Geuze H.J. J.

Once formed in MIICs, the αβ-peptide complexes are transported to the plasma membrane via largely unidentified pathways. In macrophages, putative transport vesicles, containing peptide-loaded MHC class II molecules, have been described by IEM (24Harding C.V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As an alternative pathway, we and others have shown that multivesicular MIICs can fuse with the plasma membrane directly, thereby inserting MHC class II molecules from the limiting membrane of MIICs into the plasma membrane and releasing the internal vesicles into the cell culture medium (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 26Wubbolts R. Fernandez-Borja M.

The released vesicles were termed exosomes (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), analogous to those released by reticulocytes (27Johnstone R.M. Biochem.

Physiol. 1991; 147: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and those originating from cytolytic granules released by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (29Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Van der Donk H.A.

Tschopp J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Exocytic profiles containing exosomes have also been found on the cell surface of other antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, tonsil B-cells, monocytes, and macrophages. 2M. J. Kleijmeer and H. J. Geuze, unpublished data. Exosomes secreted by B-cell lines are capable of effective antigen presentation to T-cells in vitro (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Except for their relative enrichment in MHC class II and depletion of transferrin receptor (TfR), a marker for plasma membrane and early endosomes, little is known about the protein composition of exosomes. Because interaction of MHC class II-peptide complexes with the T-cell receptor requires appropriate co-stimulatory signals, we anticipated that exosomes might express co-stimulatory molecules at their surface. The main co-stimulatory pathways involve the interaction of CD28 or CTLA-4 on T-cells with CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) expressed on B-cells and other antigen-presenting cells. Here we report that the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 is strongly enriched on internal vesicles of MIICs and on exosomes. Previous IEM studies have shown that the internal vesicles of MIICs also contain the lysosomal membrane protein CD63 (14Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 769-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a member of the tetraspan superfamily. In the present study, we show that several other members of this family, including CD37, CD53, CD81, and CD82, are enriched in exosomes, whereas other MIIC markers, such as Lamp-1, Lamp-2, HLA-DM, and Ii, are not. Tetraspan proteins have shown to be involved in antigen presentation, T-cell signaling, T-cell activation, motility, and adhesion. Also, they are able to form oligomeric complexes (32Angelisova P.

The EBV-transformed human B-cell line RN (HLA-DR15+) was maintained as described earlier (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp.

Rothlein R. Bormannn B.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar) was from Dr. P. L. Reilly (Boehringer Mannheim). Monoclonal antibody 5C1 (HLA-DM) (42Sanderson F. Thomas C. Neefjes J.J. Trowsdale J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. J. Trowsdale (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). Monoclonal antibodies M38 (IgG1; CD81) and C33 (IgG2a; CD82) have been described previously (37Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6470-6481PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fukudome K. Furuse M. Imai T.

Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2879-2886PubMed Google Scholar). The following monoclonal antibodies were purchased: BU63 (IgG1; CD86) from Ancell Europe (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), CLB-gran1/2, 435 (IgG1; CD63), and MEM-53 (IgG1; CD53) from CLB (Amsterdam, The Netherlands); CR3/43 (IgG1; HLA-DP, -DQ, -DR) from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark); H4A3 (IgG1; CD107a) and H4B4 (IgG1; CD107b) from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); S-B3 (IgG1; CD37) from Sanofi (Montpellier, France). Polyclonal anti-IgG antibody was supplied by DAKO. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation as described previously (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Briefly, RN cells were washed by centrifugation and recultured in fresh medium for 18 h. Cell cultures (35 ml) containing about 5 × 107 cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 ×g (pellet P1). The supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g (pellet P2). This was repeated once (the pooled pellets are referred to as P2). Supernatants were sequentially centrifuged at 2,000 × g twice for 15 min (the pooled pellets are referred to as P3), once at 10,000 ×g for 30 min (yielding pellet P4) and once at 70,000 × g for 60 min (yielding pellet P5), using a SW27 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). P1 contained the cells, whereas P5 was enriched in exosomes. P1–P5were directly solubilized in reducing or nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples of each pellet were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting (see below). For further purification of exosomes, P5 was resuspended in 5 ml of 2.6 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2. A linear sucrose gradient (2.0–0.25m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2) was layered on the top of the exosome suspension in a SW27 tube (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 100,000 × g, after which, 2-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. To collect membranes from these fractions, they were diluted with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 60 min at 200,000 × g using a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). The pellets were solubilized in nonreducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer at room temperature for 60 min. Samples of each fraction were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (see below). Proteins were separated on 12.5, 10, or 7.5% acrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then blocked for 90 min in PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Protivar, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 and then reacted for 90 min with primary antibodies followed by labeling with 0.1 μg/ml 125I-labeled protein G (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 90 min. 125I Label was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For detection of monoclonal antibodies, a polyclonal anti-IgG antibody was used as secondary antibody followed by incubation with125I-labeled protein G. RN cells were prepared for ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold labeling as described previously (45Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Van der Ley P.A. Scheffer R.C.T. J.

For immunoelectron microscopic analysis of exosomes, they were purified on sucrose density gradients (see above). Membrane pellets from relevant fractions were resuspended in PBS, pooled in a SW27 tube, and recentrifuged for 60 min at 70,000 ×g. The final pellet was then resuspended in PBS/0.02% sodium azide. Droplets of this preparation were directly placed on Formvar carbon-coated grids. Adsorbed membranes were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, immunolabeled and stained as above. To investigate the presence of specific proteins, exosomes of RN B-cells were collected from the culture media by sequential differential centrifugations, yielding five pellets (P1–P5), of which P1 contained the cells and P5 was highly enriched in exosomes (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). The pellets were lysed, and equal volume samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either reducing or nonreducing conditions followed by Western blotting. P1–P5 were analyzed for the presence of MHC class II, HLA-DM, and Ii as molecules directly involved in the formation of MHC class II-peptide complexes. The pellets were also analyzed for the presence of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54), the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, and the tetraspans CD37, CD63, CD81, and CD82. The relative amount of each protein recovered from P1and P5 was determined, and the ratio P5/P1 was calculated. In order to determine the relative enrichment of proteins in exosomes, their P5/P1 ratio was divided by the P5/P1 value obtained for TfR. TfR, a marker of plasma membrane and early endosomes, served as a reference protein because of its low abundance in exosomes (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) and MIICs (17Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J.

Indeed, exosome preparations contained little TfR (Fig.1 A), excluding major contamination of the exosome preparations by shed plasma membrane. Consistent with previous observations (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), MHC class II was enriched 8-fold over TfR in exosome preparations compared with whole cells (Fig.1 A; Table I). Similarly, the relative enrichment of CD86 over TfR was 9-fold (Fig. 1 A; Table I). Interestingly, exosomes were highly enriched for all tetraspan proteins tested (Fig. 1 B; Table I). Of these, CD37 (36-fold), CD81 (124-fold), and CD82 (41-fold) were present most prominently (Table I). Western blotting could not test the presence of CD53, another tetraspan protein expressed in leukocytes, because the available anti-CD53 antibodies were not suitable for that purpose. However, CD53 was clearly present on vesicles within MIICs by IEM (see below and Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the tetraspans, other membrane proteins found in MIICs, HLA-DM, Ii, Lamp-1, and Lamp-2 were not enriched in exosomes (Fig. 1; Table I). The presence of adhesion molecules was also analyzed. ICAM-1 (CD54) was detected in exosomes with a 4-fold enrichment over TfR (Fig. 1 A and Table I). ICAM-1 was also detected on exosomes by IEM (data not shown). LFA-3 (CD58) and ICAM-2 (CD102) were not significantly enriched in exosomes (data not shown). Altogether, these results show that exosomes are selectively and highly enriched in tetraspan proteins.Table IRelative enrichment of proteins over TfR in exosomesProteinP5/P1Enrichment over TfRFoldTetraspan proteinsCD373 ± 0 (6)36 ± 4CD630.6 ± 0.1 (8)7 ± 2CD8110 ± 0 (6)124 ± 10CD823.3 ± 0.2 (6)41 ± 7Molecules involved in antigen presentationMHC class II0.7 ± 0.1 (10)8 ± 2HLA-DM0.2 ± 0.1 (6)2 ± 1Ii0.02 ± 0.01 (6)0.2 ± 0.1Adhesion moleculeICAM-10.3 ± 0.1 (7)4 ± 2Costimulatory moleculeCD86 (B7.2)10 ± 2 (6)10 ± 2Lysosomal markersLamp-10.07 ± 0.04 (6)0.8 ± 0.6Lamp-20.04 ± 0.01 (6)0.5 ± 0.2Early endocytic proteinTfR0.08 ± 0.01 (10)P1 (cells) and P5 (fraction enriched in exosomes) pellets were analyzed as in Fig. 1.

The signals from P1 and P5 were quantitated with a PhosphorImager, and for each protein, the average ratio P5/P1 ± S.D. is shown in the third column. Averages are presented with number of determinations in parentheses. The relative enrichment of each protein over TfR was then determined by calculating the ratio of signals P5/P1 and normalizing these values to obtain a value of 1 for the TfR. In a previous study (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), MHC class II-positive exosomes displayed an equilibrium buoyant density of 1.10–1.18 g/ml with a peak at 1.13 g/ml on linear sucrose gradients. To confirm that tetraspan proteins and MHC class II localize to membranes with the same characteristics, exosomes isolated from the culture medium by differential centrifugation were floated into a linear sucrose gradient. The distribution of MHC class II, CD81, and CD82 in the gradient was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.2 A). The distributions of MHC class II, CD81, and CD82 were completely overlapping (Fig.2 B), providing further evidence that CD81 and CD82 are associated with MHC class II-positive exosomes. This conclusion was further strengthened by whole-mount IEM analysis of membranes equilibrating at 1.10–1.18 g/ml (Fig. 2, C andD). All tetraspan proteins were found to colocalize with MHC class II on these membranes, as illustrated for CD82 (Fig.2 C) and CD53 (Fig. 2 D). Because exosomes derive from MIICs, we next studied the subcellular localization of the various tetraspan proteins by IEM on ultrathin cryosections of RN cells. CD82 revealed the highest intracellular labeling and was present in both multivesicular and multilaminar MIICs but most abundantly in the latter (Fig.3 A). CD37 (not shown) and CD53 (Fig. 3 B) localized primarily to multivesicular MIICs, whereas CD63 was found in both multivesicular and multilaminar MIICs (Fig. 4 A). CD81 was strongly enriched in exosomes (Fig. 4 B) but could be found in only a few MIICs. A possible explanation is that the relevant antibody detected intracellular CD81 molecules inefficiently due to epitope masking. Interestingly, all tetraspan proteins were largely confined to the internal membranes of the MIICs. In contrast, other lysosomal proteins, such as Lamp-1 and –2, were located mainly to the limiting membrane of MIICs. Fig. 4 A illustrates the distinct distributions of CD63 and Lamp-2 on these membrane domains of MIICs. Exosomes within exocytic profiles were strongly labeled for the tetraspan proteins CD63, CD81, and CD37 (Fig. 4, A, B, andC, respectively), as well as for CD53 and CD82 (not shown). Differential distributions on internal and limiting membranes were further evaluated by quantifying MHC class II, CD63, CD82, and Lamp-1 labeling on membranes of MIICs. The numbers of gold particles for each protein found over internal and limiting membranes 50 multivesicular and multilaminar MIICs are given in the first four columns of TableII, and the ratios of gold labeling are presented in the last two columns. Both types of values showed a clear enrichment of CD63 and CD82 on internal membranes, which was most prominent in the multilaminar MIICs. In contrast, Lamp-1 was enriched on the limiting membranes, which is in agreement with their low abundance on exosomes. MHC class II labeling of the internal MIIC membranes is the highest of the four proteins measured. Only in the multilaminar MIICs is MHC class II enriched on the internal as compared with the limiting membrane. Thus, the IEM observations are consistent with the biochemical data on isolated exosomes, and they suggest differential protein sorting in MIICs during the formation of internal membranes.Table IIRatios of gold particles counted on limiting (l) and internal (i) membranes of multivesicular (MV) and multilaminar (ML) MIICsTotal gold numbersi/l ratio membrane lengthMVMLililMVMLMHC class II215258393920.63.2Lamp-149841092130.50.1CD63133626441511.61.7CD821916712021102.14.8Immunogold particles for the four proteins listed were counted on 50 multivesicular and 50 multilaminar MIICs on internal and limiting membranes.

In this study, we show that MHC class II, the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, and several tetraspan proteins are enriched on isolated exosomes (Fig. 1; Table I). MHC class II and CD86 were enriched 8–9-fold over TfR (Table I). Similar to MHC class II and CD86, the tetraspan CD63, which is known to be present in MIICs (14Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 49Nijman H.W. Kleijmeer M.J. Ossevoort M.A. Oorschot V.M.J. Vierboom M.P.M. Van de Keur M. Kenemans P. Kast W.M. Geuze H.J. Melief C.J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), was enriched 7-fold in exosomes. Other tetraspan proteins, CD37, CD81, and CD82, were even more abundant in exosomes, with relative enrichment factors of 36, 124, and 41, respectively (Table I). The presence of tetraspan proteins on exosomes was confirmed by IEM on whole-mount preparations of exosomes, as well as on ultrathin cryosections of exosomes in exocytic profiles and internal membranes in MIICs, the latter representing the precursors of exosomes. Although CD53 could not be detected by Western blot analyses, IEM demonstrated its presence on the plasma membrane and in MIICs. The labeling pattern of CD53 was similar to that of CD37. How the tetraspan proteins are transported to MIICs is unclear. Newly synthesized tetraspan proteins may be targeted directly from the trans-Golgi network to the endocytic tract. Alternatively, they may reach MIICs via the plasma membrane through endocytosis. However, they do not contain any of the consensus sorting signals in their cytoplasmic tail. From the differential expression levels of tetraspan proteins at the plasma membrane, distinct rates of transport between the plasma membrane and MIICs can be suspected. The mechanism by which MHC class II, CD86, and the tetraspans are selectively incorporated into the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies is also not known. A similar phenomenon has been described for the sorting of ligand-bound epidermal growth factor receptor in endosomes, resulting in its down-regulation and ultimate degradation in lysosomes (50Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 51Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21265-21273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of annexin I by this receptor has been suggested to induce inward vesiculation in this process (52Futter C.E. Felder S. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Even though the precise functions of the tetraspan proteins studied are largely unknown, similarities between their structures suggests closely related functions. They have been described to be important for T-cell development and T-cell activation. CD81 has been implicated in T-cell development (39Todd S.C. Lipps S.G. Crisa L. Salomon D.R. Tsoukas C.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2055-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 53Boismenu R. Rhein M. Fischer W.H. Havran W.L. Science. 1996; 271: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as a co-inducer molecule during differentiation of immature double positive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into single positive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cellsin vitro (54Cibotti R. Punt J.A. Dash K.S. Sharrow S.O. Singer A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CD81-null mice show a decreased early antibody production in response to antigen, indicating that CD81 is important for the development of humoral immune responses (55Maecker H.T. Levy S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). CD53 has been proposed to play a role in thymopoiesis (56Paterson D.J. Williams A.F. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 57Paterson D.J. Green J.R. Jefferies W.A. Puklavec M. Williams A.F. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether CD81 and/or CD53 indeed function as signaling molecules in thymic selection is still theoretical. Alternatively, it can be speculated that these molecules may be important for antigen presentation by MHC class II at the plasma membrane and/or exosomes. Similarly, CD82 has been reported to function as a co-stimulatory molecule for monocytes (58Lebel-Binay S. Lagaudrière C. Fradelizi D. Conjeaud H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and to play a role in T-lymphocyte activation (59Lebel-Binay S. Lagaudrière C. Fradelizi D. Conjeaud H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar) and proliferation (60Nojima Y. Hirose T. Tachibana K. Tanaka T. Shi L. Doshen J. Freeman G.J. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Cell Immunol. 1993; 152: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tetraspans have also been implicated in cell adhesion. CD63 has been shown to be involved in platelet adhesion to endothelial cells (61Toothill V.J. Van Mourik J.A. Niewenhuis H.K. Metzelaar M.J. Pearson J.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 283-291PubMed Google Scholar), and CD81 is involved in cell adhesion of B-cell, T-cell, and nonlymphoid cell lines (62Takahashi S. Doss C. Levy S. Levy R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2207-2213PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, ligation of CD53 has been shown to induce homotypic adhesion of B-cells (63Lazo P.A. Cuevas L. Gutierrez del Arroyo A. Orue E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 178: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this latter case, the authors postulated novel adhesion mechanisms among lymphoid cells modulated by several tetraspans, which represents a novel form of cell communication. Because we found relatively little conventional adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 (Fig. 1 A; Table I), ICAM-2, and LFA-3 (data not shown), in exosomes as compared with tetraspan proteins, the presence of tetraspans in exosomes would be consistent with a role in adhesion. In contrast to mature MHC class II, molecules involved in MHC class II transport and peptide loading, such as HLA-DM and Ii, were not enriched in exosomes. This is consistent with the notion that MHC class II processing occurs in MIICs prior to their fusion with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of exosomes carrying peptide-loaded MHC class II. This notion was supported by the stability of MHC class II on exosomes in the presence of SDS (Fig. 2 A; Ref. 25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). IEM studies have shown that HLA-DM is mainly associated with the limiting membrane of MIICs. This suggests that prior to the recruitment of MHC class II to the internal vesicles of MIICs, the Ii degradation product class II-associated invariant chain peptide is removed from MHC class II and substituted by a peptide, a process catalyzed by HLA-DM (9Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 10Sherman M.A. Weber D.A. Jensen P.E.

Interestingly, CD82 has recently been shown to associate selectively with MHC class II/HLA-DM complexes (64Hammond, C., Denzin, L. K., Pan, M., Griffith, J. M., Geuze, H. J. and Cresswell, P. J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). Like HLA-DM, the typical lysosomal membrane proteins, Lamp-1 and Lamp-2, were preferentially localized to the limiting membrane of MIICs. For Lamp-2, this observation is not surprising because it has been described as a receptor for the selective import of cytosolic proteins into lysosomes (65Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In conclusion, exosomes are selectively enriched in proteins that play a role in antigen presentation, suggesting their immunological rolein vivo. They could be involved in T-cell stimulation and/or in less defined processes, such as the generation of T-cell tolerance or T-cell memory. Further investigations are required to determine the physiological role of exosomes and their potential use in immunotherapy. We thank Dr. H. L.

A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we had investigated the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme. In brief, it was shown that the reduction of Eox, the disulfide-containing form of human TrxR, by its substrate NADPH leads to a series of transient enzyme species characterized by charge transfer complexes involving oxidized flavin, reduced flavin, and reoxidized flavin, respectively. The reactions result in a stable TrxR species containing reoxidized flavin, the active site pair Cys-57/Cys-62 as a dithiol, and an additional reduced redox active group, probably the Cys-495/SeCys-496 center. The nascent thiolate of Cys-62 forms a charge transfer complex with the flavin, which has a typical absorbance at 540 nm. Thus, human thioredoxin reductase mechanistically resembles glutathione reductase and is distinct from bacterial TrxR (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl.

Employing steady state kinetics, we have now continued investigating the catalytic mechanism of human thioredoxin reductase. Studies with the gold compound aurothioglucose on human glutathione peroxidase (13Chaudiere J. Tappel A.L. J. Inorg.

We therefore analyzed the susceptibility of isolated human thioredoxin reductase to organic gold compounds. Gold and its derivatives have been used as therapeutics in the history of mankind for ages. Most preparations and indications described were based on mystic principles and are obsolete today (16Kaim W. Schwederski B. Bioanorganische Chemie. 1991; (372–374, Teubner Studienbücher Chemie, Stuttgart, Germany): 325Google Scholar). In rheumatoid arthritis, however, a serious disease affecting 1–2% of the world's population, organic gold compounds like auranofin and aurothioglucose are still first choice therapeutics. As discussed below, the results presented here strongly suggest that gold compounds exert at least some of their pharmacologic effects by inhibiting the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase. Frozen placentas were kindly provided by Dr. J. Wacker (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Heidelberg University). Purification of human thioredoxin reductase from placenta is delineated below. Recombinant Escherichia coli TrxS2 with an ε280 nm of 13.7 mm−1cm−1 (17Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3670-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Mulrooney S.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were produced and isolated as described. Human glutathione peroxidase was purchased from Sigma. Auranofin was obtained from ICN, and aurothioglucose, thioglucose, gold(III)chloride, and British Anti-Lewisite (BAL) (2,3-dithiopropanol) were from Sigma. Precast gels (12% polyacrylamide) and the protein dye assay were from Bio-Rad, and molecular weight standards were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All reagents were of the highest available purity. All assays were conducted at 25 °C in a total assay volume of 1 ml. For the purification procedure and the inhibition studies, the DTNB reduction assay (4Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) proved to be sufficiently specific. The enzyme was added to an assay mixture of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 7.4, and 3 mm DTNB (using a 100 mmstock solution in Me2SO); after initiating the reaction with the addition of NADPH (200 μm final concentration), the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored. 1 enzyme unit is defined as the NADPH-dependent production of 2 μmol of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (ε412 nm 13.6 mm−1 cm−1) per min. In steady state kinetic studies, the assay mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and five different concentrations both of TrxS2 (range 5–45 μm) and of NADPH (range 5–100 μm; ε340 nm 6.22 mm−1cm−1). The reaction was started with thioredoxin reductase (final concentration 4 nm TrxR subunits), and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored during the linear phase. 1 enzyme unit is defined as the consumption of 1 μmol of NADPH per min. Each combination of [NADPH] and [Trx] was repeated six times, and the mean values were used for computing the kinetic constants. Glutathione reductase activity was measured in an assay mixture consisting of 47 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, pH 6.9, and 100 μm NADPH; after the addition of glutathione disulfide (1 mm final concentration), the consumption of NADPH was monitored as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined in a GR-coupled assay according to Beutler (20Beutler E. Red Blood Cell Metabolism –A Manual of Biochemical Methods. 3rd Ed. Grune & Stratton, Inc., London1984: 74-75Google Scholar). The assay mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 4 units/ml glutathione reductase, 2 mmreduced glutathione, 100 μm NADPH, and glutathione peroxidase) was equilibrated for 10 min; then the substratet-butylhydroperoxide (1 mm final concentration) was added and the consumption of NADPH was monitored. We increased the activity of glutathione reductase in the assay from 1 unit/ml (20Beutler E. Red Blood Cell Metabolism –A Manual of Biochemical Methods. 3rd Ed. Grune & Stratton, Inc., London1984: 74-75Google Scholar) to 4 units/ml to assure that this ancillary enzyme was not rate-limiting in the presence of organic gold compounds. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad dye assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Because of the potential risk of infection, laboratory biosafety regulations (3Gromer S. Thioredoxin Reductase of Men and Mice. A Selenoenzyme As a Drug Target, MD thesis, Heidelberg University. 1998; Google Scholar, 21Sewell D.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 389-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were strictly obeyed in the first steps including acetone precipitation. Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The TE buffer used throughout the preparation consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6. (22)A frozen placenta of approximately 500 g was cut with a stainless steel saw into slices (about 1 × 3 × 10 cm). The slices were cleaned mechanically from debris with a cover slide, weighed out, and transferred to plastic bags. Per 1 g of placenta, 0.6 ml of extraction solution (10 μm FAD, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in TE buffer) was added, and the tissue was thawed by placing the bags into a 40 °C water bath. Subsequently, the content of the bags was homogenized in 250-g portions in a Waring blender. Each portion was stabilized with 20 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immediately before treatment with chloroform/1-butanol, the homogenate was titrated to pH 8.3 using 5 mNH4OH. The chloroform/1-butanol mixture (1:2.5, v/v; −20 °C; 120 μl/gram placenta) was added under vigorous stirring. The brownish suspension was rehomogenized in the Waring blender, left for 1 h, and then centrifuged for 90 min at 8000 ×g. The supernatant was set aside while the precipitate was taken up in extraction solution (0.4 ml/gram placenta), homogenized, and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were combined, filtered through glass wool (Riedel de Häen) and adjusted to pH 8.3 using 5 m NH4OH. This solution was the chloroform-butanol extract (Table I).Table ISynopsis of the thioredoxin reductase purification procedurePurification of a human thioredoxin reductase from 530 g of frozen placentaTotal proteinTotal unitsSpecific activityStep to step yieldOverall yieldmgunitsunits/mg%Chloroform-butanol extract67501350.02(100)(100)Acetone-treated fraction29101310.0459797DEAE-cellulose eluate5301030.19479772′,5′-ADP-Sepharose eluate1.9867.233.96550Sephadex G-200 eluate0.9633.635.05025The selenium content of the Sephadex G-200 eluate was determined to be 0.94 mol/mol subunit using atomic absorption spectroscopy.

Bovine serum albumin, however, was not used in assay mixtures since it interfered with the studies on tight-binding enzyme inhibitors. Per 1 ml of chloroform-butanol extract, 0.85 ml of acetone was slowly added under stirring. The solution was left for 1 h and then centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 × g. The pellet was taken up in a small volume of TE buffer having a final volume of approximately 100 ml. This sample was dialyzed exhaustively against 2-fold diluted TE buffer and centrifuged (30 min, 25000 × g). The supernatant was set aside while the pellet was resuspended in TE buffer, mixed carefully, and centrifuged as described above. The combined supernatants were filtered through glass wool and adjusted to pH 8.3 using 5 m NH4OH. The resulting solution was referred to as the acetone-treated fraction. The acetone-treated fraction was applied to a (3.2 × 50 cm) DEAE-52 cellulose column (Whatman), which had been equilibrated with TE buffer before and was operated at room temperature. After washing the column with 1000 ml of TE buffer followed by 500 ml of 50 mm NaCl in TE buffer, thioredoxin reductase activity was eluted with 90 mm NaCl in TE buffer. In this step, the enzyme comigrated with a deep red protein. The pool of active fractions was concentrated and washed with TE buffer in a Centriprep 30 (Amicon). The resulting solution was diluted 2-fold with TE buffer, and the pH was adjusted to 7.6 using 100 mm HCl. This fraction was called the DEAE-cellulose eluate. The above fraction was applied to a 30-ml (1.5 × 17 cm) 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a jacketed chromatography tube. The tube was cooled to 6 ± 1 °C, the exact temperature being crucial for the purification success. The column was consecutively washed with 60 ml of TE buffer, 30 ml of 100 mm KCl in TE buffer, 20 ml of 200 mm KCl in TE, 30 ml of 100 mm KCl in TE, 60 ml of 2-fold diluted TE, 60 ml of 500 μm NADH in TE, 60 ml of TE, 60 ml of 100 μm NADP+ in TE, and 30 ml of 300 μm NADP+ in TE. Finally, TrxR activity was eluted with 750 μm NADP+ in TE buffer, concentrated, and washed with the buffer in a Centriprep 30. This solution, the 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose eluate, contained (on the basis of absorption spectra (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), specific activity, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis) homogeneous (more than 95% pure) thioredoxin reductase. To remove trace impurities, the above fraction may be applied to a Sephadex G-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1 × 100 cm) equilibrated with TE buffer. Spectroscopically pure fractions were pooled, concentrated, and referred to as the Sephadex G-200 eluate. 10 mm stock solutions of aurothioglucose and thioglucose in assay buffer and of auranofin in Me2SO were prepared immediately prior to use and stored in dark bottles. Dilutions were made in assay buffer. One min after adding the inhibitor to the assay mixture of a given enzyme, the reaction was started with the appropriate substrate. Thioglucose served as a control and had no inhibitory effect on the enzymes within the tested inhibitor concentration range. For inhibition studies on human TrxR, the DTNB reduction assay was used. To verify the effects of an organic gold compound on TrxR under more physiological conditions, we determined the Kifor auranofin with TrxS2 as a substrate. Using two different TrxS2 concentrations (50 and 75 μmtogether with 100 μm NADPH and 1.7 nm TrxR), the inhibitory effects of 5–50 nm auranofin in the assay were observed over 20 min, and initial rates were determined. To determine the influence of NADPH on TrxR and glutathione reductase inhibition by the gold compounds, 50-μl samples containing approximately 600 nm enzyme subunits each were preincubated with 1 μm inhibitor in the presence and absence of 200 μm NADPH for 20 min at room temperature. Aliquots were taken, diluted, and assayed for residual activity. Control experiments showed that free inhibitor present in diluted aliquots had no effect when added to assays of uninhibited enzyme. To test the reversibility of TrxR inhibition by a gold chelating agent, inhibited samples were exposed to 1 mm BAL for 5 and 20 min before assaying activity. In a complementary protection experiment, 50-μl samples of TrxR (700 nm subunits) containing 200 μmNADPH and 1 mm BAL were prepared. Then inhibitor was added (1 μm), and after 20 min the residual activity was determined. Because it is not yet possible to produce recombinant mammalian selenoenzymes in heterologous systems, we have optimized the purification of native human thioredoxin reductase. For this purpose, placenta proved to be the organ of choice (5Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The first purification steps involve organic solvents (TableI). Apart from their antiseptic effect, these solvents denature the bulk of NADP(H)-dependent enzymes (22Scott E.M. Prep. Biochem. 1976; 6: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar), which greatly enhances the efficiency of affinity chromatography used in a later purification step. In comparison with the original report of Oblong et al. (5Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we were able to improve the isolation procedure with respect to speed, final yield (1–2 mg of TrxR instead of 0.3 mg from one placenta) and specific activity (Table I). Using atomic absorption spectroscopy, the selenium content of the isolated enzyme was found to be 0.94 ± 0.03 mol/mol of subunit of 55.2 kDa. Approximatly 520 pmol of TrxR subunit exhibits 1 unit of enzymatic activity in the DTNB reduction assay. The long-standing problem of preparing the substrate thioredoxin in sufficient amounts has led in the past to the use of DTNB as the disulfide substrate or to the use of coupled disulfide systems in TrxR assays (23Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons of these alternative systems with thioredoxin-based assays have been conducted whenever it was crucial (23Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Luthman and Holmgren found that rat liver, calf liver, and E. coli thioredoxin all gave akcat of approximately 3000 min−1with rat liver thioredoxin reductase; using DTNB as the acceptor substrate, kcat was 4000 min−1(24Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In the present study on human TrxR, we have used E. coli thioredoxin (TrxS2) and found, as detailed below, a turnover number of 3300 min−1. The kinetic parameters were obtained from secondary plots of the steady state kinetic data shown in Fig. 1. As in the case of the closely related enzyme glutathione reductase (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13888-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) the results for TrxR are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. We determined a kcat of 3330 ± 882 min−1 and Km-values of 18 μm for NADPH and of 25 μm for E. coli thioredoxin. When using the DTNB reduction assay, theKm for NADPH was found to be only 6 μm; the Km value of 0.4 mmfor DTNB as reported by Oblong et al. (5Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was confirmed. Thus, our results obtained with the DTNB reduction assay compare well with a previous study on human placenta TrxR (5Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and with the data for TrxR from rat liver (24Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and mouse tumor cells (3Gromer S. Thioredoxin Reductase of Men and Mice. A Selenoenzyme As a Drug Target, MD thesis, Heidelberg University. 1998; Google Scholar, 27Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that at NADPH concentrations above 20 μm, substrate inhibition becomes appreciable in both assay systems. This is apparent in Fig. 1 where the data points depart from the straight lines at higher concentrations of NADPH. The effect of temperature on the rate of the reaction was studied both with TrxS2 and with DTNB as a substrate; the data forE. coli TrxS2 are given in Fig.2. In the range between 5 and 40 °C, the activation energy was found to be 53.2 kJ/mol. Above 40 °C, human TrxR becomes unstable and is completely inactive at 60 °C. Glutathione reductase and other disulfide reductases are known to be fully active at this temperature (6Schirmer R.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schulz G.E. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. III. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 553-596Google Scholar, 28Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Veeger C. Biochem.

Chem. 1967; 242: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 2), the turnover number at 4 °C is 650 ± 17 min−1 or 10.8 ± 2.9 s−1. As discussed below this value is consistent with the slowest step in the reductive half-reaction determined at 4 °C in an earlier study of the pre-steady state kinetics (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The results of the studies with aurothioglucose and auranofin in the assay mixture are shown in Fig.3. Gold-free thioglucose did not inhibit the enzymes in the concentration range used for the gold compounds. Glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were by at least three orders of magnitude less susceptible to the organic gold compounds than thioredoxin reductase. IC50 values for the inhibition of all three enzymes by the different inhibitors are given in TableII. It should be noted that glutathione reductase was almost unaffected by aurothioglucose, whereas auranofin had inhibitory effects although only in the upper micromolar range. For glutathione peroxidase, the situation was reversed; that is, auranofin but not aurothioglucose was found to be an inhibitor. Qualitatively speaking, our data agree well with the effects of aurothioglucose on the three enzymes in unfractionated rat cytosol. In this study, TrxR was inhibited 50% by 100-fold less gold thioglucose than needed for 50% inhibition of glutathione peroxidase, whereas GR activity was not affected by submillimolar concentrations of the gold compound (15Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Table IIIC50 values of the inhibition of human glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase by different gold compoundsAurothioglucoseAuranofinThioredoxin reductase65 nm20 nmGlutathione reductase»100 μm40 μmGlutathione peroxidase80 μm»100 μmDue to the fact that the compounds have inhibitory effects at concentrations almost equimolar to TrxR, the IC50 values presented here can vary depending on the enzyme concentration in the assay (see text). Open table in a new tab Due to the fact that the compounds have inhibitory effects at concentrations almost equimolar to TrxR, the IC50 values presented here can vary depending on the enzyme concentration in the assay (see text). Fig. 4 shows the different sensitivity of isolated TrxR and glutathione reductase in their oxidized (Eox) and NADPH-reduced states toward gold compounds. Whereas in the Eox form the enzymes remained unaffected, NADPH-reduced TrxR was almost completely inhibited (Fig.4 A). The addition of 1 mm BAL reversed the TrxR-inhibition, leading to 50% of initial activity after 5 min and 100% after 20 min. Simultaneous incubation with inhibitor and BAL completely prevented the effect of the gold compounds on TrxR. Glutathione reductase, even in the NADPH-reduced form, was hardly affected by preincubation with organic gold compounds (Fig.4 B). Only inorganic Au(III)Cl3 led to an inactivation of reduced glutathione reductase; in contrast to the situation with human TrxR, this inhibition was only partially reversible by BAL (less than 15% after 1 h). In an attempt to describe the inhibition of TrxR by auranofin more precisely, we extended this study to include inhibition steady state kinetics for tight binding enzyme inhibitors that compete with a substrate (30Morrison J.F. Walsh C."

Fzo1p is part of a larger protein complex of 800 kDa, and presumably is the first identified component of the yeast mitochondrial fusion machinery. Mitochondria exist in a particular cell type in a characteristic copy number, size, and position, often reflecting the energy needs of the cell. The inheritance of mitochondria, the maintenance of their characteristic shape, and their positioning is mediated by active transport along cytoskeletal elements and depends on continuous fission and fusion of the organelles (1Bereiter-Hahn J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 122: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Warren G. Wickner W. Cell. 1996; 84: 395-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Only little is known about the molecular components mediating these processes. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model organism to study these processes because genetic and biochemical techniques can be readily combined. In S. cerevisiae, mitochondria form a giant branched network below the cell cortex (3Stevens B. Strathern E.W. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 471-504Google Scholar). During vegetative growth, the continuity of this network is maintained by a balanced frequency of fission and fusion events (4Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). During mitotic cell division early in the cell cycle, a portion of the maternal mitochondrial network is actively transported into the developing bud, where mitochondria continue to accumulate until cytokinesis is completed (2Warren G. Wickner W. Cell. 1996; 84: 395-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Upon fusion of two mating cells, parental mitochondria immediately fuse, and their contents mix (4Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Several proteins are known to be important for mitochondrial morphology and inheritance in yeast. These proteins include the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins Mdm10p, Mmm1p, and Mdm12p, the fatty acid desaturase Mdm2p/Ole1p, the dynamin-like protein Mgm1p, the intermediate filament-like protein Mdm1p, yeast actin, Act1p, and a component important for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, Mdm20p (5Stewart L.C.

Disruption or mutation of the respective genes leads to the formation of mitochondria with an abnormal morphology and/or to a defect in the partitioning of mitochondria to the daughter cell. None of these proteins appears to play a direct role in mitochondrial fusion. Because the integrity of the three-dimensional structure of the cell depends on fusion of intracellular membranes, the identification and characterization of the molecular components responsible for this process is subject to intense investigation. The best characterized system of intracellular membrane fusion is that of the organelles of the secretory pathway which are interconnected by a complex network of transport vesicles (13Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Both the transport vesicles and the target membranes carry a specific set of integral membrane receptors on their surface, the SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARESNAP receptorNSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinmt-GFPmitochondrial GFPMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHsp60heat shock protein of 60 kDaKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninCOXIIcytochrome oxidase subunit IIDiOC63,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideCCCPcarbonyl cyanide-m-chlorphenylhydrazoneYPDyeast extract-peptone-dextroseYPGyeast extract-peptone-glycerolYPGalyeast extract-peptone-galactoseDICdifferential interference contrastPCRpolymerase chain reaction. proteins which determine the identity of organelles and control the specificity of docking between intracellular membranes (14Söllner T.

Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). At the same time, SNAREs constitute the minimal machinery for membrane fusion (16Weber T. Zemelman B.V.

The ATPase NSF and SNAP proteins play an essential role in SNARE-dependent fusion processes in vivo and are thought to be a general machinery for the recycling of SNARE proteins after fusion (16Weber T.

Mitochondrial fusion, however, appears to be independent of the action of NSF (4Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and no SNARE-like proteins are known in mitochondria.

Recently, the first known protein mediator of mitochondrial fusion has been identified in Drosophila (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The fuzzy onions (fzo) gene encodes a large predicted transmembrane GTPase that is expressed during spermatogenesis late in meiosis II. In male fzo mutants, mitochondria aggregate and are defective in postmeiotic fusion. They develop structures that look like “fuzzy onions.” This deficient organellar development results in defective sperm production and male sterility. Similar proteins of unknown function exist in mammals, nematodes, and yeast (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Here, we report the characterization of the yeast homolog of Fzo, Fzo1p. Disruption of the FZO1 gene in yeast results in a petite phenotype and in the loss of mitochondrial DNA, indicating an important function of Fzo1p in mitochondrial biogenesis. Cells lacking Fzo1p show a fragmented mitochondrial morphology. Fzo1p is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane exposing the major part of the protein to the cytosol, and can be imported into isolated mitochondria in a receptor-dependent manner. Fzo1p is part of a high molecular weight complex, and presumably is the first identified component of a yeast mitochondrial fusion machinery. Standard genetic techniques were used for growth and manipulation of yeast strains (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was carried out as described (20Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). To obtain disruption mutants of FZO1, most of the open reading frame was first replaced with the Tn903 kanamycin resistance gene in the diploid strain YPH501 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The primers used to generate the disrupting DNA fragment were 179KA-5 (5′-GGT GAT GTA AAT ACT GGT GCT AGC GCT CTT TGC AAC TCT C) and 179KA-3 (5′-GCA AAG AGC GCT AGC ACC AGT ATT TAC ATC ACC). Haploid deletants were obtained after sporulation and tetrad dissection. The wild type strains D273–10B (ATCC 24657) and W303A were used for the preparation of subcellular and submitochondrial fractions. Standard methods were used for the manipulation of DNA (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To obtain the construct for in vitro transcription of FZO1, the FZO1 open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers Z36U (5′ CCC GGA TCC ACC ATG TCT GAA GGA AAA CAA C) and Z36L (5′ CCC GTT AAC GTC GAC CTA ATC GAT GTC TAA A) and cloned into the BamHI andSalI sites of the in vitro expression vector pGEM4 (Promega). To obtain the construct for expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mitochondria, the presequence of the subunit 9 of the F0 ATPase of Neurospora crassa was amplified by PCR using the primers SU9N (5′ GGG AAG CTT ATG GCC TCC ACT CGT GTC C) and SU9C (5′ GGG GGA TCC GGA AGA GTA GGC GCG CTT) and cloned into theHindIII and BamHI sites of the vector pGEM3 (Promega) yielding plasmid pGEM3-Su9(1–69). The open reading frame coding for GFP from Aequorea victoria containing the S65T mutation (24Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pFP20 (kind gift of Dr. F. Parlati, New York) using the primers GFP-N (5′ CGG GTA CCA GAT CTA TGA GTA AGG GTG AAG AAC TTT TC) and GFP-C (5′ CGG AAT TCT TAT TTG TAT AGT TCA TCC) and cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pGEM3-Su9(1–69) yielding plasmid pGEM3-Su9-GFP2. TheHindIII/EcoRI fragment of pGEM3-Su9-GFP2 was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2.0 (Invitrogen) yielding plasmid pYES-GFP2. The in vitro import of Fzo1p was carried out essentially as described (25Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Precursor protein was synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Import mixtures (100 μl) usually contained 1–3% reticulocyte lysate (v/v) in 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, 80 mm KCl, pH 7.2. Protease treatment was performed by adding proteinase K or trypsin at the indicated concentrations for 15 min at 0 °C followed by addition of 1 mm PMSF. Mitochondria (1 mg) were pelleted for 10 min at 10,000 × g and resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm K-acetate, 4 mm Mg-acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C under agitation, mitochondrial extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 90,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (25-ml column volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and chromatographed in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostaining with antibodies against Fzo1p. Calibration standards used were as follows: cytochrome b2, 210 kDa; apoferritin, 440 kDa; Hsp60, 850 kDa. Antisera against the N and the C termini of Fzo1p were raised in rabbits by injecting the chemically synthesized peptides MSEGKQQFKDSNKC (N-terminal) or CKLMVEEINLDID (C-terminal) that had been coupled to activated KLH (Pierce). Subfractionation of yeast cells and carbonate extraction (26Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), isolation of mitochondria (25Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar), and preparation of outer membrane vesicles (27Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Protein determination and SDS-PAGE were performed according to published methods. The detection of proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Standard fluorescence and interference contrast microscopy was performed using an Axioplan microscope with a Plan-Neofluar 100x/1.30 Oil objective (Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH) using a 100 W mercury lamp and an excitation wavelength of 450–490 nm for the visualization of mt-GFP. The FZO1 gene in yeast (systematic name YBR179c) encodes a protein that is 20% identical toDrosophila Fzo (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Both proteins possess a similar domain structure, namely an N-terminal predicted coiled-coil, followed by a highly conserved GTPase domain, a second coiled-coil region, a predicted transmembrane domain in the C-terminal third of the protein, and a third coiled-coil close to the C terminus (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, we reasoned that like Fzo in Drosophila, Fzo1p might play an important role for the biogenesis of mitochondria in yeast. To test whether the FZO1 gene is essential for the viability of yeast cells, we disrupted one of the two copies ofFZO1 in diploid cells. The disruption was done by replacing almost the entire open reading frame of FZO1 by the kanamycin resistance gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). After sporulation and tetrad dissection, we found that all four spores in each tetrad were viable on glucose-containing medium, but that two spores in each tetrad showed a slow growth phenotype (Fig.1 A). Cells from the small colonies carried the disrupted gene (Δfzo1), whereas cells from normal-sized colonies carried the wild type gene. The deletion mutant failed to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (Fig.1 B), suggesting an important role of Fzo1p for mitochondrial function. The cells containing the disruption in FZO1 had lost a functional mitochondrial genome. This was concluded from two independent observations. First, mating the Δfzo1 strain with a rho° tester strain lacking mitochondrial DNA,Δmdj1 (26Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), did not result in diploid cells able to grow on glycerol. Thus, the Δfzo1 strain did not contain a functional mitochondrial genome that would be able to restore growth on nonfermentable carbon sources in the presence of the wild type copy of the FZO1 gene in the diploid strain (not shown). Second, we performed an in organello translation assay for mitochondrial-encoded proteins (28Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine, which resulted in the labeling of mitochondrial-synthesized proteins in wild type mitochondria. In mitochondria isolated from the Δfzo1strain, this labeling was completely absent (not shown). Moreover, COXII, a protein encoded by the mitochondrial DNA, was absent in immunoblots of Δfzo1 mitochondria. F0 ATPase subunit e (Tim11p) and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (Fe/S), two cytoplasmic-synthesized components of the respiratory chain, could not be detected, and the steady state levels of several other proteins involved in respiration were greatly reduced, namely cytochrome c1, F1ATPase subunit α, and Bcs1p (not shown). Mitochondria with reduced levels of components of the respiratory chain can often be found in petite or rho° strains (29Rep M. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We conclude that the FZO1 gene is crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. We asked whether the deletion of FZO1 leads to an abnormal mitochondrial morphology. When green fluorescent protein fused to a mitochondrial presequence (mt-GFP) was expressed in wild type cells, the characteristic mitochondrial network below the cell cortex was seen in the fluorescence microscope (Fig. 1 C). An identical staining was obtained with mitochondria-specific dyes such as Mitotracker or DiOC6 (not shown). In the Δfzo1strain expressing mt-GFP, the mitochondrial morphology was completely altered. Mitochondria were highly fragmented, and only in a few cells could some short tubular structures be seen (Fig. 1 C). Because it is known that the morphology of yeast mitochondria is changed in the absence of an intact mitochondrial genome (31Pon L. Schatz G. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 333-406Google Scholar), we expressed mt-GFP in a cytoplasmic petite strain lacking mitochondrial DNA that is otherwise wild type (W303 rho°). In this strain, a mitochondrial morphology similar to that in the Δfzo1mutant was observed. Most of the rho° cells harbored fragmented mitochondria, and only a few well developed tubular structures were seen (data not shown). We conclude that Fzo1p is required for a normal mitochondrial morphology. It is, however, unclear as to whether the fragmented mitochondrial morphology is a direct consequence of deletion of FZO1, or an indirect effect of the rho° state of the deletion mutant. To determine the location and topology of Fzo1p, antisera against an N-terminal and a C-terminal peptide were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, we investigated the subcellular location of Fzo1p. Cells were harvested from a liquid culture at mid-logarithmic growth phase, and subcellular fractions were prepared and used for immunoblotting. Fzo1p was detected in the mitochondrial fraction and cofractionated with Tom40, a mitochondrial protein. Fzo1p could not be detected in the cytosolic or nonmitochondrial membrane fractions (Fig.2 A). Thus, Fzo1p is a mitochondrial protein. Next, the submitochondrial location of Fzo1p was determined. Hydropathy analysis suggests that Fzo1p may contain one or two putative membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 2 B). Indeed, Fzo1p could not be extracted from mitochondrial membranes following treatment with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, indicating that it is an integral membrane protein (Fig. 2 C). To determine in which of the two mitochondrial membranes Fzo1p resides, we prepared outer membrane vesicles. Fzo1p is enriched in these vesicles together with other outer membrane proteins such as Tom70 (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, inner membrane proteins such as COXII were hardly detectable in these vesicles. Furthermore, Fzo1p was accessible to externally added proteases in intact mitochondria under conditions where proteins exposed to the intermembrane space were protected (Fig.2 C) indicating that at least a part of the protein is exposed to the cytosol. We conclude that Fzo1p is an integral protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. To understand the role of Fzo1p in the biogenesis of normal mitochondria, it is important to know its topology in the outer membrane. We noticed that after treatment of mitochondria with very low amounts of protease, fragments were generated that were slightly smaller than the full-length protein. Because these fragments could be detected in a Western blot using the antibody against a C-terminal peptide of Fzo1p (Fig. 2 D), the protease must have cleaved the N terminus of the protein, indicating that this part is exposed to the outside. Thus, the major part of Fzo1p including the predicted GTPase domain faces the cytosol. Next, we tested the in vitro import of Fzo1p into isolated mitochondria. This is an independent approach to show its mitochondrial localization, and at the same time, Fzo1p is a novel model protein to study protein import into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Radiolabeled protein was synthesized in vitro and incubated with isolated wild type mitochondria. After the import reaction, carbonate extraction was performed. Most of the imported protein was recovered in the pellet, indicating insertion of the protein into the membrane (Fig.3 A). As a control, carbonate extraction was performed on lysate in the absence of mitochondria. Here, the protein was found in the supernatant, excluding the possibility that it was aggregated under these conditions. The inserted protein like the endogenous one was sensitive to proteinase K (Fig.3 A). As expected from the lack of a typical cleavable presequence, no change in the molecular mass of Fzo1p was observed upon import. We investigated the kinetics of the import process and found that, within 5 min, most of the protein was inserted into the outer membrane (Fig. 3 B). Similar to other outer membrane proteins, the import of Fzo1p was independent of a membrane potential ΔΨ across the inner membrane as the addition of the uncoupler CCCP did not change the import efficiency (Fig. 3 C). Pretreatment of mitochondria with trypsin to cleave import receptors on the mitochondrial surface significantly reduced the amount of inserted protein, suggesting that Fzo1p uses protease-sensitive import receptors for its insertion into the outer membrane (Fig. 3 C). The import and protease sensitivity of Fzo1p was not affected by the presence or absence of nucleotides such as AMP, ADP, ATP, or GTP (Fig.3 C and data not shown). These observations are consistent with a localization of Fzo1p in the mitochondrial outer membrane. It appears that its import is receptor-dependent and does not require ATP-dependent cytosolic chaperones. It is conceivable that Fzo1p interacts with other proteins to fulfill its role in mitochondrial biogenesis. In particular, the predicted coiled-coil domains may be responsible for formation of hetero and/or homo oligomers. Thus, we investigated whether Fzo1p is part of a high molecular weight complex. Mitochondria were solubilized with detergent, and the proteins were separated on a gel filtration column. Fzo1p was eluted from the column in a relatively sharp peak, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 800 kDa (Fig.4). The protein was eluted in a fraction corresponding to a similar size when GTP was present during lysis and elution (not shown). These results suggest that Fzo1p is part of a complex of high molecular weight, which might represent the mitochondrial fusion machinery in yeast, or a part thereof. Fzo in Drosophila is the first known protein mediator of mitochondrial fusion (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 32Yaffe M.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R782-R783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Fzo1p might play a similar role in yeast. First, Fzo1p shares a significant sequence homology with the Drosophila protein and possesses a similar predicted domain structure (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Second, Fzo1p in yeast cells and Fzo in sperm cells have the same subcellular location in mitochondria. Third, Fzo1p is an integral protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane with the major part facing the cytosol, a topology which would be expected for a fusion protein that has to interact with proteins on the opposite membrane or in the cytosol. The assumption that Fzo1p plays a role in mitochondrial fusion is further strengthened by the observed phenotype of the deletion mutant. Deletion of FZO1 leads to the loss of mitochondrial DNA. The inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in yeast is an ordered event that is thought to depend on the integrity of the mitochondrial compartment (4Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that deletion of a component important for mitochondrial structure results in a defect of segregation of mitochondrial DNA to the daughter cell. Thus, several proteins are known that are important for both mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. Deletion mutants of the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, Mdm10p and Mdm12p, and the dynamin-like protein, Mgm1p, harbor one or few giant mitochondria per cell, implying a role of these proteins for mitochondrial morphology (6Guan K. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Sogo L.F. Yaffe M.P. J.

At the same time, deletion of the genes leads to the loss of the mitochondrial genome (33Jones B.A. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Guan K. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Berger K.H. Sogo L.F. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The Δfzo1 mutant is also rho°, it has, however, a fragmented mitochondrial morphology, a phenotype which is consistent with a possible role of Fzo1p in mitochondrial fusion. Proteins involved in fusion events in the secretory pathway do not seem to play a role in mitochondrial fusion. Neither these proteins themselves or homologues of them have been found associated with mitochondria. And, vice versa, no Fzo1p-like protein has been found to play a role in fusion events in the secretory pathway. Thus, mitochondria appear to employ a fusion mechanism that is fundamentally different. If SNARE-dependent fusion machineries are mediating fusion of so many diverse membranes in the cell, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuole, plasma membrane, endosomes etc., why is not a related machinery fusing the mitochondrial membranes? It is conceivable that at the time when the endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria entered the primitive eukaryotic cell, the organelles of the secretory pathway already carried a complex system of SNARE-like proteins on their surfaces. These SNAREs presumably had evolved from a single pair of primitive SNARE-like fusion proteins (16Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) long before mitochondria, or any other organelles stemming from endosymbiontic bacteria, were present in the eukaryotic cell. Furthermore, as double membrane-bounded organelles, mitochondria are faced with the problem of fusing four membranes. It is obvious that, for this challenge, a different fusion machinery had to be developed. The mitochondrial fusion machinery must be able to meet the following criteria. First, it must provide a means for the specific recognition of the membranes that are to be fused. Second, it has to supply energy to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion. Third, it must coordinate fusion with fission events to maintain the continuity of the mitochondrial network during vegetative growth. Fourth, it has to intimately link the fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane to the fusion of the inner membrane. It is unlikely that all these requirements can be fulfilled by a single protein. We have identified Fzo1p as a part of an 800-kDa protein complex. Up to now, we cannot exclude the possibility that this complex is a homo-oligomer of Fzo1p, however, preliminary data indicate that proteins of different molecular weights are present in the same complex. 2D. Rapaport, unpublished observations. Thus, Fzo1p is likely to be only the first identified component of a much more complex mitochondrial fusion machinery. The precise role of Fzo1p in mitochondrial fusion is still unknown. Our data indicate that it is an integral protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane with the major part of the protein exposed to the cytosol. The exposed part includes the GTPase domain and two predicted coiled-coil regions. Such a topology seems to be ideally suited for a fusion protein that is expected to interact with other proteins on the opposite membrane and/or in the cytosol. It is still unclear whether the C-terminal end of the protein, which carries an additional putative coiled-coil region, may contribute to such interactions. It was not possible to detect a protected C-terminal fragment in Western blots of protease-treated mitochondria or outer membrane vesicles, which would be expected if the C terminus would be in the intermembrane space, or even in the matrix (not shown). One possibility is that Fzo1p itself plays a central role in the recognition of the partner organelle and/or fusion of lipid bilayers. The predicted coiled-coil regions might be the domains mediating such interactions, similar to pairing of cognate SNARE proteins on opposite membranes via coiled-coils. An intact GTPase domain has been shown to be essential for the function of the protein in Drosophila (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Similar to dynamin GTPases, GTP hydrolysis could provide biomechanical energy that could be used for membrane fusion. Alternatively, Fzo1p could be a key regulator for mitochondrial fusion, as many GTPases play regulatory roles in diverse biological processes. Rab GTPases, for example, are important regulators for fusion events in the secretory pathway (34Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Science. 1997; 276: 1212-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The challenge for the future is to identify the components interacting with Fzo1p, and to determine the precise role of Fzo1p and each of its yet unknown partner proteins in mitochondrial membrane fusion.

This is because of the relatively low expression of cGPK in most cell types compared with the relatively high expression of its closest functional homolog, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), and the scarcity of specific cGPK substrates. Unfortunately, the mediating role of cGPK for a given effect/function is often implied or excluded by the use of cGPK activators and/or inhibitors alone, which is clearly insufficient to establish or rule out functional roles of cGPKs (1Francis S.H.

Three distinct phosphorylation sites were biochemically identified in VASP (serine 157, serine 239, and threonine 278) which are usedin vitro and in intact human platelets by both cAPK and cGPK and by the serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2A and 2B with overlapping selectivity (8Butt E.

Phosphorylation of serine 157, the site preferred by the cAPK, leads to a marked shift in apparent molecular mass of VASP in SDS-PAGE from 46 kDa to 50 kDa (6Halbrügge M. Walter U. Eur. J.

In experiments with well characterized protein kinase activators, analysis of the shift in the apparent molecular mass of VASP from 46 to 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE has been helpful in analyzing the preferential activation of both cAPK and cGPK in intact cells (3Lohmann S.M.

However, as already indicated, this shift is caused by the phosphorylation at serine 157, a VASP phosphorylation site used by both cGPK and cAPK but actually preferred by cAPK. In contrast, VASP phosphorylation at serine 239, a sequence representing one of the best in vitrocGPK-preferred phosphorylation sites (8Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been very difficult to assess in intact cells. Here, we describe the development and experimental use of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes VASP only when serine 239 is phosphorylated. The data suggest that this monoclonal antibody allows the quantitative assessment of cGPK activation in intact cells, at least for those systems containing both cGPK and VASP. In addition, the antibody allows the detection of the serine 239-phosphorylated form of VASP in distinct subcellular sites. All standard chemicals were obtained from Merck and Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and oligonucleotides from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Phosphoserine was incorporated during peptide synthesis using Fmoc-Ser(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH (Calbiochem). Peptides were purified to >98% purity by reversed phase chromatography using a Vydac 18TP column. The peptides were conjugated to thiolated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (nanoTools) after activation with bromoacetic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma). Female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin phosphopeptide immunogen (10 μg/animal and injection) four times at 14-day intervals with the first injection in complete Freund's adjuvant and the following injections in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. 2 weeks later, animals were given booster injections (10 μg of immunogen in PBS) on 3 consecutive days. 1 day after the last booster injection, animals were killed, and their spleens were excised. Spleen cells were fused with nonproducer myeloma cells. Hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies specific for phosphorylated VASP were identified initially by differential screening using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides covalently bound to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (DNA-BIND, Costar). Subsequently, immobilized recombinant His6-VASP or His6-VASP phosphorylated in vitro by cGPK was used. Monoclonal antibodies were purified from serum-free cell culture supernatants by thiophilic adsorption chromatography (thiophilic support based on POROS 50-OH, nanoTools). pVSV-VASP is based on the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and encodes human VASP (12Haffner C.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The tag (amino acids YTDIEMNRLGK, preceded by methionine) was fused via a proline to the second amino acid of VASP. In this vector, site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites (serines 157 and 239, threonine 278) to alanines was performed using splice overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. For the mutation of serine 157 to alanine (S157A), the sequence of the mutagenic primer was 5′-GCGCCGGGTCgCgAATGCAGGAGGC-3′ (the mismatches with the wild-type VASP sequence are printed in lowercase). Together with the corresponding reverse primer and primers from the NH2- or the COOH-terminal region of VASP a mutant VASP fragment was amplified and cloned back into the VASP plasmid pVSV-VASP using unique restriction sites. The sequence of the mutagenic primer for the S239A mutant was 5′-CAAACTCAGGAAAGTCgcgAAGCAGGAGGAGG-3′ and for the T278A mutant, 5′-GGAGAAGGAAAGCtgCGCAAGTTGGGG-3′. All mutations and the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments were checked by sequencing. TheEscherichia. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pREP4pQEVASP1 was used for the expression of biologically active VASP as hexahistidine fusion protein of 420 amino acids having a 30-amino acid spacer between the purification tag and the authentic VASP NH2 terminus. Bacterial cell pellets (250-ml cultures) corresponding to a mass of oneA600 × liter were suspended in 20 ml of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme; they were incubated on ice for 30 min and lysed by ultrasonic disintegration in the presence of 5 μg/ml DNase I and 10 μg/ml RNase. The efficiency of lysis was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. After adding 1 m imidazole buffer (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm and adding Triton X-100 to 0.5% the lysate was extracted by stirring on ice for 20 min. The supernatant after centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 10 min was adjusted in NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mm, recentrifuged, and added to a settled bed volume of 1.25 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen; equilibrated previously in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), containing 5% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 8.0))/1 A600× liter of lysed cell mass. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with shaking, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose corresponding to a bed volume of 1.25 ml of a 50% slurry was then washed five times with 6 ml each of ice cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, including protease inhibitors. The beads were carefully drained dry and then batch eluted with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA in three steps each of a 10-min incubation at room temperature in a total elution volume of 1.25 ml. The eluate was then dialyzed in the cold against 1 liter of 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) with 75 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 24 h with three buffer changes. The sample was finally concentrated. cGPK and the catalytic subunit of cAPK were purified as described (24Walter U. Miller P. Wilson F. Menkes D. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Purified recombinant His6-VASP (25 μg/ml) was phosphorylated by a purified catalytic subunit of cAPK (11 μg/ml) or purified cGPK (24 μg/ml) at 30 °C in a 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μm ATP, and (only with cGPK phosphorylation conditions) 20 μm cGMP. Aliquots were taken at various time points, mixed immediately with an SDS-containing stop solution (66.6 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.7) containing 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of bromphenol blue), boiled, and separated on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted as described below. PtK2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) until they were about 50% confluent. Then plasmids containing the cDNA of epitope-tagged wild-type and mutated VASP under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pVSV-VASP) were cotransfected together with an expression vector for cGPK Iβ as described (26Meinecke M. Geiger J. Butt E. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated with 30 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP for 30 min at 37 °C to activate the cGPK Iβ and stimulate VASP phosphorylation. Then, cells were washed and harvested immediately for immunoblotting. Venous blood from human volunteer donors was mixed with citrate buffer (20 mmsodium citrate, 1.4 mm citric acid, 28 mmglucose (pH 6.7)), centrifuged for 20 min at 18 °C and 200 ×g. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was removed, and apyrase (0.1 unit/ml) was added. The PRP was centrifuged for 10 min at 18 °C and 500 × g, the platelet pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm glucose, 5 mm NaOH), and cells were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.7 × 109/ml. Rat platelets were prepared essentially as described for the human platelets with minor modifications: male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized, blood was taken from the vena cava, mixed with citrate buffer (18 mm citrate), and centrifuged for 10 min at 250 × g to obtain the rat PRP. Washed platelets (0.7 × 109 cells/ml) were incubated with prostacyclin (prostaglandin (PG) I2; Wellcome, Beckenham, U.

Then the cells were incubated with PBS alone or with 100 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with PBS and fixed immediately with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once with PBS, and subsequently permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature.

Photographs were taken with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope on Kodak Tri-X-400 film. Three phosphorylation sites have been identified previously in VASP (serine 157, serine 239, and threonine 278) which are phosphorylated by both cAPK and cGPK in vitro and in intact cells with overlapping specificity. As shown in Fig.1, the serine 157 and serine 239 VASP phosphorylation sites are preferred by cAPK and cGPK, respectively. However, with respect to VASP phosphorylation in intact cells, only serine 157 phosphorylation could be monitored effectively by analyzing the electrophoretic shift of VASP from the 46- to the 50-kDa species in SDS-PAGE (6Halbrügge M.

https://openalex.org/W1984474514,"Phagocytosis requires extension of F-actin-rich pseudopods and is accompanied by membrane fusion events. Members of the ARF family of GTPases are essential for many aspects of membrane trafficking. To test a role for this family of proteins in Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, we utilized the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). The addition of 100 μm BFA to a subclone of RAW 264.7 macrophages disrupted the appearance and function of the Golgi apparatus as indicated by altered immunofluorescent distribution of β-COP and reduced efflux of BODIPY C<sub>5</sub>-ceramide, a phospholipid that normally accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, BFA had no effect on phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes. These results suggested that activation of BFA-sensitive ARFs is not required for phagocytosis. ARF6 is unique among members of the ARF family in that its membrane association is unaffected by BFA. Expression of ARF6 mutants defective in either GTP hydrolysis (Q67L) or binding (T27N) inhibited phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes and attenuated the focal accumulation of F-actin beneath the test particles. These results indicate a requirement for ARF6 in Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis and suggest that ARF6 is an important mediator of cytoskeletal alterations after Fcγ receptor activation."

Using poorly understood mechanisms, recurrent tumor cells evade the androgen requirement. We utilized androgen-dependent prostatic tumor cells to demonstrate that androgen exerts its effect on the cell cycle by influencing specific aspects of G1-S progression. Androgen depletion of these cells results in early G1arrest, characterized by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and underphosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). The reduction in kinase activity was partially attributed to reduction of specific G1 cyclins and alternate regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Using this information, we developed a reliable assay to assess the ability of specific G1 regulatory proteins to circumvent these controls and promote androgen-independent growth. As expected, inactivation of RB was required for progression through the cell cycle. Surprisingly, overexpression of G1 cyclins, which drives RB phosphorylation, was insufficient to promote androgen-independent cell cycle progression. Introduction of viral oncoproteins did promote G1-S progression in the absence of androgen, dependent on their ability to sequester RB and related proteins. These results provide the first evidence that multiple elements governing the G1-S transition dictate androgen-dependent growth, and the formation of androgen-independent prostatic tumors may be because of misregulation of these processes.

Prostate. 1996; 28: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 2Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1984; 5: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Montie J.E. Pienta K.J. Urology. 1994; 43: 892-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), resulting in a massive involution of the prostate gland (4Gittes R.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Hormone ablation also results in the death of most primary prostate tumor cells, but this relief is transient, because recurrent tumors usually develop, and the cells of these recurrent tumors are able to proliferate and metastasize in the absence of serum androgen (5Wilding G. Cancer Surv. 1995; 23: 43-62PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of androgens for the growth of prostatic epithelia, the mechanisms of their effect on the stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of cell death remain obscure. Similarly, little is known about how recurrent prostate tumor cells are able to proliferate in the absence of serum androgen. It is known that androgen exerts its biological effects through the androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family (6Jenster G. van der Korput J.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, target genes of the androgen receptor that promote proliferation remain unknown. In this report, we sought to identify downstream targets of the androgen-responsive proliferative pathway by determining the effects of androgen withdrawal on the cell cycle machinery of androgen-dependent cells. In addition, we determined how the requirement for androgen might be circumvented by misregulation of specific cell cycle pathways. While in G1, mammalian cells evaluate growth-promoting and/or growth-inhibitory environmental cues to either progress through the mitotic cell cycle or enter into quiescence (7Pardee A.B.

Extracellular signals ultimately impinge on cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseCDIcyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFBSfetal bovine serumCDTcharcoal dextran-treated FBSDHTdihydrotestosteroneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinT-AgT-antigenRBretinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteinLPlarge pocket of RB.1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseCDIcyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFBSfetal bovine serumCDTcharcoal dextran-treated FBSDHTdihydrotestosteroneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinT-AgT-antigenRBretinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteinLPlarge pocket of RB. which dictate transitions into and within the proliferative cell cycle (9Nigg E.A.

The activity of these kinases is regulated at many levels, including (i) both inhibitory and stimulatory phosphorylation events; (ii) binding to cyclins; and (iii) binding to CDK inhibitors (11Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar, 12Hunter T. Pines J.

Cell cycle progression in G1 is regulated by the activity of cyclin D-, E-, and A-associated CDKs. D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) are the earliest of the cyclins to accumulate in the cell cycle, and once produced, they associate with and promote the activation of their CDK partners, CDK4 or CDK6 (13Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar, 14Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Subsequent to CDK4(6)-cyclin D activation, cyclin E accumulates and activates CDK2 for progression through G1. Cyclin A, whose expression is initiated temporally after cyclin E in late G1, associates with both CDK2 (S phase) and CDC2 (late S and G2). Cyclin A-associated kinases are required not only for progression through late G1 but also for completion of S phase (10Peeper D.S. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar). All three G1 cyclins shorten the G1 phase when ectopically expressed and are required for progression from G1 to S phase (15Resnitzky D. Hengst L. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4347-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulation by cyclin association and phosphorylation, mammalian CDKs are regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDIs). These molecules attenuate the kinase activity of CDKs by binding directly with active CDK-cyclin complexes or by competing with cyclin for binding to CDKs (12Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). The CDIs can be divided into two families, the INK4 family (p16ink4a , p15ink4b , p18ink4c , and p19ink4d ), which act early in G1 to inhibit the activity of CDK4 and CDK6, and the CIP family (p21cip1 , p27kip1 , and p57kip2), which inhibit a large number of CDK-cyclin complexes (17Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The principal substrates for G1 cyclin-associated kinase activity appear to be the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB, and the related proteins p107 and p130 (collectively deemed the “pocket proteins”) (18Sidle A. Palaty C. Dirks P. Wiggan O. Kiess M. Gill R.M. Wong A.K. Hamel P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 237-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prior to their phosphorylation by G1 CDKs, RB, p107, and p130 are believed to prevent progression to S phase by sequestering key proteins required for DNA synthesis, such as the E2F family of heterodimeric transcription factors (19Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). E2F regulates the expression of a number of genes required for cell cycle expression, for example, cyclin E, cyclin A, and DNA polymerase α (20DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 21Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Binding of RB to specific E2F family members results in repression of these E2F-responsive genes, thus preventing S phase initiation. Upon phosphorylation of RB, E2F and other S phase promoting proteins are released and activated (19Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 21Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although cyclin E and cyclin A-associated complexes are hypothesized to phosphorylate substrates in addition to RB, a large body of evidence supports the notion that the main function of CDK4-cyclin D or CDK6-cyclin D complexes is to phosphorylate RB (13Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). Specifically, CDK4-associated kinase activity is no longer required for cell cycle progression in RB-deficient cells (23Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although initiation of RB phosphorylation is initially catalyzed by the G1cyclin-associated CDKs, cyclin B-associated complexes (CDC2-cyclin B), which promote G2/M transition, are thought to also contribute to the post-S phase maintenance of RB phosphorylation. In fact, phosphorylation of RB is maintained until the completion of mitosis, at which time RB is dephosphorylated to allow the cells to enter a new G1 phase or to exit the cell cycle (22Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, although phosphorylation of RB by the G1 CDKs is required to traverse the G1-S transition, it is not sufficient for S phase progression. This fact is evident in that (i) RB-negative cells still require growth factors for cell cycle progression (24Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O. Maleka T.P. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar); (ii) premature G1 cyclin expression shortens G1 but does not eliminate the requirement of the cell for growth factors (15Resnitzky D. Hengst L. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4347-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar); and (iii) specific late-G1 arrested cells contain hyperphosphorylated RB (26Chen Y. Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1765-1771PubMed Google Scholar). As such, mechanisms separate from the regulation of RB phosphorylation must contribute to the control of cell cycle progression. Here, we sought to determine the effects of androgens on the regulation of key cell cycle regulatory proteins and to elucidate cell cycle pathways that may be deregulated to achieve androgen-independent growth. We utilized cultured LNCaP human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells (27Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M. Papsidero L. Kim U. Chai L.S. Kakati S. Arya S.K. Sandberg A.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 37: 115-132PubMed Google Scholar), which retain most of the features common to androgen-responsive tumor cells, especially: (i) the expression of both the androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (28Montgomery B.T.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3474-3481PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) formation of tumors in male mice but only weakly in castrated male mice or female mice (27Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M. Papsidero L. Kim U. Chai L.S. Kakati S. Arya S.K. Sandberg A.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 37: 115-132PubMed Google Scholar, 31Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) growth arrest upon androgen removal (32Berchem G.J. Bosseler M. Sugars L.Y. Voeller H.J. Zeitlin S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 735-738PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented provide the first evidence that multiple G1 elements are responsive to the presence of androgen and act to prevent G1-S progression in its absence. Surprisingly, these regulatory mechanisms cannot be circumvented through the ectopic expression of G1 cyclins. However, oncoproteins capable of sequestering pocket proteins rendered prostatic carcinoma cells androgen-independent for proliferation. Thus, although androgen acts as a growth stimulus for prostatic cells, it does so in a manner that is distinct from that of many mitogens. The human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line, LNCaP, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and passages 25–39 were used in the experiments described. For regular passage, cells were grown in Improved Minimum Essential Medium (Biofluids) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For growth in androgen-depleted media, cells were propagated in improved minimum essential medium containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Dihydrotestosterone (Steraloids), when added, was diluted in ethanol and then medium and used at a final concentration of 0.1 nm(ethanol was less than 0.1% in the medium). Medium containing hormone and/or ethanol was changed every 48 h. For growth analysis, cells were seeded at a density of 2–3 × 104 cells/well in poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well dishes, and medium was changed every 48 h. At the times indicated, cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline lacking calcium and magnesium (MediaTech) and harvested using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell numbers were each determined using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion. All conditions were tested in triplicate, and the averages/deviations are shown. Poly-l-lysine coating was carried out by incubating freshly diluted 0.001% poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in H2O on the desired substrate for 20–30 min in a sterile tissue culture hood. After incubation, poly-l-lysine was completely aspirated, and substrates were thoroughly dried. Poly-l-lysine had no effect on the growth or cell cycle profile of LNCaP cells, under all conditions used (data not shown). Plasmid expressing the green fluorescent protein, pGreen Lantern, was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. pRSV-T-antigen was a gift of Dr. Suresh Subramani (University of California at San Diego). Plasmids expressing the SV40 early region and corresponding mutants (WT-T-Ag, PVU1-T-Ag, K1-T-Ag, and 2831-T-Ag) were kindly provided by Dr. Charles Cole (Dartmouth University) and have been previously described (33Zhu J. Rice P.W. Chamberlain M. Cole C.N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids WT-E1A, CXDL-E1A, and Δ30–85-E1A, which express E1A constructs from the cytomegalovirus promoter, were obtained from Dr. David Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Plasmids expressing the E1A splice variants 12 S and 13 S from the cytomegalovirus promoter were obtained from Dr. Gilbert Morris (Tulane University). Plasmids expressing WT-LP, PSM.7-LP, cyclin A, and p16ink4a from the cytomegalovirus promoter were generous gifts of Dr. Jean Wang (University of California at San Diego) and have been previously described (34Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 expression constructs (expressed from the Rous sarcoma virus promoter) were obtained from Dr. Charles Sherr (St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital) (35Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The cyclin E expression construct (expressed from a long terminal repeat) was obtained from Dr. James Roberts (Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center) (36Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). For transfection, LNCaP cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in poly-l-lysine-coated wells of 6-well dishes (or poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips resting in 6-well dishes). After 48 h, wells were washed one time with serum-free and antibiotic-free improved minimum essential medium. Transfection substrate (1 ml of serum-free/antibiotic-free improved minimum essential medium, 30 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μg of DNA) was then applied and allowed to incubate for 6 h, after which the serum-containing medium indicated was added back. To monitor protein expression, cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Co-transfection of pCMV-LP and the cyclin expression constructs were performed with a 1:2 ratio of plasmid DNA. To monitor S phase progression, co-transfections with pGreen Lantern (1.0 μg) and a secondary effector expression plasmid (4.0 μg) were carried out. Cells were labeled 48 h after transfection with cell proliferation labeling reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to manufacturer's recommended protocol. Pulse labeling was continued for 14 h, at which time cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. LNCaP cells were propagated under the conditions described and harvested at the times shown by trypsinization, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide as described previously (37Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of the stained cells was carried out using a FACSort (Becton Dickinson) and the CELLFit software program. At least 10,000 forward scatter gated events were collected for each sample, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. To monitor BrdUrd incorporation of both transfected and untransfected cells, cells were fixed and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (38Knudsen E.S. Pazzagli C. Born T.L. Bertolaet B. Knudsen K.E. Arden K.C. Henry R.R. Feramisco J.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2042-2049PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot with a 40× objective, and pictures were captured using a Color Chilled 3CCD Camera (Hamamatsu). For immunoblotting, 2–4 × 106 cells were harvested at the times indicated by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml 1, 10 phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phophatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 15 min on ice. Following brief sonication, lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g(4 °C for 15 min). Protein concentration of the clarified lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Reagent. Lysates were denatured by boiling in SDS loading buffer, and 20 μg of each sample was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) by standard methods. Blots were probed for the following proteins with polyclonal antibodies: RB and LP (851, gift of Dr. Jean Wang, University of California at San Diego); p130 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CDK4 (H-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin D3 (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin A (BF683, PharMingen); cyclin E (HE12, PharMingen); p21 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p27 (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p16 (G175–405, PharMingen); T-Ag (Pab 101, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and E1A (13 S-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase or protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was used for antibody visualization via enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro kinase assays, 2–4 × 106 cells from each condition indicated were harvested by trypsinization and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. To analyze CDK2-associated kinase activity, cells were lysed as in ice-cold IPCDC2 buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 130 mmsodium chloride, and 1% Triton X-100) containing the above mentioned protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After sonication and clarification, 200 μg of lysate was incubated for 2 h (4 °C with rotation) with anti-CDK2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-VEGF antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a negative control. Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Washes and kinase reactions were carried out as described previously (39Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8278-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Histone H1 substrate was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To analyze CDK4-associated kinase activity, cells were lysed in ice-cold cyclin D lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 80% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing the above mentioned protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After brief sonication and clarification, 200 μg of lysate was precleared using normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose. After preclearing, lysates were incubated for 2 h (4 °C with rotation) with anti-CDK4 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-VEGF antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a negative control. Washes and kinase reactions were carried out as described previously (40LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). A glutathioneS-transferase fusion of the C terminus of RB was used as substrate and was generously provided by Dr. Erik Knudsen (University of California at San Diego). Relative kinase activity signals were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Although LNCaP cells have been shown to be dependent on androgen for growth (27Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M. Papsidero L. Kim U. Chai L.S. Kakati S. Arya S.K. Sandberg A.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 37: 115-132PubMed Google Scholar, 31Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms for this have not been determined. To address this, we first characterized the growth of LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of serum androgen (Fig. 1). Subconfluent, exponentially growing cultures of LNCaP cells propagated in complete serum (FBS) were harvested and equally seeded into media containing one of three serum conditions: (i) 5% FBS; (ii) 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS (CDT); or (iii) 5% CDT supplemented with 0.1 nmdihydrotestosterone (DHT). As shown in Fig. 1 A, cells grown in complete serum exhibited a generation time of approximately 48 h. However, cells cultured in serum stripped of steroid hormone (CDT) demonstrated no increase in cell number up to 8 days post-treatment. This growth arrest was partially reversed by addition of nearly physiological levels (41Saroff J. Kirdani R.Y. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z. Murphy J.P. Oncology. 1980; 37: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Wenderoth U.K. George F.W. Wilson J.D. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) of DHT, as expected based on previous reports (29Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G.

Prostate. 1995; 26: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also in agreement with previous reports, the proliferation rate of cells propagated in CDT serum supplemented with DHT is not as robust as that of cells propagated in complete serum (32Berchem G.J. Bosseler M. Sugars L.Y. Voeller H.J. Zeitlin S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 735-738PubMed Google Scholar,43Ravenna L. Lubrano C. Di Silverio F. Vacca A. Felli M.P. Maroder M. D'Eramo G. Sciarra F. Frati L. Gulino A. Petrangeli E. Prostate. 1995; 26: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similar results are observed when comparing the growth of estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma cells in CDT supplemented with estrogen versus complete serum (44El-Ashry D. Miller D.L. Kharbanda S. Lippman M.E. Kern F.G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that optimal cellular proliferation could be achieved upon readdition of multiple steroids or factors, only DHT was added back to allow for clear study of androgen-dependent proliferation. Cells grown in CDT supplemented with DHT demonstrated a doubling time of approximately 72 h when medium changes were carried out every 48 h. Growth of “androgen-independent” human prostate tumor cell lines DU-145, PC-3, and TSU-Pr1 demonstrated no decrease in their growth rates when cultured in the absence of androgen (data not shown), confirming that the growth arrest of LNCaP cells cultured in CDT is unique to prostate cells still dependent on androgen for growth (29Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 32Berchem G.J.

We then used this system to analyze the growth arrest elicited in LNCaP cells by propagation in the absence of androgen. To determine the cell cycle stage at which these cells arrest, propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed. Approximately 65–68% of the cells exponentially growing in the presence of whole serum contained 2 n DNA content (G1 profile) at each of the points analyzed (data not shown). Cells from the same exponentially growing culture that were subsequently cultured in androgen-depleted serum had a significant increase in the G1 pop"
https://openalex.org/W2125576777,"The crystal structure of tetrameric pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution and refined to a crystallographicR-factor of 16.2% and Rfree of 19.7%. The subunit consists of three domains, all of the α/β type. Two of the subunits form a tight dimer with an extensive interface area. The thiamin diphosphate binding site is located at the subunit-subunit interface, and the cofactor, bound in the V conformation, interacts with residues from the N-terminal domain of one subunit and the C-terminal domain of the second subunit. The 2-fold symmetry generates the second thiamin diphosphate binding site in the dimer. Two of the dimers form a tightly packed tetramer with pseudo 222 symmetry. The interface area between the dimers is much larger in pyruvate decarboxylase from Z. mobilis than in the yeast enzyme, and structural differences in these parts result in a completely different packing of the subunits in the two enzymes. In contrast to other pyruvate decarboxylases, the enzyme from Z. mobilis is not subject to allosteric activation by the substrate. The tight packing of the dimers in the tetramer prevents large rearrangements in the quaternary structure as seen in the yeast enzyme and locks the enzyme in an activated conformation. The architecture of the cofactor binding site and the active site is similar in the two enzymes.

The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide but is also able to utilize other 2-oxo acids as substrates. The obligatory fermentative Gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis uses only hexoses as carbon sources for glycolysis and produces ethanol and carbon dioxide via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (1Bringer-Meyer S. Schimz K.L. Sahm H. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 105-110Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this organism, PDC amounts to 4% of the total soluble protein and to 10% of the extractable protein after cell lysis (1Bringer-Meyer S. Schimz K.L. Sahm H. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 105-110Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There appears to be only one gene coding for this enzyme in Z. mobilis (2Neale A.D. Scopes R.K. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hoogenraad N.J. J.

In solution, native ZmPDC is a tetramer of four identical subunits, and each subunit consists of 568 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa (1Bringer-Meyer S. Schimz K.L. Sahm H. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 105-110Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Neale A.D. Scopes R.K. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hoogenraad N.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Every subunit binds a set of cofactors (ThDP and Mg(II) ions) very tightly but not covalently at pH 6.0, the optimum for catalytic activity. The mechanism of cofactor binding in ZmPDC is similar to that for the yeast enzyme (1Bringer-Meyer S. Schimz K.L. Sahm H. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 105-110Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Diefenbach R.J. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cofactors stabilize the quaternary structure in a wide range of pH from 4.6 to 8.5, but more alkaline conditions lead to complete loss of catalytic activity because of dissociation of the cofactors (4Pohl M. Mesch K. Rodenbrock A. Kula M.-R. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1995; 22: 95-105Google Scholar). A common feature of pyruvate decarboxylases, with the exception of ZmPDC, is their allosteric regulation by the substrate or other activator molecules such as pyruvamide (5Hübner G. Weidhase R. Schellenberger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Dietrich A. König S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of yeast PDC revealed considerable differences in the tetramer assembly between enzyme species obtained in the absence (7Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B.

Cross-linking and small angle x-ray solution scattering experiments also indicated significant tetramer reassembly and conformational changes during substrate activation in yeast PDC (10König S.

Here, we present the crystal structure of recombinant PDC from Z. mobilis at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystallographic study reveals a novel, as yet unobserved tetramer assembly in pyruvate decarboxylases. Comparison of the quaternary structures of PDC from Z. mobilis and yeast suggests that the structural differences in the interface regions might be related to the differences in their kinetic behavior. In addition, the crystallographic analysis provides further insights into the structural basis of catalysis and substrate specificity in pyruvate decarboxylases. The gene coding for ZmPDC was expressed in the Escherichia coli SG13009 prep4 strain containing the Z. mobilis gene ATCC 29191. This strain was kindly provided by Dr. Martina Pohl (Institut für Enzymtechnologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf). Expression of the PDC gene was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosylpyranoside in the late exponential growth phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted in a French Press (SLM Instruments, Inc.). Ammonium sulfate precipitation was carried out in two steps (30 and 42% w/v ammonium sulfate, respectively). The precipitate from the last step, which contains crude pyruvate decarboxylase, was suspended in 10 mm Mes/NaOH, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm ThDP, 1 mm dithioerythitol and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The enzyme solution was applied to Fraktogel EMD TMAE (S) (Merck, column 2.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer without ThDP and MgSO4 (flow rate 1 ml/min). The protein was eluted with a linear ammonium sulfate gradient (0–40 mm in 100 ml) at 4 °C. The purest fractions showed PDC activity of 100–120 units/mg and about 95% homogeneity in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These fractions were collected and concentrated to 30–40 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Simultaneously, the buffer was changed to 10 mm sodium citrate pH 6.0. The concentrated protein solution was stored at −20 °C without significant loss of activity. ZmPDC was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Droplets were set up for crystallization by mixing 4 μl of solution containing 13 mg/ml protein and 1 mm dithioerythitol with 4 μl of the reservoir solution containing 100 mm Mes/NaOH, pH 6.5, and 24% (w/v) PEG 1500. Tiny crystals were obtained within 10 days at 20 °C. Streak seeding was used to improve crystal size. The above protein solution containing 5 mm ThDP, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm dithioerythitol was mixed with reservoir solution of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and 19–22% (w/v) PEG 1500 and pre-equilibrated for 2 days. After seeding, crystals appeared within a few hours and grew to a maximum size of 0.7 × 0.5 × 0.2 mm in 3 days. The crystals were soaked in a solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 22.5% (w/v) PEG 1500 and 17% (v/v) glycerol for 5 min and transferred into a cryogenic nitrogen gas stream at 110 K. The x-ray diffraction data sets were collected on a MAR research image plate mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode, operating at 50 kV and 90 mA. Data processing was carried out by the DENZO/SCALEPACK packages (13Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, SERC, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the triclinic space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 69.9 Å,b = 92.0 Å, and c = 98.0 Å, α = 103.7 °, β = 94.5 °, γ = 112.3 °. There are four ZmPDC monomers in one asymmetric unit, resulting in a packing density of 2.7 Å3/Da.

The structure of ZmPDC was determined by molecular replacement using a model of form B 2“Form A” and “form B” ScPDC denote yeast pyruvate decarboxylase crystallized in the absence or presence of the allosteric activator, pyruvamide. ScPDC refined at 2.4 Å (9Lu G. Dobritzsch D. König S. Schneider G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 3D. Dobritzsch, S. König, G. Schneider, and G. Lu, unpublished observation. which shares only 28% sequence identity with ZmPDC. Orientation and positions of the molecules were determined using the AMORE program (14Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1992; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) with a yeast PDC dimer as a search model. Both self- and cross-rotation functions were calculated with x-ray data in the resolution interval 10–3 Å with an integration radius of 30 Å. Two orientation solutions were found with correlation coefficients 0.125 and 0.118, respectively (1.8 times the highest noise peak). With the position of one dimer fixed in the P1 space group, a cross-translation function using the data in the 10–3 Å resolution range determined the relative position of the other dimer with a correlation coefficient of 0.173 (1.3 times the highest noise peak) and an R-factor of 0.52. A test set of 4% of the reflections was excluded before starting any crystallographic refinement to monitor the Rfreevalue. Rigid body refinement was carried out with XPLOR (15Brunger A. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) using data in the 15–2.4 Å resolution interval. The resulting model (Rfree = 0.50) was used for NCS averaging with the Dm program (16Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and the Rave packages (18Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 99-105Google Scholar). Based on the averaged electron density maps, the model was rebuilt using the O program (19Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 100-119Google Scholar), and the ZmPDC sequence was fitted to the electron density map. Atomic positions and B-factors of the model were refined with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints using REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13853) Google Scholar), and the model was rebuilt according to the resulting averaged electron density map. Iterations of the procedure were performed with the resolution gradually extended to 1.86 Å. When theRfree value had dropped to 27.5% and most of protein atoms were defined, 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc maps were used for further inspection of the model. NCS restraints were released for several residues as indicated by the electron density map. Most water molecules were added automatically using the PEAKMAX program in CCP4 (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), the PEAKCHECK program (written by J. Smith), and the WATNCS program. 4G. Lu,http://gamma.mbb.ki.se/∼guoguang/watncs.html. NCS restraints were introduced for most of the water molecules in the refinement. Additional solvent molecules that did not follow NCS were added by visual examination of the electron density map in the final stage. Errors in the model were found automatically fromFo − Fc maps by the DIFLIST program 5G. Lu, manuscript in preparation. and corrected on the display using O. At this stage, it became obvious that the bound cofactor had undergone chemical degradation in the ZmPDC crystals, and a model of an ThDP analogue with an open thiazolium ring was introduced. Citrate molecules were modelled as well as double conformations for some of the amino acid residues.

Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) were carried out using the TOP program (23Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible surface was analyzed with the VOIDOO (24Klejwegt G. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) and the AREAIMOL (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) programs. Enzymatic activity was assayed at 30 °C and 340 nm with a NADH/ADH coupled test in 100 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.1, according to Holzer et al. (25Holzer H. Schultz G. Villar-Palasi C. Jüntgen-Sell J. Biochem. Z. 1956; 327: 331-344PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is the quantity of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (ε = 275 320m−1 cm−1). The crystal structure of ZmPDC was determined by molecular replacement. Electron density maps calculated from crude models at different stages of the refinement allowed tracing of the polypeptide chains, even for those parts where the ZmPDC chain is quite different in structure compared with ScPDC. The final model of ZmPDC in the asymmetric unit is a homotetramer of four monomers related by pseudo 222 symmetry. The model contains 4 × 565 amino acids, (comprising residues 2–566), four chemically modified ThDP molecules, four Mg(II) ions and four citrate molecules, and a total of 2569 water molecules. Most of these solvent molecules (2448) fully or partially follow the pseudo symmetry. The structure of ZmPDC was refined to an R-factor of 16.2% and an Rfree value of 19.7% using all the data between 15–1.86 Å with good stereochemistry (for detailed statistics see Table II). The electron density map was of very good quality (Fig.1) and allowed location of almost all protein atoms, except the N-terminal methionine and the two C-terminal residues. Electron densities were poor or weak for side chain atoms of several residues, including Glu227 and Asp530in all subunits, Lys523 in three and Glu520 in one of the subunits. All of these residues are exposed to solvent on the protein surface. Double conformations were found for two residues in all the subunits, Lys553 located on the protein surface and Ile472 at the active site. In total, four amino acid sequences of ZmPDC have been published (26Reynen M. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3310-3313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Conway T. Osman Y.A. Konnan J.I. Hoffman E.M.

Biochem. 1992; 15: 192-206PubMed Google Scholar). Although only one ZmPDC gene has been identified so far (2Neale A.D. Scopes R.K. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hoogenraad N.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), all these sequences differ from each other at a few positions. None of these sequences completely matched the electron density map, and the amino acid sequence of our final model (listed in Fig. 4 B) is slightly different from all the templates. The amino acid sequence determined by protein sequencing (29Miczka G. Vernau J. Kula M.-R. Hofmann B. Schomburg D. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1992; 15: 192-206PubMed Google Scholar) required the fewest changes to be consistent with the electron density map (Glu200 → Asp, Asn256 → Leu, and Ala341 → Ser). In the present model, 92.1% of the amino acid residues are located in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. One residue, Ser74, is located in the disallowed region in all four subunits. This residue is, however, well defined in its electron density. ZmPDC is a homotetramer with an overall size of approximately 85 × 98 × 118 Å. Each monomer can be divided into three domains, denoted as PYR (residues 1–188), R (residues 189–354), and PP (residues 355–568) domains, 6To facilitate comparison, we are using the nomenclature defined by Muller et al. (34Muller Y. Lindqvist Y. Furey W. Schulz G.E. Jordan F. Schneider G. Structure. 1993; 1: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to identify the various domains in ThDP-dependent enzymes. each with an open α/β topology (Fig. 2). The nomenclature of the secondary structural elements is shown in Figs. 2and 4 B. No significant structural differences were found between the subunits, except for the side chains of about 20 residues, which are involved in the crystal packing. Two of the monomers are tightly bound to each other and are related by 2-fold symmetry. The extensive interface in the dimer comprises about 4400 Å2, corresponding to 19.4% of the surface area of the monomer. Most of the amino acid residues building up this interface are from the PYR and PP domains, but residues 286–290 of the R domain also are part of this region. In total, 7 pairs of salt bridges, 66 pairs of hydrogen bonds, and extensive hydrophobic interactions are formed between the two subunits. Two such dimers further form a tetramer with pseudo 222 symmetry, with an interface area of 4400 Å2 (12.4% of the dimer surface). All three domains of each subunit are involved in these interfaces. The interactions between the two dimers include 25 sets of salt bridges and 64 sets of hydrogen bonds. At the dimer-dimer interface some narrow but extensive cavities are formed, part of which are occupied by a large number of ordered water molecules. The interactions between the two dimers are not as tight as at the monomer-monomer interface so that the ZmPDC tetramer can be described as a dimer of dimers, similar to ScPDC (7Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6165-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30König S. Svergun D. Koch M.H.J. Hübner G. Schellenberger A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8726-8731Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The four identical subunits, in combination with the pseudo 222 symmetry of the tetramer, generate four cofactor and substrate binding sites in the ZmPDC molecule. The ThDP and substrate binding sites are located in narrow clefts at the interfaces formed by the PYR domains from one subunit and the PP domains of another subunit. The ThDP binding site is deeply buried inside the molecule, about 15 Å away from the protein surface. The cofactor is bound in the V conformation as found in other ThDP-dependent enzymes such as ScPDC (7Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6165-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), transketolase (31Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Ermler U. Sundström M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and POX (22Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The pyrimidine ring of ThDP interacts with the PYR domain of one subunit, whereas the residual part interacts with the PP domain of another subunit. The Mg(II) ion anchors the diphosphate group of ThDP to the protein, and it forms an octahedral coordination sphere with two oxygen atoms of the diphosphate group of ThDP, the side chain oxygen atoms of Asp440 and Asn467, the main chain oxygen atom of Gly469, and a water molecule (Fig. 3). During the refinement, it became clear that the ThDP molecule bound to the ZmPDC crystals was a chemically modified analogue of ThDP rather than the cofactor itself. The electron density maps showed no electron density between the assumed position of the C2 carbon atom of the thiazolium ring and the neighboring sulfur and nitrogen atoms, indicating that the bond between these atoms was broken (Fig. 1,bottom). In addition, negative difference electron density was observed at the position of the C2 carbon atom, indicating that the thiazolium ring had been opened and that the C2 carbon atom had been lost. Positive difference electron density was found close to the 4′ amino group of the pyrimidine ring, which has been interpreted as a water molecule tightly bound to the amino group via a hydrogen bond. The well defined electron density for the remaining parts of ThDP, the diphosphate and pyrimidine moieties, does not indicate any significant further chemical modification or degradation (Fig. 1,bottom) and suggests that the bound species might beN-(2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidyl)-N-(1-methyl-2-thiol but(1)en-4-diphosphatidyl) amide. Analysis by mass spectrometry of the ThDP analogue isolated by HPLC from redissolved crystals revealed a mass difference consistent with the loss of a methine carbon atom. The apparent selectivity in binding the acyclic analogue of ThDP most likely reflects the inability of cofactor exchange in the crystals rather than preferential binding. In the crystals, ThDP is buried deeply in its binding site, and cofactor release would require large conformational changes, which are prevented by the crystal packing. Analysis of redissolved crystals of ZmPDC showed that the catalytic activity had been lost. Only when redissolved enzyme was incubated with fresh ThDP under conditions where cofactor exchange can take place could we restore about 55% of the original activity. The modification of bound ThDP is not induced by x-ray radiation during data collection, because loss of catalytic activity is also observed in crystals not exposed to x-ray radiation. It thus appears that during crystallization of ZmPDC, a partial degradation of ThDP occurs leading to an inactive cofactor analogue. The tendency to undergo hydrolytic cleavage of the thiazolium ring is an established feature of thiamin and related compounds (32Zoltewicz J.A. Uray G. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 2104-2108Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For instance, ring opening can proceed through the formation of a pseudobase by nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on the C2 carbon atom (33Duclos J.M. Haake P. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5358-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In ZmPDC crystals, the initial nucleophilic attack on the C2 carbon could be delivered by the water molecule that is in hydrogen bonding distance to the 4-amino group. The nucleophilicity of this water molecule could be increased through interactions with the neighboring side chain of His114, which probably is uncharged (see below) and can act as a proton abstractor. The chemical steps that lead to the loss of the C2 carbon atom after ring opening are less clear and require further study. In view of the observed loss of activity in redissolved crystals (restored by the addition of fresh ThDP) and the compelling evidence that thiamin catalysis proceeds though the cyclic thiazolium ion and not an ring-opened form of thiamin (see for example Ref. 33Duclos J.M. Haake P. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5358-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we consider the acyclic analogue of ThDP at the active site an artifact and not a species of mechanistic relevance. During the crystallographic refinement, strong electron density that did not represent any protein atoms was found at the dimer-dimer interface. The shape of the electron density and the high concentration of buffer ions lead us to interpret this residual electron density as citrate molecules. The four citrate ions might contribute to the tetramer assembly by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds to protein side chains. The three carboxyl groups of each citrate molecule form salt bridges with five residues from two subunits, His150, Lys153, and Arg157 from one subunit and Arg310 and Arg318 from another subunit. In addition, several water molecules link citrate and protein atoms through hydrogen bonds, providing further stabilizing interactions. The overall topology of the subunit of ZmPDC is very similar to that of ScPDC. However, the orientation between the three domains is slightly different to the orientation observed in the two forms of ScPDC, and these relative shifts correspond to rotations of approximately 6–8 ° (Table III). Furthermore, considerable differences were found in the number of secondary structural elements. When superposing the individual domains between the two enzymes, it was found that 7 of the 24 α-helices in ZmPDC differ considerably with respect to length and orientation from their counterparts in ScPDC (Fig. 4). In general, structural differences are significantly higher for the R domains than those found for the other two domains. The twist of the β-sheet in this domain is quite different in the two enzyme species, probably because of large differences of amino acid compositions and structures in the loop regions.Table IIIComparison of domain-domain, subunit-subunit relations and interfaces in pyruvate, decarboxylases, and pyruvate oxidaseMode of superpositionZmPDCform A ScPDCform B ScPDCPOXDomai"
https://openalex.org/W2019167328,"Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the inflammatory process by coordinating the recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of tissue injury. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates many of the proinflammatory and procoagulant responses of endothelial cells, and endothelial injury is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to Gram-negative bacteria. The receptor used by LPS to signal endothelial responses has not been identified. It is also not known how LPS induces endothelial injury/death. In this study, we demonstrate that LPS mediates endothelial apoptosis by a FADD-dependent pathway. FADD is a death domain-containing protein that binds to certain members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, namely TNFR1, Fas, and DR3. However, none of these receptors appear to be involved in LPS-mediated death, suggesting that LPS may utilize a novel death domain-containing protein to transduce a death signal."
https://openalex.org/W2003127955,"The neural protein Fe65 possesses three putative protein-protein interaction domains: one WW domain and two phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding domains (PID1 and PID2); the most C-terminal of these domains (PID2) interacts in vivo with the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein, whereas the WW domain binds to Mena, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila-enabled protein. By the interaction trap procedure, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a possible ligand of the N-terminal PID/PTB domain of Fe65 (PID1). Sequence analysis of this clone revealed that this ligand corresponded to the previously identified transcription factor CP2/LSF/LBP1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the interaction between Fe65 and CP2/LSF/LBP1 also takes place in vivo between the native molecules. The localization of both proteins was studied using fractionated cellular extracts. These experiments demonstrated that the various isoforms of CP2/LSF/LBP1 are differently distributed among subcellular fractions. At least one isoform, derived from alternative splicing (LSF-ID), is present outside the nucleus; Fe65 was found in both fractions. Furthermore, transfection experiments with an HA-tagged CP2/LSF/LBP1 cDNA demonstrated that Fe65 interacts also with the nuclear form of CP2/LSF/LBP1. Considering that the analysis of Fe65 distribution in fractionated cell extracts demonstrated that this protein is present both in nuclear and non-nuclear fractions, we examined the expression of Fe65 deletion mutants in the two fractions. This analysis allowed us to observe that a small region N-terminal to the WW domain is phosphorylated and is necessary for the presence of Fe65 in the nuclear fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2128714032,"The time course of removal of thymine by thymine DNA glycosylase has been measured in vitro. Each molecule of thymine DNA glycosylase removes only one molecule of thymine from DNA containing a G.T mismatch because it binds tightly to the apurinic DNA site left after removal of thymine. The 5'-flanking base pair to G.T mismatches influences the rate of removal of thymine: kcat values with C.G, T.A, G.C, and A.T as the 5'-base pair were 0.91, 0.023, 0. 0046, and 0.0013 min-1, respectively. Thymine DNA glycosylase can also remove thymine from mismatches with S6-methylthioguanine, but, unlike G.T mismatches, a 5'-C.G does not have a striking effect on the rate: kcat values for removal of thymine from SMeG.T with C.G, T. A, G.C, and A.T as the 5'-base pair were 0.026, 0.018, 0.0017, and 0. 0010 min-1, respectively. Thymine removal is fastest when it is from a G.T mismatch with a 5'-flanking C.G pair, suggesting that the rapid reaction of this substrate involves contacts between the enzyme and oxygen 6 or the N-1 hydrogen of the mismatched guanine as well as the 5'-flanking C.G pair. Disrupting either of these sets of contacts (i.e. replacing the 5'-flanking C.G base pair with a T.A or replacing the G.T mismatch with SMeG.T) has essentially the same effect on rate as disrupting both sets (i.e. replacing CpG.T with TpSMeG.T), and so these contacts are probably cooperative. The glycosylase removes uracil from G.U, C.U, and T.U base pairs faster than it removes thymine from G.T. It can even remove uracil from A.U base pairs, although at a very much lower rate. Thus, thymine DNA glycosylase may play a backup role to the more efficient general uracil DNA glycosylase."

E protects against vascular diseases (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). Early studies suggest that the protective effect may be related to the ability of apoE to promote cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells and to mediate the clearance of cholesterol-enriched lipoproteins from circulation (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing rat apoE displayed marked resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and did not develop atherosclerosis (2Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K. Gotoda T.

In contrast, mice with targeted disruption of the apoE gene developed spontaneous atherosclerosis even under basal low fat/low cholesterol dietary conditions (4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A.

Atherosclerosis in apoE-null mice could be prevented by increasing circulating apoE level through recombinant adenovirus-mediated apoE gene transfer to the liver (8Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S.

The decrease in atherosclerosis in this model was accompanied by decreased total cholesterol and VLDL/IDL levels (8Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S.

The relationship between apoE and cholesterol transport suggests that it prevents atherosclerosis by lowering of plasma cholesterol level. However, atherosclerosis was found to be more severe in chow-fed apoE-null mice than in cholesterol-fed apoE(+/+) mice, despite the relative similar plasma cholesterol level in the two groups (7Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Additionally, transgenic expression of apoE in the arterial wall inhibited atheroma formation and severity without affecting plasma cholesterol level and lipoprotein profile in cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mice (9Shimano H. Ohsuga J. Shimada M. Namba Y. Gotoda T. Harada K. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although these two studies characterized atherosclerotic lesions based solely on macrophage foam cell deposition, it is noteworthy that increased number of intimal smooth muscle cells was observed in stenotic lesion area of the external carotid artery (10Seo H.S. Lombardi D.M. Polinsky P. Powell-Braxton L. Bunting S. Schwartz S.M. Rosenfeld M.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3593-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and fibroproliferative atherosclerotic plaques of chow-fed apoE-null mice (11Dansky H.M. Charlton S.A. Harper M.M. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4642-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that apoE may have direct impact on vascular occlusive diseases in a manner in addition to, and independent of, its property as a cholesterol-transporting apolipoprotein. Recently, apoE gene polymorphism has been shown to correlate with risk of restenosis after balloon angioplasty (12van Bockxmeer F.M. Mamotte C.D.S. Gibbons F.R. Taylor R.R. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 195-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because lipid deposition and foam cell formation is a late event in restenosis, this correlation adds support to the hypothesis that apoE may have cell regulatory functions in the vessel wall. A prominent vascular abnormality observed in both spontaneous atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty is the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the medial layer of the blood vessel to its intima, followed by proliferation of the intimal smooth muscle cells. These processes are regulated by growth factors released from cells within the injured artery or from circulating cells in plasma. Potent mitogens and chemoattractants that participate in vascular disease include PDGF and oxLDL. These reagents direct migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima of the vessel and induce proliferation of the intimal smooth muscle cells (13Bornfeldt K. Raines E.

The mechanism of cell activation is reported to be mediated via the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (15Graf K. Xi X.P. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because apoE has been shown to inhibit mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation through suppression of early cell signaling events (16Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11775-11781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the current study is undertaken to explore the possibility that apoE may protect against vascular diseases by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Human recombinant PDGF-BB, FBS, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). [Methyl-3H]thymidine, [(γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and125I-PDGF-BB were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Activated MAP kinase, insulin-regulated phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein (PHAS-I), the MAP kinase assay kit, and Quikhyb™ hybridization solution were products of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Cell Titer 96™ AQueous cell proliferation assay kit was purchased from Promega, Inc. (Madison, WI). The embryonic rat aortic smooth muscle-derived A7r5 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Transwell chambers with gelatin-treated polycarbonate membranes were obtained from Corning Coster Corp. (Cambridge, MA). The A7r5 cells were grown in monolayer cultures on plastic tissue culture-treated multiple well cluster plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere and were used for experiments between passages 3–12. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were grown in smooth muscle cell growth medium provided by the supplier. Cells were used for experiments between passages 5 and 8. In all experiments, the cells were made quiescent by incubating for 48 h in the presence of 0.4% FBS prior to use. Human apoE was isolated from fresh plasma obtained from normal healthy volunteers as detailed by Rall et al. (17Rall S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purity of the apoE preparation was verified based on a single band withMr = 34,000 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 gm/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and was stored in saline-EDTA solution (18Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification was undertaken by dialyzing the LDL against saline without EDTA and then incubating the lipoproteins with 5 μmol/L copper sulfate for 48 h at 37 °C. The oxidative modification was confirmed by 37 °C electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels. The migration of smooth muscle cells was examined according to the procedure described by Lawet al. (19Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in DMEM with 0.4% FBS at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were preincubated with 0, 25, or 50 μg/ml apoE for 30 min at 37 °C, and 0.1-ml aliquots of the cell suspension (2 × 104 cells) were added to the top chamber of gelatin-treated Transwell polycarbonate membrane with 8-μm pores in 24-well plates. The lower Transwell compartment contained 0.6 ml of DMEM, 0.4% FBS, with or without PDGF-BB or oxLDL. Incubation was continued for 4 h at 37 °C, after which the adherent cells were washed extensively, fixed with methanol, and then stained with hematoxylin. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of each filter was counted in different high power fields (HPFs) at a magnification of 320. Cells were plated at a cell density of 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture dishes and then incubated for 48 h in DMEM with 0.4% FBS to synchronize cells at the quiescent state. The cells were incubated for 20 h with PDGF-BB or oxLDL in the presence or absence of apoE. One μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium and the incubation was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation at 4 °C in 25% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min. The plates were washed three times with cold 25% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of 0.25 n NaOH. Radioactivity in the cell lysate was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Smooth muscle cell proliferation was also assessed based on the ability of the cells to convert MTS into formazan, using the AQueous Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. In these experiments, 5 × 103 quiescent A7r5 or human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in 96-well tissue culture dishes were incubated for 24 h with or without PDGF-BB or oxLDL and in the presence or absence of apoE prior to the addition of 20 μl of MTS mixed with the electron-coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate. Incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. Formazan formation was measured based on increased absorbance at 490 nm. Quiescent A7r5 cells plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes were pre-incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, with or without addition of 25 or 50 μg/ml apoE or 200 ng/ml PDGF-BB. At the end of this incubation period, 120 pmol/liter of 125I-PDGF-BB was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with cold Hanks' solution and then solubilized with 1 ml of solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The radioactivity associated with the cell lysate was quantitated in a gamma counter. Specific binding was determined as the total amount of 125I-PDGF-BB bound to the cells minus the nonspecific binding observed in the presence of excess unlabeled PDGF-BB. A cDNA probe for rat cyclin D1 was prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of mRNA isolated from proliferating cells. The forward oligonucleotide primer (5′-CTGACTGCCGAGAAGTTGTGCATC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTGGCTCCTTTCTCTTCGCGATG-3′) were designed based on the published sequence of rat cyclin D1 cDNA (20Bianchi S. Fabiani S. Muratori M. Arnold A. Sakaguchi K. Miki T. Brandi M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 591-base pair amplification product was used for hybridization with 10 μg of cellular RNA extracted using the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out for 3 h at 65 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cyclin D1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes in Quikhyb™ solutions containing denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed three times with 1× SSC buffer (1.5 mmsodium citrate, 15 mm NaCl, and 0.1% SDS) followed by another wash with 0.1 × SSC. Hybridization signal was analyzed using the Scion Image PC program. The relative level of cyclin D1 mRNA was determined based on the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in each sample. The smooth muscle cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells in 6-well plates and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB, oxLDL, and apoE. Cell lysate was prepared by adding 200 μl of buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was mixed with 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm ATP, and 2 μl of [(α-32P]ATP (1.0 mCi/ml). The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of PHAS-I, and incubation was continued for 10 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.25 m phosphoric acid. Ten μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto chromatography paper, washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid, rinsed in 95% ethanol, and then subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The apoE effect on cell proliferation was assessed by two-factorial ANOVA. All other data were analyzed for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Using the cell migration assay described under “Experimental Procedures,” 6.3 ± 2.6 quiescent A7r5 cells were found to be present in each HPF, indicating that 4.2% of the total amount of plated cells migrated to the lower chamber under basal conditions. The addition of PDGF enhanced A7r5 cell migration 4-fold, with 25.8 ± 6.1 cells observed in each HPF, representing 17.1% of the total amount of plated cells migrated to the lower chamber (Fig.1 A). Human apoE, at 25 μg/ml, inhibited the PDGF-induced A7r5 cell migration to the same level as that observed when the cells were incubated without PDGF (Fig.1 A). Significantly, at 50 μg/ml of apoE, the number of rat aortic smooth muscle cells migrated to the lower chamber was lower than that observed with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 A). These concentrations of apoE have no effect on cell viability as determined by dye exclusion assay. Similar results were observed when experiments were performed with human coronary artery smooth muscle cells instead of the rat A7r5 smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1 B). Thus, these experiments demonstrated a role of apoE in inhibiting smooth muscle cell migration with or without growth factor stimulation. Incubation of quiescent rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells with PDGF resulted in a 2- to 2.5-fold induction of [3H]thymidine incorporation into their DNA in comparison with cells incubated without the growth factor (Fig.2). The addition of 25 and 50 μg/ml of human apoE to the culture media significantly reduced the PDGF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (p< 0.001, Fig. 2). To confirm that apoE inhibition of PDGF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA is a reflection of its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, a direct cell proliferation assay was performed. The results showed that PDGF stimulated the proliferation of both rat embryonic smooth muscle cells and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The addition of apoE effectively inhibited the PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation (p < 0.001, Fig. 3).Figure 3Effect of apoE on PDGF-induced proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells. Serum-starved rat A7r5 smooth muscle cells (panel A) or human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (panel B) were incubated in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) in DMEM without PDGF and apoE (■), or with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the absence (•) or presence (○) of 50 μg/ml apoE.

The A7r5 cells were used for these experiments. Results showed that the smooth muscle cells displayed high affinity binding with 125I-labeled PDGF-BB. Excess unlabeled PDGF competitively inhibited 125I-PDGF binding to the A7r5 cells. In contrast, the addition of 50 μg/ml human apoE had no effect on 125I-PDGF binding to the A7r5 cell surface (Fig.4). To ascertain the possibility that apoE may interfere with early events in PDGF-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, experiments were performed to explore the effect of apoE on cyclin D1 gene expression, a prerequisite step for cell transition from the G0 to G1 phase in the cell cycle (22Won K.A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated from A7r5 cells incubated with PDGF in the presence or absence of apoE for 6 h, a time period which was reported to result in maximal cyclin D1 mRNA expression after growth factor-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (24Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization of cellular RNA with a rat cyclin D1 cDNA probe revealed a 2.5-fold increase in cyclin D1 mRNA level when cells were challenged with PDGF without apoE (Fig.5). However, the addition of apoE to the culture media in addition to PDGF reduced the growth factor-induced increase in cyclin D1 mRNA by >50% (Fig. 5). An early event important for PDGF stimulation of smooth muscle cells is the activation of MAP kinase (25Pazin M.J. Williams L.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 374-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Lysate obtained from cells incubated for 5 min with 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB displayed a 2- to 3-fold increase in MAP kinase activity compared with extracts obtained from unstimulated cells (Fig.6). However, when 50 μg/ml of human apoE was added simultaneously with PDGF to the cell culture medium, a significant reduction in PDGF-induced MAP kinase activity was observed (p < 0.01, Fig. 6). In addition to apoE effects on PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell functions, the impact of apoE on oxLDL-stimulated smooth muscle cell response was also explored. Results shown in Fig.7 indicated that apoE also inhibited the chemoattractive and mitogenic properties of oxLDL on smooth muscle cells (26Autrio I. Jaakkola O. Solakivi T. Nikkari T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This inhibition was also mediated through suppression of the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 7). Pathological studies indicated that narrowing of the coronary vessels in atherosclerosis and restenosis is related to neointimal hyperplasia, with abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the tunica media to the intima (28Giraldo A.A. Esposo O.M. Meis J.M. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1985; 109: 173-175PubMed Google Scholar, 29Austin G.E. Ratliff M.B. Hollman J. Tabei S. Phillips D.F. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1985; 6: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis suggests that injury to the vascular endothelium exposes the underlying smooth muscle cells to mitogenic growth factors, thereby inducing their phenotypic conversion from the contractile nonproliferating phenotype to that of a secretory proliferating phenotype. Platelet-derived growth factor and oxLDL have been implicated to play a major role in activating both processes of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (30Grotendorst G.R. Chang T.

Gonzalez A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of cell proliferation by MAP kinase has been shown to be a direct result of increased transcription of many immediate early genes (35Seth A. Gonzalez A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including cyclin D1 that is required for cell transition from the G0 to the G1 phase in the cell cycle (37Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). A possible role of apoE in modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell growth was suggested by the observation of its synthesis in quiescent but not actively proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells (39Majack R.A. Castle C.K. Goodman L.V. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Shooter E.M. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results described in this manuscript provided the first experimental evidence to document apoE inhibition of agonist-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. This inhibition was shown to be due to apoE suppression of growth factor-stimulated MAP kinase activity and cyclin D1 gene expression in aortic smooth muscle cells. These in vitro experiments implicated a cytostatic function for apoE in the vessel wall and suggested an additional mechanism by which apoE protects against vascular occlusive diseases. The results of this study add to a growing list of mechanisms by which apoE is anti-atherogenic. First, apoE reduces hyperlipidemia by mediating cholesterol clearance from circulation (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). Second, apoE suppresses foam cell formation by mediating cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells (40Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, apoE suppresses lipoprotein oxidation, thereby reducing oxidation-induced endothelial toxicity (42Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Fourth, apoE inhibits lymphocyte proliferation (16Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11775-11781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus may limit inflammatory response in the arterial wall. Fifth, apoE inhibits agonist-induced platelet aggregation (43Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which will retard the progression of atherosclerotic lesion; and sixth, apoE suppresses growth factor and oxLDL-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (this study). Taken together, these apoE activities may explain the versatility of this apolipoprotein in conferring protection against various forms of vascular diseases, including cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis (2Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Yazaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1750-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), angioplasty- or injury-induced restenosis (10Seo H.S. Lombardi D.M. Polinsky P. Powell-Braxton L. Bunting S. Schwartz S.M.

Pathol. 1996; 149: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its cell regulatory functions in the cardiovascular system, apoE has also been shown to modulate normal physiology and pathophysiology of other cells and tissues. For example, apoE suppresses steroidogenesis in adrenals and ovaries (47Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10965-10973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE is also expressed in the brain, where the apoE4 allele is correlated with an increased risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (50Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The relationship between apoE genotype and Alzheimer's disease is related to apoE interaction with β-amyloid peptide and with τ in regulation of fibrillogenesis (50Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar, 51Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Goedert M. Weisgraber K.H. Dong L.M. Jakes R. Huang D.Y. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Rose A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11183-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The ability of different apoE isoforms to regulate neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion neurons (52Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and to induce neurotoxicity (53LaFerla F.M. Troncoso J.C. Strickland D.K. Kawas C.H. Jay G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 54Marques M.A. Tolar M. Crutcher K.A. Alzheimer's Res. 1997; 3: 1-6Google Scholar) also has been implicated to play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of apoE to modulate such diverse cell functions appears to be related to its ability in modulating cell signal transduction pathways in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. For example, the suppressive effect of apoE on steroidogenesis in adrenals and ovaries is mediated through inhibition of cyclic AMP signaling mechanisms (47Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10965-10973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, apoE has no effect on cyclic AMP pathway in lymphocytes, but its inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was shown to be mediated by suppression of other early cell signaling events that lead to cell arrest at the G1a/G1b boundary (55Hui D.Y. Berebitsky G.L. Harmony J.A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4666-4673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 57Mistry M.J. Clay M.A. Kelly M.E. Steiner M.A. Harmony J.A.K. Cellular Immunology. 1995; 160: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism for apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration reported herein is different from the apoE effect on lymphocyte proliferation. The smooth muscle cell effect is mediated via inhibition of MAP kinase activity and cyclin D1 activation, resulting in the prevention of cell entry from G0 to G1 phase. Other studies revealed that apoE suppresses agonist-induced platelet aggregation by activation of nitric oxide synthesis (43Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ApoE also stimulates nitric-oxide synthase in human macrophages (58Vitek M.P. Snell J. Dawson H. Colton C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nitric oxide has been shown to inhibit migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (59Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Whether the effects of apoE on smooth muscle cells reported here are related to its effect on nitric oxide production remains to be determined. The diverse effects of apoE on cell signaling mechanisms may be related to its ability to bind various different receptors on the cell surface. Currently identified receptors capable of binding apoE include LDL receptor, LRP, gp330/megalin, the VLDL receptor, apoE receptor-2, LR11, and LR7/8 (60Yamamoto T. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 61Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whereas ligand binding to these receptors usually results in its internalization and degradation in the lysosomes, the potential for signal transduction via ligand interaction with these receptors has not been fully appreciated. There are reports that lactoferrin, lipoprotein lipase, and Pseudomonas exotoxin A binding to LRP on macrophages resulted in a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-mediated increase in intracellular calcium ion and inositol triphosphate (62Misra U.K. Chu C.T.C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significant to the current study is the report that interaction of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein or anti-LRP with LRP on vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in inhibition of cell migration (63Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether apoE inhibition of ligand-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation is mediated by LRP, or other members of the LDL receptor gene family present on these cells, such as the VLDL receptor (45Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2027150844,"Rieger syndrome is an autosomal-dominant developmental disorder that includes glaucoma and mild craniofacial dysmorphism in humans. Mutations in the Pitx2 homeobox gene have been linked to Rieger syndrome. We have characterized wild type and mutant Pitx2 activities using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, protein binding, and transient transfection assays. Pitx2 preferentially binds the bicoid homeodomain binding site and transactivates reporter genes containing this site. The combination of Pitx2 and another homeodomain protein, Pit-1, yielded a synergistic 55-fold activation of the prolactin promoter in transfection assays. Addition of Pit-1 increased Pitx2 binding to the bicoidelement in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate specific binding of Pit-1 to Pitx2 in vitro. Thus, wild type Pitx2 DNA binding activity is modulated by protein-protein interactions. We next studied two Rieger mutants. A threonine to proline mutation (T68P) in the second helix of the homeodomain retained DNA binding activity with the same apparentKD and only about a 2-fold reduction in theBmax. However, this mutant did not transactivate reporter genes containing the bicoid site. The mutant Pitx2 protein binds Pit-1, but there was no detectable synergism on the prolactin promoter. A second mutation (L54Q) in a highly conserved residue in helix 1 of the homeodomain yielded an unstable protein. Our results provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the developmental defects in Rieger syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2037870372,"To examine the role of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in cellular resistance to antineoplastic drugs, derivatives of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were developed that express MRP1 in combination with one of three human cytosolic isozymes of GST. Expression of MRP1 alone confers resistance to several drugs representing the multidrug resistance phenotype, drugs including doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and mitoxantrone. However, co-expression with MRP1 of any of the human GST isozymes A1-1, M1-1, or P1-1 failed to augment MRP1-associated resistance to these drugs. In contrast, combined expression of MRP1 and GST A1-1 conferred ∼4-fold resistance to the anticancer drug chlorambucil. Expression of MRP1 alone failed to confer resistance to chlorambucil, showing that the observed protection from chlorambucil cytotoxicity was absolutely dependent upon GST A1-1 protein. Moreover, using inhibitors of GST (dicumarol) or MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone), it was shown that in MCF7 cells resistance to chlorambucil requires both intact MRP1-dependent efflux pump activity and, for full protection, GST A1-1 catalytic activity.

Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was recently validated for the model carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (31Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies showed that GST P1-1-associated protection from 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide cytotoxicity was dependent upon concomitant expression of MRP1. Additionally, GST P1-1-associated protection from 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-mediated DNA adduct formation was greatly enhanced by co-expression of MRP1. Previous studies failed to demonstrate an association between increased MRP1 expression and resistance to alkylating agents in MCF7/VP cells (32Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar). In another study examining paired cell lines that differed in the levels of MRP1 expressed, increased MRP1 was associated with chlorambucil resistance in one but not the other two paired cell lines (33Barnouin K. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Pourtier-Manzanedo A. Konig J. Lehmann W.-D. Keppler D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These inconsistent relationships between increased MRP1 and alkylating agent sensitivity indicate that other factors, such as GST or glutathione levels, may be important in determining whether or not MRP1 will mediate protection from the cytotoxicities of some alkylating cancer drugs. Additionally, properties of some of the bifunctional alkylating agents and their metabolites make them particularly interesting candidates for GST/MRP1-mediated detoxification. Even after formation of monoglutathionyl derivatives, some of these bifunctional alkylating agents retain significant reactivity at the unmodified alkylating group and may therefore remain cytotoxic. Moreover, glutathione conjugates of some of these compounds, the nitrogen mustards melphalan and chlorambucil, are known to be transported by MRP1-containing membrane vesicles in vitro (27Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar, 33Barnouin K. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Pourtier-Manzanedo A. Konig J. Lehmann W.-D. Keppler D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have developed cellular models to examine the role of GST/MRP1 synergy in the emergence of anticancer drug resistance. Although cell-free, in vitro analyses of toxin conjugation and transport are informative, cellular models of MRP1 and GST function are essential to determine the cytoprotective consequences of coordinated MRP1 and GST expression and to determine the precise mechanisms of cellular detoxifications. Accordingly, from MCF7 cells that express extremely low levels of MRP1 and GST, we have developed derivative sublines that express MRP1 alone or in combination with representatives of three major classes of human cytosolic GSTs, GST A1-1, M1-1, and P1-1. Results show that GST A1-1 operates in synergy with MRP1 to confer resistance to the antineoplastic nitrogen mustard chlorambucil. The studies indicate the mechanism of synergy involves GST catalytic activity as well as MRP1-mediated efflux of glutathione conjugates. Mitoxantrone, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, thiotepa, and hepsulfan were provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Geneticin was from Life Technologies, Inc., and hygromycin was from Calbiochem. All other drugs were from Sigma. Stock solutions stored at −80 °C were VP-16 (5 mm in 50% ethanol), doxorubicin (5 mm in H2O), vincristine (1 mm in H2O), mitoxantrone (5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide), dicumarol (50 mm in 0.1 N NaOH), and sulfinpyrazone (200 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide). The following were prepared fresh: chlorambucil (100 mm in ethanol), melphalan (16.4 mm in acidified ethanol (∼0.4 n HCl)), 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (250 mm in 71% ethanol), and thiotepa (100 mm in H2O). Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell lines were derived from cloned parental MCF7 breast carcinoma cell lines, MCF7/WT (GST−/MRP1−), and the MDR derivative MCF7/VP (GST-/MRP1+) (32Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing human isozymes of GST, GST A1-1, GST M1-1, or GST P1-1 were established by stable transfection of MCF7/VP cells with: 1) the ΔpCEP4 vector (34Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol.

Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Control cell lines were produced by stable transfection of MCF7/WT and MCF7/VP cells with pcDNA3.1 or ΔpCEP4 lacking GST cDNA inserts (MCF7/WT-neo, MCF7/WT-hyg, MCF7/VP-neo, and MCF7/VP-hyg). Cells transfected with pcDNA3- or ΔpCEP4-based vectors were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin or 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Transfected cells were routinely grown in the selecting drug (geneticin or hygromycin) until a few days before experiments, when they were transferred to drug-free medium. Drug cytotoxicities were determined with the sulforhodamine B assay using 96-well microtiter plates (38Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar) as described previously (31Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For VP-16, doxorubicin, vincristine, and mitoxantrone, cells were exposed to drug or equivalent vehicle continuously in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For chlorambucil, melphalan, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, thiotepa, and hepsulfan, cells were exposed to drugs or vehicle for 1 h in either serum-free DMEM or DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 15 min in the presence of vehicle or inhibitor (0.1 mm dicumarol (in HBSS) or 2 mm sulfinpyrazone (in DMEM plus 1% fetal bovine serum)) followed by co-incubation of chlorambucil with vehicle or inhibitor (0.1 mm dicumarol (in HBSS) or 2 mmsulfinpyrazone (DMEM/1% fetal calf serum)) for 1 h. The human GSTA1 cDNA (36Tu C.-P.D. Qian B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was ligated into theEcoRI site of the pPROK-1 plasmid expression vector (CLONTECH). The protein was expressed following transformation into E. coli DH5a. The culture was grown overnight and then chilled, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of 10 mm KPO4 (pH 8) plus 5 mm EDTA. The suspension was warmed to 20 °C, incubated in lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min, chilled on ice, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and loaded onto a glutathione affinity column (Sigma G-4510) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) plus 0.2 m NaCl. The column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer, and then GSTA1-1 was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 9.6), 0.2 m NaCl, and 5 mm glutathione. The eluate was neutralized with dilute HCl, dialyzed against 10 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4) plus 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Glutathione levels were measured by the enzymatic recycling method (39Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5557) Google Scholar). GST activities were determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate (40Habig W. Pabst M. Jakoby W. J. Biol Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetic and in vitro inhibition analyses were accomplished using affinity-purified, recombinant human GST A1-1. For these assays, CDNB served as the varied substrate, and glutathione concentration was fixed at 2 mm. Activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 25 °C and pH 6.5 as described by Habig et al. (40Habig W. Pabst M. Jakoby W. J. Biol Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots of total cellular RNA were done as described (41Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar) using probes derived from the entire human GST A1, GST M1, or GST P1 cDNAs (36Tu C.-P.D.

The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of GST isoforms were accomplished as described previously using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against human GST A1, GST M1, or GST P1 subunits (19Leyland-Jones B. Townsend A.J. Tu C.P. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 587-594PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting of membrane protein preparations for MRP1 was done with the QCRL-1 antibody kindly provided by Dr. S. P. C. Cole (45Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of DNP-SG efflux, MCF7/VPα cells were plated to a density of 0.6 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were preincubated for 2 min in HBSS plus vehicle or 2 mmsulfinpyrazone. Following preincubations, cells were co-incubated at 25 °C with 1 μm CDNB plus vehicle or 2 mmsulfinpyrazone. At the indicated times, medium was removed and acidified to 10% perchloric acid. Cells were lysed in 10% perchloric acid. Medium and lysate samples were prepared for reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis as described (31Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Details of DNP-SG chromatography will be described elsewhere. 2C. S. Morrow, P. K. Smitherman, S. K. Diah, E. Schneider, and A. Townsend, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, acid-soluble samples were eluted isocratically from a C18 reverse phase column in 20% methanol + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Chromatographs were monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and DNP-SG levels were determined from the areas of peaks eluting at the position of authentic DNP-SG by comparison with DNP-SG standards. Concentrations of DNP-SG reference standards were determined using ε340 = 10.2 cm−1 mm−1. The effect of sulfinpyrazone or dicumarol on GST activity in vivo was determined as follows. MCF7/VPα cells (0.5 × 106/well) were seeded in 6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were incubated in DMEM plus 1% fetal calf serum ± 2 mm sulfinpyrazone or in HBSS ± 0.1 mmdicumarol at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At indicated times, cells were washed and incubated in HBSS equilibrated to 25 °C containing inhibitor (2 mm sulfinpyrazone or 0.1 mmdicumarol) or vehicle plus 10 μm CDNB. Relative in vivo GST activities were determined as the rate of total DNP-SG formation (DNP-SG in medium plus cell lysates) for 2 and 5 min at 25 °C. DNP-SG levels were measured chromatographically as described above. The levels of DNP-SG formation increased linearly with time throughout the 5 min incubation periods. MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were chosen to study the effects of expression of MRP1 alone or in combination with isozymes of GST. These cell lines constitute a good model system for such studies because parental MCF7/WT cells express extremely low levels of cytosolic GSTs and MRP1. Additionally, a MDR derivative of MCF7/WT, MCF7/VP, is available that has as its primary genetic and phenotypic change the overexpression of high levels of MRP1 (32Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar). Like MCF7/WT, MCF7/VP cells have very low endogenous cytosolic GST levels. Neither MCF7/WT nor MCF7/VP contain detectable MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) or the MRP2 (cMOAT or cMRP) isoform (32Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar). 3C. S. Morrow, P. K. Smitherman, S. K. Diah, E. Schneider, and A. J. Townsend, unpublished data. Parental MCF7/VP cells were stably transfected with expression vectors containing cDNAs encoding the human GST A1-1 (MCF7/VPα), GST M1-1 (MCF7/VPμ), or GST P1-1 (MCF7/VPπ). Additionally, control cell lines were generated by stable transfection of parental MCF7/WT and MCF7/VP cells with empty expression vectors encoding antibiotic resistance to hygromycin (hyg) or geneticin (neo) but not GST. Expression of GST isozyme-specific protein and mRNA was detected only in cell lines transfected with GST expression vectors (Fig.1). In these cells (MCF7/VPα, MCF7/VPμ, and MCF7/VPπ), relatively high levels of GST activity were confirmed by enzyme assays (TableI). GST activities remained uniformly low in the parental and control cell lines (Table I). High levels of MRP1 expression (membrane protein and mRNA) were seen only in parental MCF7/VP cells and their transfected derivatives. Co-expression of GST isozymes had no effect on the levels of MRP1 (Fig.2). Finally, glutathione levels were comparable in all of the cell lines tested (Table I).Table IGST activities and glutathione levels in model cell linesCell lineMRPGST activityanmol/min 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene conjugated with GSH per mg of cytosolic protein.Glutathionebnmol of total glutathione/mg of cytosolic protein.MCF7/WT−< 585.9 ± 17.2MCF7/WT-neo−< 578.2 ± 14.6MCF7/WT-hyg−< 5NDMCF7/VP+< 583.6 ± 16.5MCF7/VP-neo+< 578.7 ± 12.1MCF7/VP-hyg+< 5NDMCF7/VPα+270 ± 3275.0 ± 12.5MCF7/VPμ+408 ± 4773.4 ± 12.2MCF7/VPπ+350 ± 7570.7 ± 17.3Values reported are the means of ≥ three determinations ± 1 S.D.

ND, not determined. Transfection of control vectors devoid of GST cDNA inserts into parental MCF7/WT and MCF7/VP cells had no effect on GST levels (MCF7/WT-neo and -hyg; MCF7/VP-neo and -hyg), glutathione levels (MCF7/WT-neo and MCF7/VP-neo), or MRP1 expression (Table I). Moreover, cytotoxicity profiles of parental cells MCF7/WT and MCF7/VP were similar to the corresponding cells transfected with control vectors (MCF7/WT-neo and -hyg; MCF7/VP-neo and -hyg). Thus, data reported in the text below will not differentiate between the parental cells and their corresponding derivatives transfected with control vectors. The effect of MRP1 expression, alone or in combination with three different isozymes of cytosolic GST, on cellular sensitivities to various cytotoxic anticancer drugs was tested. Many of these data are summarized in TableII. A comparison of the relative resistance of MCF7/WT versus MCF7/VP cells to four drugs of the MDR phenotype, VP-16, doxorubicin, vincristine, and mitoxantrone, confirmed previous findings (32Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar) that increased expression of MRP1 alone confers resistance to these drugs. Although VP-16, doxorubicin, and vincristine are not known to form conjugates with glutathione, we wondered whether these drugs or their metabolic derivatives might be unrecognized, toxic substrates of any of the three cytosolic GST isozymes tested and, if so, whether the GST isozymes would augment MRP1-mediated resistance to these drugs. Although mitoxantrone can form glutathione conjugates, it is not known whether any of the cytosolic GSTs tested can catalyze these reactions. However, as shown in TableII, expression of relatively high levels of GST A1-1 (MCF7/VPα cells), GST M1-1 (MCF7/VPμ cells), or GST P1-1 (MCF7/VPπ cells) had no significant effect on the level of MRP1-associated resistance to these MDR-related drugs.Table IIEffect of MRP and GST expression on cellular sensitivities to the cytotoxicities of antineoplastic drugsDrugRelative resistanceaRelative resistance = IC50 of cell line ÷ IC50 of MCF7/VP cell line.

However, MRP1 has not consistently been associated with resistance to these drugs. Nevertheless, a number of glutathione conjugates, including monoglutathionyl derivatives of chlorambucil and melphalan, are known to be substrates of MRP1-dependent transport in isolated membrane vesicles (27Jedlitschky G.

https://openalex.org/W1973754795,"USF1 and USF2 are ubiquitous transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family. They form homo- and heterodimers and recognize a CACGTG motif termed E box. In the liver, USF binding activity is mainly accounted for by the USF1/USF2 heterodimer, which binds in vitro the glucose/carbohydrate response elements (GlRE/ChoRE) of glucose-responsive genes. To assign a physiological role of USFsin vivo, we have undertaken the disruption of USF1 and USF2 genes in mice. We present here the generation of USF1-deficient mice. In the liver of these mice, we demonstrate that USF2 remaining dimers can compensate for glucose responsiveness, even though the level of total USF binding activity is reduced by half as compared with wild type mice. The residual USF1 binding activity was similarly reduced in the previously reported USF2 −/− mice in which an impaired glucose responsiveness was observed (Vallet, V. S., Henrion, A. A., Bucchini, D., Casado, M., Raymondjean, M., Kahn, A., and Vaulont, S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21944–21949). Taken together, these results clearly suggest differential transactivating efficiencies of USF1 and USF2 in promoting the glucose response. Furthermore, they support the view that USF2 is the functional transactivator of the glucose-responsive complex.

USFs were originally described as a nuclear activity from HeLa cells able to bind and to transactivate the adenovirus major late promoter (AdML) through the canonical sequence CANNTG, referred to as an E-box motif (2Sawadogo M.

Purification of USFs revealed in fact two polypeptides of 43 (USF1) and 44 kDa (USF2), which were subsequently shown to be encoded by two distinct genes in human, rat, and mouse (3Henrion A.A.

These two genes are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. However, it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of USF1 and USF2 transcripts, as well as USF1 and USF2 proteins, varies among different cell types (7Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, minor forms of USF2 generated by differential splicing and alternative utilization of translational start sites have been described (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 have been shown to bind DNA as dimers (homodimers as well as heterodimers) and to share very similar DNA binding properties (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H. Sawadogo M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that, in vivo, although the relative abundance between USF1 and USF2 homo- and heterodimers varies according to the tissue, the heterodimer USF1·USF2 seems to always represent the predominant DNA binding species (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). upstream stimulatory factor L-type pyruvate kinase Spot 14 major late promoter nuclear factor Y glucose 6-phosphate basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper helix turn helix base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) internal ribosomal entry site embryonic stem knock out electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Since the demonstration of USF involvement in the transcriptional activation of the AdML promoter, USFs have been reported as potential regulators of a high number of cellular genes involved in different important cellular processes (see Ref. 4Henrion A.A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the respective roles of either USF1 and USF2 homodimers, or of the USF1·USF2 heterodimer, have usually not been well determined. Furthermore, involvement of USF is generally demonstrated by artificial ex vivo transfection experiments, which do not always reflect the actual in vivo situation. Therefore, to gain insight into the specific role of USF1 and USF2 and to evaluate the relative transcriptional activity of USF-dependent regulated genes in cells devoid of USF1, USF2, or both, we have undertaken the generation of USF1 and USF2 knock out mice. The USF2 null mice have been recently reported (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and we describe here the generation of the USF1 gene knock out mice. In an effort to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression by glucose in the liver, we previously investigated the transcriptional activation of the genes for L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), a glycolytic enzyme, and Spot14 (S14), a protein associated with lipogenesis (11Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the regulatory regions of these two genes, a common glucose-carbohydrate response element (termed GlRE/ChoRE) has been precisely characterized. This element consists of two E boxes separated by 5 bp. It was shown to bind in vitroa major complex containing predominantly the USF1/USF2 heterodimer (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M.

The involvement of USFs in the glucose response was confirmed by ex vivo experiments using expression vectors (17Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, we were able to show that the transcriptional response of L-PK and S14 genes was altered in USF2 −/− mice (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the transcriptional response of L-PK and S14 gene to glucose in the USF1 −/− mice and discuss the results considering the previously reported data obtained in the USF2 −/− mice. The USF1 genomic fragments were all generated from λ clones isolated from an ES-129 embryonic stem cell line murine genomic library (4Henrion A.A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ES culture and embryo manipulation were performed as described (20Joyner A. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). A 4-kb SpeI-SpeI fragment, encompassing exons 2, 3, and part of exon 4, was blunted, modified by the addition ofNotI linkers, and subcloned into the 5′ NotI site of the reported IRES-βgeo-containing vector subcloned into SK (21Mountford P.S. Smith A.G. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This plasmid was SalI digested and blunted, and the blunted 3′-USF1 homologous fragment, consisting of a 2.7-kbXhoI-XbaI fragment, was inserted. This fragment contains part of exon 10 and 3′ flanking sequences of the USF1 gene, leading thus to a 3-kb deletion of genomic sequences between exon 5 and exon 10. The resulting targeting construct was linearized at the uniqueXhoI site, and 60 μg was used to electroporate 1 × 107 D3-ES cells (22Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar), which were cultured on mitomycin-treated embryonic fibroblast feeder layers. DNA from clones surviving G418 selection (200 μg/ml) were individually analyzed by Southern blot. For 5′ and internal analyses, DNA wasEcoRI-digested and hybridized either with a 5′ external probe consisting of a genomic 0.7-kb EcoRI-NaeI fragment (see Fig. 1 A) or with an internal probe consisting of the 2.7-kb XhoI-XbaI 3′ homologous fragment. For 3′ analysis, DNA was BamHI digested and hybridized with a 3′ external probe consisting of a genomic 2.6-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment spanning downstream sequences of the USF1 gene. External and internal probes were further used to ensure the absence of additional random integration of the targeting construct (data not shown). ES cells from two positive targeted clones (76 and 83) were injected into blastocyste derived from C57BL/6J mice. Chimeric males derived from both clones were mated to wild type C57BL/6J females for the germ line transmission. Mice heterozygous for the gene-targeting event were then used to generate homozygous mutant USF1 −/− mice. As the phenotype and the metabolic results were identical with animals derived from both ES cell clones, the experiments were then performed only with the F2 descendant animals from the clone 83. To generate the double heterozygote USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice, USF1 +/− mice were bred with the previously reported USF2 +/− mice (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Genotyping of offspring was performed by Southern blot analysis with 10 μg ofEcoRI-digested mouse tail DNA. For metabolic studies, animals were fed a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h after a 24-h fasting. Mice were sacrificed between 10 and 12 a.m., and tissue samples were stored at −80 °C. Blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus. Glucose level was determined with glucose oxidase using the Sigma kit, and the level of glucox 6-P in crude liver extract was measured as described previously (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RNAs were purified by a modified guanidium chloride procedure from frozen liver, and Northern blot analysis was conducted as described before (23Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For detection of L-PK mRNAs, a rat cDNA clone (clone G4) encompassing the coding sequence was used (24Lone Y.C. Simon M.P. Kahn A. Marie J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For S14 detection, a polymerase chain reaction-made fragment corresponding to the murine coding sequence was used as a probe (25Liaw C.W. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7253-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with a ribosomal 18 S cDNA to check for the integrity and the amount of loaded RNAs. The amount of specific mRNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously, using USF1-specific peptide antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and affinity-purified USF2 1–49 antibodies both at a 1:200 dilution (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the DNA binding reaction was performed as described previously (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μg of whole cell extract proteins, 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1–0.5 ng of end-labeled MLP oligonucleotide. For supershift experiments, USF1 and USF2 antibodies were included in the binding reactions (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Quality and quantity of the extracts were monitored by analyzing the ubiquitous NFY binding activities. DNA binding complexes separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t test for unpaired data using the StatView software. The significance has been considered at p < 0.05. To inactivate the USF1 gene, a replacement vector was constructed with 6.7 kb of ES-129-derived genomic fragment and a selection cassette disrupting exon 4 (Fig.1 A). Ensured that the USF1 gene was active in ES cells, we carried out a promoter trap strategy to maximize the targeting frequency. To this end, the promoterless IRES-βgeo cassette was chosen as the selection cassette. This cassette allows, via an IRES element, for efficient translation of the βgeo fusion transcript. It leads to the synthesis of a fusion protein with both β-galactosidase and neomycin activities (21Mountford P.S. Smith A.G. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After electroporation and selection of recombinant ES cells, homologous recombinants were detected by Southern analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among 155 colonies screened, 76% were appropriately targeted. This result confirms previous data showing that the use of IRES-containing constructs may allow homologous recombination events to be isolated at a very high frequency (21Mountford P.S. Smith A.G. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After transmission of the mutation, heterozygous progeny, which was normal and fertile, was intercrossed to produce homozygous offspring. The presence of the mutated gene in the F2 offspring was routinely checked by Southern analysis of tail DNA. As shown in Fig.1 B, hybridization of EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs with the indicated 5′ external probe lead to wild type alleles of 10.8 kb and mutated alleles of 5.1 kb. Disruption of the USF1 gene resulted in the complete absence of USF1 protein in USF1 −/− animals. This was ascertained by immunoblotting of cellular proteins of USF1 −/−, USF1 +/−, and USF1 +/+ animals with an anti-USF1 specific antibody (Fig. 1 C). The 43-kDa USF1 protein was detected only in extracts from heterozygous and wild type animals. The reduced level of USF1 in USF1 +/− animals, as compared with the +/+ animals, suggested the failure of the wild type USF1 allele to compensate for the mutation. Out of the first 239 F2 offspring genotyped, 19.7% were homozygous (−/−) for the disrupted allele, and 24.7% were wild type (+/+), which was compatible with the expected Mendelian frequency. At birth, the homozygotes seemed to be indistinguishable from wild type and heterozygous littermates. Furthermore, in contrast to the severe phenotype of the USF2 −/− mice (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), USF1 −/− mice developed and reproduced without any obvious alteration. No behavioral defects or anatomical abnormalities in any major organs were seen. To determine the changes in the composition of USF binding activity, liver cellular extracts were used in EMSAs with a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the canonical E box from the AdML promoter (Fig.2 A). As previously reported (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the major USF binding activity in the +/+ mice liver was predominantly accounted for by USF1/USF2 heterodimer. USF1 and USF2 homodimers, visualized as weak bands after supershift with either anti-USF2 or USF1 antibody, respectively, seemed to be minor complexes. In contrast, in USF1 −/− cellular extracts, USF binding activity, visualized as a fainter and slightly upper migrating band, was only accounted for by the USF2 homodimer. Indeed, USF2 antibody fully displaced this complex, whereas the USF1 antibody had no effect. Quantification of this residual USF binding activity was performed by EMSA with an internal control consisting of the binding site for the ubiquitously expressed NFY factor (Fig. 2 B). This analysis revealed that the level of USF2 binding activity was reduced to 42% (n = 6, p = 0.0001) to that of the wild type. This result demonstrates that, in vitro, the only detectable binding activity on the E boxes, in cell extracts devoid of USF1, is USF2 and that probably USF2 gene expression is not up-regulated in the liver of USF1 KO mice. This result was further confirmed by Western blot analysis showing no change in the amount of USF2 in liver cellular extracts of either −/− or +/+ mice (Fig.2 C). To determine the impact of USF1 deficiency on glucose responsiveness of hepatic gene expression, a series of metabolic analyses was performed on wild type and USF1 −/− mice. After a 24-h fasting period, animals were refed with a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h. Glucose homeostasis was assessed by measuring blood glucose level, and hepatic glucose utilization was monitored by quantitating the level of glucose-6P. Both values were identical in normal and mutated mice (glycemia of 1.43 ± 0.3 (n = 9) and 1.41 ± 0.23 (n= 11) g/liter glucose, for the +/+ and −/− groups, respectively; and glucose 6-P concentration of 8.2 ± 2.0 (n = 9) and 8.3 ± 2.6 (n = 11) nmol/mg of proteins for the +/+ and −/− groups, respectively). This indicated an apparent normal glucose uptake and utilization by the liver of USF1 −/− mice. Total liver RNAs were then analyzed by Northern blot to assess the content of L-PK and S14 mRNAs (Fig.3 A). Quantification of this analysis (Fig. 3 B) revealed that the amount of L-PK and S14 mRNAs in the liver of the USF1 −/− mice was not statistically different from that of the +/+ mice. The absence of hepatic alteration of L-PK and S14 gene transcription in response to a hyperglucidic diet in USF1 −/− mice suggested that the remaining USF2 homodimers in the liver cells were able to substitute for the USF1/USF2 heterodimer. Interestingly, this substitution took place while the amount of USF binding activity was reduced to 42% of the total USF binding activity. We therefore asked whether this observation was specific to USF2 or if reducing the quantity of the heterodimer would have also led to unchanged L-PK and S14 mRNA levels. To address this question, we submitted wild type and double heterozygote USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice to the above described feeding protocol. We first compared by EMSA the amount of USF binding activity in liver cellular extracts of wild type and USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice. Fig. 4 A shows a representative EMSA experiment along with the quantification of USF binding activity. This result established that the USF binding activity, which was mainly accounted for by the heterodimer, was reduced to 46% in the double heterozygote mice. We then measured, by Northern blot analysis, the amount of L-PK and S14 mRNAs in the liver of USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice as compared with wild type mice. As presented in Fig. 4 B, the amount of L-PK and S14 mRNAs was comparable in the liver of wild type and USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice. Thus, the response of the L-PK and S14 genes was not altered in USF1 +/− USF2 +/− mice despite the reduced USF binding activity. In the USF1 −/− mice presented in this paper and in the previously reported USF2 −/− mice (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we have investigated the regulation of two glucose-responsive genes, namely the L-type pyruvate kinase and Spot 14. Both genes were shown to contain in their regulatory region a common sequence responsible for mediating the glucose response. This sequence consists of two 5′ CACGTG type E box motifs separated by 5 bp. It is able to bind in vitromembers of the USF family (8Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence from previous ex vivo and in vivo studies support the importance of this cis-acting sequence in promoting the glucose responsiveness. It was of prime interest to test the involvement of the trans-acting proteins described as binding this sequence in vitro. In the liver of wild type mice, we previously reported that the USF binding activity is mainly accounted for by the USF1/USF2 heterodimer (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By EMSA studies, we demonstrated, here and in the previously reported USF2 −/− KO mice (10Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), that the hepatic USF binding activity is accounted for by the remaining homodimer species,i.e. USF1 homodimer in USF2 KO mice and USF2 homodimer in USF1 KO mice. In addition, the amount of this homodimer in the liver, as assayed by gel shift and Western blot experiments, is consistent with an unchanged expression of the remaining gene. In other words, neither liver USF1 gene expression in USF2 KO mice nor USF2 in USF1 KO mice seems to be overexpressed consequently to the mutation. These results in adult liver are different from those recently reported by Sirito et al. (26Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in fetal fibroblasts from USF2 −/− and USF1 −/− mice. The authors observed that the USF2 −/− mice contain a reduced level of USF1, whereas the USF1 −/− mice seem to compensate USF1 deficiency by increased USF2 synthesis. It seems therefore that the asymmetrical cross-regulation between USF genes during fetal life is replaced after birth, at least in the liver, by an independent pattern of USF1 and USF2 gene expression. We previously demonstrated that in USF2 −/− mice refed a hyperglucidic diet for 18 h, L-PK and S14 gene expression was dramatically reduced (by 3.8- and 6.8-fold, respectively). Therefore, the glucose responsiveness of glucose-responsive genes in the liver, impaired in the presence of USF1 homodimers in USF2 −/− mice, is normal in the presence of USF2 homodimers in USF1 −/− mice. Because the glucose response of the L-PK and S14 genes is also normal in double heterozygous mutants, we can conclude that 40–50% of residual USF binding activity is sufficient to sustain a normal glucose response when consisting of either USF2 homodimers or USF1/USF2 heterodimers but not of USF1 homodimers. In other words, USF1 seems to be intrinsically less efficacious than USF2, at least as a transactivating factor of the glucose-response complex. The weak transcriptional effect of USF1 is reminiscent of the results reported by Desbarats et al. (27Desbarats L. Gaubatz S. Eilers M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These authors demonstrate that the activity of USF1 on isolated E boxes in vivo is often poor and that the distance between E boxes and start sites of transcription can be a critical factor. This observation could explain why response of the S14 gene to glucose is much more affected than that of the L-PK gene in USF2 −/− mice. Indeed, the E boxes are located far upstream from the start site of transcription (−1422 bp) in the S14 gene and in a very proximal position (−144 bp) in the L-PK gene. Furthermore, Carter et al. (28Carter R.S. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) recently called into question the traditional view of USF1 homodimer as a transcriptional activator. In an effort to determine the selective utilization of b-HLH-LZ proteins at the Ig heavy chain enhancer, the authors surprisingly observed that USF1 had a negative effect on the activity of the IgH. They hypothesize that repression may be a consequence of the absence of a strong activation domain in USF1. Different studies suggest that USF1 could act as a repressor by competing in vivo with positive-transacting factors (29Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Lun Y. Sawadogo M. Perry M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). The transactivating activity of USF1 and USF2 dimers could be intrinsically different and/or it could be brought out by differential interaction of USF1 and USF2 with other regulatory proteins. The highly divergent USF1 and USF2 NH2-terminal domains, encompassing the transcriptional activation domain, could specify these interactions. Alternatively, a role for the b-HLH-LZ domain could be evoked. In this respect, it is interesting to note that a specific cross-talk between USFs and other transcription factors begins to be documented. Blanar and Rutter (31Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) have first reported the in vitro interaction of USF2 with c-Fos. More recently, by different cloning strategies, specific interactions have been reported, on one hand, between USF1 and the b-Zip Fra1 factor (32Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Aperlo C. Fujimoto M. Ariga H. Nomoto A. Kato H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the b-HLH-E47 protein (33Dear T.N. Hainzl T. Follo M. Nehls M. Wilmore H. Matena K. Boehm T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the winged HTH Ets-1 factor (34Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); on the other hand, specific interactions have been reported between USF2 and the c-Maf1 factor (35Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). So far, however, further experiments are needed to assign a physiologic role to these physical interactions. Finally, Royet al. (36Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) recently reported the molecular cloning of the TFII-I transcriptional factor that physically and functionally interacts with USF1. It will be interesting to determine whether the differential transactivating properties of USF1 and USF2 dimers can occur on other USF-dependent genes and, in this case, to what extent they could target different sets of responsive genes in different cell types and in response to various stimuli. Although the results discussed before suggest that the USF1 homodimers are not required for normal embryonic development, postnatal growth, and transcriptional response to glucose and that they cannot by themselves totally compensate for USF2 deficiency, their role is nevertheless attested by embryonic lethality of double knock out mice deficient in both USF1 and USF2 (26Sirito M.

Vaulont, unpublished data. Preliminary data also indicate that the phenotype is more severe in animals with only a residual USF1 intact allele (USF1 +/− USF2 −/−), which die earlier during in utero development, than in those with a residual USF2 allele (USF1 −/− USF2 +/−), which generally die immediately before or after birth.2 This observation is consistent with a better efficacy of USF2 than of USF1. However, the underlying mechanism is here uncertain because, as mentioned above, Siritoet al. (26Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown that USF1 concentration is decreased in USF2-deficient mice, whereas USF2 is increased in USF1-deficient mice. In conclusion, the USF knock out mouse models have allowed us to demonstrate a differential role of USF1 and USF2 in the transcriptional response of liver genes to glucose. Indeed, a normal glucose responsiveness seems to require the presence of either USF1/USF2 heterodimers or USF2 homodimers, even in mice with total USF binding activity reduced by half, whereas USF1 homodimers give rise to a delayed response. This result could reflect an intrinsic difference in the transactivating efficiency of USF isoforms. Accordingly, consequences of USF2 deficiency on embryonic development are more severe than those of USF1 deficiency. Further investigations will determine how transactivation of glucose responsiveness by USF2-containing dimers is finely tuned by glucose. We thank M. Cognet and I.

https://openalex.org/W1978105472,"We have recently discovered an alternative function of the putative metastasis suppressor protein Nm23, which is identical to nucleoside diphosphate kinase, as a protein phosphotransferase in vitro. While purified native Nm23 protein did not phosphorylate other proteins, we could purify a Nm23-associated protein that activates the protein phosphotransferase function; it was identified as a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) isoenzyme. Co-expression and purification of (His)6-tagged GAPDH in combination with either Nm23-H1 or Nm23-H2 in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells showed that only Nm23-H1, but not Nm23-H2, forms a stable complex with GAPDH. Protein phosphotransferase activity was confirmed for the recombinant GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex but not for either of the enzymes alone, nor was this activity observed after simple mixing of the purified proteinsin vitro. The molecular mass of the highly purified recombinant GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex suggests that a dimer of GAPDH interacts with a dimer of Nm23-H1. In contrast to the complex with GAPDH, co-expression of Nm23-H1 with antioxidant protein (MER-5) or creatine kinase did not activate the protein phosphotransferase function, indicating that this activation may specifically require GAPDH as a binding partner.

The first member of the nm23 gene family has been isolated due to its reduced expression in highly metastatic clones of murine melanoma cells as compared with their nonmetastatic counterparts (1Steeg P.S.

The proposed metastasis suppressor activity of this gene, now termed nm23-H1, has subsequently been confirmed in numerous functional studies: transfection of nm23-H1cDNA into highly metastatic melanoma or mamma carcinoma cell lines resulted in a significant reduction of metastatic potential in vivo (2Leone A.

In many human tumors, such as mammary carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and malignant melanomas, reduced expression of nm23 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and decreased disease-free survival of the patients (reviewed in Ref. 6De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In other tumor types, however, increased expression of nm23was associated with cell proliferation and advanced stages of the disease (7Engel M. Theisinger B. Seib Th Seitz G. Huwer H. Zang K.D.

The later cloned gene nm23-H2, although 81% identical to nm23-H1, provided little or no evidence for a metastasis suppressor activity in tumor expression studies and in a transfection assay (3Leone A.

Erent M. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), are more distantly related to the first discovered genes and no experimental data are known so far regarding their metastasis suppressor potential. The biochemical mechanism(s) underlying the antimetastatic properties of Nm23-H1 are unknown. Allnm23 genes as known today have been demonstrated to encode for nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) 1The abbreviations used are: NDPnucleoside diphosphateAwdk-pnAwd killer of prune(d)NTP(deoxy)nucleoside triphosphateGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. kinases. These long known enzymes are ubiquitously expressed and remarkably conserved throughout evolution. For example, the human NDP kinase is 80, 62, and 40% identical to the NDP kinases from Drosophila,Dictyostelium, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The human genes nm23-H1 and nm23-H2encode for NDP kinase A and B, respectively, which form mixed heterohexamers in vivo (15Gilles A.M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that this “housekeeping” enzymatic activity is not responsible for the observed metastasis suppressor function of Nm23-H1 (16Golden A. Benedict M. Shearn A. Kimura N. Leone A. Liotta L. Steeg P.S. Benz C. Liu E. Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Human Malignancies. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1993: 345-358Google Scholar). InDrosophila, the developmental effects of a specific point mutation in the NDP kinase (identical to the Awd protein) can be dissociated from its enzymatic activity, too. The so-calledawdk-pn mutation, which represents a substitution of proline 96 by serine (17Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Véron M. J. Biol.

A distinct biochemical function as a transcription factor for c-myc was identified for Nm23-H2 but not for Nm23-H1 (20Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar,21Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.L. Mesnildrey S. Véron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that the DNA binding activity is rather nonspecific, preferring single stranded polypyrimidine sequences (21Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.L. Mesnildrey S. Véron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and that the antimetastatic function of Nm23 is likely due to other biochemical activities (22Michelotti E.F. Sanford S. Freije J.M.P. MacDonald N.J. Steeg P.S. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22526-22530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Three years ago, we discovered an alternative function of the Nm23 proteins from different species as serine/threonine-specific protein phosphotransferases (23Engel M. Véron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), so called because, at least under in vitro assay conditions, phosphorylation of other proteins occurred stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. Using different mutants of DictyoseliumNDP kinase we could also show that the protein phosphotransferase activity depends on the same active site as the NDP kinase activity. Meanwhile the novel activity was confirmed by other groups (24Inoue H. Takahashi M. Oomori A. Sekiguchi M. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Ann K.S. Nelson D.L. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Lu Q. Park H.

A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The possible phosphorylation reactions of Nm23/NDP kinase can be summarized as in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 N1TP+Nm23⇌N1DP+Nm23­His­PEquation 1 N2DP+Nm23­His­P⇌N2TP+Nm23Equation 2 or Prot­Ser/Thr+Nm23­His­P→Prot­Ser/Thr­P+Nm23Equation 3 The ability to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues of other proteins in addition to nucleoside diphosphates provides a promising hypothesis how Nm23 may participate in signal transduction, thus controlling tumor metastasis. Highly purified Nm23 proteins did not show any protein phosphotransferase activity unless nondenaturing amounts of urea were added which are suggested to induce conformation changes (23Engel M. Véron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since these conditions were rather artificial, we investigated whether native Nm23 proteins could be isolated from human cells in a stable, protein phosphotransferase-active state. In the present study, we demonstrate that Nm23-H1 protein exists in a specific complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in vivo that exhibits protein phosphotransferase activity. human erythrocyte concentrate (200 ml) was mixed with 800 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 40 min at 14,000 × gand 4 °C. The supernatant was stirred gently overnight at 4 °C with 7 ml of cAMP-agarose (Sigma). Then the cAMP-agarose was filled into a column and washed with buffer A until absorption at 280 nm had decreased to zero. Washing was continued with two-column volumes of buffer A containing 1 mm cAMP, and bound proteins were eluted with 30 mm cAMP in buffer A. The cAMP eluate was precipitated overnight at 4 °C by dialysis against a saturated solution of (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was redissolved in a small volume of buffer B (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) and applied to a Superdex-200 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in buffer B containing 140 mm(NH4)2SO4. Gel filtration was carried out at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min at 8 °C. The collected fractions were assayed for the presence of Nm23 proteins by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) also containing 2 mm EDTA, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All fractions showing the characteristic Nm23-H1/-H2 band pair around 18 kDa were then assayed for protein phosphotransferase activity as described previously (23Engel M. Véron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), using heat-denatured CX-1 proteins as test substrate. Positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA). The dialysate was applied on a Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with buffer C, and the bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The collected fractions were analyzed for protein phosphotransferase activity, and proteins present in the fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Proteins in the Mono-Q fraction containing the protein phosphotransferase-activating protein were precipitated by addition of 8 volumes of acetone, and the precipitate was washed with 80% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without heating. SDS-PAGE was performed exactly as described by Dunbar and Wilson (28Dunbar B. Wilson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to a Immobilon-PSQ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Trans-Blot SD; Bio-Rad). After staining the membrane with Coomassie Blue, the protein band of interest (∼1 μg) was cut out and sent to a commercial sequencing service (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA). All cDNA fragments intended for cloning were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR. RNA (10 μg) isolated from human colon tissue was reverse-transcribed using Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and aliquots of the obtained cDNA were used for PCR employing the following primer sequences:nm23-H1, H1–5′-Bam (5′-GCGGATCCATGGCCAACTGTGAGCGTAC-3′) and H1–3′ (5′-CCTCCTGTCATTCATAGATCC-3′) for cloning in pQE-30 (Quiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), H1–5′-Bam and H1–3′-Eco (5′-GCGAATTCCCTCCTGTCATTCATAGATCC-3′) for cloning in p2Bac (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, NM) and in pALTER-Ex2 (Promega, Madison, WI); nm23-H2, H2–5′-Bam (5′-GCGGATCCATGGCCAACCTGGAGCGCAC-3′), and H2–3′-Eco (5′-GCGAATTCGACTGCTGTTGTGTCCACCTC-3′) for cloning in p2Bac; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): GAP-5′-BsiHis6 (5′-ATCGTACGATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGGAAG GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3′) and GAP-3′-Spe (5′-CGACTAGTTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG-3′) for cloning in p2Bac, GAP-5′-Bam (5′-GCGGATCCATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3′) and GAP-3′-Spe for cloning in pQE-30; creatine kinase, CK-5′-Bam (5′-TGTGGATCCGCTGCCAGTGAACGACGG-3′) and CK-3′ (5′-CGATGGGGAGTTAATGCTTG-3′) for cloning in pQE-30; MER-5, MER5–5′-Bam (5′-GTGGATCCGCGGCTGCTGTAGGACGGTTGCTC-3′) and MER5–3′ (5′-GAGAAGGTGCAGATACACATGGGTG-3′) for cloning in pQE-30. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 3 s, 57–62 °C (according to individual melting points of primers) for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s (nm23), 1 min (GAPDH and MER-5) or 2 min (creatine kinase), 35 cycles; 72 °C, 12 min, 1 cycle. The PCR products were excised from agarose gels, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned into the respective vectors that had also been cut appropriately and dephosphorylated. The correctness of the cDNA inserts was verified by double-stranded automatic sequencing. The recombinant bicistronic p2Bac vector (4 μg) containing the GAPDH sequence and the nm23-H1 or -H2 sequence, respectively, was transfected in combination with 0.5 μg of Bac-N-Blue virus DNA (Invitrogen) in Sf9 insect cells (2 × 106). The transfection was carried out in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. 72 h after transfection a plaque assay was performed to purify recombinant virus from any uncut or nonrecombinant viral DNA according to the manufacturer′s protocol. Putative recombinant plaques were chosen, and viruses were amplified by infection of log-phase Sf9 cells (P-1 stock). 20 μl of each of the P-1 stocks were then used to prepare high titer viral stocks (P-2) by reinfection. 1 ml each of these P-2 stocks was added to 6 × 106 Sf9 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks. 48 and 72 h after infection, respectively, the cells were harvested and checked for recombinant protein expression. Cells from 20 flasks were pooled and used for protein purification as described below. pQE-30 vectors carrying GAPDH, MER-5, or creatine kinase inserts, respectively, and pALTER-Ex2-nm23-H1 were used to co-transform E. coli JM109-competent cells. Bacteria were plated on LB agar containing 13 μg/ml tetracycline, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 2% glucose. Single colonies were then picked, grown in 1-liter LB medium containing the same antibiotics to anA600 of 0.5 at 37 °C, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express recombinant proteins for 4 h at 30 °C. After harvesting Sf9 cells (see above) or bacteria by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatant was stirred in a Baker glass at 4 °C for 30 min with Ni2+-chelate-agarose (Quiagen) previously washed in binding buffer. The Ni2+-agarose was filled into a column which was then connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Washing was performed at room temperature with wash buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) until UV absorption had declined to almost zero, then proteins bound to the column were eluted with a flat gradient of 0–400 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Since the creatine kinase·Nm23-H1 and the MER-5·Nm23-H1 complexes were already about 85% pure at this stage (not shown) and no protein kinase activity was found (see “Results”), purification was stopped here. The main peak fraction containing the recombinant GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex was passed over a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C to exchange buffer against RY buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). The protein solution was then stirred gently for 1 h at 4 °C with Reactive Yellow agarose (Sigma) which had been equilibrated before in RY buffer. Then the agarose was filled into a column, and the column was washed with RY buffer until the UV absorption had declined to zero. The bound protein complex was eluted with 1 mm ATP in RY buffer and extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The buffer was changed three times over a period of 2 days and contained in addition a suspension of activated charcoal to remove most of the ATP from the solution. For size exclusion chromatography and stoichiometrical measurements, the buffer of the complex eluted from Reactive Yellow agarose was exchanged against buffer S (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.3) using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then the solution was passed over a Source-30S cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The complex was collected in the flow-through fraction. When (His)6-GAPDH and (His)6-Nm23-H1 were purified as isolated proteins from bacteria transformed with the respective recombinant pQE-30 vector alone, Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography was used as a single step method to purify the proteins. The procedure was essentially the same as described above, except that 1 m NaCl was included in the binding and wash buffers in order to prevent nonspecific binding to the affinity material and to remove possible E. coli proteins interacting with the respective recombinant protein. GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex (0.5 mg) was applied to a Superdex-200 column in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Parmacia Biotech) either alone or mixed together with standard proteins and chromatographed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Vo was determined using blue dextran. The elution volumes of the proteins as detected by UV absorbance that were used for the calibration curve were mean values from three consecutive runs. NDP kinase activity was determined using a coupled enzymatic assay. Nm23 samples were added to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm dTDP, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 2 units of pyruvate kinase in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 0.1% 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 n HCl and mixing. After addition of 10 n NaOH (200 μl) and ethanol (1 ml), absorption of the hydrazone was measured at 520 nm. A calibration curve was established by adding known amounts of pyruvate to the reaction mixture above but omitting Nm23 and pyruvate kinase. NDP kinase activity was expressed as micromoles of ADP·min−1·mg−1 (units/mg). The activity of GAPDH was measured spectrophotometrically in the direction of NADH utilization. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADH, 15 units of phosphoglycerate kinase, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the GAPDH samples in a final volume of 1 ml. Incubation was continued at room temperature until there was no change in UV absorbance. Then 3-phosphoglycerate was added to the reaction mixture (6 mmfinal concentration), and the change of UV absorbance was recorded at 340 nm. The enzymatic activity was expressed in micromoles of NADH oxidized per min per mg of GAPDH protein, units/mg (εNADH= 6.22 cm2/μmol). Samples intended for densitometry were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein concentrations of noncomplexed GAPDH and Nm23-H1 were determined both by the method of Bradford and by measuring the optical density at 280 nm (extinction coefficients for 1 mg/ml solution: GAPDH, 0.8; Nm23-H1, 1.2). Different known amounts of these proteins were co-electrophoresed with the samples and used later to create a calibration curve. After staining, the SDS-gels were dried, digitized with a scanner, and densitometrically analyzed using the NIH Image program (version 1.60 for PowerPC). The amounts of GAPDH and Nm23-H1, respectively, in the complex were determined using the calibration curve. In order to isolate a protein phosphotransferase activity involving Nm23 from human erythrocytes we employed the following chromatographic steps: 1) cAMP-agarose affinity chromatography, 2) gel filtration on Superdex-200, and 3) anion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q. After each step, individual fractions were assayed for the presence of Nm23 protein and the positive fractions again for protein phosphotransferase activity. Fig. 1 A shows the chromatograph of the last purification step. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and assayed for protein phosphotransferase activity using heat-denatured protein extract as a test substrate (Fig. 1 B). The activity sought after was mainly found in the same fractions as the Nm23 hexamers containing equal proportions of Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 proteins (A3B3). Silver staining of an analytical SDS-gel revealed that the protein phosphotransferase activity coincided with the presence of a 37-kDa protein in fractions 12, 18, and 20 (Fig.1 C). Other proteins co-purified with the Nm23-H1 and -H2 proteins were not consistently found in all fractions showing protein phosphotransferase activity. Moreover, the relative amount of 37-kDa protein correlated well with the strength of protein substrate phosphorylation, if a stoichiometric mode of phosphotransfer was assumed (23Engel M. Véron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The co-purified 37-kDa protein was N-terminally sequenced and surprisingly identified as a GAPDH isoenzyme (TableI).Table IN-terminal sequence of the Nm23-associated protein from fraction 12 (Fig. 1C) and homology with GAPDHN-terminal amino acid sequenceHuman GAPDH (muscle, liver)VKVGVNGFGRIGRLVTRAAFN‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖‖ ‖‖‖‖Nm23-associated 37-kDa proteinVKVGVNGFGRIGRLVTXAAFNX denotes an amino acid that could not be clearly identified in the Edman degradation Open table in a new tab X denotes an amino acid that could not be clearly identified in the Edman degradation To examine the characteristics of the Nm23·GAPDH complex, we tried to reproduce the interaction in vitro by mixing purified (His)6-GAPDH with both purified, non-(His)6-tagged Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 protein, respectively. After incubation with Ni2+-chelate beads and washing of the beads, no binding of GAPDH to either of the Nm23 proteins was observed after elution of the bound fraction (data not shown). Since the purified proteins were all oligomers in solution, it was hypothesized that binding might occur only between monomers or lower order oligomeric forms. To further meet all possible needs for the action of chaperones or post-translational modifications to form a complex, we decided to reproduce the interaction in vivo by co-expressing the recombinant proteins in insect cells. Bicistronic vectors were constructed with both human GAPDH and Nm23-H1 or Nm23-H2 cDNA as inserts. After homologous recombination with baculovirus DNA the virus was used to infect Sf9 cells which simultaneously overexpressed the recombinant proteins in high quantity (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and6). GAPDH was fused to a (His)6-tag which simplified purification and allowed to immediately check complex formation with non-(His)6-tagged Nm23 proteins. After purification of the recombinant proteins, it was observed that only Nm23-H1, but not Nm23-H2, protein forms a stable complex with GAPDH (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 7). Protein phosphotransferase activity was confirmed for the GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex (Fig.2 B). This complex was also produced by co-expression inE. coli and displayed the same protein phosphotransferase activity after purification (Fig.3, lane 1). In contrast, the latter activity was not observed for either of the bacterially expressed enzymes alone or for a mixture of the purified components (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4). To determine the molecular mass of the GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex, larger amounts of the recombinant complex were produced in E. coli. However, as observed before with the complex derived from insect cells, free GAPDH was in large excess over GAPDH actually bound to Nm23-H1. The reason was possibly that not every GAPDH molecule synthesized in vivo was captured in a complex, and part of the complexes may have dissociated during purification, resulting in loss of Nm23-H1. To free the protein complexes from unbound GAPDH, the mixture was passed over a Source30S cation exchange column. While noncomplexed GAPDH was retained by the column due to the high pI value (>8), the complex having an estimated pI value equal to or only slightly higher than the pH of the buffer (7.3) was collected in the flow-through. The pure complex thus obtained was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Relative amounts of GAPDH and Nm23-H1 were determined by densitometrical measurement and by comparing the values with a calibration curve obtained by densitometry of known amounts of GAPDH and Nm23-H1, respectively (not shown). The stoichiometry of the binding partners in the complex was thus calculated to be 1:1 molar. Next, the molecular mass of the complex was determined using size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 column. Pure GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex (500 μg) was injected together with known standard proteins and eluted at a volume corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 107.4 kDa (Fig. 4). After gel filtration, the eluted fractions were reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure that the complex was still intact and had not dissociated during chromatography (data not shown). Considering the 1:1 molar ratio in the complex, the value of 107.4 kDa thus determined suggests that a dimer of GAPDH is associated with a dimer of Nm23-H1, which yields a calculated total molecular mass of 108 kDa. GAPDH has a basic pI very similar to Nm23-H2 (reported pI values for GAPDH range from 8.0 to 8.8), which explains the co-elution of the complex with the Nm23 he"
https://openalex.org/W2046583364,"Kinesins comprise a large family of microtubule-based motor proteins, of which individual members mediate specific types of motile processes. Using the ezrin domain of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a new kinesin-like protein, KIF1C. KIF1C represents a member of the Unc104 subfamily of kinesin-like proteins that are involved in the transport of mitochondria or synaptic vesicles in axons. Like its homologues, the 1103-amino acid protein KIF1C consists of an amino-terminal motor domain followed by a U104 domain and probably binds to target membranes through carboxyl-terminal sequences. Interestingly, KIF1C was tyrosine-phosphorylated after peroxovanadate stimulation when overexpressed in 293 or NIH3T3 fibroblasts or in native C2C12 cells. Using immunofluorescence, we found that KIF1C is localized primarily at the Golgi apparatus. In brefeldin A-treated cells, the Golgi membranes and KIF1C redistributed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This brefeldin A-induced flow of Golgi membranes into the ER was inhibited in cells transiently overexpressing catalytically inactive KIF1C. In conclusion, our data suggest an involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of the Golgi to ER membrane flow and describe a new kinesin-like motor protein responsible for this transport.

Adjacent to the stacked cisternae of the Golgi complex, regions of the ER membrane bud off to form vesicles. These vesicles then seem to fuse with a tubular network at the cis face of the Golgi apparatus. Vesicles are formed from the ER by the action of the coat protein II complex, and they incorporate vesicle targeting molecules (known as v-SNAREs). These proteins interact with corresponding t-SNAREs, which are present on the target membranes of the cis-Golgi network. Proteins not only leave the ER near Golgi membranes but emerge at sites that are distributed apparently randomly over the cell. These sites are marked by little groups of vesicles and tubules (vesicular-tubular clusters). The vesicular-tubular clusters, containing the secreted proteins, travel along microtubules (MTs) to the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the cis-Golgi network. This flow of membranes into the Golgi complex needs to be counterbalanced by a reverse (Golgi to ER) membrane transport pathway that involves coat protein I-coated vesicles traveling along MTs (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pelham H.R.B.

Intracellular transport along microtubules is controlled by two microtubule-based mechanochemical motor protein superfamilies: the dyneins and the kinesin-like proteins (KLPs) or kinesin family proteins (KIFs). Nucleation of microtubule growth by the microtubule-organizing center, which in many cell types is located close to the nucleus, results in a radially polarized array of MT with their fast growing (plus) ends at the periphery of the cell and their slow growing (minus) ends at the cell center. Dyneins and some members of the kinesin superfamily drive movement toward MT minus ends, whereas conventional kinesin and most kinesin-related proteins are involved in the movement of membrane-bound organelles and vesicles toward the plus ends of microtubules. In addition to their function in vesicle transport, motor proteins of both superfamilies are also involved in mitosis and meiosis. Recently, dynein was identified by Presley et al. (3Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J.M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) as the motor protein mediating the vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. Kinesins share a conserved motor domain of ∼340 amino acids, and similarities have been used to construct molecular phylogenies of the KLPs with so far eight subfamilies and numerous outgroups being described (4Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 18: 207-219Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Hirokawa N. Trends Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 135-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Outside of the motor domain, the amino acid sequences of the KLPs differ from each other, reflecting their different functions. Like kinesin, most KLPs have a central α-helical region. This region is judged to mediate the homodimerization of kinesin heavy chains (KHCs). The tail of kinesin is associated with two kinesin light chains and thought to bind the cargo and/or accessory proteins. An integral membrane protein, kinectin, has been identified to act as the link between kinesin and its cargo (6Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Very few associating proteins have been identified for KLPs. Candidates include KAP3 for KIF3A/3B regulating membrane binding of the KIF3 complex (7Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 for KLP38B (8Alphey L. Parker L. Hawcroft G. Guo G. Kaiser K. Morgan G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 395-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With only little knowledge about associated proteins, the regulation of motility and cargo binding of KLPs is poorly understood. Several reports have suggested that serine phosphorylation, which was observed in kinesin and kinectin (9Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), may play an important role. By contrast, no function of tyrosine phosphorylation has been demonstrated, although it has been reported for KHC (11Matthies H.J.G. Miller R.J. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11176-11187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a new kinesin-like motor protein, KIF1C, which is a ubiquitously expressed member of the U104 subfamily. KIF1C is tightly associated to the Golgi membranes and required for the retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles to the ER. We also provide evidence that this motor protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in intact cells, which adds tyrosine phosphorylation as a putative regulatory element in the vesicle transport between Golgi and ER. The ezrin-like domain of PTPD1 (Ref. 12Møller N.P.H. Møller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A skeletal muscle cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) was transformed into the L40 lexA-D1ezrin strain, and 106 transformants were screened for interaction as described (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Yeast plasmid DNA was isolated from His+ β-Gal+ colonies, rescued into Escherichia coli HB101, retransformed into L40 lexA-D1ezrin, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity and growth on dropout medium with complete supplement lacking Trp, Leu, Ura, Lys, and His (Bio101). The specificity of the interaction between the ezrin domain of PTPD1 and potential candidates was proven by transforming the candidate plasmid also into the L40 lexA and the L40 lexA-laminin strain. 2S. Hollenberg and J. Cooper, unpublished results. Clones interacting specifically with PTPD1 in the two-hybrid screen were subjected to sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Nonredundant nucleotide data bases (GenBankTM and EMBL) were searched for homologous sequences using the FASTA search algorithm. To obtain 5′-terminal KIF1C sequences, the partial KIF1C cDNA obtained from the two-hybrid screen (clone K1, base pairs 1196–4082) was used to screen a human hippocampus λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) by standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding the amino-terminal part of KIF1C were fused by conventional DNA cloning techniques to the KIF1C clone from the two-hybrid screen generating a full-length cDNA of KIF1C. A multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECH. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C with 5 × 106 cpm/ml of32P-random primed DNA probe as described by the manufacturer. The KIF1C rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of KIF1C (amino acids 362–725). The PTPD1 and the PTPH1 antisera were raised against peptides (PTPD1, residues 618–631; PTPH1, residues 900–913) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the 58K and β-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. For transient expression in 293 and NIH3T3 cells, all cDNAs were cloned by standard procedures into the cytomegalovirus immediate early promotor-based expression plasmid pRK5 (16Lammers R.

For generation of the catalytically inactive mutant of KIF1C, KIF1C-K103A, the codon of lysine 103 was mutated to a codon for alanine using the method of Kunkel et al. (17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). In the ΔNT-KIF1C protein amino acids 1–571 are replaced by the sequence MYPYDVPDYA, which contains the nonapeptide of the hemagglutinin protein of human influenza virus. NIH3T3, RD, and C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mm glutamine. 293 and BOSC23 cells were maintained in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine. Before stimulation with peroxovanadate (POV) (18Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol.

Taxol (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μm, colcemid (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml, and brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. KIF1C stably overexpressing NIH3T3 cells (3T3/X/KIF1C) were generated by retroviral infection of exponentially growing cells. The retrovirus was obtained by transfection of BOSC23 cells with the pLXSN-KIF1C plasmid (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Transfection of 293 and NIH3T3 cells was performed using the method of Chen and Okayama (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Treatment and lysis of the cells were performed as described (16Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm plate (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were adjusted for equal protein concentration, and the appropriate antibody (2 μl of serum or 2 μg of antibody) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and incubated for at least 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with the respective antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad, Sigma). Before reprobing, blots were incubated for 30 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C. For immunofluorescence studies, NIH3T3 cells grown on uncoated glass coverslips were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold methanol at −20 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 15 min with 0.1% NaBH4 and 0.1m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline to block autofluorescence. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked for 45 min with PBG (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.045% fish gelatin) containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. Incubation with the primary antibody was done for 1.5 h at 37 °C after dilution in PBG containing 5% normal goat serum; the affinity-purified KIF1C antibody was used at a concentration of 20 ng/μl unless otherwise stated, and the 58K antibody (Sigma) was diluted as recommended by the manufacturer. After five washes with PBG, primary antibody binding was detected with isotype-specific secondary antibody conjugated with either DTAF or Cy3 (Dianova). The coverslips were mounted in PermaFlour (Immunotech). Triton extraction of cells for immunofluorescence under MT-stabilizing conditions was performed prior to fixation for 5 min on ice in a buffer containing 100 mmPipes, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.75% Triton X-100, 10 μm taxol (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis under MT-destabilizing conditions was performed in the lysis buffer described above lacking EGTA and with the addition of 80 μmCaCl2 (21Steuer E.R. Wordeman L. Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), to the group of cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatases containing an ezrin-like domain. This domain is homologous to the amino-terminal portion of the cytoskeleton-associated proteins of the band 4.1 superfamily, and in the case of the ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) mediates the association with the membrane-spanning protein CD44 (26Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), thereby linking the cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane. By contrast, the functional relevance of this ezrin-like domain in PTPs has not yet been described. To identify proteins binding to the ezrin-like domain of PTPD1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system (for a review, see Ref.27Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A human skeletal muscle cDNA library was screened using the ezrin-like domain of PTPD1 (amino acids 1–345) fused to the lexA DNA binding domain as the bait. Out of 106 clones screened, nine clones were found to interact with the ezrin-like domain of PTPD1 in yeast. Sequence analysis suggested that the clones encoded cDNAs derived from the same gene. None of the clones isolated contained a full-length open reading frame, but all of them encoded an overlapping sequence of 96 amino acids (amino acids 714–809), apparently sufficient for binding PTPD1. The missing 5′-end of the cDNA was isolated from a human hippocampus library by conventional screening using the K1 cDNA obtained in the two-hybrid screen (base pairs 1196–4082) as a probe. The sequence showed greatest homology to the kinesin-like motor protein KIF1B (28Nangaku M. Sato-Yoshitake R. Okado Y. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yamazaki H. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1994; 79: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and in accordance with the nomenclature introduced by Nangaku et al. (28Nangaku M. Sato-Yoshitake R. Okado Y.

Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), this protein was named KIF1C. The complete cDNA of KIF1C has a size of 4.1 kilobase pairs and contains a single open reading frame coding for a 1103-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 122,000 (Fig.1). KIF1C belongs to the family of kinesin-like proteins as evidenced by the presence of the kinesin signature (amino acids 242–253) in the amino-terminal motor domain. In addition, the protein contains a P-loop sequence (amino acids 97–104) characteristic for ATP- or GTP-binding proteins (30Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) and the consensus sequence of the nucleotide binding motif for kinesins (31Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D.

Like all MT-dependent motor proteins, KIF1C is capable of binding microtubules in vitro and in intact cells (data not shown). Close to the amino-terminal motor domain, KIF1C contains a U104 domain, which is also found in the other kinesins belonging to the Unc104 subfamily and in the AF-6 and Cno gene products (33Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 265-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The function of the U104 domain has not yet been defined.

More recently, in a polymerase chain reaction screen, a partial amino acid sequence of the motor domain of murine KIF1C was identified and showed 98% homology to human KIF1C (37Nakagawa T. Tanaka Y. Matsuoka E. Kondo S. Okada Y. Noda Y. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9654-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, a sequence alignment of the three known mammalian members of this subfamily is depicted. KIF1C shows a high degree of homology to KIF1A and KIF1B in the motor and U104 domain but significantly lower homology to these proteins in the central and carboxyl-terminal regions. While most kinesin-like proteins form homodimers by folding an α-helical coiled-coil in the stalk domain (4Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 18: 207-219Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the proteins of the Unc104 subfamily are judged to exist predominantly as globular monomers due to the low probability of forming coiled-coils (28Nangaku M. Sato-Yoshitake R. Okado Y. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yamazaki H. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1994; 79: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 29Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Using the algorithm of Lupas (38Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that KIF1C also has only a low probability to form coiled-coil structures (data not shown). This implies that KIF1C, similar to KIF1A and KIF1B, may act as a monomeric motor. To study the size of the transcript and the tissue distribution of KIF1C, Northern blot analysis using the cDNA fragment K9 (base pairs 2252–3126) as a probe was performed. A KIF1C transcript of approximately 4.2 kilobase was detected in all tissues examined but with especially high expression in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3 A). For Western blot analysis, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against KIF1C was raised against a glutathione S-transferase-KIF1C fusion protein containing the intervening region between the motor domain and the PTPD1 binding domain of KIF1C. When screening various cell lines for KIF1C protein expression, we detected KIF1C as a protein of approximately 135 kDa (Fig. 3 B). The discrepancy between the calculated molecular weight and the one observed in SDS-PAGE could be caused by posttranslational modifications of KIF1C. Interestingly, the human KIF1C has a slightly higher mobility than the rodent protein. This may be due to differences in the number of amino acids or, alternatively, to posttranslational modifications. The size of the protein in human cell lines corresponds to the size of the protein expressed after transfection of a KIF1C expression construct into 293 cells, indicating that we indeed cloned the complete sequence of KIF1C. As described above, KIF1C was isolated as a cDNA encoding a protein capable of binding to the ezrin-like domain of PTPD1. Nine cDNAs were isolated, which all differ in length from each other and thus are independent and not derived from clonal amplification of the same original cDNA. They all contain a region in the carboxyl-terminal half of KIF1C, encoding the amino acids 714–809. This demonstrates that these 96 residues are sufficient to bind PTPD1 (Fig.4 A). While the two-hybrid system has now been successfully used many times to demonstrate protein-protein binding, it is also known to be capable of producing false positives. To confirm the interaction of PTPD1 and KIF1C in a different system, we examined the association under the condition of overexpression within cells. Therefore, we expressed KIF1C alone or together with PTPD1 transiently in 293 cells. After immunoprecipitations using the PTPD1 antiserum, the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with the affinity-purified KIF1C antibody. As shown in Fig.4 B, KIF1C coprecipitated with PTPD1. The specificity of the KIF1C interaction was investigated in a similar coexpression experiment with a related tyrosine phosphatase, PTPH1, also containing an amino-terminal ezrin-like domain. However, no coprecipitation of KIF1C with PTPH1 could be observed, although KIF1C was expressed (Fig.4 B). Furthermore, we tested the ezrin-like domains of PTPBAS, PTPMEG, and PTPD2 and did not find an association with KIF1C (data not shown). The binding of KIF1C is therefore specific for PTPD1, and future work is necessary to show the physiological relevance of this interaction. Since KIF1C was identified by its association with a PTP, we investigated whether KIF1C itself can be tyrosine-phosphorylated. We therefore expressed KIF1C in 293 cells and stimulated the cells with POV. In a parallel experiment, we coexpressed KIF1C with the cytosolic tyrosine kinase c-Src. As shown in Fig. 5 A, KIF1C was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon treatment with POV and also upon coexpression with c-Src. To prove equal amounts of KIF1C expression in the experiment, we reprobed the filter with KIF1C antibody. The lower band probably represents an unphosphorylated degradation product. To confirm these data in a cell line stably overexpressing KIF1C, a NIH3T3-derived cell line was generated by infection with a retrovirus encoding KIF1C. The 3T3/X/KIF1C cells were stimulated with POV before lysis, and KIF1C was immunoprecipitated. As observed in 293 cells, KIF1C was again tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B). The phosphorylated proteins detected in addition to KIF1C could represent associated proteins. We next investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of endogenous KIF1C in undifferentiated mouse C2C12 cells. KIF1C was immunoprecipitated from cleared Triton X-100 lysates and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5 C, KIF1C is tyrosine-phosphorylated after POV stimulation and to a low extent also in unstimulated cells, as observed in longer exposures of the same blot. These data indicate that the motor protein KIF1C is tyrosine-phosphorylated in intact cells, which can be enhanced by treatment of the cells with the PTP inhibitor POV. As a tyrosine kinase potentially capable of phosphorylating KIF1C, c-Src was identified. To elucidate the functions of KIF1C, we performed immunofluorescence experiments utilizing the affinity-purified antibody against endogenous KIF1C. Studies in NIH3T3 fibroblasts revealed that KIF1C is localized mainly on a tubular structure close to the nucleus, which is reminiscent of the stacks of the Golgi apparatus (Fig.6 A). In a control experiment, the Golgi apparatus was detected using a monoclonal antibody against the protein 58K (Fig. 6 C) which is described to be located specifically at the cis/medial site of the Golgi apparatus by binding simultaneously to microtubules and the Golgi membranes (39Bloom G.S.

Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1476-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To prove that KIF1C indeed colocalizes with the Golgi, we performed double staining of KIF1C and 58K. Conventional microscopy (Fig. 6, D and E) as well as laser confocal microscopy (data not shown) clearly demonstrated the colocalization of KIF1C with the 58K protein at the Golgi stacks.

In contrast, unliganded steroid receptors exist in heterocomplexes with hsp90 and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain protein, such as an immunophilin. Although p50cdc37 and TPR domain proteins bind directly to hsp90, p50cdc37 is not present in native steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes. To obtain some insight as to how v-Raf selects predominantly hsp90·p50cdc37 heterocomplexes, rather than hsp90·TPR protein heterocomplexes, we have examined the binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90 and to Raf. We show that p50cdc37 exists in separate hsp90 heterocomplexes from the TPR domain proteins and that intact TPR proteins compete for p50cdc37 binding to hsp90 but a protein fragment containing a TPR domain does not. This suggests that the binding site for p50cdc37 lies topologically adjacent to the TPR acceptor site on the surface of hsp90. Also, we show that p50cdc37 binds directly to v-Raf, with the catalytic domain of Raf being sufficient. We propose that the combination of exclusive binding of p50cdc37 versus a TPR domain protein to hsp90 plus direct binding of p50cdc37 to Raf allows the protein kinase to select for the dominant hsp90·p50cdc37 composition that is observed with a variety of protein kinase heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cytosols.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) heterocomplexes contain p50cdc37 , but no TPR protein has been identified. We have shown that v-Raf, a serine/threonine kinase involved in signal transduction, also exists in heterocomplexes with hsp90 and p50cdc37 (31Stancato L.F. Chow Y-H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H.

Although v-Raf immune pellets have the ability to bind a small amount of [3H]FK506 in a Raf·hsp90-specific manner (32Stancato L.F. Chow Y-H. Owens-Grillo J.K. Yem A.W. Deibel M.R. Jove R. Pratt W.B.

It is not known how the protein that is being chaperoned by hsp90 (i.e. steroid receptor or protein kinase) determines the composition of the heterocomplex. In this report, we provide evidence that p50cdc37 binds to hsp90 at a site on its surface that is near the binding site for the TPR domain proteins. Using FLAG-tagged p50cdc37 and PP5, we show that p50cdc37 exists in separate hsp90 heterocomplexes from the TPR proteins. In addition to binding to hsp90, p50cdc37 binds directly to Raf. It is known that, during the process of Raf·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, Raf is transiently associated with p60 (also called Hop) (33Stancato L.F. Silverstein A.M. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chow Y-H.

Our observations are consistent with a model in which dissociation of p60/Hop from the newly formed Raf·hsp90 complex results in an open region on the surface of the hsp90 dimer that can be occupied by either p50cdc37 or a TPR protein. With continued exchange binding of p50cdc37 and TPR domain proteins to Raf-associated hsp90, Raf·hsp90·p50cdc37 complexes are rapidly selected because p50cdc37 also binds directly to Raf.

Homogenates were centrifuged 15 min at 12,000 × g. Native hsp90 heterocomplexes were immunoadsorbed from 150 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 2 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of 3G3 antibody prebound to 12 μl of protein A-Sepharose, as described previously (24Owens-Grillo J.K.

Native p60/Hop heterocomplexes were immunoadsorbed from 150 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with DS14F5 antibody against p60 (3%), and FLAG-PP5 or FLAG-p50 was immunoadsorbed with 6 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope. All immunopellets were washed three times by suspension in 1 ml of TEGM buffer (10 mm TES, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.6), and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots were probed with 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90 (or, in the case of insect hsp90, with 0.1% hsp70/hsp90 antiserum), 0.1% UPJ56 for hsp56, 0.1% PP5 antiserum for PP5, 1 μg/ml M2 monoclonal for the FLAG-proteins, 0.1% DS14F5 for p60/Hop, 0.1% p50 antiserum for p50cdc37 , 0.1% anti-Raf antiserum for v-Raf, 0.1% GST ascites for GST-Raf, or 0.1% anti-cyclophilin 40 for CyP-40. The immunoblots were developed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and/or 125I-conjugated counter antibody. Although immunoblots from individual immunoadsorption or competition binding experiments are presented, the experiments have been performed at least three times and corroborating results obtained by immunoadsorption of, or competition by, other proteins are usually presented in other panels of the same figure. Rabbit hsp90 was purified from brain cytosol as described by Hutchison et al. (40Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Aliquots (30 μl) of purified rabbit hsp90 (1 mg/ml) were immunoadsorbed to 12-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose precoupled with 15 μl of 3G3 antibody. Pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of HE buffer and suspended in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in a final volume of 100 μl, including 30 μl of the pooled, hsp90-free hydroxylapatite fraction of rabbit brain cytosol containing p60/Hop, PP5, FKBP52, p50cdc37 , and CyP-40 prepared exactly as described by Owens-Grillo et al.

In experiments where binding of proteins to hsp90 was competed with bacterially expressed p60/Hop, Sf9-expressed FLAG-PP5 or FLAG-p50cdc37 , bacterial lysate, or Sf9 cytosol was preincubated with the immunopellets in a final volume of 30 μl on ice for 20 min with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 3 min. The hydroxylapatite pool was then added and reaction mixtures were brought up to a final volume of 100 μl, and incubations were maintained on ice for 35 min with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 3 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of HEG buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Bacterially expressed p60/Hop was prepared as described previously (35Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Purification of rabbit FKBP52 was performed by binding the GST-FKBP52 to GSH-agarose and incubation at 4 °C with thrombin, which cleaves at a site between the GST domain and the FKBP52 domain. For bacterial expression of GST-Raf (COOH terminus), an in-frame deletion of amino acids 26–309 of human c-Raf-1 following digestion with PvuII and BglI (41Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector and in-frame with the GST propeptide to generate pGEXΔNRaf. The resulting construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A control construct including GST in fusion with the first 25 amino acids of human c-Raf-1 behaved similarly as GST alone, in that it bound neither to p50cdc37 nor to hsp90 (data not shown). Control E. coli and bacteria expressing the GST-tagged Raf (COOH terminus) were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline, and 50 μl of lysate were immobilized on 15 μl of glutathione-cross-linked agarose. v-Raf was immunoabsorbed from 3Y1 cytosol (200 μl) by rotation with the C-12 rabbit anti-Raf-1 IgG prebound to 8 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The immune pellets were washed two times with 1 ml of TEG plus 0.1% Triton X-100, then two times with TEG (for native Raf heterocomplexes, 20 mmmolybdate was present in the wash buffers). The pellets were then suspended in TEG buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and stripped of Raf-associated hsp90 by heating for 1 h at 30 °C followed by two buffer washes prior to incubation with 30 μl of cytosol from Sf9 cells expressing FLAG-p50cdc37 , 40 μl of purified FLAG-p50cdc37 , or 45 μl of purified bacterially expressed rabbit FKBP52.

The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing and subsequently used to generate FLAG-p50cdc37 encoding recombinant baculoviruses and high titer stocks, using the BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system from Life Technologies, Inc. Sf9 cells (1.8 × 107) were cultured into T-162 cm tissue culture flasks and infected with a baculovirus expressing FLAG-p50cdc37 at a multiplicity of infection of 3, then incubated for 2 days at 27 °C. Cytosol was prepared from infected cells and diluted 1:1 with TEG, the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.02%, and the diluted cytosol was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g. FLAG-tagged p50cdc37 was then purified using M2-agarose beads (IBI) according to manufacturer's instructions. Human p50cdc37 (amino acids 2–378) expressed as GST fusion protein was purified by GSH-Sepharose chromatography and used to generate p50cdc37 -specific antisera in rabbits. Although the rabbit anti-p50cdc37 antiserum exhibits a wide reactivity for p50cdc37 across species, it does not recognize the endogenous p50cdc37 expressed in insect Sf9 host cells. In a previous study (29Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we showed that a fragment containing the TPR domains of CyP-40 competed for the binding of FKBP52 and CyP-40 to hsp90. However, the binding of p60/Hop and p50cdc37 was not inhibited by the highest achievable level of the CyP-40 TPR fragment. Subsequently, we found that the fragment of PP5 containing its four TPRs bound much more tightly to hsp90 and competed for p60/Hop binding (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M-S.

In Fig. 1, we use this tight binding PP5 TPR fragment to compete for the binding of p50cdc37 and several TPR domain proteins to hsp90. In this experiment, an immune pellet alone (lane 1) or immune pellets prebound with purified hsp90 (lanes 2 and 3) were incubated with an hsp90-free hydroxylapatite pool of rabbit brain cytosol (29Owens-Grillo J.K.

As shown in lane 2 (Fig. 1), all four of these proteins bound to hsp90. However, in the presence of the PP5 TPR fragment (lane 3) binding of CyP-40 and FKBP52 was blocked and p60/Hop binding was inhibited. The p60/Hop band was probed with125I-labeled counter antibody, excised, and counted to determine the extent of inhibition. The PP5 TPR domain fragment (lane 3) reduced the binding of p60/Hop by 65% but it did not compete for the binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90 (cf. lanes 2 and 3). In contrast to the TPR domain fragment, intact TPR domain proteins do compete for binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90. In the experiment of Fig. 2 A, hsp90-bound 3G3 immune pellets were preincubated with buffer (lane 2), with lysate from control bacteria (lane 3), or with lysate from bacteria expressing p60/Hop (lane 4). The pellets were then incubated with the rabbit brain hydroxylapatite pool, and binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90 was assayed. It is clear from lane 4 that p60/Hop competes for the binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90. In Fig. 2 B, hsp90-bound immune pellets were preincubated with lysate from Sf9 cells expressing FLAG-p50cdc37 and then incubated with the hydroxylapatite pool. In the presence of the Sf9-expressed p50cdc37 (lane 4), the binding of p60/Hop to hsp90 was competed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Sf9-expressed FLAG-PP5 also competes for the binding of p50cdc37 to hsp90. The cloning and sequencing of p50cdc37 showed that it does not possess a TPR domain (6Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W.

As shown in the experiment of Fig. 1, we have occasionally observed an increase in the amount of p50cdc37 binding to hsp90 when the PP5 TPR fragment is present. Such an increase in p50cdc37 binding would occur if binding of TPR proteins to the TPR acceptor site on hsp90 prevented access of p50cdc37 to its binding site, but the small PP5 TPR fragment did not. These competition data suggest that the binding site for p50cdc37 may be close enough to the TPR binding site on the surface of hsp90 such that the binding of a protein to one site blocks access of the other protein to its binding site. If that is true, p50cdc37 should not exist in a native hsp90·TPR protein complex unless there is a binding site for each of the proteins on each half of th"

Farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed to prevent Ras processing and thus to be effective agents for the treatment of cancers harboring mutated ras. However, FTIs inhibit the growth of most tumor cells and several xenograft models, irrespective of whether they possess mutated ras. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effect is not correlated with inhibition of Ki-Ras processing; tumors with wild type rasare inhibited, and FTIs are not particularly toxic. These data suggest that the mechanism of FTI action is complex and may involve other targets besides Ras. To begin to understand how FTIs work, we investigated the mechanism of growth inhibition. FTI causes G1 arrest in a subset of sensitive lines. This is accomplished by transcriptional induction of p21, which mediates the inhibition of cyclin E-associated protein kinase activity, pRb hypophosphorylation and inhibition of DNA replication. Induction of p21 is p53-dependent; it does not occur in cells with mutant p53 or in cells expressing human papillomavirus E6. However, neither p53 nor p21 are required for inhibition of cell proliferation. FTI still blocks the growth of cells deficient in these proteins. In the absence of p21, G1 block is relaxed, DNA replication is not affected, and cells become polyploid and undergo apoptosis. These results suggest that farnesylated protein(s) may be involved in regulating p53 function and in coordinating entrance into S, and that the consequences of FTI treatment are a function of the other mutations found in the tumor cell.

The biologic activity of some proteins is dependent upon their isoprenylation. For example, farnesylation of Ras and geranylgeranylation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab and Rho families are necessary for proper subcellular localization and for efficient interaction with regulators and effectors (1Gibbs J.L.

However, it is not clear that the effects of the drug are due predominantly to inhibition of Ras processing.

Second, a majority of human tumor cell lines are sensitive to FTI whether or not they contain mutated rasgenes (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N.

These observations suggest that the phenotype induced by FTI might be due to effects on other farnesylated target proteins (3Coleman P.S. Chen L.C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Subcell.

(9Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. DeSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Graham S.L. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. Lebowitz P.F. Wechsler R.R. Kohl N.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2626-2632PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in transformed fibroblasts the growth and morphological changes induced by FTI correlate more closely with inhibition of RhoB processing than with changes in Ras. This is unlikely to be true in epithelial lineages, however, in which inhibition of growth by FTI is unassociated with characteristic changes in morphology and cytoskeletal architecture. The mechanism underlying FTI action is of interest for several reasons. The action of the drug is likely to be secondary to specific inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase. This suggests that one or several farnesylated protein(s) yet to be identified (or to be assigned such a function), play a critical role in the biology of transformation. Second, several FTIs are currently entering phase I trials as anticancer agents in humans. Rational clinical development will depend on an understanding of the biochemical basis for their inhibition of cell growth. We undertook to approach these questions by examining the mechanism(s) by which FTI arrested the growth of cancer cells. We found that in a subset of sensitive lines, FTI arrests cells in either G1 or G1 and G2. In these cell lines, FTI caused a p53-dependent induction of p21waf1/cip1/sdi, which led to inhibition of cyclin E- and A-associated protein kinase activities, accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), inhibition of DNA synthesis, and cell cycle arrest. However, whereas p21 induction was necessary for G1 block, it was not necessary for the cytotoxic effects of the drug. In cells in which p53 or p21 were knocked out, FTI caused endoreduplication of DNA and increased apoptosis. These data show that FTI affects cells in a complex manner that is, as it might be expected, dependent upon the complement of mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes in the tumor cell. They also suggest that farnesylated protein(s) may be involved in regulating cellular activity of p53. FTI L-744,832 was a generous gift from Drs. N. Kohl and A. Oliff at Merck & Co., West Point, PA. The drug was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Stocks were fractionated and stored at −80 °C. The human tumor cell lines MCF7, MDA MB-468, Colo 205, DU145, and PC3 were from the American Tissue Culture Collection. HCT116 p21 knockouts and parentals (16Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. T. Waldman and B. Vogelstein (John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, air. To investigate the effect of the FTI L-744,832 on the proliferation of MCF7 and HCT116 cells, growth curves and soft agar colony formation assays were performed as described in Sepp-Lorenzino et al. (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). In order to collect cells for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis and to obtain protein samples, cultures were seeded at a density of 2,500 cells/cm2 and incubated with or without 20 μmFTI for increasing time periods. Cells floating in the medium were collected by centrifugation, and attached cells were trypsinized. These populations were combined. The cell number was determined with a Coulter counter, and aliquots were prepared for protein and kinase analysis and determination of cell cycle parameters and apoptosis. Nuclei were prepared according to Giaretti and Nusse (17Giaretti W. Nusse M. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), stained with ethidium iodide, and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Conversely, samples for whole cell flow analysis were prepared according to Nusse et al. (18Nusse M. Julch M. Geido E. Bruno S. Di Vinci A. Giaretti W. Ruoss K. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Dual label FACS analysis was employed to determine the effect of the drug on DNA replication. Thirty minutes before harvest, cells were pulsed-labeled with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Samples were fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies conjugated with fluorescein (Becton Dickinson) and with propidium iodide prior to FACS analysis. Apoptosis was assessed with quantitative fluorescence microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assays combined with flow cytometry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assays were performed with the apo-BrdUrd kit from Pharmingen according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative fluorescence microscopy, 105 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stored at 4 °C until further analysis. Cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 25 μl of PBS containing 3 μg/ml bisbenzimide. Over 300 cells were counted with a fluorescence microscope, and the percentage of apoptosis was determined. Cells were extracted with RNAzol (Quality Biotech). Thirty μg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting using a HindIII-XbaI 0.7-kilobase pair fragment of p21 cDNA as a probe (kindly provided by Dr. J. Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering). The probe was labeled by random priming. Blots were also probed for a housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as a control for RNA loading. p21 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were quantitated with a PhosphorImager and p21 mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Extracts for protein analysis were prepared from PBS-washed cell pellets that had been stored at −20 °C. Pellets were lysed with 2% SDS, for pRb detection or with 1% Nonidet P-40 for Cdk activity assays. For total cell lysates, pellets were dissolved in 2% SDS in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, boiled 10 min, and sonicated three times for 30 s each time on ice. Nonidet P-40 lysates were obtained by incubating the cell pellets on ice for 15 min in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 1 mmV04Na3, 10 μg/ml each of soybean trysin inhibitor, aprotinin, and leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Ten percent polyacrylamide gels were used to detect cyclins, Cdks, and p21, whereas 7% gels were used for analysis of pRb. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with specific antibodies. All the antibodies for immunoblotting were from Santa Cruz. Protein detection was by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Cyclin-associated Cdk 2 and Cdc 2 protein kinase activity were assayed in vitro with histone H1 as the substrate. One-hundred μg of Nonidet P-40 lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-cyclin antibodies (sc-751 for cyclin A, sc-198 for cyclin E, and sc-181 for cyclin B, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Kinase reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of histone H1. Cdk 4 activity was analyzed in anti-Cdk 4 immunoprecipitates with a glutathione S-transferase-pRb fragment (Promega) as a substrate. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreiss sample buffer and then boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 10% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and blots were exposed to x-ray film or to a PhosphorImager screen. Kinase activity was quantitated with a FUJIX PhosphorImager. Blots were also probed for cyclins, kinases, and p21 using specific antibodies and detection by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Transient and stable transfections were carried out using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Transient transfections were employed to study the effect of FTI on the induction of the p21 promoter. Luciferase reporter constructs under control of the p21 promoter, either inact (WWP) or lacking the major p53 regulatory site (DM) (19El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), were cotransfected with SV40-β-galactosidase into MCF7 cells. After 16 h, cultures were split into 6-well plates and treated for either 24 or 48 h with or without 20 μm FTI in triplicate. Cells were harvested, and aliquots were employed for determination of β -galactosidase and luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase, which was unaffected by the FTI. HCT116 E6 transfectants were obtained upon co-transfection of the HPV-E6-AU1 epitope tagged under the control of the SV40 promoter (pSG5-HPV-E6-AU1) (kindly provided by Dr. M. Stöppler, Georgetown University Medical Center) with a neomycin resistance-conferring plasmid (pSV40-neo). Single cell clones were obtained after 2 weeks of growth in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Clones were characterized by E6 expression (upon immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-AU1 antibody (BabCo)), by the lower basal levels of p53 and by the decreased induction of p53 by doxorubicin (350 nm for 24 h). We have previously shown that FTI has a profound inhibitory effect on the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of a majority of human tumor cell lines (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). In order to begin to identify the target(s) responsible for the antiproliferative effect of the FTI, we investigated the mechanism of growth inhibition in several of the sensitive lines identified in our previous screen (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). FTI inhibited the growth of various cell lines without apparent changes in cell cycle parameters. On the other hand, in another subset of sensitive lines, inhibition of growth was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. For example, the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 is sensitive to the FTI (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cells, harboring wild type p53 and ras, and functional pRb; they posses low levels of epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2 and abundant levels of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (20Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Lebwohl D.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, FTI inhibited MCF7 cell proliferation and resulted in an increase in the proportion of G1 cells at the expense of cells in S phase, whereas the proportion of cells in G2 and mitosis remained largely unchanged (Fig. 1 B). G1 arrest was accompanied by hypophosphorylation of pRb as seen in Fig.1 C. Control cells maintained hyperphosphorylated pRb while in a logarithmic growth state; hypophosphorylation of pRb was detected at days 5 and 6 when cultures began to reach confluence. The mechanism by which FTI induced the hypophosphorylation of pRb and G1 block was investigated. FTI treatment led to a time-dependent inhibition of cyclin E- and A-associated kinase activities, whereas Cdk 4 kinase activity remained unchanged (Fig. 2 A and not shown). The kinase activity of cyclin E·Cdk 2 complexes declined earlier than that associated with cyclin A (24 h versus 48–72 h). FTI induced a decline in the steady-state levels of cyclin A (2–3-fold) and a slight decrease in Cdk 2, which might explain the effect on kinase activity of this complex (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the levels of Cdk 4 and cyclins E and D3 remained largely unchanged, whereas FTI increased cyclin D1 levels by 2–3-fold (Fig.2 B). As cyclin E kinase levels fell in the absence of major changes in cyclin E and Cdk 2 expression, the effects of FTI on the expression of Cdk inhibitors (Cdi) were determined. No changes were observed in the levels of p27, p15, p16, p18, and p19 (not shown); however, p21waf1/cip1/sdi was induced by treatment of MCF7 cells with 20 μm FTI (Fig.3 A). We also found that p21 levels rose with increased cell density in control cultures, yet the levels induced by FTI treatment are 2.5–5-fold higher than those of controls. It is also important to point out that the cell density in FTI-treated cultures remained very low compared with control cultures (Fig. 1 A), thus if a direct comparison could be made under equal density conditions the induction of p21 by FTI would be of a greater magnitude. The kinetics of induction of p21 by FTI were compared with those of doxorubicin, an agent known to induce DNA damage and p21. Cells were treated for increasing time periods with either 20 μm FTI or 350 nm doxorubicin and p21 levels were compared with those of untreated controls (Fig. 3 B). Doxorubin induced a rapid and marked increase in the steady-state levels of p21, detected after 3 h of drug treatment. In contrast, FTI induction took at least 16 h to become evident. A maximun p21 level was attained after 24 h in FTI when p21 was 5-fold higher than that in untreated controls. The induction of p21 by the FTI was accompanied by an increase in the steady-state levels of p21 mRNA (Fig.3 C). Increased p21 mRNA was also detected in control cultures as cell density increased; however, FTI induction was 4-fold greater (484 versus 2012 arbitrary units). We observed that the cells in which FTI induced p21 and caused G1 arrest had wild type p53. MCF7 and human colon carcinoma HCT116 are both p53 wild type cells, and in both, FTI treatment leads to increased p21, Cdk inhibition, Rb hypophosphorylation, and cell cycle block (Figs. 1, 2, and 6). On the contrary, FTI did not induce p21 in cell lines with mutated p53 (such as Colo 205, DU145, PC3, and MDA MB-468) that are sensitive to its effects on cell growth (Fig.4 A). In view of these results we sought to determine whether the induction of p21 in response to the FTI was dependent on p53.Figure 4p21 up-regulation by FTI is dependent on p53 function. A, a set of p53 positive and negative cell lines was tested for the ability of 20 μm FTI to induce p21 as described for Fig. 3. B, activation of the p21 promoter by FTI requires an intact p53-binding site and wild type p53 activity. MCF7 (p53+/+) and MDA MB 468 (p53 mut) cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs driven by the full-length p21 promoter (WWP) or a truncated promoter lacking the major p53 regulatory site (DM). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated for an additional 24 or 48 h with or without 20 μm FTI. Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of cotransfected SV40-β-galactosidase. Each point was done in triplicate. The graph represents the average of three independent experiments for the 24-h time point. At 48 h of treatment proportional results were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of the FTI on the transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter and its p53 dependence were investigated using a set of reporter constructs in which the luciferase gene was driven either by the intact p21 promoter (WWP-luc) or by a truncated p21 promoter, in which the major p53-binding element at −2.4 kilobase pairs is missing (DM-luc) (19El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). Transcription from the wild type p21 promoter was induced by the FTI in p53 wild type cells, but not in cells with mutant p53 (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the p53 binding site was necessary for transcriptional activation from the p21 promoter by FTI, as no significant changes in transcription were detected from the truncated promoter in p53 wild type cells treated with FTI (Fig.4 B). The requirement for p53 was further investigated by assessing the effects of FTI on cells engineered to express the E6 gene of the human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16). HPV16 E6 specifically targets p53 for degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (21Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). E6 was introduced into HCT116 cells and stable transfectants were isolated 2 weeks later as G418-resistant clones. Expression of E6 was confirmed by immunodetection of the AU1-tagged protein. These clones contained decreased basal levels of p53, and the up-regulation of p53 following DNA damage was attenuated (Fig.5 A). The induction of p21 by doxorubicin was decreased in the E6-expressing clones compared with neomycin-resistant controls, and no increase in p21 occurred in response to the FTI (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, the small increase in p53 levels detected in the neomycin controls treated with FTI was absent from the p53 deficient cells. These results support the conclusion that the FTI induces the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene by a p53-dependent mechanism. Are p21 and p53 required for the antiproliferative effect of the FTI? For this purpose we tested the effect of the FTI on the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of HCT116 cells expressing HPV16 E6 or lacking the p21 gene (16Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.5 B, inability of the FTI to induce p21 due to absence of the gene or to loss of wild type p53 function did not alter the capacity of the drug to inhibit cell growth. This result is in agreement with our previous finding that FTI effectively inhibited the proliferation of cells with mutated p53 (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N. Gibbs J. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that p21 induction constitutes only one of the pathways through which FTI inhibits cell growth. If that is the case, what is the mechanism of growth inhibition in the absence of p21? We compared the effects of the FTI on HCT116 parental cells and on their counterparts lacking p21. As expected, only the parental cells could up-regulate p21 in response to FTI treatment and induce the hypophosphorylation of Rb (Fig.6 A). Increased cellular levels of p21 led to enhanced association of the Cdi with cyclin-Cdk complexes and consequential inhibition of cyclin E- and A-associated kinase activity (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, in p21−/− cells the FTI neither caused decreased Cdk activity or pRb hypophosphoryl"

Together the system is capable of supporting host defense and repair functions but may also act as an amplifier of inappropriate inflammation in diseases such as asthma. Moreover, many components of the chemokine system are exploited as pro-microbial factors (3Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 12: 593-633Google Scholar, 4Pease J.E. Murphy P.M. Semin.

As the chemokine system expanded by gene replication, some functions were conserved, but new ones were added, allowing functional back-up to grow apace with functional diversification. This is illustrated nicely by the receptors CCR1 and CCR3. These receptors are more closely related in sequence to each other than to other chemokine receptors (54% amino acid identity) and have overlapping but nonidentical functional specificities (6Neote K.

Because of their roles in inflammation, identifying agents that specifically block CCR1 and CCR3 function may be therapeutically useful, and information about the ligand binding site may help to develop the most efficacious blocking agents. Also, CCR3 binding agents may be useful as anti-HIV agents. Eotaxin itself has this property, whereas RANTES and MCP-3 are much less potent (17Alkhatib G. Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Pease J.E. J. Biol.

We have previously analyzed a series of chimeric CCR1:CCR3 receptors to map determinants of the HIV-1 coreceptor activity at CCR3(17). Here we use chimeric receptors to map chemokine selectivity determinants for CCR1 and CCR3. Construction of DNA-encoding chimeric receptors was accomplished by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using the p4 cDNA-encoding CCR1 and the clone 3 cDNA-encoding CCR3 as templates, as described previously (7Gao J.-L.

The sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) was inserted between the first two codons by inclusion in the 5′ oligonucleotide primer. Chimeric DNA was then ligated into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, CA) at the HindIII (5′) andXhoI (3′) sites, and sequences were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The murine pre-B cell lymphoma cell line 4DE4 was generously provided by L. Staudt and maintained as described previously (29Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.-L. Pease J.E. Locati M. Combadiere C.

Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was introduced into 3 × 106 cells by electroporation in 0.5 ml of Hanks' buffered saline solution (250 V, 940 μF). After 48 h in culture, the medium was supplemented with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 0.6 mg/ml until the flask achieved confluency, after which the concentration of G418 was raised to 1 mg/ml, and the cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Individual clones were then screened for receptor expression by radioligand binding and chemokine-induced calcium release assays. 4DE4 cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and were loaded with 2.5 μm Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were then washed twice in Hanks' buffered saline solution and resuspended at 1.5 × 106/ml. Cells were then stimulated with various doses of either eotaxin or MIP-1α in a continuously stirred cuvette at 37 °C in a fluorometer (Photon Technology, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). We used the recombinant BB10010 variant of human MIP-1α, a generous gift of L. Czaplewski (British Biotech Inc., Oxford, UK) and recombinant human eotaxin purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Data were recorded every 200 ms as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential stimulation at 340 and 380 nm. These were carried out as described previously using microchemotaxis chambers (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) (29Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.-L. Pease J.E. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Results obtained were expressed as a chemotactic index. 125I-MIP-1α and125I-eotaxin were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The specific activities were 2200 Ci/mmol. Cells were washed once in binding buffer (Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% NaN3) and resuspended in the same buffer at 2–3 × 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of this suspension were added to duplicate Eppendorf tubes containing 0.25 nm labeled ligand and varying concentrations of cold competing ligand in a final volume of 200 μl. Ligand binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h, after which 500 μl of binding buffer adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl was added, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was cut from the tube and counted in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was typically 20–40% of the total counts. The data were fit to a curve, and the apparent binding affinity and receptor density were estimated using the program LIGAND. We have previously analyzed HIV-1 specificity determinants for CCR3 using a panel of CCR1:CCR3 chimeric receptors transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. This system, which depends on vaccinia virus activation of a vaccinia promoter in the plasmid vector pSC59, allows high levels of receptor expression; however it could not be used for the present study because vaccinia interrupts G protein signaling in these cells. 2G. Alkhatib, M. Locati, P. M. Murphy, and E. A. Berger, unpublished observations. We therefore subcloned the chimeric DNA inserts into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 and cloned stably transfected cell lines in a mouse pre-B cell lymphoma cell line. Untransfected cells did not exhibit specific binding of MIP-1α or eotaxin at the concentrations employed. However, very small calcium fluxes were observed on untransfected cells in response to MIP-1α but only at concentrations of 300 nm and above (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports, after transfection with the CCR1 expression plasmid, approximately 50% of clones tested responded to MIP-1α at low nanomolar concentrations in a calcium flux assay, but none responded to eotaxin. Likewise, after transfection with the CCR3 expression plasmid, approximately 40% of clones tested responded to eotaxin in the calcium flux assay, but none responded to MIP-1α. Clones that gave the most robust responses were selected for further characterization (Fig. 1). Clone 1 expressing CCR1 exhibited specific binding for MIP-1α (Fig.1 F), but specific eotaxin binding was not detected on the same cells using 0.25 nm125I-eotaxin and 200 nm unlabeled eotaxin as probes (data not shown). Conversely, clone L expressing CCR3 exhibited specific binding for eotaxin (Fig. 1 E), but specific MIP-1α binding was not detected on the same cells using 0.25 nm125I-MIP-1α and 200 nm unlabeled MIP-1α as probes (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of competition binding data revealed that clone L expressing CCR3 expressed ∼2000 eotaxin binding sites/cell with an apparent Ki = 0.5–1.0 nm (Table I). The EC50 for calcium release by eotaxin in these cells was 1–5 nm (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Eotaxin binding was insensitive to competition with excess MIP-1α, and MIP-1α did not antagonize eotaxin induction of calcium release (data not shown). Receptor parameters for clone 1 expressing CCR1 were similar: ∼2200 MIP-1α binding sites/cell, an apparent Ki = 1–5 nm, and an EC50 for calcium release by MIP-1α of 1–5 nm (Table I). Also, MIP-1α binding to clone 1 was insensitive to competition with excess eotaxin, and eotaxin did not antagonize MIP-1α induction of calcium release (data not shown). These parameters are consistent with those previously reported for wild type CCR1 and CCR3 expressed in other cell types (6Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J.

Clone L cells expressing CCR3 also exhibited chemotaxis to eotaxin, with the maximal response observed at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 1 C). No background chemotaxis was observed with eotaxin using untransfected cells, even at concentrations of 1 μm. In contrast, MIP-1α was a poor chemoattractant, eliciting a chemotactic response only when employed at 1 μm, which represented a background response on these cells (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Clone 1 cells expressing CCR1 were unable to chemotax in response to eotaxin, as may have been inferred by the calcium release data in panel B, but surprisingly, MIP-1α was also a poor attractant, eliciting only background chemotactic activity when tested at 1 μm (Fig.1 D). Similar chemotaxis results were obtained when the same constructs were tested in transiently transfected L1.2 cells (data not shown). It is interesting that two similar receptors expressed in the same cellular background can exhibit potent efficacy in mobilizing intracellular calcium to key ligands, yet have such different chemotactic profiles to the same ligands. Similar but converse findings have been observed for CCR2B, where chemotaxis to MCP-1 was observed in the absence of a calcium flux, suggesting that the two events can occur independently of each other (30Arai H. Tsou C.-L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14485-14499Google Scholar). Staining of both clones with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5 revealed a small 2-fold shift relative to staining of untransfected cells, consistent with the low levels of expression determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding data. Having established the receptor parameters for wild type CCR1 and CCR3 in our system, we next tested the importance of the N-terminal segments of each receptor in determining differential ligand selectivity. We focused on this region because the corresponding region has been shown to be a ligand selectivity determinant for several other chemokine receptors, including CXCR1, CXCR2, Duffy and CCR2 (31LaRosa G.J.

One chimera contained amino acids 1–32 from CCR1 joined to amino acids 33–355 of CCR3 and was named CHI1. The reciprocal chimera contained amino acids 1–32 of CCR3 fused to amino acids 33–356 of CCR1 and was named CHI2. The junctions were based on the hydropathy plot of the receptors. When expressed in pre-B cells, both chimeras exhibited chimeric ligand recognition, specifically binding both125I-MIP-1α and 125I-eotaxin (Fig.2). Scatchard analysis of competition binding data revealed that clone A6 for CHI1 coexpressed both eotaxin and MIP-1α binding sites (apparent Ki = 5–10 nm and 10–50 nm, respectively, and 6,000–10,000 sites/cell for each). Likewise, Scatchard analysis of competition binding data revealed that clone 5.5 for CHI2 coexpressed both eotaxin and MIP-1α binding sites (apparent Ki= 0.5–1.0 nm and 50–75 nm, respectively, and 6,000–10,000 sites/cell for each). A role for the N-terminal segment of CCR1 as a MIP-1α binding selectivity determinant is supported by the gain of MIP-1α binding in CHI1 relative to wild type CCR3 and the ∼50-fold reduction in apparent binding affinity for MIP-1α in CHI2 relative to wild type CCR1. A role for the N-terminal segment of CCR3 as an eotaxin binding selectivity determinant is supported by the gain of eotaxin binding in CHI2 relative to wild type CCR1 and the ∼10-fold reduction in apparent binding affinity for eotaxin in CHI1 relative to wild type CCR3. That other receptor domains are also involved in ligand binding selectivity is apparent from the preserved ability of CHI1 to bind eotaxin and CHI2 to bind MIP-1α, albeit at reduced affinity. Heterologous competition binding was carried out to examine the relationship of the MIP-1α and eotaxin binding sites on CHI1 and CHI2. Neither chemokine could compete for binding to the site labeled by the other on either chimera, even when 1 μm heterologous chemokine was used (data not shown), suggesting that the sites are independent, as they are on wild type CCR1 and wild type CCR3. Independence of binding sites has also been reported for interleukin-8 and GROα on CXCR1:CXCR2 chimeric receptors and for MCP-1 and MIP-1α on chimeric receptors (33Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of CCR2, a pseudo-tethered N-terminal domain binds MCP-1 with affinity similar to the full-length wild type receptor, suggesting that the bulk of the binding energy between CCR2 and MCP-1 is conferred by interactions occurring solely between MCP-1 and this domain (36Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Also, there is direct structural evidence from spectroscopy studies for binding of interleukin-8 to the N-terminal segment of CXCR1 (38Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ligand selectivity determinants have been mapped to the second extracellular loop of CCR5 using CCR2:CCR5 chimeras and to the third extracellular loop of CCR1 using CCR1:CCR2 chimeras; however, direct binding sites have not been identified yet (39Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Broder C.C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19771-19776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, in some cases chemokines may bind to receptors at a single extracellular domain, and this domain could differ for different chemokines binding to the same receptor. However, in other cases, ligands appear to share sites on the same receptor. It is important to point out that, in contrast to our results with CCR1:CCR3 chimeras, MIP-1α selectivity did not map to the N-terminal segment of CCR1 in CCR1:CXCR2 or CCR1:CCR2 chimeras reported previously (33Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a revised interpretation of these negative results may be warranted: that the CCR1 N-terminal segment complements other domains to determine MIP-1α recognition specificity. From this perspective, CCR3 contains complementary domains, whereas CXCR2 and CCR2 do not. With several exceptions, there is a fairly good correlation between the rank order of chemokine binding affinity for individual receptors and among different receptors versusthe rank orders when the same chemokines are evaluated as agonists. Creation of chimeric receptors allows one to test whether chemokine binding specificity determinants and chemokine receptor activation determinants map to the same domains. Unlike wild type CCR1 and wild type CCR3, we did not observe activation of either CHI1- or CHI2-expressing stable cell lines in calcium flux and chemotaxis assays when stimulated with either MIP-1α or eotaxin, even at concentrations 10–100-fold greater than the apparent binding constant. The cells were capable of signaling as shown by robust calcium flux responses to the CXC chemokine SDF-1 via an endogenous pre-B cell receptor that is probably the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (not shown; Refs. 41Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 333-829Crossref Scopus (1752) Google Scholar and 42Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results could not be explained by low receptor expression, since levels of chimeric receptors were actually 3-fold higher than wild type receptor levels in the clones tested. Nor could they be explained completely by reduced ligand binding affinity, since eotaxin binding affinity for CHI2 and wild type CCR3 were equivalent. In the case of MIP-1α, affinity for CHI1 and CHI2 was substantially reduced (∼10-fold) compared with wild type CCR1. However, a third chimeric receptor named CHI3, in which the third extracellular loop of CCR1 was replaced with that of CCR3, was expressed at levels similar to CHI1 and CHI2, exhibited an affinity for MIP-1α only 5-fold higher than values for CHI1 and CHI2, and supported MIP-1α signaling at a potency and efficacy equivalent to wild type CCR1 (EC50 = 1–5 nm for calcium release, Fig. 3). Cells expressing CHI3 were able to bind eotaxin with an apparent affinity ∼3-fold lower than for wild type CCR3 (∼20 nm). However, no response to eotaxin was observed at concentrations up to 200 nm. The reciprocal of CHI3 was not informative in fluorescence-activated cell sorter, ligand binding, or calcium flux assays (data not shown). Note that the present CHI3 is a different structure from a construct named CHI3 in a previous paper (17Alkhatib G. Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20420-20426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the same constructs were transiently expressed in L1.2 pre-B cells, with one exception. CHI1-transfected cells responded chemotactically to eotaxin, although the efficacy was typically ∼25% that of wild type CCR3 in the same system, despite equivalent levels of expression as determined by the monoclonal antibody 7B11 (data not shown). Thus the results from the stably and transiently transfected cells with respect to chemotaxis are qualitatively similar. The results of the present study are consistent with a multi-site model for chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction in which one or more subsites determine chemokine selectivity, but others are needed for receptor triggering. In this model, ligand is envisioned to bind first via a docking domain, which may be the N-terminal segment for eotaxin and MIP-1α in the case of CCR3 and CCR1, respectively, and then to be presented to a second activation site on the receptor. The first well documented example in support of this model was the C5a receptor, which binds a peptide chemoattractant similar in size to the chemokines (43Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J.

Since then, additional examples have been reported based on the study of chimeric CCR1:CXCR2, CCR2:CCR5, and CXCR1:CXCR2 receptors (33Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

With cell warming, the CD14-enriched ruffles fused and formed large vesicles. Later, these vacuoles made stacks and condensed into phago-lysosomes. CD14 was specifically associated with all of these structures. Radiolabeled LPS internalization paralleled CD14 internalization. Confocal microscopic studies confirmed the co-localization of LPS and CD14 both at the cell surface and in endosomal compartments.

Glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-linked molecules are sorted to plasma membrane subdomains, rich in sphyngomyelin, cholesterol, receptors, and other signaling molecules (18Lisanti M.P.

In epithelial cells, these plasma membrane domains correspond morphologically to noncoated pits and vesicles, known as caveolae (19Anderson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CD14 is naturally attached to macrophage and polymorphonuclear neutrophil plasma membranes via a GPI moiety (23Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J.

CD14 association with particular membrane subdomains, routes of LPS and CD14 internalization remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that LPS and CD14 internalized via a macropinocytosis independently of “classical” receptor-mediated endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-coated pits or caveolae. The modification of the GPI-anchored CD14 into an integral protein did not significantly affect rates and pathways of receptor-ligand internalization, and CD14 endocytosis did not seem to be regulated by its ligand, LPS. Finally, cytochalasin D inhibited LPS endocytosis but did not prevent LPS-dependent cell activation. Wild type CD14 cDNA or a chimeric cDNA construct of CD14 attached to the transmembrane portion of human tissue factor were used to transfect a human promonocytic, CD14-negative, THP-1 cell line, as described elsewhere (15Schiff D.E.

Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressed either a GPI-anchored CD14 (wtCD14-THP1 cells) or a transmembrane form of CD14 (tmCD14-THP1 cells). Cells transfected with the empty vector (pRc/RSV) served as control cells (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing penicillin and gentamicin antibiotics, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin®), all from Life Technologies, Inc. CD14 expression in wtCD14-THP1 and tmCD14-THP1 cells was 2 × 106 and 2 × 105 CD14 molecules/cell, respectively (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane targeting of CD14 was assayed using sucrose density gradient according to published methods (26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 wtCD14-THP1 and tmCD14-THP1 cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing anti-proteases (TNE (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 200,000 IU/ml aprotinin), and 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Triton X-100 1% plus 60 mm octylglucoside (26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then homogenized (8 strokes, Dounce homogenizer), and 2 ml of an 80% sucrose solution was added to 2 ml of cell lysates. A 7.5-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was layered onto the 40% sucrose/cell lysate mixture, and tubes were ultracentrifuged (Beckman SW41 rotor) at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C for 18 h. One-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes. Proteins in each fractions were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and separated using a 12% acrylamide SDS gel. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. CD14 was detected by Western blot using a goat anti-human CD14 antibody (from R. J. Ulevitch, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla), protein G-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, cell membrane proteins were detected by dot-blot (27Ilangumaran S. Arni S. Chicheportiche Y. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar): proteins contained in 2–20 μl of the sucrose density gradient fractions (non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitated) were diluted in 200-μl TNE buffer and transferred onto nitrocellulose by filtration (Bio-Rad DotBlot™ apparatus). Membrane proteins were detected by Western blot using specific monoclonal antibodies, a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), and the ECL detection system (27Ilangumaran S. Arni S. Chicheportiche Y. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Murine monoclonal antibodies to human membrane proteins used in this dot-blot assay were 28C5 (anti-CD14, a gift from D. Leturcq, RW Johnson Pharmacological Institute, San Diego), MEM 154 (anti-CD16), MEM 48 (anti-CD18), MEM 102 (anti-CD48), MEM 118 (anti-CD55), and MEM 43/5 (anti-CD59). Antibodies of the MEM series were characterized and donated by V. Horejsi, Prague, Czech Republic (28Horejsi V. Angelisova P. Bazil V. Kristofova H. Stoyanov S. Stefanova I. Hausner P. Vosecky M. Hilgert I. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1988; 34: 23-34PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, GPI-rich membrane subdomains were isolated without detergent, using a combination of mechanical homogenization of cells, membrane sonication, successive Percoll™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Optiprep™ (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) gradients, as described elsewhere (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and assayed by dot-blot for CD14 (see above). THP-1 transfectants were sequentially incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.3 mg/ml of biotinylated 63D3 monoclonal antibody (a noninhibitory anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody, not interfering with LPS binding site) (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and for 1 h at 4 °C with a 1:10 dilution of streptavidin coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold particles (ANAWA, Wageningen, The Netherlands) in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin 1% buffer. After two washes in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline, cells were warmed and kept 5 or 20 min in a 37 °C water bath in the presence or in the absence of 2 μg/ml Escherichia coli K12 LCD25 LPS (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA)/10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then fixed for 30 min at 20 °C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and processed for electron microscopy as described elsewhere (30Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Paccaud J.P. Roy G. Lacopetta B. Kazatchkine M. Stendhal O. Pozzan T. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thin sections were examined in a Philips electron microscope 301, and gold particles were quantitatively analyzed. For each time point studied, 450–800 gold particles from more than 50 cells were analyzed from cells expressing either wt- or tmCD14. Gold particles were scored in terms of their association with cellular structures, such as microvilli or membrane ruffles, the inner leaflet of macropinosomes (vesicular structures), endocytic vesicles (clathrin-coated pits/vesicles), and lysosome-like organelles. The percentage of membrane surface represented by ruffles or microvilli was determined on randomly photographed pictures of wtCD14-THP1 cells (231.4 ± 11 μm of plasma membrane length on each micrography; n = 57) and tmCD14-THP1 cells (256.7 ± 12.6 μm; n = 50) at an initial magnification of × 7200 as described previously (31Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One hundred ng/ml [3H]LPS (biosynthetically tritiated E. coli K12 LCD25 LPS, List Biological Laboratories) (32Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with fetal bovine serum, were added to the cells for various times. In some experiments, the microfilament-disrupting agent cytochalasin D (Sigma) (3 μm), or the phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) (1 μm) were added to the cells 30 min prior to the addition of LPS (33Grassmé H.U.C. Ireland R.M. van Putten J.P.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). After various times of LPS incubation, cells were washed and treated at 4 °C with 200 μg/ml Pronase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h (35Tausk F. Fey M. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3295-3302PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bamezai A. Goldmacher V. Reiser H. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3107-3112PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants and cells were separated by centrifugation and transferred into scintillation liquid. Radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter to determine cell-bound and internalized (Pronase-resistant, cell-associated) counts. Internalization was defined as the percentage of counts resistant to Pronase relative to the total counts (cell-associated counts before the Pronase treatment). Cell viability during the experiment was tested using the Live/Dead™ Eukolight viability kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's protocol. wtCD14- and tmCD14-THP1 cells preincubated for 30 min in the presence or in the absence of 3 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) were labeled with 60 μg/ml biotinylated 63D3 anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody and 30 μg/ml streptavidin-Texas red (Molecular Probes) at 4 °C for 45 min. After washing, 1 μg/ml fluoresceinated (FITC) LPS (donated by P. S. Tobias, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) in 10% normal human serum was added, and cells were put at 37 °C for 1 or 30 min. Cells were then chilled, washed, and fixed in Tris/glycerol/polyvinyl alcohol mounting solution. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss confocal laser fluorescence inverted microscope (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using simultaneous lasers with excitation wavelengths of 543 and 488 nm for red and green, respectively, and detection using red and green narrow band filters. Cells were observed through an oil plan-neofluar × 63/1.3 objective. The best plan of section was optimized through optical sectioning. Cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphorylation by LPS (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 3 μm cytochalasin D (1 h pretreatment) was assayed using a 4G10 phosphotyrosine Western blot (Upstate Biotechnology), as described elsewhere (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In similar experiments, LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation was assessed using classical electromobility shift assay of nuclear proteins (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interleukin-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Endogen, Cambridge, MA) in conditioned supernatants from THP-1 transfectants treated for 7 h with various concentrations of LPS, with or without 3 μm cytochalasin D (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using sucrose density fractionation of Triton X-100 cell extracts, we observed that the GPI form of CD14 (wtCD14) and the transmembrane CD14 chimera (tmCD14) were targeted to different membrane subdomains, as indicated by their differential buoyancy in the sucrose gradient. The Triton X-100-extracted wtCD14 floated in low sucrose density fractions, previously recognized as GPI-rich domains, whereas tmCD14 remained in the 40% sucrose solution (Fig.1 A). Octylglucoside known to disrupt GPI-rich domains solubilized wtCD14, which was recovered in the 40% sucrose density fractions (Fig. 1 A), whereas the buoyancy of tmCD14 was not modified by this detergent. In Triton X-100 lysis buffer, wtCD14 co-localized in low sucrose density fractions with other GPI-anchored proteins (CD16, CD48, CD55, and CD59), but tmCD14 remained in the high sucrose density fractions, along with the transmembrane CD18 protein (Fig. 1 B). Nondetergent isolation of low-density GPI-rich domains (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) showed that CD14 was enriched at least 100 times in these domains as compared with tmCD14, as determined by serial dilutions of GPI-rich domains of wt- and tmCD14-THP1 cells in the dot-blot assay (data not shown). This latter experiment indicated that the separation by buoyancy of wt- and tmCD14 was not an artifact due to the presence of detergents. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that the GPI anchoring was responsible for targeting CD14 to GPI-rich, lipid-rich plasma membrane subdomains, whereas tmCD14 was sorted into other membrane domains, where most integral proteins are found. LPS treatment did not modify the distribution pattern of wt- or tmCD14 in the sucrose density fractions (not shown). CD14 from 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3-differentiated THP-1 cells (CD14-positive THP-1 cells) (6Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Kline L. Lee J.D. Kato K. Martin T.P. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar), human monocytes, and epithelial cells (COS and HepG2) transfected with GPI-CD14 was found in the same sucrose density fractions as wtCD14 originating from transfected THP-1 cells (not shown), indicating that GPI-CD14 targeting to lipid-rich domains was independent of the cell type tested. We next determined wt- and tmCD14 association with plasma membrane structures using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of CD14. The THP-1 cell plasma membrane was found to be very convoluted, with 37% of the membrane surface found as microvilli or ruffles (TableI). CD14 immunogold labeling at 4 °C indicated that wtCD14, and to a lesser extent tmCD14, associated preferentially with membrane microvilli or ruffles, with enrichment factors of CD14 on these structures of 1.48× and 1.22×, respectively (Table I and Fig. 2). Very little, if any, wt- or tmCD14 localized in clathrin-coated pits. We did not observe clear caveolar structures in THP-1 cells. No immunogold CD14 labeling was observed in RSV-control THP1 cells.Table IAssociation of wt- and tm-CD14 with plasma membrane structures using morphometrical studies of electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of CD14Membrane surface found as microvilli or rufflesGold particles associated with microvilli or rufflesCD14 enrichment on microvilli or rufflesaCD14 enrichment on microvilli or ruffles was calculated as the ratio of the percentage of gold particles associated with microvilli or ruffles over the percentage of membrane surface found as microvilli or ruffles.%%wtCD14-THP1 cells37 ± 2.254.9 ± 0.81.48 × ± 0.07tmCD14-THP1 cells37.7 ± 2.145.9 ± 0.41.22 × ± 0.06a CD14 enrichment on microvilli or ruffles was calculated as the ratio of the percentage of gold particles associated with microvilli or ruffles over the percentage of membrane surface found as microvilli or ruffles. Open table in a new tab Co-localization of LPS and CD14 at the plasma membrane level was assessed by confocal laser microscopy and dual LPS and CD14 fluorescent labeling. After 1 min of incubation at 37 °C, Texas red-immunolabeled CD14 and FITC-LPS co-localized exclusively at the membrane surface in both THP-1 transfectants (Fig.3). No fluorescent labeling was detectable in control RSV cells. We next addressed whether LPS and CD14 co-localized during the process of endocytosis using confocal laser microscopy. After 30 min of cell warming, both LPS and CD14 internalized and were found to be co-localized in intracellular endocytic compartments (Fig. 3). LPS internalization patterns and rates were assessed using a classical internalization protocol. Cells were put at 37 °C in the presence of [3H]LPS and serum for various times and then chilled and treated with Pronase. Cell-associated counts after Pronase treatment were considered internalized. Association of [3H]LPS with THP1 transfectants was entirely dependent on the presence of CD14, because RSV control cells did not show significant [3H]LPS binding. In addition, in experiment not shown here, anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies specifically blocking [3H]LPS binding to CD14 (28C5 and 3C10, ATCC) prevented [3H]LPS binding and internalization. In wt- and tmCD14-THP1 cells, [3H]LPS binding (defined as 3H counts released by Pronase) was rapid and plateaued after 5–10 min (not shown). [3H]LPS was internalized with similar rates (∼2% per min) in both THP1 transfectants. A plateau of internalization (maximal internalization of ∼45%) was reached after 30–60 min in wtCD14-THP1 cells (Fig. 4). In tmCD14-THP1 cells, although initial internalization rates were quite similar to those measured in wtCD14, internalization did not quite reach a plateau after 120 min (∼70% internalization at 120 min; Fig.4).Figure 4Kinetics of LPS internalization (100 ng/ml3H-LPS) in wtCD14-THP1 cells (upper panel) and tmCD14-THP1 cells (lower panel) (2 × 106cells/experiment), in the presence (closed circles) or in the absence (open circles) of cytochalasin D.

After immunolabeling of CD14 at 4 °C, THP1 transfectants were warmed at 37 °C for various times. Gold-labeled CD14, mainly present at the surface of microvilli or ruffles, localized in macropinocytic vesicles after 5 min, forming large endocytosed vacuoles organizing in stacks (Figs. 2 and5). After 20 min, CD14 was found deeper in the cytoplasm in denser endosome-like or lysosome-like structures (Figs. 2 and 5). These pictures are typical of macropinocytosis. CD14 internalization route was identical in wt- and tmCD14-THP1 cells. Very similar rates of CD14 internalization were found in both THP-1 transfectants (Figs. 4 and 5). Only tmCD14 internalized more and was found more associated with endosome-like or lysosome-like structures than wtCD14-THP1 cells (75 versus 45% internalization at 20 min, respectively) (Figs. 4 and 5). These findings are in accordance with what was found in the LPS internalization assay, with similar rates of LPS and CD14 internalization in both assays (Fig. 4). All of this strongly suggested a common pathway of LPS and CD14 internalization. In experiments not shown here, LPS treatment of THP-1 transfectants did not significantly influence rates or routes of CD14 internalization. The actin filament disrupting agent cytochalasin D markedly decreased [3H]LPS internalization in both wtCD14- and tmCD14-THP1 cells, with a maximum effect observed at 3 μm cytochalasin D concentration (Fig. 4). In confocal microscopy, cytochalasin D clearly prevented FITC-LPS and Texas red-CD14 internalization (Fig. 3). Phosphoinositide-3 kinase has been implicated in macropinocytosis (34Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In experiments not shown here, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin decreased [3H]LPS internalization by 30%. Importantly, these inhibitors had no effect on cell viability at the concentrations tested. As previously shown (25Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.-D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LPS treatment of wt- and tmCD14-THP1 cells induced rapid phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-κB activation, and IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6). Although cytochalasin D had a profound inhibitory effect on LPS internalization, it modified neither LPS-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation nor NF-κB activation. Importantly, LPS internalization and activation was assayed within the same time frame,i.e. 30–45 min (Fig. 6). IL-8 secretion occurring 7 h after LPS treatment was markedly increased by the treatment of cytochalasin D. These results strongly suggest that LPS internalization (blocked by cytochalasin D) and LPS activation (unaffected or increased by cytochalasin D) of cells are"
https://openalex.org/W1996900427,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutants belonging to the Lec2 complementation group are unable to translocate CMP-sialic acid to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Complementation cloning in these cells has recently been used to isolate cDNAs encoding the CMP-sialic acid transporter from mouse and hamster. The present study was carried out to determine the molecular defects leading to the inactivation of CMP-sialic acid transport. To this end, CMP-sialic acid transporter cDNAs derived from five independent clones of the Lec2 complementation group, were analyzed. Deletions in the coding region were observed for three clones, and single mutants were found to contain an insertion and a point mutation. Epitope-tagged variants of the wild-type transporter protein and of the mutants were used to investigate the effect of the structural changes on the expression and subcellular targeting of the transporter proteins. Mutants derived from deletions showed reduced protein expression and in immunofluorescence showed a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm in transiently transfected cells, while the translation product derived from the point-mutated cDNA (G189E) was expressed at the level of the wild-type transporter and co-localized with the Golgi marker α-mannosidase II. This mutation therefore seems to directly affect the transport activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change glycine 189 into alanine, glutamine, and isoleucine, respectively. While the G189A mutant was able to complement CMP-sialic acid transport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary mutants, the exchange of glycine 189 into glutamine or isoleucine dramatically affected the transport activity of the CMP-sialic acid transporter. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutants belonging to the Lec2 complementation group are unable to translocate CMP-sialic acid to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Complementation cloning in these cells has recently been used to isolate cDNAs encoding the CMP-sialic acid transporter from mouse and hamster. The present study was carried out to determine the molecular defects leading to the inactivation of CMP-sialic acid transport. To this end, CMP-sialic acid transporter cDNAs derived from five independent clones of the Lec2 complementation group, were analyzed. Deletions in the coding region were observed for three clones, and single mutants were found to contain an insertion and a point mutation. Epitope-tagged variants of the wild-type transporter protein and of the mutants were used to investigate the effect of the structural changes on the expression and subcellular targeting of the transporter proteins. Mutants derived from deletions showed reduced protein expression and in immunofluorescence showed a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm in transiently transfected cells, while the translation product derived from the point-mutated cDNA (G189E) was expressed at the level of the wild-type transporter and co-localized with the Golgi marker α-mannosidase II.

Increased sialylation has been described for tumor cell surfaces and has been shown to correlate positively with malignant potential (6Santer U.V. DeSantis R. Hard K.J. van Kuik J.A.

Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar) exist, the transporter may provide an effective target to inhibit cell surface sialylation. Accordingly, the inhibition of the UDP-galactose transporter and CMP-sialic acid transporter by somatic mutations and synthetic inhibitors resulted in strong reduction of the metastatic potential in the murine MDAY-D2 tumor cell line and in human colorectal cancer lines in nude mice (11Harvey B.E.

Heterologous expression of the murine CMP-Sia-Tr on the zero background of S. cerevisiae was used to confirm the biological function of the protein (22Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

The transfected yeast cells acquired the ability to translocate CMP-sialic acid.All nucleotide-sugar transporters cloned to date have been identified by complementation cloning in glycosylation mutants. The murine and hamster CMP-Sia-Tr were isolated by expression cloning in a clone of the Lec2 complementation group. Although the Lec2 mutation is known to inhibit translocation of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi lumen (23Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I.B. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the molecular basis responsible for the asialo phenotype is still unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the molecular basis of the Lec2 phenotype. Thereby, we took advantage of the fact that several independent Lec2 mutants have been isolated in the laboratory (14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The results summarized in this study demonstrate that Lec2 cells carry defects in the CMP-Sia-Tr gene leading to aberrations in the transporter protein. The analysis of these mutants provides a useful system to gain insight into structure-function relationships of the transporter protein.DISCUSSIONCells of the Lec2 complementation group are defective in the transport of CMP-NeuAc into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (23Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I.B. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Clones exhibiting the lec2 defect have been isolated by lectin resistance (24Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or immunoselection (14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The lec2mutation causes the expression of asialo cell surfaces. Among the carbohydrate epitopes missing is PSA. Reexpression of PSA was therefore used to isolate cDNAs encoding the murine and hamster CMP-Sia-Tr cDNAs via complementation cloning (14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to determine the lec2 mutation at the molecular level. Four independent mutants (1E3, 6B2, 8G8, and 9D3), which arose from chemical mutation experiments (32Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), together with the clone Lec2 isolated via lectin resistance (24Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), were analyzed by Northern blotting and RT-PCR. Deletions, insertions, and point mutations in the CMP-Sia-Tr coding region were found that demonstrated that the gene defective in these cells encodes the CMP-Sia-Tr. The high frequency by which these mutants occur after chemical mutagenesis (32Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) makes this approach an attractive way to identify functionally important primary sequence elements and to investigate structure-function relationships of nucleotide-sugar transporters.Deletions observed in clones 6B2, 8G8, and Lec2, are likely to result from mutations in splice acceptor or donor sites. Support for this assumption comes from the observation that the deleted sequence sections share common boundaries. The extended sequence changes associated with the mutations lec2, 6b2, and8g8, cause mistargeting of the translation products. While co-localization of the wild-type CMP-Sia-Tr with α-mannosidase II indicated transport to the Golgi apparatus (Ref. 14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and Figs. 4 and 5), all internally deleted or C-terminally truncated transporter mutants were not in the α-mannosidase II compartment but produced a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasma. The staining pattern observed for the mutants might be explained by retention of the proteins in the ER. The extended primary sequence changes caused by the deletions or truncations most probably lead to misfolded proteins, which do not escape the process of “ER quality control” (34Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, reduced expression levels were observed for the mutant proteins.Analysis of the CMP-Sia-Tr mRNA from clone 9D3 revealed a single missense mutation, resulting in exchange of glycine at position 189 for glutamic acid. Like the other mutants, the steady-state level of mRNA expression in this mutant was comparable with that of wild-type cells (Fig. 1), and Western blot analysis of cells transiently transfected with the epitope-tagged G189E cDNA indicated that this protein was expressed at the same level as the epitope-tagged wild-type protein. In contrast to the mutants described above, this protein co-localizes with α-mannosidase II, indicating correct targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, the G189E mutation seems to directly affect the transport activity of the CMP-Sia-Tr. Changing glycine 189 to alanine did not influence the activity of CMP-Sia-Tr, measured as polysialic acid expression in clones of the Lec2 complementation group. In contrast, the activities of G189Q and G189I mutants were drastically decreased and resembled that of the G189E mutant. These results suggest that not the charge repulsion between glutamine and CMP-sialic acid, but rather the size of the amino acid at position 189, is a critical factor for the transport activity. Large amino acids at this position may lead to steric hindrance of a hydrophilic “channel” required to translocate CMP-sialic acid through the membrane. This hypothesis is in good agreement with the transporter model proposed recently (17Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), where Gly189 is part of a transmembrane helix, closely located to the cytosolic face of the membrane. Another explanation would be that the mutation destroys a potential site involved in the binding of cofactors or in protein dimerization. So far, however, there are no experimental data supporting the idea.The G189E mutation identified a functionally important region of CMP-Sia-Tr. In the mutant 9D3, sialic acid is undetectable by either Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Overexpression of the mutant G189E in 9D3 cells, however, restored transport activity at a very low level. Due to the high sensitivity of the anti-PSA mAb 735, a very faint PSA signal was visible in immunocytochemistry and Western blot after transient transfection of cells. The signal intensity is however too low to be reproduced in Fig. 6, and sialic acid reexpression was not detectable with Maackia amurensis lectin. Thus, the mutant transporter from 9D3 cells is not completely inactive, but the endogenous expression of the mutated protein in 9D3 cells is insufficient to translocate CMP-sialic acid at a rate necessary for detectable amounts of (poly)sialic acid at the cell surface. Transient overexpression of the deletion mutants in CHO cells of the Lec2 cells did not lead to a detectable complementation. Together with the above results, this strongly suggests that these mutants are completely inactive.The change Gly189 to Glu occurs in a region that is conserved among CMP-Sia-Tr and UDP-Gal-Tr isolated from mammals and the yeast Schizosacchaccharomyces pombe. Furthermore, this sequence is found in a putative nucleotide-sugar transporter ofC. elegans. All transporter sequences containing this motif are listed in Fig. 7. The high conservation strongly suggests that this amino acid stretch is essential for a functionally active transporter. On the other hand, the appearance of this domain in transporters of different specificity argues against a direct involvement in nucleotide-sugar binding or recognition. Additional studies are required to define the functional role of this sequence motif.An important aspect of this study consists in the fact that a CMP-Sia-Tr mutant exhibiting residual transport activity could be isolated after chemical mutation of CHO cells. Isolation and functional analysis of such mutants provides a powerful way to gain further insight into structure-function relationships for this structurally ambitious group of molecules.

Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The lec2mutation causes the expression of asialo cell surfaces. Among the carbohydrate epitopes missing is PSA. Reexpression of PSA was therefore used to isolate cDNAs encoding the murine and hamster CMP-Sia-Tr cDNAs via complementation cloning (14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to determine the lec2 mutation at the molecular level. Four independent mutants (1E3, 6B2, 8G8, and 9D3), which arose from chemical mutation experiments (32Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), together with the clone Lec2 isolated via lectin resistance (24Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), were analyzed by Northern blotting and RT-PCR. Deletions, insertions, and point mutations in the CMP-Sia-Tr coding region were found that demonstrated that the gene defective in these cells encodes the CMP-Sia-Tr. The high frequency by which these mutants occur after chemical mutagenesis (32Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) makes this approach an attractive way to identify functionally important primary sequence elements and to investigate structure-function relationships of nucleotide-sugar transporters.Deletions observed in clones 6B2, 8G8, and Lec2, are likely to result from mutations in splice acceptor or donor sites. Support for this assumption comes from the observation that the deleted sequence sections share common boundaries. The extended sequence changes associated with the mutations lec2, 6b2, and8g8, cause mistargeting of the translation products. While co-localization of the wild-type CMP-Sia-Tr with α-mannosidase II indicated transport to the Golgi apparatus (Ref. 14Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and Figs. 4 and 5), all internally deleted or C-terminally truncated transporter mutants were not in the α-mannosidase II compartment but produced a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasma. The staining pattern observed for the mutants might be explained by retention of the proteins in the ER. The extended primary sequence changes caused by the deletions or truncations most probably lead to misfolded proteins, which do not escape the process of “ER quality control” (34Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, reduced expression levels were observed for the mutant proteins.Analysis of the CMP-Sia-Tr mRNA from clone 9D3 revealed a single missense mutation, resulting in exchange of glycine at position 189 for glutamic acid. Like the other mutants, the steady-state level of mRNA expression in this mutant was comparable with that of wild-type cells (Fig. 1), and Western blot analysis of cells transiently transfected with the epitope-tagged G189E cDNA indicated that this protein was expressed at the same level as the epitope-tagged wild-type protein. In contrast to the mutants described above, this protein co-localizes with α-mannosidase II, indicating correct targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, the G189E mutation seems to directly affect the transport activity of the CMP-Sia-Tr. Changing glycine 189 to alanine did not influence the activity of CMP-Sia-Tr, measured as polysialic acid expression in clones of the Lec2 complementation group. In contrast, the activities of G189Q and G189I mutants were drastically decreased and resembled that of the G189E mutant. These results suggest that not the charge repulsion between glutamine and CMP-sialic acid, but rather the size of the amino acid at position 189, is a critical factor for the transport activity. Large amino acids at this position may lead to steric hindrance of a hydrophilic “channel” required to translocate CMP-sialic acid through the membrane. This hypothesis is in good agreement with the transporter model proposed recently (17Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), where Gly189 is part of a transmembrane helix, closely located to the cytosolic face of the membrane. Another explanation would be that the mutation destroys a potential site involved in the binding of cofactors or in protein dimerization. So far, however, there are no experimental data supporting the idea.The G189E mutation identified a functionally important region of CMP-Sia-Tr. In the mutant 9D3, sialic acid is undetectable by either Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Overexpression of the mutant G189E in 9D3 cells, however, restored transport activity at a very low level. Due to the high sensitivity of the anti-PSA mAb 735, a very faint PSA signal was visible in immunocytochemistry and Western blot after transient transfection of cells. The signal intensity is however too low to be reproduced in Fig. 6, and sialic acid reexpression was not detectable with Maackia amurensis lectin. Thus, the mutant transporter from 9D3 cells is not completely inactive, but the endogenous expression of the mutated protein in 9D3 cells is insufficient to translocate CMP-sialic acid at a rate necessary for detectable amounts of (poly)sialic acid at the cell surface. Transient overexpression of the deletion mutants in CHO cells of the Lec2 cells did not lead to a detectable complementation. Together with the above results, this strongly suggests that these mutants are completely inactive.The change Gly189 to Glu occurs in a region that is conserved among CMP-Sia-Tr and UDP-Gal-Tr isolated from mammals and the yeast Schizosacchaccharomyces pombe. Furthermore, this sequence is found in a putative nucleotide-sugar transporter ofC. elegans. All transporter sequences containing this motif are listed in Fig. 7. The high conservation strongly suggests that this amino acid stretch is essential for a functionally active transporter. On the other hand, the appearance of this domain in transporters of different specificity argues against a direct involvement in nucleotide-sugar binding or recognition. Additional studies are required to define the functional role of this sequence motif.An important aspect of this study consists in the fact that a CMP-Sia-Tr mutant exhibiting residual transport activity could be isolated after chemical mutation of CHO cells. Isolation and functional analysis of such mutants provides a powerful way to gain further insight into structure-function relationships for this structurally ambitious group of molecules.

In a number of functional studies, strict conservation of structure and function across distantly related vertebrate species has been confirmed. In this study we make use of the observation that soluble human EphA3 (HEK) exerts a dominant negative effect on somite formation and axial organization during zebrafish embryogenesis to probe receptor function. Based on exon structure we have dissected the extracellular region of EphA3 receptor into evolutionarily conserved subdomains and used kinetic BIAcore analysis, mRNA injection into zebrafish embryos, and receptor transphosphorylation analysis to study their function. We show that ligand binding is restricted to the N-terminal region encoded by exon III, and we identify an independent, C-terminal receptor-dimerization domain. Recombinant proteins encoding either region in isolation can function as receptor antagonists in zebrafish. We propose a two-step mechanism of Eph receptor activation with distinct ligand binding and ligand-independent receptor-receptor oligomerization events.

In our model, high affinity interactions between ephrin-A on the leading edge of migrating cells and the N-terminal ligand binding domain of EphA receptors on opposing cells leads to clustering of EphA receptors. A sufficiently high local concentration of ephrin-A will facilitate accumulation of receptors to a critical concentration that triggers oligomerization through their C-terminal receptor/receptor interaction domain and leads to receptor transphosphorylation and signal transduction.DISCUSSIONWhile Eph receptors have been shown to mediate key functions in embryogenesis, the mechanisms of ligand binding and receptor activation underlying these functions remain to be defined in detail. It is clear that only membrane-bound or artificially dimerized or clustered soluble ligands will mediate activation of Eph receptors (43Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1995; 82: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) including h-EphA3 (3Lackmann M. Mann R.J. Kravets L. Smith F.M. Bucci T.A. Maxwell K.F. Howlett G.J. Olsson J.E.

Recently the role of higher order receptor oligomers has been studied, demonstrating that full biological activation is only achieved once a tetrameric receptor aggregate is generated (22Stein E.

Our analysis of the stoichiometry of soluble h-ephrin A5 binding to the h-EphA3 ECD unambiguously confirmed a one-to-one interaction (3Lackmann M. Mann R.J. Kravets L. Smith F.M. Bucci T.A.

The event(s) that follow ligand binding, leading to receptor oligomerization and cell signaling, remain to be defined. This study sought to further our understanding of this first step of receptor activation through the analysis of functional domains of the h-EphA3 ECD both in vitro and in vivo.The highly conserved subdomain architecture of the ECD of Eph receptors coincides with a conserved exon structure (this paper and Ref. 33Connor R.J. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar). A study of interspecies sequence homologies between human, murine, and chicken EphA3 revealed high homology throughout but with a ranking of exon sequence identities, the strongest evolutionary constraint (>99% identity between mouse and human) being on exon III (Fig. 1,a and b). Regions of the ECD demarcated by exon boundaries were expressed in CHO cells, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. A kinetic analysis, using plasmon resonance detection of binding of the various subdomains to BIAcore sensorchip-immobilized h-ephrin-A5 clearly localized the ligand binding sequences to those encoded by exons I–III. The affinity for the interaction of this smaller ligand binding domain of KD = 18 nm was well within the range reported previously for the binding of ephrin-A5 to sensorchip-immobilized h-EphA3 (KD = 12 nm (3Lackmann M. Mann R.J. Kravets L. Smith F.M. Bucci T.A. Maxwell K.F. Howlett G.J. Olsson J.E. Vanden Bos T. Cerretti D.P. Boyd A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16521-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) but was somewhat higher than the affinity estimated for the binding of the h-EphA3 ECD to sensorchip-immobilized ephrin-A5 (KD = 62–72 nm, Fig. 1 e). Correspondingly increased association rates of the smaller subdomain constructs (Fig.1 d) and of the ligand (3Lackmann M. Mann R.J. Kravets L. Smith F.M. Bucci T.A. Maxwell K.F. Howlett G.J. Olsson J.E. Vanden Bos T. Cerretti D.P. Boyd A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16521-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggest that higher diffusion rates and improved access to the binding interface of the smaller proteins may explain this apparent affinity increase.In seeking to further narrow the binding region, we note that exon I contributes only seven non-conserved residues, but both exons II and III show very high sequence identity across species (Fig. 1). Attempts to express exon III without exon II sequences were unsuccessful, and expression of protein was not detected. However, in-solution competition experiments with a peptide corresponding to the exon I- and II-encoded residues of the receptor ECD showed no effect on binding. Taken together with the homology data, these results suggest that exon III-encoded sequences are directly involved in ligand binding, whereas exon II is not involved but is required for a stable protein domain structure. Furthermore, attempts to express a C-terminal truncated form of exon III, terminating after cysteine 186 (corresponding to cysteine 191 of EphB2), resulted in low yields of high molecular weight protein aggregates, suggesting the importance of this C-terminal sequence for the structural integrity of this domain. These findings are in general agreement with a recent study of the chicken EphB2 and EphA3 receptors (36Labrador J.P. Brambilla R. Klein R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By using a different approach the authors also identified the critical role of the N-terminal region in ligand binding. Although they did not analyze the contribution to protein secretion, stability, or ligand binding of the N-terminal, exon I- and II-encoded subdomain denoted in their report as “signal peptide,” successful expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins in our study suggests that this signal peptide is not cleaved from the receptor ECD during secretion. Furthermore, restricted C-terminal truncations of exon III sequences in their study resulted in reduced ligand binding affinity (36Labrador J.P. Brambilla R. Klein R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that most or all of exon III is required for high affinity binding. Together, these findings, emphasizing the structural importance of the N- and C-terminal sequences of the N-terminal half of the EphA3 ECD, support our conclusion that exons II and III encode an integral structure rather than, as previously assumed, discrete globular and cysteine-rich subdomains.Organization from defined structural building blocks with distinct regions of sequence conservation is a common feature of RTKs (44van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). As our data imply for EphA receptors, the region of highest sequence conservation within several subfamilies including the fibroblast growth factor receptors delineates the ligand-binding interface. In the case of the fibroblast growth factor receptors, ligand binding is encoded by Ig domains II and III, both of which independently bind fibroblast growth factors. Similarly, the PDGFR, c-Kit, TrkR, and Flt1 RTKs use multiple Ig repeats to bind ligand (21Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y.

In the Eph family the ligand-binding site is characterized as a single structural domain which, despite reported weak similarities to Ig-like (4Tuzi N.L. Gullick W.J. Br. J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) domains, appears to be unique to this family. The notion of a single exon II- and III-encoded protein domain is also supported by an evolutionary argument based on intron phase analysis (53Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of exon II and the 3′ end of exon III are phase 1 (i.e. interrupting the coding triplet after one base), whereas the intron between exons II and III is phase 0, implying that it arose through insertion into an ancestral coding sequence.To analyze further the role of isolated receptor ECD subdomainsin vivo, we modified a dominant negative strategy in zebrafish, previously used to study EphA4 signaling in fore- and hindbrain formation during zebrafish embryogenesis (24Xu Q.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), is well established (reviewed in Ref.44van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). We used our observation that expression of exogenous soluble EphA3 or ephrin-A5 resulted in a characteristic developmental defect in somite development and axial organization4 to probe the function of ECD subdomains. As anticipated from the BIAcore analysis, embryos injected with h-EphA3 I–III RNA show the same phenotype as h-EphA3 I–VII or soluble ephrin-A5 RNA-injected embryos, consistent with a dominant negative effect by the soluble EphA3 ligand binding domain. By contrast, injection of the h-EphA3 IV–VII RNA, encoding all regions except the ligand-binding domain, was not expected to alter the normal phenotype. At low and medium concentrations no abnormality in embryo development was observed. Extended dose-response studies revealed that both h-EphA3 I–VII or h-EphA3 I–III exhibited the expected dose-dependent increase in the number of developmentally defective embryos (Fig. 5).4 Although the severity of the effects also increased (an increasing number of somites were disrupted at higher concentrations of RNA; data not shown), the defects were confined exclusively to those tissues that had been perturbed also at low concentrations of injected RNA. Importantly, at high concentrations of h-EphA3 IV–VII RNA and h-EphA3 I–III RNA, injections resulted in a similar proportion of identically defective embryos. The complete overlap of phenotypes resulting from these injections of either h-EphA3 I–VII RNA, h-EphA3 I–III RNA, or high concentrations of h-EphA3 IV–VII RNA implied that the same signaling processes had been disrupted by all receptor constructs.Since the h-EphA3 IV–VII protein cannot bind ephrin-A5 (Fig. 1,d and e), this finding suggested that h-EphA3 can bind to endogenous receptor to produce functionless heterodimers, thus disrupting Eph signaling in a ligand-independent manner. An approximation of the abundance of the exogenous receptor proteins on the basis of Western blot and BIAcore data (Figs. 2, a andb, 5 a), and by assuming the extracellular space of a 10 hpf embryo as 5 pl (1/100th of the total volume of a 1-mm diameter embryo), suggests a concentration of 10–20 μmh-EphA3 IV–VII in 100 pg of mRNA-injected embryos. This high concentration of expressed protein required to achieve the dominant negative effect (Fig. 5, a and b) implies a significantly lower affinity of the receptor/receptor interaction than for the receptor-ligand binding. This notion was confirmed by BIAcore studies of h-EphA3 I–VII or h-EphA3 IV–VII binding to h-EphA3 I–VII derivatized sensor surfaces, indicating that ligand-independent receptor dimerization occurred at micromolar concentrations (Table I). Although we were not able to achieve high enough concentrations of monomeric h-EphA3 IV–VII to block ligand-induced h-EphA3 transphosphorylation in LK63 cells, we confirmed the ligand-independent receptor dimerization through a direct in vitro binding experiment. Anti-FLAG mAb cross-linked forms of either soluble h-EphA3 I–VII or the ligand binding domain-deficient h-EphA3 IV–VII construct (Fig. 6) induced transphosphorylation of endogenous receptors, demonstrating their competence for a ligand-independent interaction. A slow dissociation rate from the h-EphA3 I–VII sensor surface during BIAcore experiments and immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated endogenous h-EphA3 with mAb-dimerized h-EphA3 ECD constructs from a detergent lysate of LK63 cells suggest that the interaction is stable, once the critical receptor concentration is reached. On the other hand, a weak interaction of h-EphA3 I–III with h-EphA3 I–VII inferred from BIAcore and transphosphorylation experiments (Table I, Fig. 6) did not withstand the immunoprecipitation and indicates a minor contribution of this domain to the dimerization. Thus, our experiments provide several lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a low affinity dimerization domain which is encoded by exons IV–VII and functions independently of ligand binding. Exons IV–VII encode an EGF domain and two Fibronectin type III domains, the latter having been implicated in receptor dimerization in the cytokine receptor family (57Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although the data presented in this report do not precisely define the region mediating dimerization, preliminary zebrafish studies with h-EphA3 IV–V and h-EphA3 V–VII suggest that dimerization is mediated by exon IV sequences.The presence of a ligand-independent dimerization domain in EphA3 invites comparison with activation of the c-Kit and PDGFR. Experiments with c-Kit-specific mAbs which block dimerization, and analysis of c-Kit ECD deletion mutants, define an Ig domain C-terminal to the ligand binding interface which is required for receptor dimerization (21Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This dimerization domain is essential for biological effects of the Kit ligand. Of most relevance to the results presented, ligand-independent activation at high receptor density has been demonstrated using high level expression of PDGFR in SF9 cells (25Herren B. Rooney B. Weyer K.A. Iberg N. Schmid G. Pech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15088-15095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The identification of distinct receptor subdomains that mediate ligand-binding and receptor dimerization at different concentrations suggests a stepwise mechanism of receptor activation for EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands. In our model, an EphA-expressing cell or axon moving into a gradient generated by differentially expressing ephrin-A-positive cells encounters progressively higher ephrin-A concentrations. As EphA receptors engage ephrin through high affinity interaction of the N-terminal ligand-binding domain at the cell-cell interface (step 1), the reduced mobility of the receptor-ligand complexes versus free receptor or ligand results in their accumulation at the int"

The functional significance of these cleavages has not yet been determined. Calpain is a cysteine protease with dozens of substrates; it is activated through an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (22Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The two major calpain isoforms, μ- and m-, differ in the amount of Ca2+ required for activation. Calpain is triggered in necrosis (23Wang K. Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and in many cell types undergoing apoptosis, including SH-SY5Y (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A.

We recently showed that the CaM-binding protein α-spectrin is proteolytically cleaved in apoptotic SH-SY5Y cells by both caspase and calpain activation (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We suspected that other Ca2+/CaM-binding proteins may be similarly vulnerable to cleavage during apoptosis. The present study examines the fate of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase IV in SH-SY5Y cells in response to apoptotic challenge. CaMK IV is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly homologous to the catalytic and regulatory domains of multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) with a calculated mass of 52 kDa (human) (27Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CaMK IV expression is mainly restricted to the brain (28Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F.

It has been implicated in Ca2+-dependent transcription regulation through activation of the cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) (34Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, Alevizopoulos et al. reported that CaMK IV activates the transforming growth factor β-responsive transcription factor CTF-1 (38Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Ruegg U. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23597-23605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a hormone involved in growth regulation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (39Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The few known CaMK IV substrates other than transcription factors include synapsin I and the Ras-related GTP-binding protein Rap-1b (40Sahyoun N. McDonald O.B. Farrell F. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2643-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CaMK IV contains a polyglutamate-rich C-terminal tail (28Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is characteristic of chromatin-associated proteins (41Earnshaw W.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6903-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity is associated with apoptosis. Inhibition of CaM kinase activity with CaM kinase-specific inhibitors induces apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (45Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitizes etoposide-resistant cells to apoptotic challenge (46Kawamura K. Grabowski D. Krivacic K. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thymic T cells from transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of CaMK IV showed defects in survival and activation (47Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that CaMK IV was proteolytically cleaved during apoptosis. The CaMK IV fragmentation was mediated by both caspase-3 and calpain. We also report that loss of Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase activity is an early event in neuroblastoma cells undergoing apoptosis. All chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO (calpain inhibitor II, CalpInh II), thapsigargin, staurosporine, and syntide-2 were from Calbiochem. Carbobenzoxy-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-D-DCB) was made in-house at Parke-Davis. Anti-CaMK IV (monoclonal) and anti-CaM kinase kinase were from Transduction Laboratories, anti-α-spectrin (monoclonal) was from Chemicon, and anti-PARP (monoclonal) from Biomol. Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. SH-SY5Y cells were grown on 12-well plates to confluence (roughly 2 million cells/well) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At the beginning of the experiment, cultures were washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. As indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h with protease inhibitors. The cultures were then challenged with 0.5 μm staurosporine or 2 μm thapsigargin and maintained for indicated time, when protein was extracted. Cerebellar granule neurons and mixed cortical cells were isolated as described previously (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted by lysing cells with 2% SDS/Tris buffer, precipitating proteins with trichloroacetic acid and solubilizing with Tris base as described previously (48Wang K.K. Posner A. Hajimohammadreza I. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 662-668PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with a modified Lowry (Bio-Rad D-C protein assay kit). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on each lane and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel; Novex) with a Tris/glycine running buffer. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.2 μm) by semidry electrotransfer (Bio-Rad semidry transfer unit) for 2 h at 20 V. The blots were probed with primary antibody, a biotinylated secondary antibody, and avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoblots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Total protein was extracted from untreated confluent SH-SY5Y cells by the Triton X-100 method (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cell extract (30 μg of protein) was digested with 2.5 μg of mature purified recombinant caspases (supplied by Dr. Robert Talanian, BASF) or 1 μg of purified μ- or m-calpain (Calbiochem) in 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4 at room temperature), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v, v) glycerol, 1 mmEGTA (for caspases), or 1 mm Ca2+ (for calpain) for indicated times. The digestion was halted by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer for PAGE. Alternatively, 1.5 μg of purified, recombinant CaMK IV was subject to digestion under identical conditions. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and probed with indicated antibody. Purified, recombinant mouse CaMK IV fragments produced by digestion with purified caspase-3 or μ-calpain were subjected to Edman degradation to obtain N-terminal sequences (in-house at Parke-Davis). Mouse CaMK IV (20 μg, a gift from Dr. Thomas Soderling) was incubated for time indicated at room temperature with purified recombinant caspase-3 (5 μg) or purified μ-calpain (3 μg). The digestion was halted with the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred in a CAPS/methanol buffer to PVDF membrane using the method of Matsudaira (49Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie in 50% methanol until bands appeared. The stained bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. SH-SY5Y cells were treated as described, and cells were collected by scraping and centrifugation. Cells washed once with cold Tris-buffered saline plus 1 mm EDTA. Cell lysates were made by resuspending the cell pellet in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) (50MacNicol M. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12197-12201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were kept on ice 10 min with vortexing and then sonicated for 15 s. Total CaM kinase activity in 15 μg of sample was assayed by phosphorylation of the CaM kinase-selective substrate syntide-2 (Pro-Leu-Ala-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys, 40 μm), in the presence of Ca2+ (0.5 mm) and calmodulin (1.5 μg/assay tube) with 5 μCi/assay tube [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). Kinase reactions were carried out for 5 min at 30 °C and halted by spotting onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and washing in 75 mmphosphoric acid (3 × 10 min). The extent of phosphorylation was quantified by a Beckman scintillation counter. SH-SY5Y cell viability was assessed by measuring release of the cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium (25 μl samples). Quantification of LDH release was done using the Cytotox 96 colorimetric LDH assay kit (Promega), following the manufacturer's directions. To determine whether CaMK II or CaMK IV are expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, we subjected control lysate from SH-SY5Y cells to Western blotting with antibodies to CaMK IV (Fig.1 A, top), and to the major neuronal isoforms of CaMK II: α (Fig. 1 A,bottom) and β (Fig. 1 A, middle). Rat cerebral cortical and cerebellar granule cell extracts were used as positive controls for the presence of CaMK II α and β. In our hands, human CaMK IV appeared as a roughly 55-kDa doublet (probably α and β CaMK IV isoforms) with rat CaMK IV running slightly higher. The predicted molecular mass for human CaMK IV is 52 kDa (27Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although neither α nor β isoform of CaMK II is detectable in SH-SY5Y cells, the presence of other CaMK II isoforms, such as δ or γ, or CaM kinase I cannot be disregarded. To validate our antibodies, purified recombinant CaMK II α and CaMK IV were each Western blotted with antibodies to CaMK II α and CaMK IV (Fig. 1 B). The CaMK IV antibody reacted with only a 55-kDa protein, whereas the CaMK II α antibody reacted with only a 50-kDa protein. These molecular masses are consistent with masses for these proteins observed in situ (Fig. 1 A). No cross-reactivity occurred, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies used. To investigate the fate of CaMK IV in neuronal cells undergoing apoptosis, we challenged SH-SY5Y cell with 2 μm thapsigargin, a well established pro-apoptotic agent (51Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 52Kaneko Y. Tsukamoto A. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 53Tsukamoto A. Kaneko Y. Cell Biol. Int. 1993; 17: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration through inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase (54Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysate was prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. Treatment with thapsigargin resulted in the appearance of two major CaMK IV fragments, 40 kDa and 38 kDa, and two minor fragments, 50 kDa and 33 kDa (Fig. 2 A, top panel). The 40-kDa fragment is seen faintly in control lysate, but increases by 3 h of thapsigargin treatment. The 38-kDa band is readily apparent 3 h after start of thapsigargin treatment. We compared the time course for CaMK IV breakdown with those of PARP (Fig. 2 A, middle panel) and α-spectrin (Fig.2 A, bottom panel) in thapsigargin-treated SH-SY5Y cells. α-Spectrin (19Vanags D.M.

Caspase-3 activity mediates the formation of the 120-kDa α-spectrin breakdown product (BDP) and the 85-kDa PARP BDP. Densitometric analysis was performed on the fragments (Fig.2 B). CaMK IV, PARP, and α-spectrin fragments were apparent beginning at 3 h post-treatment. The early appearance of a greater amount the 120-kDa α-spectrin BDP is consistent with reports that α-spectrin cleavage is one of the early events of apoptosis (56Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The increase of the CaMK IV fragments occurs in a time frame similar to that of PARP and α-spectrin. We wanted to confirm that CaMK IV would be cleaved under a different apoptotic paradigm. SH-SY5Y cells were challenged with staurosporine, a nonspecific kinase inhibitor and well established pro-apoptotic agent (10Nath R. Raser K.J. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Stafford D. Wang K.K. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Posmantur R.M. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K.W. J.

Staurosporine treatment produced the same breakdown pattern as thapsigargin (Fig.3 A, second lane versus fifth lane). We have previously demonstrated that pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-D-DCB blocks formation of the 120-kDa α-spectrin fragment (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Here, we examine its ability to prevent CaMK IV cleavage during apoptosis. Z-D-DCB prevented formation of the 38-kDa CaMK IV fragment in both staurosporine- and thapsigargin-treated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.3 A). Ability of Z-D-DCB to block formation of a subset of CaMK IV fragments suggests that caspase is in part, but not fully, mediating CaMK IV proteolysis. In staurosporine-treated, but not thapsigargin-treated, cells, formation of the 50- and 33-kDa CaMK IV fragments was attenuated. This discrepancy may be a result of the different mechanisms that lead to apoptosis in staurosporine- versus thapsigargin-treated cells or differences in time to onset for apoptosis. Staurosporine activates caspase-3 much more rapidly than thapsigargin in these cells (data not shown). Furthermore, because staurosporine is a protein kinase inhibitor, it may directly interact with CaMK IV and alter susceptibility to cleavage. Because calpain is also activated in SH-SY5Y cells undergoing apoptosis (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we investigated its role in CaMK IV fragmentation. We inhibited calpain in two ways: by incubation with 2 mm EGTA and by treatment with CalpInh II before the onset of apoptosis. Pretreatment with EGTA"

We have explored the signaling pathways by which insulin mediates the repression of G6Pase transcription in H4IIE cells. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) inhibitor blocked the repression of G6Pase mRNA expression by insulin. However, both rapamycin, which inhibits p70S6 kinase activation, and PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, were without effect. Insulin inhibited dexamethasone-induced luciferase expression from a transiently transfected plasmid that places the luciferase gene under the control of the G6Pase promoter. This effect of insulin was mimicked by the overexpression of a constitutively active PtdIns 3-kinase but not by a constitutively active protein kinase B. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PtdIns 3-kinase activation is both necessary and at least partly sufficient for the repression of G6Pase expression by insulin, but neither mitogen-activated protein kinase nor p70S6 kinase are involved. In addition, activation of protein kinase B alone is not sufficient for repression of the G6Pase gene. These results imply the existence of a novel signaling pathway downstream of PtdIns 3 kinase that is involved in the regulation of G6Pase expression by insulin.

This raises the possibility that the expression of these genes may be regulated in a coordinated fashion by insulin, both at the level of the transcription factors involved as well as in the signaling pathways utilized.One of the central enzymes involved in insulin signaling is phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase (12Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 7: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (826) Google Scholar)). This enzyme is activated when the SH2 domain of its p85 subunit binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (13Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.E. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B.

This leads to the production of 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides, which serve to activate the downstream protein kinase, protein kinase B (PKB). Hence wortmannin, an inhibitor of PtdIns 3-kinase, is able to block activation of PKB by insulin (15Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

In this study, we have examined the capacity of the viral auxiliary protein, Vpr, to modulate transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter sequence located within the long terminal repeat (LTR). We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Vpr in human astrocytic cells, U-87MG, enhances the basal activity of the viral promoter in transfected cells and that the GC-rich sequences, spanning nucleotides −80 to −43, are important for this activity. Since this region serves as the target for p53-induced suppression of LTR activity and interacts with the ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1, we examined the cooperative activity of Vpr, p53, and Sp1 upon LTR transcription. Results from co-transfection studies indicated that overexpression of wild type p53, but not mutant p53, decreases the level of activation of the LTR by Vpr. Transcriptional activation of the LTR by Vpr required the presence of Sp1 since overexpression of Vpr in cells with no endogenous Sp1 failed to augment LTR activity. Results from protein-protein interaction studies indicated that Vpr is associated with both p53 and Sp1 in cells with ectopic expression of these proteins. Moreover, it was evident that p53 and Sp1 interact with each other in these cells. These functional and structural studies provided a working model on the cooperative interaction of Vpr with cellular proteins Sp1 and p53 and control of viral gene transcription at immediate early stage of infection prior to the participation of other viral regulatory proteins.

J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, earlier studies have indicated that Vpr has the ability to augment transcription of the HIV-1 LTR in cell-free in vitrotranscription assay (14Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These observations led to the assumption that the envelop-incorporated Vpr, by up-regulating viral gene expression in newly infected cells at the immediate early phase, increases expression of other viral genes including the potent transcription transactivator, such as Tat, in the subsequent lytic cycle. Whereas the mechanism whereby Tat exerts its regulatory action upon virus gene transcription is greatly understood (for review, see Ref. 15Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), the pathway by which Vpr induces promoter activity of HIV-1 remains elusive. In previous studies, results from in vitro transcription assay suggested that Vpr may induce transcription of the HIV-1 promoter through the GC-rich motif of the LTR (14Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which serves as the binding site for the ubiquitous cellular transcription factor, Sp1 (16Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and that interaction of Vpr and Sp1 may be important for the observed activity (14Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, results from protein-protein studies indicated in vitro association of Vpr and TFIIB (17Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Rey F. Bouhamdan M. Spire B. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that high level expression of the viral genome may require cooperative interaction of several viral proteins, such as Tat, Vpr, and the cellular proteins that may share a common target motif within the viral genome. The ability of Vpr to stimulate the HIV-1 promoter through the GC-rich motif, a region which has been demonstrated to negatively respond to the p53 tumor suppressor protein, prompted us to launch a series of functional and structural studies to assess the ability of Vpr to regulate HIV-1 promoter activity in cell culture and to determine the importance of the GC-rich binding protein and p53 in this regulatory event. The plasmid constructs containing various sequences of the HIV-1 LTR upstream of the reporter CAT gene have been described previously (18Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R. Bagasra O. Chowdhury M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Amini S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs with an internal deletion in the GC-rich motif were provided by Dr. S. Zeichner NCI, National Institutes of Health, (Bethesda, MD) (19Zeichner S.L Kim J.Y. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2436-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA Vpr expression plasmid containing the CMV promoter expressing Vpr was provided by Dr. A. Srinivasan (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) and has been described previously (20Mahalingam S. Khan S.A. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Virology. 1995; 207: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Sp1 expression vector was generously provided by Dr. R. J. Tjian (University of California Berkeley). The CMV-p53 and mutant p53 expression vectors have been described previously (21Stuart E.T. Haffner R. Oren M. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. R. Gartenhaus (Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, PA). pPac-Sp1 and pPac-p53 represent plasmids in which cDNAs corresponding to Sp1 and p53, respectively, are expressed by the actin promoter in SL2 cells. The MCK-CAT plasmid containing muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter fused to the CAT gene has been described previously (22Zambetti G.P. Bargonetti J. Wlaker K. Prives C. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The human astrocytic glial cell line, U-87MG (ATCC, Manassas, VA), was maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The stable clonal cell line, GM47.23, that conditionally expresses wild-type p53 following treatment of cells with dexamethasone was derived from human glioblastoma cells (23Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). All cells were grown in the presence of penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml). Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line, SL2, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Jaynes (Thomas Jefferson University). These cells were grown in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics and 12% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (24Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection, approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm plates, and after 16 h, cells were transfected with various plasmids as specified by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). In general, the transfection mixture contained 500 ng of the reporter plasmid either alone or with 5 μg of the expression plasmids, and the final concentration of the promoter DNA construct was normalized by the addition of empty expression plasmid, pcDNA3. CAT activity was determined after 36–48 h posttransfection by the previously described method (26Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Each transfection was done in duplicate and repeated 2–4 times with at least three different plasmid preparations to ensure the reproducibility of the results. Monoclonal antibodies for detection of p53 were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). pAb 421 (Ab-1) and pAb 240 (Ab-3) are mouse monoclonal antibodies which recognize the amino acid residues 371–380 (27Legros Y. Lafon C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1994; 7: 2071-2076Google Scholar) and 213–217 (28Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) of human p53, respectively. Polyclonal anti-flag antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). This antibody recognizes the flag tag sequence that is positioned at the C terminus of Vpr derived by pCMV-Vpr (29Serio D. Rizvi T.A. Cartas M. Kalayanaraman V.S. Weber I.T. Koprowski H. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody for detection of Sp1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. U-87MG andDrosophila SL2 cells were transfected with either the pCMV-Vpr flag, pCMV-p53, or pCMV-Sp1 (for U-87MG cells) and pPac-Sp1 or pPac-p53 (for Schneider cells) alone or in various combinations by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Transfectants were trypsinized and subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or Western analysis as described previously (30Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Silver staining was performed according to previously published procedures (31Moeremans M. Daneels G. De May J. Analytical Biochemistry. 1985; 145: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Treatment of GM47.23 cells with dexamethasone at a final concentration of 1 μm was done according to the procedure described previously (23Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Analysis of p53 production and HIV-1 LTR activity was performed according to the procedures described above. Vpr is a 96-amino acid protein encoded by the HIV-1 genome that has the ability to increase the rate of replication of the virus in T-cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (32Arrigo S.J. Weitsman S. Zack J.A. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4585-4588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ogawa K. Shibata R. Kiyomasu T. Higuchi I. Kishida Y. Ishimoto A. Adachi A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4110-4114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have indicated that Vpr has a transcriptional activity and induces expression of the viral LTR and several cellular genes (34Cohen E.A. Terwilliger E.F. Jalinoos Y. Proulx L. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). While activation of the viral promoter by Vpr may be mediated by TFIIB, a component of the transcription initiation complex (17Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Rey F. Bouhamdan M. Spire B. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), earlier studies pointed to the importance of the GC-rich motif located upstream of the transcription start site, in the observed activation of the HIV-1 gene by this protein. Here, we performed transfection studies utilizing full-length and deletion promoter constructs derived from the HIV-1 regulatory region to evaluate the ability of Vpr in enhancing the activity of HIV-1 LTR in the human astrocytic cell line, U-87MG. Results from this study indicated that ectopic expression of Vpr in U-87MG cells transfected with the reporter plasmid containing the LTR promoter sequences from −458 to +80, −117 to +80, and −80 to +80 results in 6.4–7.0-fold activation of the viral promoter (Fig.1). Removal of the sequences between −80 to −48, that deletes the GC-rich motif, completely abrogated Vpr responsiveness and LTR activation in these cells. The use of 3′ deletion constructs that remove the sequences between +80 to +3 suggested that the sequences positioned downstream from the transcription start site (+1) may not play an important role in Vpr-induced activation of the LTR in these cells (Fig. 1). Results from studies utilizing internal deletion constructs of the LTR that remove the sequences between −80 to −48 from the full-length (3 and 7), and the 5′ deletion constructs (5 and 9) as depicted in Fig. 1, in the transfection experiments verified that the sequences between −43 to −80 are essential for induction of LTR transcription by Vpr in astrocytic cells. In earlier studies, we and others (35Duan L. Ozaki I. Oakes J.W. Taylor J.P. Khalili K. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4302-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 103-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the p53 tumor suppressor gene product has the ability to decrease transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR in cell culture and in a cell-free transcription system and that the sequences spanning the GC-rich motif of the LTR are important for this activity (35Duan L. Ozaki I. Oakes J.W. Taylor J.P. Khalili K. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4302-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Vpr to stimulate transcription of the LTR through the GC-rich sequences prompted us to examine the potential cooperative action of Vpr and p53 on transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter. In the first series of studies, U-87MG cells were co-transfected with the LTR reporter plasmid (LTR-CAT) alone or together with plasmids expressing either wild-type or mutant p53. As shown in Fig. 2 A, in accord with the previous observations (35Duan L. Ozaki I. Oakes J.W. Taylor J.P. Khalili K. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4302-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where overexpression of wild-type p53 decreased transcription of the viral promoter, production of mutant p53 that contains a mutation in amino acid 143 of the protein led to an increase in HIV-1 promoter activity. Of note, mutation in the amino acid residue 143 completely abrogates transcriptional activity of p53 (38Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Next, cells were transfected with LTR-CAT and an optimum amount of Vpr expression plasmid in the absence and presence of plasmids expressing either wild-type or mutant p53. As illustrated in Fig.2 B, overexpression of wild-type p53 decreased the level of activation of the LTR by Vpr. Under similar experimental conditions, mutant p53 showed no significant effect on Vpr-induced transcription of the LTR. In a different approach, to assess the effect of p53 on the activation of the LTR by Vpr, we utilized the human glial cell line, GM47.23. This cell line has the ability to conditionally overexpress wild-type p53 once the cells are maintained in media supplemented by dexamethasone (23Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone resulted in the highest level of p53 production after 18 h, as examined by Western blot analysis of the protein extract obtained from the cells treated with dexamethasone for 12, 18, and 24 h (Fig.3 A). The effect of p53 on LTR promoter activation by Vpr was then examined following transfection of these cells with the LTR-CAT construct alone or together with the Vpr expression plasmid at different time intervals after dexamethasone treatment. Results from these studies revealed that treatment of the cells with dexamethasone decreased basal and Vpr-mediated transcriptional activity of the viral promoter and that the maximum level of inhibition was achieved at 18 h when the level of p53 is at the highest (Fig. 3, B and C). It should be noted that treatment of the cells with dexamethasone had no significant effect on the basal transcription of the HIV-1 LTR in these cells. 2B. Sawaya, unpublished data. These observations, along with the previous co-transfection data, strongly suggest that functional interaction between Vpr and p53 may modulate the level of Vpr transcriptional activation upon the LTR promoter. As described previously, p53 has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator and repressor in a variety of cells. To examine the effect of Vpr in the activation of the p53 responsive promoter, we utilized MCK-CAT, which contains the p53 responsive element, and its transcriptional activity is increased by the wild-type p53 (39Weintraub H. Hauschka S. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4570-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, cells were transfected with the reporter MCK-CAT constructs and the wild-type p53 expression plasmid in the absence and presence of the Vpr expression plasmid. As shown in Fig.4, a substantial increase in the transcriptional activity of MCK promoter was obtained in cells expressing wild-type p53. Co-expression of wild-type p53 and Vpr decreased the level of p53 activation of the MCK promoter in the transfected cells. Of note, expression of Vpr alone in these cells resulted in a modest (2-fold) induction of the MCK promoter. This activation may be attributed to the presence of a GC-rich sequence which resides within the MCK promoter (40Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Co-expression of mutant p53 and Vpr in the cells showed a similar effect on the MCK promoter as that observed in cells expressing Vpr alone. These data further indicate that functional interaction between p53 and Vpr may not be restricted to the LTR promoter as evidenced by the cooperative action of these two proteins upon the gene that is positively regulated by p53. The finding that these two proteins in combination exert a negative effect upon LTR activity is reminiscent of the interplay between p53 and SP1 in activation of HIV-1-LTR (41Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. ( Paris ),. 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar), where the influence on promoter activity was attributed to alteration in the interaction of SP1 with DNA by p53. Since both p53 and Vpr exerted their regulatory action on the HIV-1 LTR through the GC-rich motif, a region which is the target for binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1, in the next series of studies we examined the involvement of Sp1 in the observed regulatory event. In this study, SL2 cells, which have no endogenous Sp1, were transfected with LTR-CAT alone or in various combinations with expression plasmids that produce Vpr, wild-type p53, and Sp1. Results from these studies indicated that in contrast to the data obtained from the U-87MG cells (Figs. 3 and 5 A), ectopic expression of Vpr and p53 in these cells exhibits no significant effect on LTR promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). However, once the plasmid expressing Sp1 was included in the transfection mixture, the level of LTR activity was drastically elevated. Co-production of Vpr and Sp1 resulted in transcriptional activation of the LTR to a level that is comparable with that seen upon expression of Sp1 alone in these cells. Of interest, expression of p53 significantly decreased the level of transcriptional activation of the LTR by Sp1 and Sp1 plus Vpr. These observations suggest that activation of the LTR by Sp1 may be modulated by p53 and that Sp1 function can be counter prevented by p53. As mentioned earlier, these findings corroborate with previous observations indicating that p53 has the ability to alter the DNA binding ability of Sp1 (41Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. ( Paris ),. 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it is evident that Vpr is incapable of augmenting LTR transcription in the absence of Sp1. Further, the data presented in Fig. 5 suggest that yet another protein(s) present in mammalian cells may be involved in Vpr activation of the HIV-1-LTR. In the next series of experiments, we investigated the interaction of Vpr with Sp1 and p53. Initially, U-87MG cells were transfected with p53 and Vpr expression plasmids alone or in combination. In this study, we utilized the fusion Vpr expression plasmid, pCMV-Vpr-flag, which expresses Vpr fused to amino acid flag sequences at the C-terminal region (23Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Amin M. Sauve G.J. Appella E. Romano J.W. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). After 36 h, protein extracts were prepared and reacted with either anti-Sp1 antibody, or anti-flag antibody that recognizes Vpr fusion protein. The immunocomplexes were separated from the remaining protein by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blot technique directed for the detection of p53. As shown in Fig.6 A, the anti-Sp1 immunocomplexes from untransfected cells and cells transfected with pCMV-p53 contained p53 protein, suggesting that p53 and Sp1 may be associated with each other in these cells. Of note, the intensity of the band corresponding to p53 in the transfected cell extract was higher compared with the control, indicative of overproduction of p53 by pCMV-p53 (Fig. 6 A, compare lane 2 to1). This observation is in agreement with previous data pointing to the interaction of endogenous Sp1 and p53 (36Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 103-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-flag-directed immunocomplex obtained from the Vpr transfected cells showed an extremely weak signal corresponding to the p53 band. In contrast, the immunocomplex obtained from the cells with ectopic expression of Vpr and p53 by using anti-flag antibody showed an intense p53 band, suggesting the in vivo association of p53 and Vpr in these cells (Fig. 6 A, lane 5). Similarly, protein extract from cells transfected with Vpr and p53 expression plasmids showed the presence of p53 in the immunocomplex that was pulled-down by anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 6 A, lane 6). Fig. 6 B shows that the Sp1-associated immunocomplex from cells transfected with Vpr contains the 15-kDa chimeric Vpr protein. These observations strongly suggest that the HIV-1 regulatory protein, Vpr, is in complex with cellular proteins Sp1 and p53. Of note, results from Western blot analysis revealed an approximately 3-fold increase in the level of Sp1 in the cells transfected with the Sp1 expression plasmid than that of the untransfected cells (data not shown). The endogenous level of p53 in untransfected cells was almost undetectable (Fig. 6 C, lane 1). In the extract from the transfected cells, an intense band corresponding to exogenously produced p53 was easily detected (Fig. 6 C,lane 2). Furthermore, from the intensity of the bands, it was evident that only 30% of the protein was immunoprecipitated and found in the pellet, whereas 70% of the overproduced p53 remained in the supernatant (Fig. 6 C, lanes 3 and4, respectively). Results from silver staining of the protein gel showed the presence of p53, the immunoglobulin subunits, and one peptide with lower mobility than p53 (data not shown). In the next series of studies, we utilized SL2 cells to investigate the importance of Sp1 in the association of Vpr and p53. These cells were transfected with the expression plasmids alone or in various combinations allowing for ectopic production of Sp1, p53, and Vpr. Of note, SL2 cells contain endogenous p53 protein, which co-migrates with the p53 produced by the expression plasmid (Fig. 6 D, comparelanes 1 and 2). This band was not detected in the immunocomplex pulled down with the control preimmune sera (data not shown). Results of the immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses indicate that the anti-flag-mediated pulled down immunocomplex from cell extracts transfected with Vpr and p53 contains no strong band corresponding to the 53-kDa protein (Fig. 6 E, lane 1). Of interest, ectopic expression of Sp1 in the transfected cells resulted in the appearance of a p53 band in the immunocomplex pulled down by anti-flag antibody (Fig. 6 E, lane 4). These observations suggest that Sp1 may mediate complexation of Vpr and p53. The immunocomplex pulled down by Sp1 from the extract transfected with pCMV-Sp1 alone (lane 2) or pCMV-Sp1 plus pCMV-p53 (lane 3), pCMV-Sp1 plus pCMV-p53, and pCMV-Vpr-flag (lane 4) contains a p53 band, further suggesting the association of Sp1 and p53 in these protein extracts. The studies presented in this communication provide evidence for the cooperative interaction of viral (Vpr) and cellular (p53 and Sp1) regulatory proteins and their effect on HIV-1 gene transcription. Although the mechanism of these observations remains unclear, activation of viral gene transcription by Vpr is intriguing in light of the findings that this small protein, by associating with the capsid proteins, incorporates into the virion and enters into the newly infected cells. As such, it is possible that input Vpr in the newly infected cells stimulates transcription of the viral genome at the immediate early phase and leads to rapid production of other regulatory proteins such as Tat and Rev that are pivotal for productive viral lytic infection. Results from deletion mutant analysis corroborate with earlier results and indicate that the GC-rich nucleotide sequence positioned between nucleotides −80 to −43, which is the binding site for Sp1, is the target for Vpr activation. We also demonstrated that in cells expressing Vpr, Sp1, and p53, Vpr can form a complex with Sp1. This is an interesting observation since in previous studies it was demonstrated that in vitro association of highly purified Vpr and Sp1 requires the presence of at least two Sp1 DNA motifs. Thus, one can envision a model in which stable complexation of Sp1 and Vpr can occur in the absence of Sp1-DNA motifs once the cellular protein, p53, is present. Therefore, p53 may function as a co-factor and facilitate interaction of Vpr and Sp1. Experiments are currently in progress to establish functional relevance of such interactions through the use of mutant versions of these proteins that lack the ability to interact with each other. It is also interesting to remember that p53 is a major player of host cell cycle machinery, and by modulating a series of cellular genes such as p21, can dictate the rate of G1, G1/S, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle (42Shaw P.H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Also, earlier studies by several laboratories have indicated that Vpr can induce cell cycle arrest of the cells in the G2 phase by preventing activation of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases and thereby prevent cells from undergoing mitosis and proliferation (for review, see Ref. 43Emerman M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although, the significance of these observations with respect to HIV-1 gene transcription and replication remains to be established, it is noteworthy to mention that cooperative interaction between another viral protein, Tat, and host-cell cycle machinery results in elongation of the G1 phase and prevents rapid cell proliferation (14Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,44Li C.J. Wang C. Friedman D.J. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5461-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that both HIV-1 regulatory proteins, Vpr and Tat, can stall cell cycle proliferation on one hand, and stimulate viral gene transcription on the other hand. Evidently, to exert their dual activity on viral and host functions, these regulatory proteins require interaction with cellular proteins such as Sp1 and p53 (for Vpr) as presented in this communication, and NFκB and pRb for Tat (45Kundu M.

https://openalex.org/W2118244670,"DNA photolyases repair pyrimidine dimers via a reaction in which light energy drives electron donation from a catalytic chromophore, FADH−, to the dimer. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli photolyase suggested that the pyrimidine dimer is flipped out of the DNA helix and into a cavity that leads from the surface of the enzyme to FADH−. We have tested this model using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Phr1 photolyase which is >50% identical to E. coli photolyase over the region comprising the DNA binding domain. By using the bacterial photolyase as a starting point, we modeled the region encompassing amino acids 383–530 of the yeast enzyme. The model retained the cavity leading to FADH− as well as the band of positive electrostatic potential which defines the DNA binding surface. We found that alanine substitution mutations at sites within the cavity reduced both substrate binding and discrimination, providing direct support for the dinucleotide flip model. The roles of three residues predicted to interact with DNA flanking the dimer were also tested. Arg452 was found to be particularly critical to substrate binding, discrimination, and photolysis, suggesting a role in establishing or maintaining the dimer in the flipped state.

A structural model for photolyase-dimer interaction is presented. Pyrimidine bases absorb strongly in the UV region and are highly susceptible to photochemical reactions that alter their structures. In DNA, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPDscyclobutane pyrimidine dimersFADflavin adenine dinucleotidePhr1photolyase encoded by the S. cerevisiae PHR1 geneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayLPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts are the most frequent and biologically significant products of these reactions. These lesions are lethal and mutagenic and must be repaired to ensure cell survival and genetic stability. DNA photolyases repair CPDs and (6-4) photoproducts via reactions in which near UV or visible light provides the energy for bond rearrangements which restore the pyrimidines to their undamaged state. Two types of DNA photolyases have been recognized with regard to substrate specificity as follows: cyclobutane dipyrimidine photolyases and (6-4) photolyases (see Ref. 1Sancar A. Richardson C.C. Abelson J.N. Raetz C.R.H. Annual Review of Biochemistry. Annual Reviews, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1996: 43-81Google Scholar for a recent review). Each type of enzyme recognizes and efficiently repairs a single type of damage (2Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T.

Understanding how the CPD photolyases efficiently repair pyrimidine dimers in DNA entails answering the following two questions: how do the enzymes recognize pyrimidine dimers specifically in the midst of a vast excess of nondamaged bases, and how do the enzymes catalyze dimer photolysis? Photolysis involves two noncovalently bound chromophores, reduced FAD and a second chromophore which, depending upon the source of the enzyme, is either folate or deazaflavin (4Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Absorbance of a photon of photoreactivating light subsequent to substrate binding initiates electron donation by enzyme-bound FADH− to one of the bases in the dimer (4Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 5Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The photon may be absorbed either directly by FADH− or, more often, by the second chromophore which transfers energy to the flavin chromophore (1Sancar A. Richardson C.C. Abelson J.N. Raetz C.R.H. Annual Review of Biochemistry. Annual Reviews, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1996: 43-81Google Scholar). Both electron transfer and energy transfer are highly efficient processes, resulting in a quantum yield for the overall photolysis reaction of 0.6–1.0 for CPDs containing thymine or uracil (6Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,7Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 2A. Sancar, personal communication. CPD photolyases are structure-specific enzymes that display binding discrimination comparable to that seen for sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Studies on the Escherichia coli andSaccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes have shown that the equilibrium association constant for (cis,syn)-CPDs in DNA is approximately 109m−1, whereas the association constant for nondamaged DNA is 103m−1 (6Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Husain I. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Baer M.E.

The affinity for (trans,syn)-pyrimidine dimers in DNA and U<>U dimers in RNA is only about 10-fold greater than that for nondamaged DNA; nevertheless, once bound, these lesions are photolyzed efficiently (7Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,11Kim S.-T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7065-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus the presence of a cyclobutane dimer, the geometry of the bases in the dimer, and the absence of a 2′-OH on the sugar phosphate backbone are determinants of binding specificity. Important recognition elements are also found in DNA flanking the dimer. In particular, ethylation of the first phosphate 5′ to the dimer and 3–4 phosphates 3′ to the dimer in the lesion-containing strand inhibits binding (12Baer M. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4777-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,13Husain I. Sancar G.B. Holbrook S.R. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13188-13197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least some of these interactions contribute to binding specificity as shown by the fact that discrimination between dimer-containing and undamaged oligonucleotides decreases as the substrate is shortened (6Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the yeast Phr1 photolyase have been identified which simultaneously decrease substrate discrimination and alter interactions with DNA phosphates surrounding the dimer (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that the structure of the flanking sugar-phosphate backbone is uniquely altered by the dimer. A structural basis for the efficiency of the photolysis reaction and for specific substrate recognition has been provided by the crystal structure of E. coli photolyase (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain is folded into an amino-terminal α/β domain and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain with the folate cofactor nestled into a shallow cleft between the two domains. The flavin chromophore lies deeply buried in the center of the helical domain, with direct access to solvent limited to a cavity leading from the edge of the isoalloxazine ring of flavin to the surface. The cavity lies in the center of a trace of positive electrostatic potential that runs along the flat face of the helical domain, and both the dimensions of the cavity and the asymmetric distribution of hydrophobic and polar residues within the cavity are appropriate to accommodate a pyrimidine dimer. These features of the photolyase structure led Park and co-workers (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) to propose thatE. coli photolyase binds DNA along the trace of positive electrostatic potential and that in the enzyme-substrate complex the dimer is flipped out of the DNA helix and into the cavity leading to FAD. Here we report the results of mutational studies designed to test the model for photolyase binding using the yeast Phr1 photolyase. Phr1 and E. coli photolyases contain identical chromophores and are 50% identical in primary sequence over the region encompassing most of the proposed DNA binding surface and the cavity leading to flavin. Our results provide the most detailed picture yet of interactions at the photolyase-DNA interface, support the dinucleotide flip model, and suggest that interactions between DNA and residues inside and outside of the cavity contribute to binding affinity, to substrate discrimination, and to maintaining the dimer in the flipped state. Modeling was performed using the program FRODO (PSX, version 6.6) on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 Graphics system. The E. coli photolyase crystal structure (see Ref.14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar; Protein Data Base code 1dnp) was used as the starting point for modeling the structure of the DNA-binding site of yeast photolyase. The region of the α-helical domain of E. coli photolyase encompassing helices 11 through 18 (amino acids 273–419) contains most of the residues predicted to interact with DNA in and surrounding the cavity leading to the flavin chromophore (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Within this region the overall sequence identity between the two enzymes is 50% (Fig.1). To model this region, the 73 nonidentical amino acids in the E. coli photolyase sequence were replaced with the corresponding amino acids from the S. cerevisiae Phr1 sequence (15Sancar G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8231-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each new amino acid was subjected to a modeling and refinement protocol. First, the amide nitrogen, α carbon, and amide carbon of each amino acid were placed in the position of the previous E. coli amino acid. The yeast amino acid side chain was then rotated about its first dihedral rotation angle (χ1) to produce an alignment devoid of steric clash. Because χ1 displays a strong tendency to assume values near 60, 180, and 300°, each new side chain was examined first in each of these positions. The preferred alignment was at a χ1 value that placed the yeast side chain near theE. coli side chain and did not produce any steric clashes (within 2.5 Å). At positions 285, 291, and 368 (Phr1 positions 395, 401, and 478), alternative values for χ1 had to be chosen. A similar protocol was used to model the dihedral angle χ2 between the β and γ carbons on Gln, Glu, Lys, Arg, Met, Phe, Tyr, and Trp side chains. Again, the preferred dihedral values were those that placed the yeast side chain near the corresponding E. coli side chain. Steric clashes at positions 307, 308, and 411 (Phr1 positions 417, 418, and 521) prohibited placing these side chains in the preferred positions. The program REFINE, written by Dr. Jan Hermans (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), was then used to refine the geometry (bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles) for the S. cerevisiae model. Individual amino acids were first refined, then the entire structure was analyzed over the course of 10 cycles. After 10 cycles, the cumulative coordinate shift was determined, and further modeling was performed until this shift value decreased to less than 5.0 Å. An identical approach was used to replace Arg226, which lies near the rim of the cavity leading to flavin, with the equivalent yeast residue, Lys330. The entire PHR1coding region and approximately 500 bp of 3′-flanking sequence were subcloned from pCB1241/recon (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) intoXmnI-PstI-digested pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs), yielding pGBS424. Oligonucleotides used in the construction of the various mutants are listed in Table I, and the locations of the introduced mutations and relevant restriction sites are shown in Fig. 2. To facilitate construction of the K330A mutant, PCR mutagenesis was used to introduce a SmaI site into PHR1 at nucleotides 684–689 (relative to the first PHR1 ATG; Fig. 2), yielding plasmid pGBS425. The amino acid sequence of photolyase was not changed in this construction. Alanine substitution mutations were introduced at Lys330, Glu384, Arg452, Phe494, and Gln514 using two-primer (Lys330, Arg452) or four-primer PCR mutagenesis (Lys383, Glu384, Phe494, and Gln514) and pGBS425 as template. Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used in the first PCR stage (25 cycles). For 4-primer PCR, the first stage PCR products were purified on 3% GTG agarose gels (FMC Bioproducts), recovered in sterile water, and used for the second PCR reaction in conjunction with appropriate outside primer pairs (Table I). Amplification was carried out for 15 cycles using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Purified PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases and cloned into pGBS425 which had been digested with the same set of enzymes as follows: KpnI and XbaI for K383A and E384A, XbaI and PstI for F494A and Q514A,KpnI and XbaI for R452A, and SmaI andKpnI for K330A (Fig. 2). In each case the nucleotide sequence of the amplified region was verified to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced by the PCR. The photolyase bearing three substitutions (K330A/E384A/F494A) was constructed by subcloning restriction fragments containing the E384A and the F494A mutations into the K330A plasmid using unique restriction sites surrounding each mutation. To express PHR1 without any attached fusion protein, the ∼2.4-kilobase pair BglII-PstI fragment from each mutant was subcloned into similarly digested pCB1241/recon. Construction of mutant W387A has been described previously (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab All photolyases were overexpressed from pCB1241/recon derivatives (no maltose binding protein fusion) in E. coli strain CSR603F′lacI Q (Phr−) and purified as described previously to greater than 95% purity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration and chromophore content for each protein preparation were determined by spectroscopy from 220 to 700 nm (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectra were closely examined for the presence of peaks near 450, 480, 580, and 625 nm, which are indicative of oxidation of the reduced flavin chromophore to the blue neutral radical or FADox (16Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Heelis P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15457-15465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 43-bp DNA substrate containing a centrally located thymine dimer was prepared for these studies as shown in Oligonucleotide 1. 5′­3′­pCTATCGATGGCCTGCAGGCAAGTATAGCTACCGGACGTCCGTTCA<>TGGAGGAATTCGTACTGAGTCACCTCCTTAAGCATGACTCAG­3′T­5′ OLIGONUCLEOTIDE1A (cis,syn)-thymidine dimer (a gift from Xiaodong Zhao and Aziz Sancar) was synthesized and incorporated into the top strand oligonucleotide shown using standard oligonucleotide coupling protocols (17Taylor J.-S. Brockie I.R. O'Day C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6735-6742Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Full-length oligonucleotide was purified from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, quantitated by absorbance at 254 nm, and labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (>6,000 Ci/mmol). The bottom strand oligonucleotide was quantitated by absorbance at 254 nm, and the two oligonucleotides were mixed at a concentration of 500 nmdimer oligonucleotide and 1500 nm bottom strand oligonucleotide in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and then allowed to anneal by slow cooling to room temperature. This procedure resulted in incorporation of >90% of the dimer oligonucleotide into double-stranded DNA. Oligo(dT)18 (Sigma) dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA was used as competitor for nonspecific binding studies. For each photolyase preparation the fraction of photolyase molecules active in DNA binding was determined by titrating a fixed concentration of enzyme (2–3 × KD) with increasing amounts of substrate, as described previously (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to separate bound and free substrate. Radioactivity present in the bound and free DNA bands was quantitated using an Ambis Radioanalytic Imager (Ambis Systems). The equilibrium association constants (KA) of the various photolyases for the dimer-containing substrate were determined by titrating substrate (5 × 10−9m) with enzyme (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control reactions without enzyme were used to calculate the amount of background smearing of the DNA in each gel. The slope of a Eadie-Scatchard plot (ES/St × Ef versus ES/St) of these data yielded −KA (where ES = bound DNA concentration; St = total substrate concentration; and Ef = free enzyme concentration). The binding affinity for nonspecific DNA (KNS) was measured by titrating the enzyme-dimer oligonucleotide complex (70% of substrate bound in the absence of competitor) with cold oligo(dT)18 over the nucleotide concentration range of 1 × 10−4m to 5 × 10−3m. The x intercept of a plot of 1/ES versus concentration of oligo(dT)18 yielded −(1/KNS) (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 100-120Google Scholar). KS, the intrinsic specific association constant of photolyase for the dimer, was determined from the relationshipKobs = KS(1 + [D]KNS) where D= molar concentration of nondimer nucleotides in the 43-bp substrate (9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EachKA, KNS, and active molecule determination was performed at least 3 times. End-labeled double-stranded dimer-containing substrate was ethylated at phosphate groups (19Siebenlist U. Simpson R.B. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) as follows. 100 μl of ethanol saturated with ethylnitrosourea (Sigma) were added to 4 pmol of labeled substrate dissolved in 100 μl of sodium cacodylate (pH 8.0). Following incubation at 50 °C for 1 h, ethylnitrosourea was removed by seven ethanol precipitations in 0.5m CH3CO2NH4 with 25 μg of carrier RNA. The DNA was washed with 95% ethanol after the final precipitation, dissolved in 0.1 mm EDTA, and recovered substrate was quantitated by scintillation counting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, in a volume of 100 μl, were performed using the conditions described above. 5 × 10−9m substrate was incubated with sufficient photolyase to produce 60% binding as judged by EMSA. Following EMSA, the bound and free DNAs were cut out of the gel, and the DNA was eluted by overnight agitation in 0.5 mCH3CO2NH4, 1.0% SDS, filtered through glass wool, extracted with phenol and ether, and precipitated in ethanol. Following a second ethanol precipitation and ethanol wash, the samples were lyophilized to dryness and then suspended in 15 μl of 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA. The DNA was cleaved at ethylated phosphates by addition of 2.5 μl of 1 m NaOH followed by incubation at 90 °C for 30 min. Fifteen μl of urea dye (6 m urea, 0.25% bromphenol blue) were added, and aliquots were loaded onto a 12% denaturing acrylamide gel alongside sequence ladders (A + G) (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9016) Google Scholar). Band intensity was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging System. To account for differences in loading, counts were normalized using as reference a band outside of the photolyase-binding site. The ethylnitrosourea interference pattern for each photolyase was determined twice. Labeled 43-bp dimer-containing substrate was incubated in a volume of 300 μl with a sufficient concentration of wild-type or substituted photolyase to produce greater than 70% binding as measured by EMSA. Following a 20-min incubation in the absence of photoreactivating light, the binding reactions were placed in individual compartments in a 12-well microtiter plate and irradiated with 365 nm light (General Electric BLB) at a fluence rate of 2 J/m2/s (UV Products UV Radiometer with a 365-nm detector). Following each 25 J dose, a 25-μl aliquot was removed and loaded onto an EMSA gel. The amount of repair (increase in free substrate) following each dose was quantitated taking into account the amount of free substrate present prior to photoreactivation. The quantum yield for each photolyase was calculated as described previously (5Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Baer M.E. Sancar G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16717-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the light source was not monochromatic, we have expressed the quantum yield for each enzyme relative to the quantum yield for the wild-type enzyme, rather than as an absolute value. A minimum of two experiments were performed for each photolyase. By using the crystal structure of E. coli photolyase (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) as a starting point, we modeled the structure of yeast Phr1 photolyase over the region encompassing residues 383 through 532 (E. coli photolyase residues 273–422; Figs. 1and 3). The validity of this approach is supported both by the high degree of sequence conservation in these regions of the enzymes (50% identity with no gaps; Fig. 1 and see Ref.15Sancar G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8231-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which suggests a similar fold, and by the results obtained during the modeling. Of the 73 nonidentical residues replaced during modeling, only 6 residues (Phr1 residues 395, 401, 417, 418, 478, and 521) produced steric clashes when modeled using the torsion angles of the equivalent E. coli residue. Each of these residues could, however, be modeled using alternative standard torsion angles. Most of these residues are solvent-exposed and none lie near the proposed DNA binding surface or the flavin-binding site; therefore it is unlikely that an incorrect choice of torsion angle for these residues would affect either the overall accuracy of the model or the structure of either the DNA-binding site or the flavin-binding site. Overall the structures of the enzymes over the modeled region are highly similar to one another (Fig. 3), as well as to the recently solvedAspergillus nidulans photolyase structure (21Tamada T.

The latter enzyme exhibits 70% sequence identity to the E. coliphotolyase within the modeled region (21Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P.M. Miki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Two important results relevant to this study emerged from the modeling of the yeast enzyme. (i) The structure of the flavin-binding site is conserved. Within the modeled region there are 6 amino acids that interact with FAD (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), 5 of which are identical to those found in theE. coli enzyme (Fig. 1). The single amino acid substitution (Trp338(E. coli) → Tyr448(S. cerevisiae)) places the Tyr448 side chain OH within H-bonding distance of the same FAD phosphate contacted by the ring nitrogen of Trp338 (data not shown). Of the seven FAD-contacting residues that lie outside of the modeled region (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), 5 are identical in both enzymes and one of the nonidentical amino acids (Arg236(E. coli) → Gly340(S. cerevisiae)) is predicted to make contact only through backbone substituents. The same substitution occurs in the A. nidulans photolyase structure where the FAD contact is conserved (21Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P.M. Miki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Based upon the conservation of the cofactor-binding site, we conclude that the orientation of FADH− is likewise retained. (ii) The crucial features of the proposed DNA binding surface of the E. coli enzyme (14Park H.-W. Kim S.-T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) are conserved in yeast photolyase (Fig. 3). This conservation is seen most strongly for residues lining the cavity leading from the surface to the flavin chromophore. The three substitutions, Lys383(S. cerevisiae) → Asn273(E. coli), Phe494(S. cerevisiae) → Trp384(E. coli), and Lys330(S. cerevisiae) → Arg226(E. coli), conserve the asymmetric distribution of polar and hydrophobic residues in the cavity. The band of positive electrostatic potential extending out from the cavity is also conserved and is augmented by several substitut"

Shephard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). Most cells in the animal body have type 1 IGF receptors (IGF-IR) and require the activation of this receptor by its ligands for optimal growth, both in vivo (2Liu J-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 3Baker J. Liu J.-P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A.

Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The requirement for IGF-I is especially evident with mouse and human fibroblasts, where it combines with other growth factors (for instance, platelet-derived growth factor) in stimulating growth of cells under defined conditions (serum-free medium). Singly, these growth factors cannot stimulate the growth of normal fibroblasts, like 3T3 cells (5Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades N.H. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 3Baker J. Liu J.-P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). R− cells have been extensively used in the past years to study the role of the IGF-IR in mitogenesis, transformation, and apoptosis (see the editorial in Ref. 8Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2645-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). R− cells do not grow in serum-free medium supplemented with the growth factors that are known to sustain the growth of other 3T3 cells, with a physiological number of IGF-IRs (1Scher C.D. Shephard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). Singly or in combination, the following growth factors failed to stimulate the growth of R− cells: platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, IGF-I and II, insulin, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor, TGFα, TGFβ, and hepatocyte growth factor (7Sell C.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3777-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In fact, even R− cells overexpressing either the epidermal growth factor receptor (11Coppola D. Ferber A. Miura M. Sell C. D'Ambrosio C. Rubin R. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4588-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (12DeAngelis T. Ferber A. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) are unresponsive to their respective growth factors, indicating a central role of the IGF-IR in fibroblast growth. Reintroduction of a wild type IGF-IR promptly restores the growth deficits of R− cells (6Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, the fact that R− cells grow in 10% serum clearly indicates that serum contains one or more growth factors that bypass the requirement for IGFs. R− cells also grow in medium conditioned by certain (but not all) cell lines (9Xu S.Q. Sell C. DuBois G.C. Baserga R. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In previous papers (9Xu S.Q. Sell C. DuBois G.C. Baserga R. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 13Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we reported that the conditioned medium of BRL-3A cells stimulated the growth of R− cells. The partial fractionation of a growth-stimulating polypeptide derived from BRL-3A cells was reported by Xu et al. (9Xu S.Q. Sell C. DuBois G.C. Baserga R. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The growth factor has now been identified as the granulin/epithelin precursor (14Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Byles C. Todaro G.J. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Bhandari V. Palfree R.G. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by high accuracy peptide mass mapping with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), followed by data base searching with a set of measured peptide masses. Further evidence for its identity was provided by sequence analysis of a peptide by Edman degradation after purification by reverse phase chromatography. Given the central role of the activated IGF-IR in the growth of cells in vivo andin vitro (see above), the identification of the granulin/epithelin precursor as a growth factor that bypasses the requirement for IGFs can be of considerable interest to the many investigators in the field of IGFs and IGF-binding proteins and of cell proliferation in general.DISCUSSIONWe have purified, partially sequenced, and identified a polypeptide from BRL-3A conditioned medium that stimulates DNA synthesis (and growth in number) of R− cells that are null for the IGF-IR (6Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This growth factor has been identified as the granulin/epithelin precursor (14Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Byles C. Todaro G.J. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Bhandari V. Palfree R.G. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Bhandari V. Giaid A. Bateman A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The identification of the granulin/epithelin precursor as a growth factor that bypasses the requirement for a functional IGF-IR is of considerable interest for several reasons: 1) The IGF-IR plays a major role in the growth of cells, both in vivo and in vitro (see Introduction), but clearly its requirement is not an absolute one, because it can be circumvented by a single purified growth factor. 2) Although epithelins are produced also by normal tissues (see below), in cells in culture they are predominantly expressed by transformed cell lines that can grow in serum-free medium. This raises the question whether the expression of epithelins may also be involved in transformation. 3) The IGF-IR shares with other growth factor receptors the main mitogenic pathway (commonly referred to as the raspathway). However, the discovery of a purified growth factor that bypasses this pathway opens the possibility of identifying a new mitogenic pathway that is presumably ras-independent (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). 4) One can also predict the usefulness of the granulin/epithelin precursor in studies dealing with the inhibitory action of IGF-binding proteins, because stimulation of cell proliferation could be achieved in the absence of IGFs.Epithelins were originally purified from rat kidney as two small single chain peptides (approximately 6 kDa) containing about 20% cysteine (14Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Byles C. Todaro G.J. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Epithelin1 stimulated the proliferation of murine keratinocytes, whereas epithelin2 had inhibitory potential (14Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Byles C. Todaro G.J. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Neubauer M.G. Buckley S.D. McDonald V.L. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13073-13078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At about the same time, the same peptides were isolated from leukocytes and termed granulins (26Bateman A. Belcourt D. Bennett H. Lazure C. Solomon S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Bhandari et al. (15Bhandari V. Palfree R.G. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) cloned the granulin precursor cDNA and reported that the prepropeptide of the human granulins is a 593-residue glycoprotein containing seven tandem repeats of the 12-cysteine granulin domain. The human granulin/epithelin gene codes for at least four small epithelin peptides (27Bhandari V. Bateman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to granulin A and B, an additional peptide, granulin F, which had never been isolated before but whose primary structure is known on the basis of the cDNA sequence, was isolated from human urine (28Sparro G. Galdenzi G. Eleuteri A.M. Angeletti M. Schroeder W. Fioretti E. Protein Express. Purif. 1997; 10: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rat granulin precursor codes for 589 amino acid residues (BRL-3A cells are from rat liver) and is 72% homologous to the human granulin precursor and 87% homologous to the mouse granulin precursor (16Bhandari V. Giaid A. Bateman A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Neubauer M.G. Buckley S.D. McDonald V.L. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13073-13078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of the epithelins has been reported by Belcourt et al. (29Belcourt D.R. Lazure C. Bennett H.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9230-9237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the granulin/epithelin protein motif has an unusual structure consisting of a parallel stack of β-hairpins stapled together by six disulfide bonds (30Hrabal R. Chen Z. James S. Bennett H.P.J. Ni F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The granulin gene has an unusual genomic structure containing 12 exons interrupted by 11 introns mapped to chromosome 17 in human and 13 exons interrupted by 12 introns mapped to chromosome 11 in mouse, respectively (15Bhandari V. Palfree R.G. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Baba T. Nemoto H. Watanabe K. Arai Y. Gerton G.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Bucan M. Gatalica B. Baba T. Gerton G.L. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A putative promoter has also been characterized at the 5′ end of the granulin gene (33Bhandari V. Daniel R. Lim P.S. Bateman A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The granulin gene is conserved widely in species, suggesting a possibly widespread growth regulatory function (30Hrabal R. Chen Z. James S. Bennett H.P.J. Ni F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Although granulin/epithelins have been usually tested as the small peptides, Zhou et al. (34Zhou J. Gao G. Crabb J.W. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10863-10869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified the precursor protein and showed that it was, by itself, a mitogen for cells in culture. We are now showing that the granulin/epithelin precursor is mitogenic per se, in fact that it can stimulate DNA synthesis (and growth, see Ref.9Xu S.Q. Sell C. DuBois G.C. Baserga R. Cell Prolif. 1997; 30: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in serum-free medium in R− cells that are known to be refractory to stimulation by other purified growth factors, singly or in combination. Interestingly, Zhou et al. (34Zhou J. Gao G. Crabb J.W. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10863-10869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified the granulin/epithelin precursor from an “insulin-independent” cell line. Because insulin in tissue cultures is generally used at concentrations that activate the IGF-IR (35Flier J.S. Usher P. Moses A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), their observation is an indirect confirmation of our observation that the granulin/epithelin precursor bypasses the requirement for the IGF-IR. The stimulatory activity of the precursor, in respect to the small epithelins, may be due to the fact that the small epithelins are a mixture of stimulatory and inhibitory peptides (14Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Byles C. Todaro G.J. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Neubauer M.G. Buckley S.D. McDonald V.L. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13073-13078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our active polypeptide was inactivated by a denaturing gel. This was not surprising, given the large number of cysteine residues in the sequence (see above); furthermore, structural evidence indicated the importance of proper formation of intra-chain disulfide bonds of the granulin/epithelin (30Hrabal R. Chen Z. James S. Bennett H.P.J. Ni F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Finally, epithelin-binding sites have been found in human breast carcinoma cells (36Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10458-10462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, no further information on a putative receptor has been made available. A 170–175-kDa protein has been reported (37Parnell P.G. Carter B.J. Halper J. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that binds the epithelial-type transforming growth factor (TGFe), and this growth factor is partially homologous to, but distinct from, the granulin/epithelins (33Bhandari V. Daniel R. Lim P.S. Bateman A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Parnell P.G. Wunderlich J. Carter B. Halper J. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This TGFe-specific receptor with a size of approximately 170–175 kDa (37Parnell P.G. Carter B.J. Halper J. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is presumably different from the putative receptor for granulin/epithelin, a membrane protein of 140–145 kDa (36Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10458-10462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is worth mentioning that SDS-PAGE of proteins in fractions 34 and 35 corresponding to the first active peak in Fig. 2 showed a single band of about 25–28 kDa by silver stain (data not shown). Whether it is a TGFe or a processed granulin/epithelin or another factor remains to be established. BRL-3A conditioned medium is rich in growth-stimulating activities (39Hylka V.W. Teplow D.B. Kent S.B.H. Straus D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14417-14420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hylka V.W. Straus D.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 1990; 63: 195-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), including IGF-II, originally identified as multiplication stimulating activity (17Dulak N.C. Temin H.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1973; 81: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IGF-II, however, cannot stimulate DNA synthesis in R− cells, even at concentrations up to 200 ng/ml (10Morrione A. Valentinis B. Xu S.-Q. Yumet G. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3777-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and, in addition, the size of IGF-II is much smaller than the size of the growth factor we have purified. It is likely that there are other growth factors in the BRL-3A conditioned medium that can stimulate growth of R−cells. The one we have purified and identified is the granulin/epithelin precursor.The identification of the granulin/epithelin precursor as a growth factor that bypasses the requirement for an activated IGF-IR is, in our opinion, important, both from a basic and an applied point of view (see above). The IGF-IR is found in many cell types and, as mentioned in the Introduction, is necessary for the optimal growth of cells in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, down-regulation of the IGF-IR causes massive apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo, whereas overexpression causes transformation and protection from apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 4Baserga R. Hongo A Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The granulin/epithelin family could then become a target in those tumor cells that have escaped regulation by the IGF-IR. At a more basic level, our finding raises some interesting questions, for instance, whether the granulin/epithelin peptides use and, so to speak, usurp the IGF-IR signaling pathway(s), or whether they induce mitogenicity (and/or transformation) by a totally different pathway. This problem is being actively investigated, but our preliminary results shown in Fig. 5 clearly indicate that MAP kinases are activated, but IRS-1 is not. Thus, the pathway stimulated by the granulin/epithelin precursor does not seem to be dependent on IRS-1 and is therefore different from the IGF-IR mitogenic pathway, which is heavily dependent on IRS-1 (reviewed in Ref. 4Baserga R. Hongo A Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this pathway connects again with one of the main pathways for stimulation of DNA synthesis, which passes through the MAP kinases. A considerable amount of evidence has accumulated, indicating a crucial role of MAP kinases in the stimulation of DNA synthesis by either growth factors or integrins or simply attachment to the substratum (23Schlaepfer D.D.

Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), which is usually correlated with stimulation of DNA synthesis. Thus it seems that the granulin/epithelin precursor bypasses the IRS-1 mitogenic pathway but eventually joins the mitogenic pathway that is common to many growth factors and mitogenic stimuli (23Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 42Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The question now is where the granulin/epithelin pathway reinserts itself into the main mitogenic pathway, downstream from IRS-1. At present, the only clue we have is that a plasmid expressing the human granulin/epithelin precursor (courtesy of Dr. Bateman) can make R− cells grow in serum-free medium, a property that, so far, is shared only by v-src (13Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that src may be involved in granulin/epithelin signaling. The connection between c-src and MAP kinases has been elucidated recently by Schlaepfer et al. (23Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and the src pathway may therefore be a prime candidate for further studies. However, the complexities of the mitogenic signaling pathways is such that several options must be kept open, especially in view of the fact that no receptor for the granulin/epithelin precursor has yet been cloned. The R− cells expressing the granulin/epithelin precursor are now being investigated in detail for their growth phenotype, including transformation and ability to protect cells from apoptosis and the ability to process the precursor and their signaling potentials. It has been known for several years that the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and -II) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-IRtype 1 IGF receptorTGFtransforming growth factorTGFeepithelial-type TGFMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electorphoresisMAPmitogen-activated protein.1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-IRtype 1 IGF receptorTGFtransforming growth factorTGFeepithelial-type TGFMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electorphoresisMAPmitogen-activated protein. play a central role in the growth of cells in culture (reviewed in Ref. 1Scher C.D. Shephard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). Most cells in the animal body have type 1 IGF receptors (IGF-IR) and require the activation of this receptor by its ligands for optimal growth, both in vivo (2Liu J-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S.

The requirement for IGF-I is especially evident with mouse and human fibroblasts, where it combines with other growth factors (for instance, platelet-derived growth factor) in stimulating growth of cells under defined conditions (serum-free medium). Singly, these growth factors cannot stimulate the growth of normal fibroblasts, like 3T3 cells (5Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades N.H. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). R− cells have been extensively used in the past years to study the role of the IGF-IR in mitogenesis, transformation, and apoptosis (see the editorial in Ref. 8Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2645-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). R− cells do not grow in serum-free medium supplemented with the growth factors that are known to sustain the growth of other 3T3 cells, with a physiological number of IGF-IRs (1Scher C.D. Shephard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). Singly or in combination, the following growth factors failed to stimulate the growth of R− cells: platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, IGF-I and II, insulin, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor, TGFα, TGFβ, and hepatocyte growth factor (7Sell C.

Ornithine decarboxylase is a key regulatory enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, and precise regulation of the expression of this enzyme is required, according to cellular growth state.

Both activation and inhibition of ODC activity is required for precise regulation of ODC levels. A broad spectrum of stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, tumor promoters and oncogenes elevates ODC activity in the cell. In most cases, these increases in activity result from enhanced levels of ODC mRNA (6Abrahamsen M.S. Morris D.R. Campisi J. Cunningham D.D. Inouye M. Riley M. Perspectives on Cellular Regulation: From Bacteria to Cancer. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 107-119Google Scholar, 7Law G.L. Li R.S. Morris D.R. Casero R.J. Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 5-26Google Scholar). Several of the DNA elements and protein factors involved in both basal and stimulated activity of the ODC promoter have been identified, including several binding sites for transcription factor Sp1, two binding sites for members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, and binding sites for transcription factors related to c-myc (7Law G.L. Li R.S. Morris D.R. Casero R.J. Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 5-26Google Scholar). Little is known about DNA elements or protein factors that are involved in repressing ODC transcription. A GC-rich region located at −123 to −91 relative to the transcriptional start site of the ODC promoter seems to be such an element. We have demonstrated that two proteins bind this site in a mutually exclusive manner, Sp1 and NF-ODC1 (19Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 is a well characterized transcription factor that is found in most eukaryotic cell and is directly involved in both basal and induced expression of many genes. NF-ODC1 has been characterized only through in vitro binding assays. Point mutations that eliminate NF-ODC1 binding, but maintain Sp1 binding, elevate basal activity relative to the wild type promoter (19Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that NF-ODC1 functions to repress the transcriptional activity of the ODC gene. The goal of the present study was to identify the protein responsible for NF-ODC1 binding activity. We have used a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate cDNAs that code for NF-ODC1. One of the isolated cDNAs encoded the human homologue of ZBP-89, a known DNA-binding protein that acts to repress both basal and induced expression of the gastrin gene (20Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence, including copurification, demonstrate that ZBP-89 is the protein responsible for the NF-ODC1 binding activity. ZBP-89 represses Sp1 activation of the ODC promoter in Schneider'sDrosophila line 2 (SL2) cells, consistent with properties previously attributed to NF-ODC1. The human Jurkat T-cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2 mml-glutamine on 150-mm culture dishes. Jurkat cells were grown in 6-liter spinner flasks from which nuclear extracts were prepared for NF-ODC1 purification. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) and 10% calf serum. SL2 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown at 27o, in Shield and Sang M3 insect medium, pH 6.6 (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum, heat-inactivated (Sigma; catalog no. F-3018). All media contained 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared as outlined in Ref.21Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Phosphatase inhibitors Na2MoO4 and NaF were added to all buffers at 0.1 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The high salt buffer contained 1.2 m KCl. The following protease inhibitors were added to the buffers immediately before use, at the indicated final concentrations: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and antipain (5 μg/ml). The nuclear extract was not dialyzed, but stored in appropriate sized aliquots at −70 °C until use. Binding reactions (final volume 20 μl) contained in addition to the protein sample: 0.1 pmol of probe, 200–300 mm KCl, 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), and 1.0 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA in gel shift buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm ZnSO4). In experiments utilizing unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides as specific competitors, the protein was added to the reaction after the DNA. Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C before loading on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 37.5:1, 0.5× Tris-borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer (TBE: 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA), 5% glycerol, 3-mm-thick gel) that had been pre-run for 1 h. After running in the cold room at 200 V in 0.5× TBE for 4–6 h and drying, the gel was exposed to film with an intensifying screen for several hours to 2 days as necessary. The probes (1.0–0.5 × 105 cpm/μl and 0.05 pmol/μl) were made by end-labeling double-stranded oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. NICK® spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to remove non-incorporated isotope. When required, phosphorimage analysis was performed to quantitate signal intensities. Slightly different conditions were used to assay for MAZ binding: 10 μl of 2× MAZ gel shift buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2% glycerol, 1 μm ZnSO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) were used per 20-μl reaction, and double-stranded poly(dA-dT) was used instead of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. The gels were run in 0.25× TBE at 200 V for 8 h. The MAZ antibody was kindly provided by Kenneth B. Marcu (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). In “supershift” experiments, the antibody was added to reaction mixtures containing protein, but no probe. The antibody-protein solution was incubated for 1- 3 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of the probe and an additional incubation at 4 °C for 20 min before loading the binding reaction onto the gel. Control peptides or antigens were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies prior to use in the binding reactions. The antibodies and control peptides for the Sp1 family of proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that included amino acids 1–521 of rat ZBP-89 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) (23Taniuchi T. Mortensen E.R. Ferguson A. Greenson J. Merchant J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Anti-ZBP-89 was the IgG fraction from the rabbit antisera. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Shown are the upper strand sequences for the double-stranded oligonucleotides used.

The MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System from CLONTECH was one method used to isolate the cDNA encoding for the protein responsible for the NF-ODC1 binding activity. The MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System protocol was used to prepare the target-reporter constructs, to integrate these constructs intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strainYM4271, to screen the AD fusion library (Human Leukemia MATCHMAKER cDNA Library,CLONTECH), and to isolate plasmid from each candidate clone. Two pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized (Genset, La Jolla, CA). When annealed, the double-stranded oligonucleotides consisted of either three tandem copies of the wild type NF-ODC1 binding site or three tandem copies of a mutated NF-ODC1 binding site. Wild type oligonucleotides: 5′-AATTCAGCCCCTCCCCCGAAGCCCCTCCCCCGATAGCCCCTCCCCCGTCTAGAGCTACGAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTCGTAGCTCTAGACGGGGGAGGGGCTATCGGGGGAGGGGCTTCGGGGGAGGGGCTG-3′. Mutated oligonucleotides: 5′-AATTCAGCCCCTCCCAAGAAGCCCCTCCCAAGATAGCCCCTCCCAAGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGACTTGGGAGGGGCTATCTTGGGAGGGGCTTCTTGGGAGGGGCTG-3′. The wild type target site was placed upstream of both the pHis-1 and pLacZi plasmids. The mutated target site was place upstream of pHis-1. The target-reporter constructs were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain YM4271. The two wild type reporter constructs (pHis-1 and pLacZi) were transformed in a consecutive manner to produce a dual reporter strain. The plasmid DNA, isolated from the yeast candidate clones, was transformed into DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformed bacteria and transformed into the strain containing the mutated target reporter. The Gene Trapper™ cDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a Superscript™ cDNA human leukocyte library (Life Technologies, Inc.) was also used to isolate ZBP-89 cDNAs using the following primers from the NH2-terminal domain of htβ: HTB-1, 5′-TCAAGATCGAAGTATGCCTCAC-3′; HTB-2, 5′-GCTCTGAGGAAGATTCTGGGC-3′; and HTB-3A, 5′-TGCCTTCTGAGTCCAGTAAAG-3′. In vitro coupled transcription/translation reactions were performed using the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The pET-human ZBP-89 expression vector was constructed by inserting the BamHI/BglII fragment from positive clones into the BamHI site of the pET-3b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The MAZ expression vector, MAZHH, (provided by Kenneth B. Marcu, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) was used for thein vitro transcription/translation of MAZ. The unmodified pBKCMV (control vector), pBKCMV containing the full-length rat ZBP-89 cDNA or pBKCMV containing the truncated rat ZBP-89 cDNA (designated B22) as described by Merchant et al. (20Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell.

The resulting pellet was resuspended in CB (25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 100 μm ZnSO4, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The redissolved protein extract was applied to a P6 (Bio-Rad) desalting column (equilibrated in CB buffer) to remove remaining (NH4)2SO4. The protein fraction from the P6 column was applied to a Mono Q column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), pre-equilibrated in CB, and the bound proteins were eluted using a 0–500 mm KCl gradient in CB. The NF-ODC1binding activity eluted at approximately 350 mm KCl. The fractions containing NF-ODC1 were pooled, diluted to 100 mm KCl with DA buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol ,and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and applied to a DNA affinity column (see below), and the NF-ODC1 activity was eluted from the column with DA buffer containing 600 mm KCl. The following protease inhibitors were added to CB and DA buffers immediately before use, at the indicated final concentrations: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and antipain (5 μg/ml). The DNA affinity column matrix was made using double-stranded oligonucleotide, GCN (Fig. 1), in which the upper strand was biotinylated at the 5′ end (Genset, La Jolla, CA). The biotinylated GCN was coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (75 μg of DNA/500 μl of agarose bead) using the procedure and buffers outlined by Ostrowski and Bomsztyk (24Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1045-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). EMSAs using GCN as probe were using during this procedure to determine the NF-ODC1-containing protein fractions. For immunoblot analysis, protein samples were fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PolyScreen, NEN™ Life Science Products) using standard techniques and a mini-gel format. Phototope®-HRP Western blot detection kit and protocol (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) were used for antigen detection. Anti-ZBP-89 (1:1000) was used as the primary antibody. Band intensities were quantitated by densitometry. SL2 cells were transfected using a modification of a previously described method (25Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1–2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish, approximately 20 h before transfection. Calcium-phosphate complexes were made by the dropwise addition of the DNA/CaCl2 solution into 2× Hepes-buffered saline while bubbling the mixture. After 20 min at room temperature, the suspension of calcium-phosphate complexes was added dropwise to the culture dishes. The following plasmids were used. γF-gal is an internal control plasmid in which the E. coliβ-galactosidase gene is under the control of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 core promoter (26Contursi C.

The pPacSp1 expression plasmid and the parental pPac plasmid, pPacO, have been described previously (27Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA). The pOD150WTLuc construct contained the ODC sequence from −133 to +16 in the pGL2-basic vector (Promega, WI) with a modified multiple cloning site. Twenty base pairs (−104 to −84) were removed from pOD150WTLuc with a method for site-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction as outlined by Hemsley et al. The sequences of the two primers used were: 5′-AGGGGCGGGGACTCCGTG-3′ and 5′- AACCGATCGCGGCTGGTT-3′. The resulting construct, pOD150M12Luc, retained the entire Sp1 binding site but only 6 out of 11 base pairs of the ZBP-89 binding site. BCAT-S was created by cutting BCAT-1 (29Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) with PstI and SalI to removing the HTLVIII LTR Sp1 binding site. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ODC Sp1 binding site withPstI and SalI ends was inserted. The sequence of the annealed oligonucleotides were: 5′-GCGGATGCCCCGCCCCGATG-3′ and 5′-TCGACATCGGGGCGGGGCATCCGCTGCA-3′. The Sp1 binding site is underlined. The modified pBKCMV vector and the modified pBKCMV vector containing rat ZBP-89 cDNA (pBKCMV-ZBP-89) have been described previously (20Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R.

To each 60-mm dish, 0.1 μg of γF-gal, 5 μg of pOD150WTLuc, and 0.1–0.75 μg of expression vectors were added. The control vectors pPacO and modified pBKCMV were used to keep the total amount of DNA constant. The medium was not changed before or after the addition of DNA complexes, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Generally, 5 μl of cell lysate were used in the Galacto-Light™ β-galactosidase assay (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) and 50 μl of lysate were used to determine the luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (30Brasier A.R.

The luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and each transfection was done in triplicate. Nuclear extract was harvested, as described above, from SL2 cells transfected with 16 μg of pBKCMV-ZBP-89 and 11 μg of pPacSp1 per 150-mm dish. EMSAs were performed with SL2 nuclear extract using the same protocol as described for Jurkat nuclear extract. We have used EMSAs as a tool to further characterize and identify the protein responsible for the DNA binding activity we called NF-ODC1. Fig. 1 shows the sequence of the −123 to −91 GC box in the proximal promoter in the ODC gene that contains both the Sp1 and NF-ODC1 binding sites and also the sequences of four double-stranded oligonucleotides that we used as probes and competitors in several of the EMSAs detailed in this study. GCWT contained the sequence of the wild type GC box. In GCWT6, the wild type sequence was altered so that Sp1 binding to the oligonucleotide was greatly reduced, but NF-ODC1 binding was unaltered. GCN (formerly ODC543; see Ref. 19Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained only the NF-ODC1 binding site, which also had low affinity for Sp1 (see below). GCS(formerly ODC53; see Ref. 19Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained only the Sp1 binding site and did not interact with NF-ODC1. When radiolabeled GCWT was incubated with Jurkat nuclear extracts, a complex band shift pattern resulted (Fig.2 A, lane 2). We previously showed that the first complex (C1) was due to Sp1 binding and the third complex (C3) was the result of NF-ODC1binding (19Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were two other specific DNA-protein complexes, C2 and C4, in which the identity of the protein component was unknown. When radiolabeled GCS was used as probe, Sp1, C2, and C4 complexes were detected, but there was no NF-ODC1 complex (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and7). When GCS was used as an unlabeled competitor, no Sp1, C2, or C4 complexes were seen, indicating that GCS had high affinity for Sp1 and the proteins in C2 and C4 (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). GCS did not compete for NF-ODC1 binding (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5). When needed, GCS was used in EMSAs as an unlabeled competitor to unambiguously identify the NF-ODC1-containing complex. Using either radioactive GCWT or GCS probe, unlabeled GCN also competed for binding to Sp1 and the proteins in C2 and C4 complexes, albeit less efficiently than GCWT at 30-fold molar excess or GCS at 50-fold molar excess (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 3–5 and also lanes 8–10). These results indicated that Sp1 not only had the capacity to bind with high affinity to the Sp1 consensus site found in the wild type ODC promoter sequence, GCWT, but also interacted at lower affinity with the NF-ODC1 site. GCN competed efficiently with GCWT for formation of the NF-ODC1 complex (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4), indicating that GCN bound to NF-ODC1 with relatively high affinity. As needed, radiolabeled GCN was used as probe in EMSAs, which resulted in significantly reduced band intensities for C2, C4, and Sp1 complexes (compare Fig. 2 A, lane 2with Fig. 3 A, lane 2).Figure 3Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 bind to the GC box of the ODC promoter. Supershift experiments were performed as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The indicated antibody was added to the binding reaction containing Jurkat nuclear extract, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C followed by an additional 20-min incubation with 0.1 pmol of the indicated probe. SSindicates the location of supershifted bands. The location of complexes containing Sp1, C1b, C2, C4, and NF-ODC1 are indicated. A, GCN was used as probe; 10 μg/lane Jurkat nuclear extract and 1 μg of each indicated antibody was used as indicated. B, GCWT was used as probe and the binding reactions contained either 5 (lanes 2–7) or 2.5 μg of total protein/lane (lanes 8 and 9) of Jurkat nuclear extract. Lane 1 contained no protein. Additional reagents were added to some of the binding reactions:lanes 3–9, 30-fold molar excess of GCWT6; lanes 4–9, 1 μg of anti-Sp1; lanes 5, 6, and 7 contained 1, 2, and 1 μg of anti-Sp4 respectively; lane 7, 1.2 μg of Sp4 control peptide (P4); lanes 8 and 9, 0.1 μg of anti-Sp3; lane 9, 1 μg of Sp3 control peptide (P3). All reactions were run on the same gel and exposed to film for same length of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DNA binding domains of many proteins that bind to GC-rich regions contain zinc finger motifs. To determine if the interaction between NF-ODC1 and DNA required zinc, EMSAs were performed with the zinc chelator, o-phenanthroline. To eliminate the radioactive bands of C1, C2, and C4, unlabeled GCS was added to each binding reaction. Increasing the amount of zinc chelator resulted in decreasing amounts of the NF-ODC1 complex (Fig.2 B). When zinc was added back to the reaction, in the form of Zn2SO4, NF-ODC1 binding was restored. These results indicate that NF-ODC1 binding is dependent on the presence of zinc. To determine if the complexes formed with the GC-box contained known members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors, specific antibodies were employed (Fig. 3). Antibodies to Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 were added separately to binding reactions containing GCN as probe and Jurkat nuclear extract (Fig. 3 A). As expected, NF-ODC1 binds strongly to this probe, while Sp1 gives a weak signal. GCS was used as an unlabeled competitor to eliminate Sp1 binding and to identify the NF-ODC1 complex (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Binding of NF-ODC1was not inhibited by any of these antibodies (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 2 with lanes 4–7). The Sp1 band was supershifted as expected when the Sp1 antibody was used (Fig.3 A, lane 7).

Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,2Nichol C.H. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BH4 is synthesized from GTP by three enzymes (2Nichol C.H. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BH4 is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of catecholamines; tryptophan hydroxylase, the first enzyme of the biosynthesis of serotonin; phenylalanine hydroxylase, the main enzyme of phenylalanine metabolism; and nitric-oxide synthase (2Nichol C.H. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of BH4is thought to be tightly regulated with regard to the activities of those enzymes because the intracellular levels of BH4 are at or below the saturating levels for those enzymes (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of the regulation, the molecular mechanisms are still unknown. A major advance in our understanding of this issue has been made by our identification of the regulatory protein GFRP (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The discovery of GFRP and its effects on GTP cyclohydrolase I revealed how the biosynthesis of BH4 is linked to the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the presence of GFRP, BH4inhibits the enzyme activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I, and the inhibition is reversed by phenylalanine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine thus stimulate the biosynthesis of BH4to fill the cofactor requirement of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the activity of which is known to be also stimulated by phenylalanine (4Kaufman S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These mechanisms provide the explanation at a molecular level of several in vivo phenomena about the close relationship between the levels of BH4 and phenylalanine that were observed in normal individuals and patients with phenylketonuria (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,5Leeming R.J. Blair J.A. Green A. Raine D.N. Arch. Dis.

Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is a 300-kDa multimer composed of identical subunits with a subunit molecular mass of 25 kDa (8Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its exact number of subunits has not yet been determined. Rat GFRP has been recently purified and cloned (10Milstien S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GFRP is a pentamer of identical subunits with a subunit molecular mass of 9.5 kDa (11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The regulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I by GFRP occurs through ligand-induced complex formation between these two proteins, which is reversible (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We showed by using an activity assay that GFRP is associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I both in the presence of BH4 and GTP and in the presence of phenylalanine, whereas no protein complex is formed in the absence of these ligand molecules. In particular, both GTP and BH4 are required for formation of the inhibitory protein complex, whereas phenylalanine alone is sufficient for formation of the stimulatory protein complex (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phenylalanine reduces the positive cooperativity of GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GFRP (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, detailed information regarding complex formation is lacking. We accordingly established a gel filtration method for analyzing complex formation. In this paper, we characterize the stoichiometry of both types of complexes and the ligand specificity for complex formation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSubunit Number of Rat GTP Cyclohydrolase IEscherichia coli GTP cyclohydrolase I was shown to be a decamer by crystallographic studies (17Nar H. Huber R. Meining W. Schmid C. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. Structure. 1995; 3: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Considering the high sequence similarity betweenE. coli (18Katzenmeier G. Schmid C. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Bacher A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and rat (9Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) GTP cyclohydrolase I and their similar native molecular weights (8Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nar H. Huber R. Meining W. Schmid C. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. Structure. 1995; 3: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that rat GTP cyclohydrolase I also was a decamer. To determine the subunit number of GTP cyclohydrolase I, we performed cross-linking experiments using dimethyl suberimidate, a homobifunctional imidoester that is able to cross-link lysine residues. The cross-linking reagent was used at a variety of concentrations to obtain proteins cross-linked to variable extents. The cross-linked proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under the conditions established by Weber and Osborn (13Weber K. Osborn M. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Academic Press, New York1975: 179-223Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, significant intersubunit cross-linking of GTP cyclohydrolase I was obtained at a dimethyl suberimidate concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. As higher concentrations of dimethyl suberimidate were used, the protein was further cross-linked. At a dimethyl suberimidate concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, the proteins were almost completely cross-linked and converged to one species with a molecular mass of 280 kDa. When the estimated molecular masses of the protein species found in the gel were plotted against subunit number, a linear relationship was obtained, and the number of the largest species was 10. This finding demonstrates that GTP cyclohydrolase I is a decamer.Inhibitory Complex FormationDose Dependence of GFRP for Its BH4-dependent Inhibitory Action on GTP Cyclohydrolase I ActivityTo determine the amount of GFRP required to totally inhibit GTP cyclohydrolase I, we examined the effect of varying amounts of GFRP on the activity of a fixed amount of GTP cyclohydrolase I (0.23 μm) in the presence of a saturating concentration of BH4 (Fig.2). Because the Kdvalue for the association between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I is in the nanomolar range (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the concentrations used were saturating for formation of the protein complex. As shown in Fig. 2, the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I was inhibited in a GFRP dose-dependent manner and became totally inhibited when the GFRP concentration was above 0.25 μm. This result indicates that the same number of GFRP as GTP cyclohydrolase I in terms of subunits is necessary and sufficient for total inhibition of the enzyme activity. Because GFRP is a pentamer (11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and GTP cyclohydrolase I is a decamer as shown above, this finding indicates that two molecules of GFRP are required for the total inhibition of one molecule of GTP cyclohydrolase I.Figure 2Effect of varying concentrations of GFRP subunits on GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the presence of BH4 and GTP. The assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase I subunit was 0.23 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Stoichiometry of the Inhibitory Complex Formation between GTP Cyclohydrolase I and GFRPThe kinetic experiments suggested that two molecules of GFRP were associated with one molecule of GTP cyclohydrolase I. To physically determine the number of GFRP associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I, we used a gel filtration method by which the complex was separated from free GFRP.It should be noted that, when each protein was separately filtered through the resin in the presence of either or both BH4 and GTP (data not shown), both proteins eluted from the gel resin at the same volume as those in the absence of ligands (Fig.3, A1 and A2), indicating that these ligands induced neither dissociation into subunits of smaller number nor further association of each multimer. Thus, GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I are stable in terms of subunit assembly under the gel filtration conditions used. These properties of the proteins made the gel filtration experiments feasible for assessing complex formation.Figure 3Gel filtration analysis of the complex formed between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GTP and BH4 (A) and phenylalanine (B). GFRP (0.8 nmol) (A1 and B1), GTP cyclohydrolase I (0.8 nmol) (A2 and B2), or a mixture of GTP cyclohydrolase I (0.8 nmol) and GFRP (0.4, 0.8, and 1.4 nmol forA3–5 and B3–5, respectively) was separated on a TSK G3000SWXL column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The equilibration buffer contained 20 μmBH4 and 200 μm GTP (A) and 1 mm phenylalanine (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We titrated GTP cyclohydrolase I with GFRP in the presence of 20 μm BH4 and 200 μm GTP. No protein complex was formed in the absence of BH4 and GTP or even in the presence of either of the two ligands under these experimental conditions (data not shown). In the presence of BH4 and GTP, by contrast, the peak height of GTP cyclohydrolase I increased gradually as the amount of GFRP added increased (Fig. 3 A). The peak height increased continuously until the moles (subunit) of GFRP equaled those of GTP cyclohydrolase I and then leveled off. GFRP did not elute as a free form until the molar amount of GFRP exceeded that of GTP cyclohydrolase I.These observed alternations of the two peaks in the chromatograms were more evident when the heights of both peaks were plotted against the amount of GFRP added (Fig.4 A1). When the number of GFRP subunits equaled that of GTP cyclohydrolase I subunits, GFRP saturated GTP cyclohydrolase I. Therefore, we concluded that two molecules of a pentameric GFRP were associated physically with one molecule of a decameric GTP cyclohydrolase I. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion derived from the kinetic data described above. The elution position of the complex changed little from that of free GTP cyclohydrolase I; consequently, these two species were not distinguished on the chromatograms. Thus, the peak assigned to the complex in the plot contained both free GTP cyclohydrolase I and the complex between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I, but this apparently does not affect the conclusion.Figure 4Estimation of the amount of GFRP associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GTP and BH4(A) and phenylalanine (B). A1and B1, peak heights of protein eluted at 7 min (open circles) and 11 min (closed circles) (see Fig. 3) were plotted against the amount of GFRP applied to the gel resin. A2 and B2, shown is a plot of corrected values of A610 for dye eluted from the gel bands corresponding to GFRP shown in Fig. 5 (forA2, but data not shown for B2) versusthe amount of GFRP applied to gel filtration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further verify this conclusion, we measured by gel electrophoresis the amounts of each protein species that were contained in the peaks eluted at 7 min. As shown in Fig. 5, when proteins contained in the peak were separated by gel electrophoresis, we observed that the amount of GFRP contained in those fractions increased until it became equimolar with GTP cyclohydrolase I and then leveled off. To estimate the amounts of each protein species in the gel, we cut the stained protein bands out of the gel, eluted the dye bound to the proteins, and measured the amount of eluted dye by its absorbance. As shown in Fig. 4 A2, the amount of GFRP associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I increased linearly and leveled off at the same molar amount as that of GTP cyclohydrolase I. This result is consistent with the conclusion derived from the chromatograms. Furthermore, we quantitated each protein species by comparing the amount of eluted dye from the samples with that from varying amounts of standard GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I. We observed that 1 mol of GFRP subunit was associated with each mole of GTP cyclohydrolase I subunit for the samples derived from the complex in which GFRP saturated GTP cyclohydrolase I (data not shown).Behavior of the Complex on Gel FiltrationAs described above, the elution volume of the complex from a TSK G3000SWXLcolumn was almost the same as that of GTP cyclohydrolase I. Since the elution position of the complex from the column was close to the void volume, it was outside the given linear estimation of molecular masses. Thus, we performed gel filtration using Superose 6 resins, which gave a straight line over the molecular mass range of 150–669 kDa. GTP cyclohydrolase I and the complex were eluted from this column at close volumes, which corresponded to the relative molecular masses of 300 and 313 kDa, respectively, when compared with those of bovine thyroglobulin (669 kDa), sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa). This observation suggests that the radius of gyration of GTP cyclohydrolase I did not change even after two molecules of GFRP with a molecular mass of 50 kDa were bound to the enzyme. Considering that the shape of the corresponding E. coli GTP cyclohydrolase I is a torus formed by face-to-face association of two pentamers with dimensions of 65 × 100 Å (17Nar H. Huber R. Meining W. Schmid C. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. Structure. 1995; 3: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we infer that the structure of the complex is such that one molecule of the GFRP pentamer binds to each of the two outer faces of the pentamer of GTP cyclohydrolase I; in other words, GTP cyclohydrolase I is sandwiched between GFRPs. Thus, the complex might behave on gel filtration as though the apparent diameter was similar to that of GTP cyclohydrolase I.Dose Dependence and Specificity of BH4 and GTP for Their Inducibility of Complex FormationBy using the gel filtration method, we examined the effect of varying concentrations of BH4 on complex formation between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GTP. As shown in Fig.6 A, the protein complex was formed in a BH4-dose dependent manner. The median effective concentration (EC50) of BH4 was estimated from the graph to be 2 μm. This value is equal to the EC50 value of BH4 (2 μm) that was kinetically determined for the inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity at 100 μm GTP (11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the physical association of GFRP with GTP cyclohydrolase I is tightly coupled to the inhibition of enzyme activity.Figure 6Dose-dependent effect of BH4 and GTP and their related compounds on the complex formation between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I. A mixture of GFRP (0.8 nmol) and GTP cyclohydrolase I (0.8 nmol) was filtered through Superdex 75 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The equilibration buffer contained varying concentrations of BH4 (closed circles) or BH2 (open circles) with 100 μm GTP (A) and varying concentrations of GTP (closed circles), dGTP (open circles), GTPγS (×), or GDP (closed squares) with 8 μm BH4(B). Complex formation was estimated by a decrease in the peak heights of free GFRP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined the effect of varying concentrations of GTP on protein complex formation in the presence of BH4. As shown in Fig.6 B, the complex was formed in a GTP dose-dependent manner. The EC50 value of GTP was estimated to be 26 μm.We examined the ability of two BH4-related compounds to induce formation of the protein complex at a fixed saturating concentration of GTP. The compounds examined were BH2 andl-biopterin, which are oxidized forms of BH4and have no cofactor activity for the known BH4-requiring enzymes. As shown in Fig. 6 A, BH2 induced complex formation, and its EC50 value was 4.7 μm. Thus, BH2 is half as effective as BH4. Biopterin induced no complex formation even at a concentration of 50 μm. Thus, more potent effects were observed for more reduced biopterins. These results are consistent with our kinetic data (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that showed that BH2 inhibits the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I with an EC50 value of 4 μm, whereas biopterin is totally ineffective at a concentration of 50 μm. These findings indicate again the close relationship between the physical association of GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I and the catalytic activity of the enzyme.We also examined the ability of GTP-related compounds to induce complex formation in the presence of 8 μm BH4. As shown in Fig. 6 B, dGTP showed a similar inducibility compared with GTP with an EC50 value of 20 μm. Thus, the deoxylation of the ribose moiety at the 2′-position had a slight effect on complex formation. GTPγS also induced complex formation with an EC50 value of 18 μm. GDP induced complex formation, and its EC50 value was 67 μm; however, the maximum binding of GFRP to GTP cyclohydrolase I was estimated to be about half of that with GTP. This finding may indicate that only one molecule of GFRP associated with one molecule of GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GDP under the experimental conditions. GMP did not induce complex formation at all, even at a concentration of 100 μm.To determine the structural requirement of the base portion of nucleotide triphosphates for complex formation, we examined the ability of ATP, inosine 5′-triphosphate, and xanthine 5′-triphosphate to induce formation of the protein complex. These compounds did not induce complex formation at all at a concentration of 100 μm.The conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate did not appear to be required for formation of the complex between GTP cyclohydrolase I and GFRP because the enzyme activity was almost completely inhibited at 8 μm BH4. Furthermore, while GTPγS and dGTP induced formation of the protein complex as shown above, we found that these molecules did not serve as substrate for GTP cyclohydrolase I at all. After incubating each of these nucleotides with the enzyme, we measured the amount of nucleotide remaining in the reaction mixture. No decrease in either nucleotide was found upon incubation with the enzyme. These findings indicate that no enzymatic conversion of guanine nucleotides is involved in the protein complex formation.Stimulatory Complex FormationDose Dependence of GFRP for Its Phenylalanine-dependent Stimulatory Action on GTP Cyclohydrolase I ActivityIn the presence of GFRP, phenylalanine changes the kinetic nature of GTP cyclohydrolase I from sigmoidal to hyperbolic in a dose-dependent manner; in other words, phenylalanine stimulates the enzyme activity when GTP concentrations are below saturation (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of GFRP required for producing the maximum effect of phenylalanine, we examined the effect of varying concentrations of GFRP on the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I at a non-saturating GTP concentration of 20 μm in the presence of 1 mm phenylalanine. With this phenylalanine concentration, the substrate velocity curve for GTP cyclohydrolase I fully changes from sigmoidal to hyperbolic (1Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260 (and references therein): 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentration of GTP used (20 μm) is a concentration at which the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I increases ∼4-fold in the presence of a saturating amount of GFRP and 1 mm phenylalanine (11Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, GFRP stimulated the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I in a dose-dependent manner and leveled off at a concentration of 0.2 μm, which is the same concentration as that of GTP cyclohydrolase I contained in the reaction mixture (Fig. 7). This result indicates that, as in the case of the GFRP-dependent inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I, an equimolar number of GFRP subunits is necessary for the total activation of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity, indicating that two molecules of GFRP are required for the total activation of one molecule of GTP cyclohydrolase I.Figure 7Effect of varying concentrations of GFRP on GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the presence of phenylalanine. The concentrations of phenylalanine and GTP were 1 mm and 20 μm, respectively. The assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase I was 0.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Stoichiometry of the Stimulatory Complex Formation between GTP Cyclohydrolase I and GFRPTo physically determine the protein stoichiometry of the stimulatory complex formed between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I, we performed similar gel filtration experiments as for the inhibitory complex. When each protein was separately filtered through the resin in the presence of phenylalanine, both GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I eluted from the gel resin at the same volumes as they did in the absence of any ligands, indicating that phenylalanine did not alter the association state of the subunits of either protein. This fact was a prerequisite for the following experiments.With regard to the phenylalanine-dependent complex formation, we obtained chromatograms (Figs. 3 B and4 B1) that were similar to those obtained for the inhibitory complex (Figs. 3 A and 4 A1). It should be noted that the increase in the peak height of GTP cyclohydrolase I was not a linear function of the amount of GFRP (Fig. 4 B1). However, the quantitative analysis of proteins in the peak fraction by gel electrophoresis showed that the amount of GFRP associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I increased linearly and leveled off at the same molar amount as that of GTP cyclohydrolase I (Fig. 4 B2). These findings indicate that phenylalanine also induces association of two molecules of pentameric GFRP with one molecule of decameric GTP cyclohydrolase I.Dose Dependence and Specificity of Phenylalanine for Its Inducibility of Complex FormationWe examined the effect of varying concentrations of phenylalanine on complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W1964831127,"Interaction of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) with its receptors leads to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and/or phospholipase C (PLC). While regulation of adenylyl cyclase is thought to involve the G-protein Gs, it is not known whether activation of PLC results from coupling the receptor to Gq family proteins or whether βγ subunits released from receptor-activated Gs activate PLC. We used human bone cells OHS-4 bearing CGRP receptors in which CGRP activates only the PLC signaling pathway to determine how CGRP acts. CGRP increased the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) within 5 s via a Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels and by mobilizing calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. The activation of effectors, like PLC coupled to G-proteins, is the early event in the pathway leading to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, which is responsible for Ca2+ mobilization. Western blotting demonstrated a range of PLC-β isoforms (β1, β3, β4, but not β2) and G-proteins (Gαq/11 and Gαs). Only phospholipase C-β1 is involved in the mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum of Fura-2-loaded confluent OHS-4 cells and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by CGRP; PLC-γ have no effect. Activation of PLC-β1 by CGRP involves the Gαq/11 subunit, which is insensitive to pertussis toxin, but not Gβγ subunits. We therefore believe that CGRP causes the activation of two separate G-proteins."

The factors controlling their cell- and islet-specific expression are poorly known. Insulin-enhancer factor-1 (IEF1) has previously been shown to interact with the E boxes of the rat insulin I and II genes and was proposed to play a critical role in beta cell-specific expression. BETA2, a recently identified basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, binds with high affinity and transactivates the rat insulin II gene upon dimerization with the ubiquitous bHLH protein E47.

In transfection experiments, the E boxes of the insulin I and glucagon genes confer transcriptional activity in both insulin- and glucagon-producing cells, which is increased by overexpression of E47 and BETA2. However, overexpression of E47 inhibits only E box-mediated glucagon gene expression, whereas it activates insulin gene transcription, indicating that the E boxes of the insulin and glucagon genes display gene-specific characteristics. We conclude that the heterodimer E47/BETA2 represents an islet-specific factor that controls both insulin and glucagon gene transcription and that the E47/BETA2 ratio may be important for regulated gene expression.

Glucagon and insulin are two major antagonist hormones secreted by the endocrine pancreas which control glucose homeostasis. Glucagon gene expression in the adult is restricted to the alpha cells of the pancreas, the L-cells of the intestine, and some specific cell types in the central nervous system, whereas insulin gene expression is limited to pancreatic beta cells. The regulation as well as the cell-specific expression of both genes rely on specific interactions between cis-acting DNA sequences of their promoters and trans-acting factors (1Dumonteil E.

G2 and G3 are distal enhancers, whereas G4 is located in the proximal promoter just upstream of G1 (4Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

The bHLH transcription factor family is divided into three groups according to their structure, DNA-binding ability, and cell distribution. Class A factors, such as USF or E47, are ubiquitous and bind DNA as homo- or heterodimers, whereas class B factors are tissue-specific and preferentially bind as heterodimers with class A factors. Class C factors contain a leucine zipper motif at the carboxyl-terminal end of the bHLH domain and are further divided into ubiquitous and tissue-specific subgroups. Functional studies on rat insulin I and II gene expression have identified several binding sites for trans-acting factors within the first 400 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence which confer beta cell-specific expression including two distinct types of DNA motifs, A boxes, which correspond to the minimal sequence TAAT, and E boxes, corresponding to the consensus CANNTG (12Edlund T.

The two E boxes E1 and E2 of the rat insulin I gene have been reported to play a major role in beta cell-specific expression and regulation by glucose; they interact with insulin enhancer factor 1 (IEF1), a protein complex composed of the ubiquitous bHLH protein E12/E47 and an islet cell-specific factor (14Ohlsson H.

IEF1 is also present in glucagon-producing cells, and previous results from our group suggested that IEF1 may also interact with the E3 element of the glucagon gene and thus play a role not only in insulin gene expression but rather in islet hormone gene expression (6Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent work on the E1 box of the insulin II gene (previously called RIPE3a), which is also critical for beta cell-specific expression, has led to the characterization of BETA2, a class B bHLH transcription factor which is capable of binding with high affinity as a heterodimer to E1 and activating insulin gene transcription (17Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Since E boxes with the same core motif are also found in the rat insulin I and glucagon genes, we hypothesized that the E47/BETA2 heterodimer may affect their expression also and thus function as an activator of islet hormone gene expression. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the interactions of E47 and BETA2 with E3 and E1 of the glucagon and insulin I genes, respectively. Our data indicate that the heterodimer E47/BETA2 binds to and transactivates the E boxes of the glucagon and insulin I genes and represents IEF1. The E boxes of both genes function in both glucagon- and insulin-producing cells, but not in BHK-21 cells, indicating that IEF1 is necessary but not sufficient for the E box-mediated transcriptional activity. However, the E boxes of the insulin and glucagon genes are not interchangeable and display clear specificity. Indeed, E47 overexpression inhibits glucagon gene transcription through specific interactions with E3, whereas insulin gene transcription is activated, suggesting that the E47/BETA2 ratio might be critical for the regulation of these genes. The oligonucleotides IEB1 (gatccGCCATCTGCCA, where lowercase letters are attached ends and uppercase letters reflect the DNA sequence of the gene promoter fragment) and E130 (gatccTGAGGAGCAGATGAGCAGAGAGTa) containing the E1 box of the rat insulin I gene and the E3 box of the rat glucagon gene, respectively (see Fig. 1) (6Cordier-Bussat M.

Reporter plasmids containing glucagon promoter sequences were constructed by placingBamHI-compatible ends on two oligonucleotide copies of the wild type (G4-CAT) or mutated (G4–108N-CAT, and G4–130N-CAT) G4 sequences (corresponding to −100/−140 bp of the glucagon promoter) and inserting them into a BamHI site upstream of the glucagon minimal promoter (−31 to +58 bp) linked to the CAT reporter gene (6Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The same strategy was used to insert two copies of the E130 oligonucleotide containing the functional E3 box (found within G4). Reporter plasmids containing insulin I gene promoter sequences were prepared by linking two copies of the E1 (gatcCGCCATCTGCCA) or E2 (gatccGCCATCTGGCa) boxes (formerly IEB1 and IEB2, respectively) to the CAT reporter gene (18Karlsson O.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) recently characterized a composite element of the glucagon gene promoter, G4, which contains at least three binding sites, the most distal one (E3) acting as a functional E box (Fig. 1). We suggested that the IEF1 complex, previously shown to represent a critical determinant of the beta cell-specific expression of the insulin gene, could interact with E3 of the glucagon gene and thus be involved in the islet-specific expression of the glucagon gene. It has recently been proposed (17Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) that the likely equivalent of IEF1 which interacts with E1 (RIPE3a) of the rat insulin II gene is a heterodimer composed of E47, an ubiquitous bHLH protein, and BETA2, a class B bHLH protein present in the islets of Langerhans, the intestine, and the brain. We thus investigated whether these two proteins were indeed capable of binding to E3 of the rat glucagon gene and to E1 of the rat insulin I gene. Nuclear extracts prepared from the glucagon-producing cell line InR1G9 were incubated with oligonucleotides containing either E1 (IEB1) (Fig. 2 A) of the rat insulin I gene or E3 (E130) (Fig. 2 B) of the rat glucagon gene and analyzed by EMSAs. As reported previously (6Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2, the islet-specific IEF1 complex and several nonspecific complexes are observed with both oligonucleotides. The addition of either anti-E47 or anti-BETA2 antibodies supershifted or disrupted the IEF1 complex, whereas anti-USF antibodies had no effect (data not shown). Of note, migration of IEF1 with IEB1 was identical to that observed with E130; its intensity with E130, however, was only 1/10th of that seen with IEB1, illustrating the lower affinity of IEF1 for E3 compared with E1 (Fig. 2 A). To better evaluate the interactions between E47/BETA2 and E1 and E3, we used nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells transfected with expression vectors containing either E47, BETA2, or both cDNAs and in vitro synthesized E47 and BETA2 (Fig.3). Overexpression of E47 in BHK-21 cells resulted in the appearance of a complex corresponding to E47 homodimers with both IEB1 (Fig. 3 A) and E130 (Fig. 3 C). This complex was disrupted by the addition of anti-E47 antibodies and displaced by an excess of cold oligonucleotide competitor (Fig.3 A). E47 homodimers were also observed when in vitro synthesized E47 was incubated with either IEB1 (Fig.3 B) or E130 (Fig. 3 D). No specific complex was detected, however, with nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells overexpressing BETA2 on either IEB1 (Fig. 3 A) or E130, and similar results were obtained with in vitro synthesized BETA2 (Fig. 3 B). The same observation was reported previously with E1 (RIPE3a) of the rat insulin II gene (17Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), indicating that BETA2 may not be able to form homodimers or at least not be able to bind to the different E boxes of the insulin and glucagon genes as homodimers. Using nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells transfected with both E47 and BETA2 cDNAs (Fig. 3, A and C) and in vitro synthesized E47 and BETA2 proteins (Fig. 3, B andD), we were able to reconstitute IEF1 on both IEB1 and E130. IEF1 comigrated with the complex formed by the in vitrosynthesized E47 and BETA2 proteins (Fig. 3 B) and was supershifted or displaced by the addition of anti-E47 and anti-BETA2 antibodies (Fig. 3, B–D). Bands migrating close to IEF1 were observed with untransfected BHK-21 cells as well as cells transfected with the E47 or BETA2 cDNAs (Fig. 3 A). These bands, although not always present, migrated slightly faster when gels were run for longer time periods and were not supershifted or disrupted by the addition of anti-E47 or BETA2 antibodies. Of note, the intensity of the protein-DNA complexes obtained with in vitrosynthesized E47 and BETA2 were lower compared with those obtained from transfected BHK-21 or InR1G9 cells. We conclude that IEF1 is a heterodimer of E47 and BETA2, which not only interacts with the rat insulin II gene promoter but also with both E1 of the insulin I gene and E3 of the glucagon gene. To evaluate the respective affinity of E47 homodimers and E47/BETA2 heterodimers for IEB1, we used different ratios of in vitrosynthesized E47 and BETA2 proteins (10/1, 5/1, 1/1) in the EMSA (Fig.4). We observed preferential formation of E47/BETA2 and evaluated that E47/BETA2 had at least a 10-fold higher affinity for IEB1 compared with E47 homodimers. Our results thus indicate that when E47 is sufficiently abundant it can form homodimers and bind to E1 and E3, but with a lower affinity compared with the E47/BETA2 heterodimer. BETA2 by contrast is unable to bind as a homodimer. To investigate the functional roles of BETA2 and E47 on glucagon gene expression, we first performed cotransfection experiments in BHK-21 cells using the glucagon G4 element (see sequence of Fig. 5) linked to the first 31 bp of the glucagon gene promoter and 58 bp of the first exon as well as to the CAT reporter gene (G4-CAT) and expression vectors containing either the E47, BETA2, or both cDNAs. The G4 element was unable to direct significant expression of the CAT reporter gene in these non-islet cells, and CAT activity was not affected by cotransfection of any of the cDNAs (data not shown). Similar results were reported using the E1 (RIPE3a) element of the insulin II gene (17Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells transfected with either the E47 or/and BETA2 cDNAs can form specific complexes with both E1 and E3 boxes, these results indicate that IEF1 by itself is not sufficient for transactivating the insulin and glucagon gene promoter in heterologous cells and that it likely requires additional cell-specific factors such as PDX1 (formally Idx1/IPF1/STF1) or RIPE3b to be functional (17Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 18Karlsson O. Walker M.D. Rutter W.R. Edlund T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments performed in InR1G9 cells revealed that overexpression of BETA2 alone had no effect on G4-directed CAT activity (G4-CAT), whereas overexpression of E47 inhibited CAT activity by more than 50% (Fig. 5). In contrast, overexpression of both E47 and BETA2 led to a 2-fold increase in transcriptional activity compared with G4-CAT alone and a 4-fold increase compared with the activity obtained with overexpression of E47. Similar results were obtained when the first 292 bp of the glucagon promoter were used to direct the CAT reporter gene (data not shown). Our data thus indicate that overexpression of E47 in glucagon-producing cells results in opposite regulatory effects on glucagon gene transcription compared with overexpression of both E47 and BETA2. Because the G4 element contains an additional E-like motif (E2) separated from E3 by a short intervening sequence (Fig. 5), we wanted to ensure that the transcriptional effects of E47 and E47/BETA2 were mediated through specific interactions with E3. We thus investigated the effects of specifically mutated oligonucleotides representing G4, disrupting either E3 or E2 on transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). Disruption of E2 (G4–108N-CAT) led to a slight decrease in basal activity compared with the wild type sequence, but the modulatory effects of E47 and E47/BETA2 overexpression were similar to that observed with G4-CAT. A mutation of the E3 motif (G4–130N-CAT), on the other hand, resulted in a marked decrease in basal activity and a loss of any significant modulatory effects of E47 and E47/BETA2. Although E47 overexpression was still able to slightly depress activity, it did not result in any significant difference compared with vector alone. These data confirm that E47/BETA2 exert their effects on glucagon gene transcription through a specific interaction with E3. To further characterize the effects of E47 and BETA2 on glucagon gene transcription, we performed a dose-response analysis of their transcriptional potential on the G4 element. Transfection of InR1G9 cells with G4-CAT and increasing amounts of expression plasmids containing the E47 cDNA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of transcriptional activity to a maximum of about 70% (Fig.6 A). Similar results were obtained when the reporter gene was linked to the first 292 bp of the glucagon gene promoter (data not shown). Cotransfection of G4-CAT with increasing amounts of the BETA2 expression plasmid, by contrast, did not significantly affect CAT activity, although we noted a small increase at the lowest amounts of"

The ionotrophic P2X subclass of purinoreceptors respond to ATP by stimulation of calcium ion permeability; however, it is unknown how P2X purinoreceptor activation is linked to intracellular signaling pathways. We report that stimulation of PC12 cells with ATP results in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK1 and ERK2 and was wholly dependent upon extracellular calcium ions. Treatment of the cells with adenosine, AMP, ADP, UTP, or α,β-methylene ATP was without effect; however, MAP kinase activation was abolished by pretreatment with suramin and reactive blue 2. The calcium-activated tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, acts as an upstream regulator of the MAP kinases and became tyrosine phosphorylated following treatment of the cells with ATP. We have ruled out the involvement of depolarization-mediated calcium influx because specific blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels did not affect MAP kinase activation. These data provide direct evidence that calcium influx through P2X2 receptors results in the activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that a different line of PC12 cells respond to ATP through P2Y2 purinoreceptors, providing an explanation for the conflicting findings of purine nucleotide responsiveness in PC12 cells."

Cluster mutation of aspartic residues in this loop results in a strong reduction of the affinity for Ca2+, as shown by the Ca2+dependence of ATPase phosphorylation from either ATP or Pi. The reduction in Ca2+ affinity for phosphorylation from Pi is observed both at acidic and neutral pH, suggesting that these mutations interfere with binding of the first Ca2+, as proposed for some of the intramembranous residues essential for Ca2+ binding (Andersen, J. P. (1995)Biosci. Rep. 15, 243–261). Treatment of the mutated Ca2+-ATPase with proteinase K, in the absence or presence of various Ca2+ concentrations, leads to Ca2+-dependent changes in the proteolytic degradation pattern similar to those in the wild type but observed only at higher Ca2+ concentrations. This implies that these effects are not due to changes in the conformational state of Ca2+-free ATPase but that changes affecting the proteolytic digestion pattern require higher Ca2+ concentrations.

During Ca2+ transport, Ca2+-ATPase probably undergoes several conformational changes, although only two main states were initially considered (1de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), which denote forms with a high and low affinity for Ca2+, respectively (see also Refs. 9MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J.

Binding of cytosolic Ca2+ at the Ca2+activating and transport sites of the ATPase was measured directly under equilibrium conditions and found to occur with a stoichiometry of 2:1 and a positive cooperativity, which was interpreted on the basis of a sequential mechanism (11Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed to occur in a multistep process accompanied by conformational changes. Evidence has been presented that binding of only one Ca2+ is sufficient to prevent phosphorylation from Pi, while the binding of the second Ca2+ is required to allow subsequent phosphorylation from ATP (12Fujimori T. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18475-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mainly based on the kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation, Ca2+-binding sites have been suggested to be arranged in a channel-like structure including two sites (13Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation with ATP, the Ca2+ions can initially no longer dissociate from the high energy phosphoenzyme formed and are found in what has been described as an “occluded” state (16Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Takisawa H. Makinose M. Nature. 1981; 290: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ ions are subsequently released toward the SR lumen because of reorganization of both sites and loss of their affinity for Ca2+ (18Watanabe T. Lewis D. Nakamoto R. Kurzmack M. Fronticelli C.

Chemical and/or genetic modification of the polypeptide chain has allowed us to examine the functional role of different domains (for reviews, see Refs. 5Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim.

Residues critical for Ca2+binding and transport were not found in the stalk sector, despite the fact that this region has a large content of acid residues (25Clarke D.M. Murayama K. Loo T.W. Leberer E. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, such residues are clustered in the transmembrane domain, in M4 (Glu-309), M5 (Glu-771), M6 (Asn-796, Thr-799, and Asp-800) and M8 (Glu-908) (26Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Further experiments showed that the five residues in M4, M5, and M6 were also critical for occlusion in the presence of Cr-ATP (27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3539-3550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not Glu-908, which was therefore considered to be involved in the initial recognition of the Ca2+ ions but not in its final intramembranous binding (10Andersen J.P.

In addition to the molecular biology approach, limited proteolysis of the SR Ca2+-ATPase has also been developed for identification of regions critical for Ca2+ activation of the ATPase (29Andersen J.P.

Experiments showed that the rate of electrophoretic migration of a small C-terminal ATPase peptide, p20C, was sensitive to Ca2+, while a slightly shorter peptide, p19C, was not. We found that p20C starts at Gly-808, at the beginning of the loop connecting putative transmembrane spans 6 and 7, while p19C starts at Asp-818, in the middle of loop. This led us to suggest that the L6–7 loop might interact with Ca2+ (32Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Gomez de Gracia A. Soulié S. Centeno F. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the loop contains three aspartic residues (Asp-813, -815, and -818), which were mutated in a cluster, D813A/D818A and D813A/D815A/D818A. After expression in yeast, we found that these mutants had a low Ca2+-ATPase activity (32Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Gomez de Gracia A. Soulié S. Centeno F. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in gastric H+,K+-ATPase, residues Glu-837 and Asp-839, which correspond to Asp-813 and Asp-815 in Ca2+-ATPase, were found to render the ATPase unphosphorylatable by ATP when mutated to glutamine and asparagine residues, respectively (33Swarts H.G.

In the present work, we have carried out more detailed experiments to investigate the role of the L6–7 loop in Ca2+-ATPase. The experiments were designed to characterize the functional consequences of mutations of aspartic residues, D813A/D818A and D813A/D815A/D818A, as well as those of mutations of the proline residues in the same loop, Pro-811, -812, -820, and -821. We found that cluster mutations of aspartate residues led to a clear reduction in the apparent affinity with which Ca2+ controlled ATPase phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Although Asp to Ala mutations are often thought of as nonconservative, susceptibility to proteolytic digestion suggested that our mutation of the L6–7 loop did not cause any major conformational change. Thus, the present findings are consistent with an interaction of the aspartic residues of the L6–7 loop with the first Ca2+ ion that binds to Ca2+-ATPase during the transport process and suggest that the L6–7 loop contributes to the control of the activation of Ca2+-ATPase by Ca2+ during the initial steps of Ca2+ binding. A model is proposed describing one possible mechanism by which such a control might occur. The single mutants E309Q and E771Q and the cluster mutants D813A/D818A (referred to later as ADA) and D813A/D815A/D818A (referred to later as AAA) were obtained as in Ref. 32Falson P. Menguy T.

The Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between the slopes obtained in the presence and in the absence of thapsigargin and was corrected for the (very small) background of thapsigargin-dependent activity obtained with light membranes of control yeasts. Ca2+-ATPase phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was carried out in an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and various free Ca2+concentrations, as indicated in Figs. 3 and 4.

These respective subunits are referred to as the a- and b-subunits (or heavy and light subunits). The enzyme is encoded by a single gene, and post-translational cleavage of the nascent polypeptide into a mature a/b heterodimer is required for activation.

Dunn G.S. Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); (ii) part of the 31-residue insertion in the human enzyme is removed from the new C terminus of the a-subunit in the lysosome (6Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O.K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); no trimming occurs in the bacterial enzyme; (iii) the human enzyme containsN-linked glycans on both the a- and b-subunits (Asn15 and Asn285) (14Halila R. Baumann M. Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Peltonen L. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the bacterial enzyme is nonglycosylated (4Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); (iv) according to previous sequence alignments (3Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), neither the position nor the pattern of disulfide bridges is conserved between these two enzymes. The disulfide bonds have been shown to be essential for initial protein folding and activation of human GA (15Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Together, these differences suggest the possibility that the structure of Flavobacterium GA may be significantly different from the human enzyme. Here we report the crystal structures of recombinant GA from F. meningosepticum. Structures of the wild type GA and a single amino acid mutant in their mature forms have been determined at 2.2 and 2.1 Å, respectively. Protein expression and purification will be described elsewhere. 2T. Cui, T. J. O'Loughlin, C. Guan, and H.-C. Guo, manuscript in preparation. Crystals were grown in hanging drops equilibrated by vapor diffusion against well solutions of 15% PEG 3300, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium azide. Microseeding was routinely used to improve crystal quality. Crystals were harvested into a modified well solution containing 20% PEG 3300. Shortly before data collection, crystals were placed in dialysis buttons and dialyzed stepwise against harvest buffer supplemented with a progressively higher concentrations of glycerol. The final glycerol concentration was 20%, and the transfer steps were between 5 and 10% glycerol and varied from 3 h to a couple of days for each step. No correlation was observed between transfer procedure and the quality of the diffraction data. Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the native crystals in the harvest buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.1–10 mm of heavy atom compound, from 15 h to a few days, before step up to the final glycerol concentration. Oscillation data were collected from crystals frozen at 100 K, mounted in a thin film of harvest buffer plus 20% glycerol, and supported by a loop made of dental floss. Diffraction data were collected using an R-AXIS IIC image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator. All intensity data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE from the CCP4 software package (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The space group was determined by examination of the differences in intensities of potential pairs of reflections across putative mirror planes within the data and confirmed by examining the electron density maps. Heavy atom positions were initially obtained from isomorphous Patterson maps calculated in XTALVIEW (18McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The heavy atom parameters were then refined by MLPHARE from the CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by the cross Fourier. At this stage, the figure of merit was 0.55 (0.71 calculated by XTALVIEW). The MIR phases were then extended to the resolution range 12–2.5 Å and were improved by noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, solvent flatterning, and histogram matching using the program DM (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with a figure of merit of 0.785. The first map was calculated at 2.5 Å resolution (see Fig. 3) and skeletonized to build a Cα trace in the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The first 244 of 275 residues were built based on the DM-modified MIR map. Automated refinement included rigid body, overall temperature factor, positional, and restrained atomic temperature factor refinement, as well as simulated annealing using a slow cooling protocol in X-PLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). After the first round of manual rebuilding, without the N-terminal nucleophile (amino acid 152), the structure, after rigid body fit by AMORE (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), was used for refinement of both the wild type and the T152C mutant. SIGMAA (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used in the early cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding to combine model phases with experimental phases. Initially, strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were applied, and in later stages of refinement, tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied, exclusive of residues that were involved in crystal contacts. After a few rounds of model rebuilding, stepwise resolution extension, and automated refinement, clear electron density could be seen for all residues in the final model. Refinement protocols were aimed at decreasing theRfree (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) rather than the conventionalRcryst to avoid errors introduced by overfitting of the data. When the Rfree appeared to have reached a minimum at the final resolution, water molecules were added and subjected to another round of automated refinement and manual rebuilding. The statistics of the final structures are shown in TableII, with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.20–0.23 Å for main chain atoms between crystallographically independent molecules.Table IIRefinement statisticsWild typeT152CResolution range (Å)6–2.26–2.1Unique reflections All F22,93229,161 F > 3ς18,08925,661Non-hydrogen atoms ProteinaModel contains residues 3–138 and 152–290 of both a/b heterodimers 1 and 2 in the asymmetric unit.4,1884,186 Water134246Rcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ‖Fobs −Fcalc‖/ΣFobs.

Open table in a new tab All superimpositions of different structures were performed using LSQKAB (17Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). For Fig. 4, all atoms of residues contacting the reaction product, aspartate, in the human structure are superimposed (atoms equivalent to those in bacterial Thr152, Thr170, Arg180, Asp183, Thr203, and Gly204). The enzymes crystallized in space group P21 with unit cell constants a= 46.2Å, b = 97.3Å, c = 61.8Å, and β = 90.3°. The initial phases were obtained by MIR method with four heavy atom derivatives (Table I). The wild type structure has been determined at 2.2 Å and refined to anRfree (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) of 29.70% and anRcryst of 24.65% with all reflections (TableII). There are two a/b heterodimers per asymmetric unit. In the final model, each heterodimer comprises 136 residues (3–138) of the a-subunit and 139 residues (152–290) of the b-subunit. No electron density is observed for the 13 residues spanning the segment (139–151) that connects the a- and b-subunits in the precursor protein. In the crystal, this linker segment appears to face into the solvent channels. 93% of the nonglycine residues fall in the most favored regions of Ramachandran plot, as defined in PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and no residues are in the disallowed regions.Table IData collection and phasing statisticsWild typeT152CDerivativesHg(OAc)2CH3HgClK2PtCl4KAuCN2Resolution (Å)2.22.12.52.54.52.5Reflections (total/unique)42,281/23,99959,059/30,53050,741/18,51440,157/18,5325,298/3,07855,117/18,816I/ς6.98.39.56.27.08.9Completeness (%)86.796.297.796.091.198.7RsymmaRsymm = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs.0.110.090.090.110.090.08RisobRiso = Σ‖Ider −Inat‖/ΣInat, whereInat is the observed native (T152C) intensity.0.240.340.260.14Number of sites4662MIR phases (12–2.5 Å) (MLPHARE) Phasing powercPhasing power = Σ‖FH‖/Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FPH,calc∥.1.431.561.491.03 CullisR-factordCullis R-factor = Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FPH,calc∥/Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FP,obs∥.0.780.780.750.86 Overall figure of merit0.550Density modification (DM) Overall figure of merit0.785a Rsymm = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs.b Riso = Σ‖Ider −Inat‖/ΣInat, whereInat is the observed native (T152C) intensity.c Phasing power = Σ‖FH‖/Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FPH,calc∥.d Cullis R-factor = Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FPH,calc∥/Σ∥FPH,obs‖ − ‖FP,obs∥. Open table in a new tab Overall, the topology of Flavobacterium GA is very similar to its human counterpart (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both the a- and b-subunits together form a four-layer α-β-β-α structure (Fig.1), with two β-sheets packed against each other to form a core that is “sandwiched” by two layers of α-helices. Eight β-strands from both the a- and b-subunits form the first β-sheet, with topology aS4, aS3, aS2, bS2, bS1, aS1, bS7, and bS8. All these β-strands are antiparallel except aS4, which is parallel to aS3. The other β-sheet is comprised of four antiparallel β-strands from the b-subunit, with the topology bS3, bS4, bS5, and bS6. The α-helix layer packed against the outside of the eight-strand sheet is formed by five α-helices from the a-subunit: aH1, aH2, aH3, aH4, and aH5. The other layer of α-helix packed outside of the four-strand sheet is formed by three α-helices (bH1, bH2, and bH3) plus a 310 helix (bH4) from the b-subunit. All inter-layer loops cluster at one side of the structure to provide functional groups for the active site (top center of the structure in Fig. 1, toward the viewer), whereas the intra-layer loops are located on the other side. The structure-based alignment of amino acid sequences betweenFlavobacterium and human enzymes is shown in Fig.2. They have similar secondary structural elements, with the exception that the 310 helix (bH4) is unique to the bacterial structure. The bacterial GA differs from the human form as follows. There is a 1-residue insertion at the N-terminal end of the aH1 helix, a 1-residue deletion between strands aS2 and aS3, a 31-residue deletion at the C-terminal end of the a-subunit, a 7-residue insertion between helices bH3 and bH4, a 4-residue deletion between strands bS6 and bS7, a 2-residue deletion between strands bS7 and bS8, and 2 extra residues at the C-terminal end of the b-subunit.Figure 2Structure-based sequence alignment between the Flavobacterium (Flavo) and human glycosylasparaginase (Human). The dashed lines represent incorporated gaps that bring the sequences into alignment. The vertical lines represent identical matches. The bold black arrow represents the autoproteolytic site. Yellow shading shows conserved residues in the active site (see Fig. 4 and text). Purple shades highlight the mutations identified in human AGU disease (1Mononen I. Fisher K.J. Kaartinen V. Aronson Jr., N.N. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); not shown is an Asp-Ala insertion between Ala19 and Ala20 in the human sequence. The secondary structural elements are based on this study: red arrows for β-strands, green rectangles for α-helices, and open rectangle for 310 helix. Cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds in the human structure are linked by lines below the human sequences: Cys41-Cys46, Cys140-Cys156, Cys263-Cys283, and Cys294-Cys322.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A deficiency of GA results in the human genetic disorder known as AGU (1Mononen I. Fisher K.J. Kaartinen V. Aronson Jr., N.N. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, we have mapped five known AGU mutations onto the structure-based sequence alignment. Only the double mutant (human Arg138 to Gln and Cys140 to Ser) maps outside of the shared secondary structural elements. This double mutant results in the loss of a disulfide bond (Cys140-Cys156) that stabilizes the loop formed by a portion of the 31-residue insertion at the C-terminal end of the human a-subunit (Fig.1 c). The remaining four mutations may disturb secondary structural elements, such as aH1 (with a 2-amino acid insertion), aH2, aS3, bS5, and thus may disturb the correct folding of the enzyme. An r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å is obtained by superimposing the common 1,068 main chain atoms (excluding insertions/deletions) of the Flavobacterium and human GA structures. This is significantly larger than the r.m.s. deviation of 0.26–0.45 Å found between the two human structures (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, the r.m.s. deviation between our two bacterial structures is 0.22 Å (see below), similar to that observed between two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (Table II). A number of peptide fragments within the structure deviate by more than 2 Å (Fig. 1 c); most of them are in loops connecting elements of secondary structure. The largest difference of 8.5 Å is near the 7-residue insertion in the bacterial structure. Deviations greater than 2 Å are also observed in the common secondary structural elements (see below). These data are consistent with the observation that molecular replacement using the human structure proved difficult with the data of FlavobacteriumGA. 3H.-C. Guo and Q. Xu, unpublished observation. The human enzyme contains four disulfide bonds (Fig. 2) that are important for protein folding, autoproteolysis, and enzyme activity (15Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These four disulfide bonds are conserved among mammalian enzymes. The insect enzyme retains all but one (Cys263-Cys283) of the disulfide bonds (3Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, no conserved disulfide bond is found between theFlavobacterium and eukaryotic GA. Indeed, there are no disulfide bonds among the five cysteines in the bacterial a/b heterodimer. One cysteine pair in the bacterial structure (Cys68-Cys168) has side chains in close proximity that may potentially form a disulfide bond, but this was ruled out based on several observations: (i) Cys68 and Cys168 bind to heavy atoms Hg(OAc)2 and CH3HgCl, respectively; (ii) the initial MIR map indicates that the side chain of Cys168 point away from Cys68; (iii) the simulated annealed omit maps also show these two side chains to be in nonbridged conformations; (iv) a Cys to Ser mutation at either of these two cysteines does not significantly affect either protein stability or enzymatic activity 4T. Cui, unpublished results. ; and (v) the a- and b-subunits can be separated on a nonreducing SDS protein gel (data not shown). Although the overall protein folds are similar in the bacterial and human structures, the location or length of some secondary structural elements differ. For example, the bacterial enzyme has a unique 310 helix (bH4), whereas the human enzyme carries a C-terminal additional loop on its a-subunit (Fig. 1 c). Furthermore, in the bacterial structure, the insertion of Gly14 extends helix aH1 at its N-terminal end by two residues. At the C-terminal end of helix aH1, Ser26 is designated as part of the helix in the human structure, but the equivalent Lys27 in the bacterial structure is not assigned as part of the helix by PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). This is apparently because of a significant deviation of the main chain traces between these two structures (Fig. 3). When these two structures are superimposed by their common secondary structural elements, Cα of Lys27 deviates by 3.5 Å from its equivalent atom in the human structure. The C-terminal end of aH2 helix also deviates by more than 2 Å. No crystal contact either in the human or bacterial structure can account for these deviations. In the bacterial structure, the 7-residue insertion in the b-subunit also extends the bH3 helix by 4 residues at its C-terminal end. The loops connecting different layers of α-helices and β-sheets form a deep funnel-shaped active site centered at the N-terminal Thr152 of the b-subunit (Fig. 1). The funnel in the bacterial enzyme is wider than that of the human enzyme, mainly because of deviation of the loop between helix aH2 and strand aS2 as well as lack of the C-terminal loop in the a-subunit (Fig. 1 c). Several conserved residues surround the nucleophilic center Thr152 of the bacterial active site, including Thr170, Arg180, Asp183, Thr203, and Gly204, which are highlighted inyellow in Fig. 2. These residues had been described to interact with aspartate, one of the two reaction products (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the human equivalent to Arg180 forms hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl group of aspartate. Both human equivalent residues of Asp183 and Gly204 make hydrogen bonds with the α-amino group of aspartate. Human residues equivalent to Thr152, Thr203, and Gly204 also form hydrogen bonds with the Oδ1 of aspartate. In addition, human residue equivalent to Thr170 makes a hydrogen bond with the Oγ of Thr152. Additional conserved residues not described previously also might participate in either ligand binding or catalysis. Residue Trp11 has a putative role in carbohydrate binding (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is also near the N-terminal nucleophile and may participate in catalysis, possibly through a bridging water molecule. In line with this suggestion, mutation of Trp11 to Ser (W11S) affects enzyme specificity for substrates with or without carbohydrate moiety (23Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kcat of the W11S mutant was reduced by more than 400-fold, suggesting an additional role of Trp11 in regulating enzyme catalysis. Contrary to a previous suggestion (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), human Phe278 might not contribute to carbohydrate binding, because sequence alignment shows that this residue is not conserved either in the bacterial (Gln254 in Fig. 2) or insect (Met278 in Ref. 3Liu Y.

https://openalex.org/W2000173206,"In order to investigate the gene activation mechanism triggered by the CO binding to CooA, a heme-containing transcriptional activator, the heme environmental structure and the dynamics of the CO rebinding and dissociation have been examined in the absence and presence of its target DNA. In the absence of DNA, the Fe-CO and C=O stretching Raman lines of the CO-bound CooA were observed at 487 and 1969 cm−1, respectively, suggesting that a neutral histidine is an axial ligand trans to CO. The frequency of ν(Fe-CO) implies an open conformation of the distal heme pocket, indicating that the ligand replaced by CO is located away from the bound CO. When the target DNA was added to CO-bound CooA, an appearance of a new ν(Fe-CO) line at 519 cm−1 and narrowing of the main line at 486 cm−1 were observed. Although the rate of the CO dissociation was insensitive to the additions of DNA, the CO rebinding was decelerated in the presence of the target DNA, but not in the presence of nonsense DNA. These observations demonstrate the structural alterations in the heme distal site in response to binding of the target DNA and support the activation mechanism proposed for CooA, which is triggered by the movement of the heme distal ligand to modify the conformation of the DNA binding domain.

The purple, nonsulfur, phototrophic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum synthesizes a series of enzymes that oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) into carbon dioxide, which is coupled to the evolution of molecular hydrogen (3Bonam D.

CooA is a homodimer containing 222 amino acid residues in each subunit (2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent success of the high level expression of CooA inEscherichia coli has enabled us and other researchers to obtain enough homogeneous protein for spectroscopic investigations (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was revealed that each subunit of CooA contains a singleb-type heme as a prosthetic group, which can bind exogenous CO reversibly, as is evidenced by its optical absorption spectra (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The significant homology between CooA and CRP suggests that CooA consists of two domains, N-terminal effector binding domain and C-terminal DNA-binding domain containing the helix-turn-helix motif (11McKay D.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1981; 290: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our recent mutagenesis work confirmed that the N-terminal region of CooA consisting of amino acid residues from Met-1 to Met-131 is the heme binding domain (14Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alteration at the heme center caused by the CO binding should be transmitted to the DNA-binding domain, which increases the affinity of CooA with the target DNA. The molecular mechanism of this process remains to be elucidated and would be an important contribution to the understanding of the transcriptional activation in prokaryotes. The CO binding to the heme has special importance for characterization of heme proteins. The vibrational frequencies of the Fe-CO unit detected by resonance Raman and infrared spectroscopies are used to characterize the axial ligand trans to the bound CO as well as the polarity of the distal heme pocket (15Yu N.-T.

The rebinding kinetics of CO after photodissociation from CO-bound hemes reflect the environment around the hemes. The characterization of CO-bound CooA is of special interest, since it is the CO-bound form of CooA that plays crucial and physiological role in its gene activation (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K.

We have, therefore, undertaken the resonance Raman investigation on the CO-bound and reduced forms of CooA. CO rebinding kinetics of CooA were also determined by a laser photolysis method. It has been confirmed that the ferrous protein is in a six-coordinated form with two axial ligands, one of which is suggested to be a histidine residue (2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Addition of CO to the reduced protein causes the replacement of the other axial ligand by CO and creates the open distal pocket. The conformation of the distal heme site was modulated by the specific interaction with the target DNA. These results are consistent with the signal transduction mechanism proposed for CooA that the specific DNA binding is induced by the movement of the distal ligand triggered by the CO binding (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The protein expression and preparation were performed as described previously (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, recombinant CooA was expressed in E. coli JM109 and purified using consecutive column chromatographies; a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a Chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR 10/10). After removing salts by dialysis against an appropriate buffer, the sample was used for spectroscopic measurements. Reduced CooA was prepared by adding a slight excess of freshly prepared dithionite solution under argon atmosphere into the protein solution. CO-bound CooA was prepared by introducing gaseous CO into the reduced sample. The resonance Raman spectra were obtained by excitation with 413.1-nm light from a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics, model 2016). The scattered light was dispersed with a single polychromator (Ritsu, DG-1000) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Astromed, CCD3200). The spectral slit width was ∼6 cm−1. The sample solutions for Raman measurements were sealed in quartz cells which were rotated at ∼1000 rpm at room temperature. Typically, the sample aliquots were 5 μm on the basis of heme content dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0. Raman shifts were calibrated using heat indene, CCl4, and an aqueous solution of potassium ferrocyanide as frequency standards, providing accuracy of ±1 cm−1 for intense isolated lines. The laser light was focused into the cell so that the laser power was ∼0.6 milliwatts for CooA-CO to avoid photolysis of the iron-bound CO, and ∼3 milliwatts for ferrous CooA. Absorption spectra were measured both prior to and after Raman measurements, and no degradation was detected under the experimental condition applied in this study. The kinetics of CO rebinding were obtained by a laser photolysis apparatus (19Uchida T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30108-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The absorption changes were monitored at 420 nm using a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu, R2949) and digitized by a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS-520A). The second harmonic (532 nm, 6-ns pulse width) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite-I) was used for the photolysis. The incident power was about 10 mJ. The CO concentrations were varied every 0.2 mm from 0.2 to 1.0 mm by using a gas mixer (Stec, SGD-XC). The apparent rate constants, kobs, calculated from the kinetic traces were plotted against CO concentrations to estimate the bimolecular recombination rate constant (kon =kobs/[CO]). The CO dissociation rate constants (koff) were determined by rapidly mixing CooA-CO with equal volume of a concentrated (20 mm) potassium ferricyanide (20Millikan G.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1936; 120: 366-388Crossref Google Scholar, 21Wittenberg B.A. Brunori M. Antonini E. Wittenberg J.B. Wyman J. Arch. Biochem.

The time courses were monitored at 566 nm with a spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda19) or a rapid scanning monochrometer (Olis, RSM-1000). The sample solutions used for the kinetic measurements typically contained 20 μm CooA in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, 20 °C. A representative DNA sequence recognized by CooA is as follows (10He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

The strands were annealed at room temperature for about 3 h after heating at 80 °C for 5 min. Nonsense DNA of 34-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides was prepared by the same method as the target DNA. Resonance Raman spectra and CO rebinding kinetics of DNA-bound CooA were measured after incubating the protein solution with the appropriate amount of DNA at room temperature for more than 30 min. The high frequency resonance Raman spectra (1200–1700 cm−1) of the dithionite-reduced (spectrum A), and CO-bound (spectrum B) forms of CooA are presented in Fig. 1, and the observed frequencies of the major lines are compared with those of cytochrome c (22Hu S.Z.

It is established that the lines in the high frequency region can be used as sensitive markers of the oxidation state (ν4) and spin and coordination states (ν2 and ν3) of the heme iron (26Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Application of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar). The polarized lines at 1579 and 1491 cm−1observed for the dithionite-reduced form can be assigned to ν2 and ν3, respectively (polarization data not shown), whose frequencies indicate that the heme iron is six-coordinate low spin as found for cytochromeb5. As we will discuss later, CO-bound CooA is likely to have a histidine as a fifth ligand, which should also be one of the axial ligands in the reduced protein. Coordination of methionine or cysteine as the other axial ligand can probably be excluded, since the frequency of ν2 usually appears at around 1590 cm−1 for His/Met or His/Cys ligand pairs, 10 cm−1 higher than that for CooA (22Hu S.Z.

Furthermore, the absorption maxima of the α, β, and Soret absorption bands for ferrous CooA are 559, 529, and 425 nm, respectively (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which are distinct from those of cytochrome c (550, 522, and 414 nm) (28Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol.

Since the absorption peaks in the optical spectrum are rather similar to those of cytochrome b5 (556, 526, and 423 nm) (30Strittmatter P. Velick S.F. J. Biol.

The resonance Raman spectrum for the CooA-CO complex (spectrum B, Fig. 1) is characteristic of a low spin six-coordinated heme and resembles that of Mb-CO. Fig.2 shows resonance Raman spectra in the Fe-CO stretching and the C=O stretching frequency regions of the natural abundance CO (spectrum A) and13CO-labeled CO (spectrum B) adducts of CooA. A line at 487 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching mode of Fe-CO, ν(Fe-CO), on account of its 4 cm−1 low frequency shift upon the 13CO substitution. The C=O stretching frequency, ν(C=O), appeared at 1969 cm−1 for natural abundance CO and at 1927 cm−1 for 13CO. There is a well-known inverse correlation between the frequencies of the Fe-CO and C=O stretching modes (15Yu N.-T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III.

The frequencies measured for CooA-CO lie on the line composed by heme proteins with neutral histidine as a proximal ligand (correlation plot not shown). This result, as well as the appearance of the Soret absorption maximum at 422 nm, suggests that a histidine ligates to the heme iron in CO-bound CooA, 2The NO-bound ferrous CooA is unstable, which precludes us from establishing the coordinated histidine by ESR spectroscopy and estimating the koff rate of CO by the conventional NO-replacement method., 3We failed in detecting the transient ν(Fe-His) Raman line from the photodissociated CooA, probably due to the fast and large geminate process as described under “Results and Discussion.” We estimate that the total yield of the bimolecular process is at most 10%, which causes detection of the line to be extremely difficult. which can be compared with the recent mutagenesis studies demonstrating His-77 as a possible candidate for the ligand (2Shelver D.

The isolated Fe-CO unit as is observed for model compounds and for Mb-CO in the acidic solution shows frequencies at ∼490 and ∼1965 cm−1 for ν(Fe-CO) and ν(C=O), respectively, and is labeled as the A0 conformer in Mb (34Morikis D. Champion P.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4791-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is considered that the distal His swings out of the heme pocket and influences no positive interaction on the Fe-CO unit of acidic Mb (17Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4791-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The appearances of ν(Fe-CO) and ν(C=O) at 487 and 1969 cm−1, respectively, for CO-bound CooA demonstrate that the Fe-CO unit has a conformation similar to the A0 conformer of Mb. This observation indicates the absence of any significant interactions between the bound CO and the distal heme pocket, that is, the absence of the distal histidine or any positively and sterically interacting residues around the iron-bound CO. Since ferrous CooA has a six-coordinated iron, CO should replace one of the axial ligands to form CO-bound CooA. The replaced ligand, whose identity has not been specified, moves away and affords no interaction with the bound CO. The absence of the distal amino acid residues that interact with CO is consistent with the observation that stable oxygen-bound CooA is not formed (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), because the interaction with the positively charged residue would stabilize the iron-bound oxygen. In spectrum A of Fig. 2, the Fe-C-O bending mode, δ(Fe-C-O), was not observed. The low intensity of δ(Fe-C-O) is characteristic of heme proteins with an unconstrained heme pocket (15Yu N.-T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar), further supporting the open conformer of CO-bound CooA. Fig. 3 depicts the resonance Raman spectra of natural abundance (spectrum B) and13C18O-labeled (spectrum C) CO-bound CooA in the presence of the target DNA. Comparing with the spectrum obtained in the absence of DNA (spectrum A), addition of 20 eq of the target DNA per monomeric CooA results in the narrowing of the major ν(Fe-CO) line at 486 cm−1 from 20 to 15 cm−1 measured by Gaussian line fitting concomitant with the appearance of a weak line at 519 cm−1. Both of the lines can be assigned to Fe-CO stretching modes, because the isotopic shifts for both lines were observed (spectrum D). 5We could not detect the C=O stretching Raman line in the presence of the target DNA due to the strong fluorescence background originating from the DNA. Detection of the line using infrared spectroscopy was also found impossible, because of its necessity to use concentrated samples (>1 mm), which caused aggregation of the target DNA. The frequency at 519 cm−1 corresponds to the A3 conformer of Mb-CO (34Morikis D. Champion P.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4791-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These observations show that the specific DNA binding causes the structural change around the distal heme environment, which shifts the equilibrium between A0 and A3conformers to the A3 site and the narrowing of the A0 mode. Although some controversy exists on the interpretation of the A3 conformer of Mb (18Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S.

A side chain of the replaced axial ligand is a possible candidate that exerts hydrogen-bonding interaction to the iron-bound CO. This result demonstrates that the distal heme site and the DNA binding domain of CooA are structurally connected to each other. Although the observed effects of the DNA binding are relatively minor, we consider it reasonable since the CO-bound protein is in the DNA-binding form either in the presence and the absence of the target DNA. The kinetics of CO recombination to ferrous CooA after the photolysis of CO in the absence of the target DNA is illustrated as trace A of Fig. 4. The observed kinetics consists of bimolecular and geminate processes (geminate data not shown). We could not resolve the geminate process well due to its fastness that is comparable to the response time of our system (about 20 ns).3 The bimolecular process can be separated into three exponentials. The linear dependence of the decay rate constants (kobs) of the exponentials on CO concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 mm ascertains that they are the bimolecular rebinding reactions. The calculated association rate constants (kon) and the relative populations are 32, 6.8, and 1.2 μm−1 s−1, and 53, 31, and 16%, respectively (Table II). The relative populations are independent of the CO concentration. The kinetic difference spectra between the transient and the initial CO-bound species show that the CO rebinds to the five-coordinated heme before the coordination of the internal ligand (data not shown). The observed heterogeneity, hence, suggests the presence of conformational transitions that compete with the CO rebinding within the five-coordinated protein. The transitions between the activated and inactivated forms and/or the allosteric interaction between the two monomers are possibly responsible for the observed heterogeneity. The addition of the target DNA decelerated the CO association (trace B), while the kinetic trace was insensitive to the addition of nonsense DNA (trace C). The DNA titration experiment shows that the change reached a maximum with 10 eq of the target DNA per monomeric CooA without changing the quantum yield of the photodissociation (data not shown). The fitting calculation of trace B gives rate constants of 24 (43%), 6.4 (40%), and 1.2 (17%) μm−1 s−1 and shows that the fastest phase is primarily decelerated. The slow CO association demonstrates that the CO binding site is more crowded in the DNA-bound conformer, which is consistent with the observed conformational transition of the Fe-CO unit.Table IIKinetic rate constants for CO bimolecular rebinding and dissociation reactions of CooA in the presence and absence of the target DNA at 20 °CProteinkon1kon2kon3koffμm−1 s−1s−1CooA − DNA (%)aValues in parentheses describe the relative population of each component.32 ± 1 (53 ± 5)6.8 ± 0.5 (31 ± 2)1.2 ± 0.1 (16 ± 3)0.021 ± 0.003CooA + DNA (%)24 ± 1 (43 ± 5)6.4 ± 0.1 (40 ± 2)1.2 ± 0.1 (17 ± 4)0.023 ± 0.003a Values in parentheses describe the relative population of each component.

The obtained rate constants are 0.021 ± 0.003 s−1, 0.021 ± 0.004 s−1, and 0.023 ± 0.003 s−1 for the samples without DNA, in the presence of nonsense DNA, and in the presence of the target DNA, respectively. All values are identical within our experimental uncertainty, and are similar to those of myoglobin and each subunit of hemoglobin possessing a neutral histidine as a trans ligand (36Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). If we estimate the change in the free energy between the CO-bound and unbound (five-coordinated) states using the fastest konrate (ΔG = −RTln(kon[CO]/koff)), the largest difference caused by the DNA binding (ΔΔG = ΔG−DNA − ΔG+DNA) is not more than 1 kJ mol−1. This is in accordance with the cAMP binding to CRP at low salt concentration, whose free energy difference is about 2 kJ mol−1 (37Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the activation of CooA is induced by the displacement of the distal ligand by CO, which in turn modifies the conformation of the DNA binding domain (1Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The present resonance Raman and kinetic data afford the first experimental evidence that supports the proposed mechanism. First, the open conformation of the Fe-CO unit for CO-bound CooA in the absence of DNA implicates that the distal ligand in the ferrous form is replaced by CO with a rather large conformational transition. Second, the structure of the heme distal site of CooA-CO is susceptible to the conformational transition at the DNA binding domain. This suggests that the structural alterations around the heme distal site can be efficiently transmitted to the DNA-binding domain of CooA. Further spectroscopic and kinetic investigations combined with the site-directed mutagenesis are important to clarify the heme coordination structure as well as the gene-activation mechanism of CooA. We are grateful to Prof. T. Kitagawa (Institute of Molecular Science) for kind permission to use his resonance Raman observing system."

Previous studies using two domain switch PKC chimera revealed that the catalytic domains of PKC α and βII contain molecular determinants important for isozyme-specific function (Walker, S. D., Murray, N. R., Burns, D. J., and Fields, A. P. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 9156–9160). We have now analyzed a panel of PKC chimeras to determine the specific region within the catalytic domain important for PKC βII function. A cellular assay for PKC βII function was devised based on the finding that PKC βII selectively translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear lamin B in response to the PKC activator bryostatin. This response is strictly dependent upon expression of PKC βII or a PKC chimera that functions like PKC βII. We demonstrate that a PKC α/βIIchimera containing only the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids from PKC βII (βII V5) is capable of nuclear translocation and lamin B phosphorylation. These results are consistent with our recent observation that the PKC βII V5 region binds to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a potent and selective PKC βII activator present in the nuclear membrane (Murray, N. R., and Fields, A. P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11514–11520). Soluble βII V5 peptide selectively inhibits PG-stimulated PKC βII activity in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that PG-mediated activation of PKC βII involves interactions with the βII V5 region of the enzyme. We conclude that βII V5 is a major determinant for PKC βIInuclear function and suggest a model in which binding of PG to the βII V5 region stimulates nuclear PKC βIIactivity during G2 phase of the cell cycle.

In human erythroleukemia (K562) cells, we determined that PKC α is involved in PMA-induced cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J.

In order to study the molecular basis of PKC α and βIIisozyme function, we expressed two domain switch chimeras between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKC α and βII in K562 cells (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These chimeras demonstrated that the catalytic domains of PKC α and βII contain determinants that are critical for isozyme-specific function (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specifically, a PKC βII/α chimera, consisting of the regulatory domain of PKC βII and the catalytic domain of PKC α, exhibited a phenotype resembling wild type PKC α (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Conversely, a PKC α/βII chimera, composed of the regulatory domain of PKC α and the catalytic domain of PKC βII, behaved like wild type PKC βII (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, we wished to define the isozyme-specific determinants within the catalytic domain of PKC βII. For this purpose, we constructed and expressed a series of α/βII PKC chimeras in which the variable and constant regions within the catalytic domain of PKC βII were replaced by the corresponding PKC α regions. Our results demonstrate that the V5 region of PKC βII (βII V5), consisting of the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids of PKC βII, contains the molecular determinant necessary for nuclear translocation and activation of the enzyme. These results are interesting, in light of our recent studies demonstrating that the V5 region of PKC βII binds phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a nuclear activator of the enzyme (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A soluble peptide corresponding to βII V5 inhibits PG-stimulated PKC βIIactivity, indicating that interactions between PG and the βII V5 region are important for PG-mediated activation of PKC βII. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the cell cycle-regulated activation of nuclear PKC βII. In previous work, we demonstrated that a chimera consisting of the regulatory domain of PKC α (αV1–V3) and the catalytic domain of PKC βII(βII C3–V5) behaved like PKC βII (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed PKC α/βII chimeras in which each of the constant and variable regions within the catalytic domain of this chimera was replaced with the corresponding PKC α sequence (Fig. 1). PKC chimeras were constructed by two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The first step in the chimera construction was to amplify the desired PKC α and PKC β portions of the chimera using the appropriate 5′ and 3′ end primers, internal chimeric primers, and either PKC α or PKC βIIcDNA as a template. The internal primers were constructed so that they would anneal in the second PCR step. Products from the first PCR step were gel-purified and combined, along with 5′ and 3′ end primers, and the complete chimera produced by extension and amplification. The primers used for construction of the chimeras are presented in TableI. The end primers contained restriction sites (5′ KpnI and 3′ NheI) to facilitate subsequent cloning. Completed chimeras were gel-purified and cloned into the TA PCR cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). The chimeras were restricted from pCR 2.1 using KpnI and NheI and ligated into the KpnI and NheI sites within the multiple cloning site of the episomal expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen).Table IPCR primers used to construct PKC chimerasEnd primers 5′α5′-GGTCTCTAGAGGTACCATGGCTGACGTTTTCCC-3′ 3′βII5′-CCGCGCTAGCTTAGCTCTTGACTTCGG-3′Internal chimeric primersaAS, antisense; S, sense. βII V4AS5′-GCGGCTTCCCAGGCAGGGCCAAGACTCG-3′S5′-CGAGTCTTGGCCCTGCCTGGGAAGCCGC-3′ βII C4AS5′-GAGCTGGGTCAGGAACGGGGGTTTGTCAAGS5′-CTTGACAAACCCCCGTTCCTGACCCAGCTC-3′ αβIIαAS5′-TCATACTGCACTCTGTAAGATGGGGTGCACAAACTGGGGGTTGACATAGGAAAATCCTTC-3′ βII 1504AS5′-GGAGTGCCACAGAAGGTCCTGGTCG-3′S5′-CGACCAGGACCTTCTGTGGCACTCC-3′ βII 1851AS5′-CCACAAGCTTTTGGCTTGAATGGTGG-3′S5′-CCACCATTCAAGCCAAAAGCTTGTGG-3′ βII V5AS5′-TTCAGAGTTAACAAACGAGAACCCTTCAAAATC3′S5′-GATTTTGAAGGGTTCTCGTTTGTTAACTCTGAA-3′a AS, antisense; S, sense. Open table in a new tab Human erythroleukemia K562 cells (ATCC) were maintained in suspension culture as described previously (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the pREP4 plasmids containing the PKC chimera constructs using DOTAP lipofection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, fresh medium containing 250 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) was added to the cultures and transfectants selected for 3–4 weeks. K562 cell transfectants were maintained continuously in growth medium supplemented with 250 units/ml hygromycin B. Expression of PKC chimeras was determined by immunoblot analysis using previously characterized isotype-specific antibodies directed against the V5 regions of PKC α and βII (14Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, K562 cell transfectants were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated for 30 s in SDS sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), and boiled for 5 min. Total cell extracts from 1 × 105 cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric nature of the chimeras was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using isozyme-specific antibodies against the V3 region of PKC α and βII as described previously (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). K562 cell transfectants carrying either control vector (pREP4) or PKC chimera-containing pREP4 vectors were treated with 30 nm PMA (LC Laboratories) or diluent (0.1% Me2SO). Previous studies demonstrated that this PMA treatment leads to loss of immunologically detectable PKC βII and loss of bryostatin-mediated lamin B phosphorylation (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following the 48-h PMA treatment, total cell lysates were prepared from an aliquot of cells and subjected to immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific PKC α V5 and βII V5 antibodies as described above. The remainder of the cells were incubated in the presence and absence of bryostatin 1 (100 nm, LC Laboratories) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by nuclear envelope isolation and determination of lamin B phosphorylation as described previously (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In vitro protein kinase C assays were carried out using purified baculovirus-expressed human PKC βII as described previously (15Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed in assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 40 μg/ml (50 μm) phosphatidylserine (PS, Avanti Polar Lipids), 20 μm dioctanoylglycerol (DAG, Avanti Polar Lipids), and 10 μg of histone H1 for 15 min at 25 °C. In most reactions, 250 μg/ml (315 μm) dioleoyl PG (Avanti Polar Lipids) was added to maximally stimulate PKC βII activity (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to βII V5 (CFVNSEFLKPEVKS) or α V5 (CQFVHPILQSSV) were added at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Histone H1 phosphorylation was quantitated using phosphorimaging analysis as described previously (12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our previous finding that the catalytic domain of PKC βII is crucial for PKC βII function (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we generated a series of PKC chimeras in which the variable and constant regions within the catalytic domain of PKC βIIwere exchanged with the corresponding sequences from PKC α by two-step PCR as depicted in Fig. 1. To investigate the biochemical properties of these chimeras in intact K562 cells, chimeric PKC constructs were subcloned into the pREP4 episomal expression vector and transfected into K562 cells. Expression of the PKC chimeras was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal V5 regions of PKC α and βII (Fig. 2). Expression of each of the chimeras containing the βII V5 region (βII V4, βII C4, βII V5, βII 1504, and βII 1851) was confirmed using the PKC βII V5 antibody (Fig. 2 A). Expression of the α βII α chimera, which contains the carboxyl-terminal V5 region from PKC α, was confirmed using the PKC α V5 antibody (Fig. 2 B). In each case, a band with apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa was detected, corresponding in size to intact PKC α and βII protein. The level of expression for all chimeras was determined by densitometric analysis to be between 2- and 3-fold that of the endogenous levels of PKC α or PKC βII. The chimeric nature of each of the chimeras was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the appropriate PKC α and βII-specific V3 antibodies as described previously (Ref.16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; data not shown). Our previous studies demonstrated that treatment of K562 cells with PMA for 48 h leads to an increase in PKC α expression and a loss of PKC βII expression (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wished to assess the fate of PKC chimeras expressed in K562 cells following treatment with PMA. For this purpose, K562 cell transfectants were treated with PMA (30 nm) for 48 h. Transfectants were harvested and immunoblotted as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3). As expected, endogenous PKC βII expression was dramatically reduced as a consequence of PMA treatment (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 and2) (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, in contrast to endogenous PKC βII, the expression of each of the transfected PKC chimeras (βII V4, βII C4, βII 1504, βII 1851, βII V5, and αβIIα) persists after PMA treatment (Fig. 3,A and B). The observation that expression of PKC chimera persists after chronic PMA treatment while endogenous PKC βIIlevels are dramatically reduced suggested a strategy to specifically determine whether the transfected PKC chimeras could function like PKC βII in intact K562 cells without the contribution of endogenous PKC βII. This strategy is predicated upon several key observations. First, PKC βII is selectively translocated and activated at the cell nucleus in response to bryostatin but not PMA (9Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol.

Second, bryostatin-mediated translocation of PKC βII to the nucleus leads to direct phosphorylation of the nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B (11Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8253-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Third, the ability of bryostatin to stimulate nuclear lamin B phosphorylation is strictly dependent upon the expression of PKC βII (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, when K562 cells are treated with PMA, both PKC βII expression and bryostatin-mediated lamin B phosphorylation is lost (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the ability of the transfected PKC chimeras to reconstitute bryostatin-mediated lamin B phosphorylation in PMA-treated K562 cell transfectants as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.4). Treatment of K562 cells containing an empty control vector with PMA leads to the expected loss in bryostatin-mediated lamin B phosphorylation, whereas cells not treated with PMA exhibited robust lamin B phosphorylation in response to bryostatin (Fig. 4, compare panels labeled Control (−PMA) and Control (+PMA). K562 cells expressing the βII V4, βII C4, βII 1504, βII 1851, and βII V5 chimeras were all capable of reconstituting bryostatin-mediated lamin B phosphorylation after treatment with PMA. In contrast, cells expressing the αβIIα chimera were incapable of reconstituting the bryostatin-mediated response. From these results, we conclude that chimeras containing the functional determinant important for PKC βII function are capable of reconstituting PKC βII-dependent lamin B phosphorylation. Furthermore, our analysis localizes this functional determinant to the extreme carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids of PKC βII(βII V5), since a chimera containing only these 13 amino acid residues from PKC βII (PKC βII V5) is capable of functioning in this PKC βII-selective pathway. The results from the PKC chimera studies demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal V5 region of PKC βII represents a molecular determinant for PKC βII-selective function in intact K562 cells. In recent studies, we identified a component of the nuclear membrane, termed nuclear membrane activation factor (NMAF), which selectively activates PKC βII (19Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21385-21390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we identified NMAF as PG (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PG was found to be a potent and selective activator of PKC βII, stimulating the enzyme 3–5-fold above the level of activity seen in the presence of optimal concentrations of PS, DAG, and calcium (19Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21385-21390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that PG binds selectively and saturably to the carboxyl-terminal region of PKC βII(17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that PG stimulates PKC βII activity through interactions involving βII V5. To specifically test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of soluble βII V5 peptide on PG-stimulated PKC βIIactivity in vitro (Fig. 5). As reported previously (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) addition of 315 μm PG stimulates PKC βII more than 4-fold over the level in the absence of PG. This stimulation is specific for PG since it is not observed in the presence of 370 μm PS (data not shown). Inclusion of βII V5 peptide in the kinase assay leads to inhibition of PG-stimulated PKC βII histone kinase activity (Fig.5 A, lane 5). Inhibition is specific for the βII V5 peptide, since no inhibition is observed using the corresponding V5 peptide from PKC α (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Inhibition by βII V5 peptide is dose-dependent with an apparent IC50 of ∼100 μm (Fig. 5 B), whereas significant inhibition was not observed with the corresponding α V5 peptide. Interestingly, the βII V5 peptide inhibits only the PG-stimulated component of PKC βII activity and not calcium-, DAG-, and PS-stimulated activity. These results are consistent with the conclusion that PG mediates activation through the carboxyl-terminal V5 region of PKC βII, whereas calcium, DAG, and PS mediate activation by binding to the C1 and C2 regions within the regulatory domain of the enzyme. The PKC family of serine/threonine kinases serves critical roles in cellular function. Recent studies have begun to elucidate specific roles for individual PKC isozymes (1Murray N.R. Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. Protein Kinase C Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit. R. G. Landis Co., Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 3Clemens M.J. Trayner I. Menaya J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). We have identified roles for the three major PKC isozymes in human K562 leukemia cells. K562 cells express PKC α, βII, and ι, and each of these isozymes serve distinct functions in these cells. PKC α is important in cellular differentiation (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKC βII is required for cellular proliferation (10Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PKC ι plays a critical role in leukemia cell survival and resistance to apoptosis (20Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, despite our knowledge of the importance of these isozymes in cellular physiology, less is known about the specific pathways in which these isozymes function, the relevant cellular targets of their action, and the mechanisms by which they maintain isozyme identity within the intact cell. We have addressed these questions in the case of PKC βII. PKC βII is required for cell cycle progression through the G2/M phase transition (12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PKC βII is activated at the nucleus during late G2 phase just prior to mitosis in synchronized cells (12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the nucleus, PKC βII mediates direct phosphorylation of the nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B on sites involved in mitotic nuclear lamina disassembly (12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKC βII activation leads to cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, demonstrating the importance of nuclear PKC βII activation and lamin B phosphorylation in entry into mitosis (13Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nuclear PKC βII activation is regulated by several factors. First, a nuclear phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity generates a peak of diacylglycerol at the nuclear membrane during G2 phase that serves to activate nuclear PKC βII (21Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second, the nuclear membrane contains a potent activator of PKC βII that stimulates its activity above the level observed in the presence of optimal calcium, DAG, and PS (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,19Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21385-21390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activator, originally termed NMAF, was recently identified as the phospholipid PG (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The selectivity of PG for PKC βII activation suggested that PG might function through interactions within the carboxyl-terminal V5 region of PKC βII. Indeed, we have demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of PKC βII binds selectively and saturably to PG-containing vesicles, but not to vesicles containing other phospholipids (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we wished to determine the molecular determinants on PKC βII that allow it to translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate lamin B in intact cells, a process that we have demonstrated requires PKC βII expression (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that a chimera between PKC α and PKC βII containing the catalytic domain of PKC βII was capable of translocating to the nucleus and phosphorylating lamin B (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, a chimera containing the catalytic domain of PKC α was not capable of mediating this response (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). From these data, we concluded that regions within the catalytic domain of PKC βII serve as a molecular determinant of PKC βII function (16Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have now used further PKC α/βII chimeras to map this molecular determinant to the extreme carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids of PKC βII. The results of this study are interesting in light of our recent finding that the V5 region of PKC βII mediates binding to PG (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, we now demonstrate that a βII V5 peptide selectively inhibits PG-stimulated PKC βII activity in a dose-dependent fashion. These results indicate that interactions between PG and βII V5 are important for PG- stimulated PKC βII activity. The identification of the carboxyl-terminal region of PKC βII as an important region regulating isozyme specific function is consistent with recent studies suggesting the importance of this region to PKC function. The V5 region of PKC α has recently been shown to interact with PICK 1, a PKC-binding protein, through PDZ domain-like interactions (22Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). PICK1 has been suggested to play a role in targeting PKC α to appropriate intracellular sites where it can transduce isozyme-specific signals (22Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Likewise, we have demonstrated that interaction of the V5 region of PKC βII, in this case with the phospholipid PG, is important for the nuclear translocation and activation of the enzyme at the nuclear membrane, where it is required for nuclear lamina disassembly and entry into mitosis (17Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11514-11520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, studies investigating the differential regulation of PKC βI and βIIactivity by calcium have led to the suggestion that the V5 region of PKC βII interacts with the C2 region of the enzyme to influence calcium- and PS-mediated enzyme activation (23Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given our recent data on nuclear activation of PKC βII, the proposed interdomain interactions involving the C2 and V5 regions of PKC βII, and related studies on the mechanism of PKC membrane translocation and activation (24Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar), we propose a working model for the cell cycle-regulated, nuclear activation of PKC βII as illustrated in Fig.6. Soluble PKC βII is stably phosphorylated on at least three known sites (24Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar, 25Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). First, PKC βII is phosphorylated by a putative protein kinase C kinase at threonine 500 in the activation loop of the enzyme (24Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar, 25Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at threonine 500 makes PKC βIIcatalytically competent and triggers subsequent autophosphorylation of threonine 641 and serine 660 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the enzyme. Phosphorylation of these sites stabilizes the catalytically competent conformation of the enzyme and allows its release into the cytosol (24Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar, 25Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In our model, a nuclear PI-PLC isozyme(s), whose activity is linked to cell cycle by an unknown mechanism, is activated during the G2 phase of cell cycle (21Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of nuclear PI-PLC leads to generation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and DAG. We propose that IP3 binds to nuclear IP3 receptors to mobilize intracellular calcium stores, leading to a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations. It has been demonstrated that nuclei contain functional IP3receptors (26Humbert J.P. Matter N. Artault J.-C. Koppler P. Malviya A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and that intracellular calcium concentrations rise in synchronized cells just prior to mitosis (27Ratan R.R. Macfield F.R. Shelanski M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Kao J.P.Y. Alderton J.M. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Hepler P.K. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of this rise in intracellular calcium, using calcium chelators such as BAPTA, leads to cell cycle arrest in G2phase, demonstrating the importance of calcium in entry into mitosis (29Hepler P.K. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We propose that one function of elevated calcium levels is to translocate PKC βII to the inner nuclear membrane. We have not directly determined whether this step involves translocation of PKC βII from cytosolic pools, or alternatively involves translocation of inactive PKC βII from a nucleoplasmic pool. However, based on our fractionation studies (9Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the immunofluorescence studies of others in cultured myocytes (30Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), we favor the hypothesis that this step represents translocation of cytosolic PKC βII to the nucleus. As has been previously demonstrated, binding of calcium to PKC increases its membrane affinity leading to membrane translocation and an increase in affinity of the enzyme for PS (31Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7184-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane bound PKC coordinately binds multiple PS molecules, possibly within the C2 region of the enzyme (34Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that PKC induces calcium-dependent clustering of acidic phospholipids into microdomains that may facilitate cooperative binding of phospholipid to the C2 domain (36Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7961-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We propose that nuclear PG coclusters with PS during this phase of nuclear membrane binding. In the presence of DAG, PKC activation occurs, through displacement of the pseudosubstrate domain from the active site of the enzyme (37Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that the V5 region of PKC βII interacts with the C2 region of the enzyme when it is in its active conformation (23Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We further propose that these V5-C2 interdomain interactions are mediated, at least in part, by binding of the V5 region to PG that is clustered in the same nuclear membrane microdomains containing the PS involved in membrane/C2 domain interactions. Once optimally activated at the inner nuclear membrane, PKC βII directly phosphorylates lamin B at Ser-405 within its carboxyl-terminal globular domain (12Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lamin B is an ideal substrate for nuclear membrane-bound PKC βII since it is intimately associated with the inner nuclear membrane surface by virtue of its carboxyl-terminal isoprenyl groups (38Fields A.P. Thompson L.J. Meijer L. Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 1. Plenum Press, New York1995: 271-286Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of lamin B by PKC, and p34 cdc2/cyclin B kinase, leads to nuclear lamina disassembly, a process required for entry into mitosis (38Fields A.P. Thompson L.J. Meijer L. Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 1. Plenum Press, New York1995: 271-286Google Scholar). Current studies are focused on determining the identity and mechanism of the cell cycle regulation of nuclear PI-PLC and on characterizing the mechanisms by which PG and the V5 region of PKC βII participate, along with the C1 and C2 domains, in regulating nuclear PKC βII activity. We thank B. Sun and Y. Wang for technical assistance in the construction of PKC chimeras, N. R. Murray for many helpful suggestions, and D. Schattenberg for preparation of the PKC model (Fig. 6)."
https://openalex.org/W2029721326,"Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at 10 highly conserved polar residues within the C-terminal half of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, which corresponds to the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase, to identify amino acid side chains that augment the active site tyrosine Tyr-782 in the breakage and rejoining of DNA strands. Complementation tests show that alanine substitution at Arg-690, Asp-697, Lys-700, Arg-704, or Arg-781, but not at His-735, His-736, Glu-738, Gln-750, or Asn-828, inactivates the enzyme in vivo. Measurements of DNA relaxation and cleavage by purified mutant enzymes show that these activities are abolished in the R690A mutant and are much reduced in the mutants D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A. When a Y782F polypeptide with a phenylalanine substituting for the active site tyrosine was expressed in cells that also express the R690A polypeptide, the resulting heterodimeric yeast DNA topoisomerase II was found to nick plasmid DNA. Thus in a dimeric wild-type enzyme, Tyr-782 in one protomer and Arg-690 in the other cooperate intrans in the catalysis of DNA cleavage. For the residues D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A, their locations in the crystal structures of type II DNA topoisomerase fragments suggest that Arg-781 and Lys-700 might be involved in anchoring the 5′ and 3′ sides of the broken DNA, respectively, and the roles of Asp-697 and Arg-704 are probably less direct. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at 10 highly conserved polar residues within the C-terminal half of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, which corresponds to the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase, to identify amino acid side chains that augment the active site tyrosine Tyr-782 in the breakage and rejoining of DNA strands.

Measurements of DNA relaxation and cleavage by purified mutant enzymes show that these activities are abolished in the R690A mutant and are much reduced in the mutants D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A. When a Y782F polypeptide with a phenylalanine substituting for the active site tyrosine was expressed in cells that also express the R690A polypeptide, the resulting heterodimeric yeast DNA topoisomerase II was found to nick plasmid DNA. Thus in a dimeric wild-type enzyme, Tyr-782 in one protomer and Arg-690 in the other cooperate intrans in the catalysis of DNA cleavage. For the residues D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A, their locations in the crystal structures of type II DNA topoisomerase fragments suggest that Arg-781 and Lys-700 might be involved in anchoring the 5′ and 3′ sides of the broken DNA, respectively, and the roles of Asp-697 and Arg-704 are probably less direct. Because of the double helix structure of DNA, its cellular transactions often require the passage of individual DNA strands or double helices through one another. The DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that have evolved to fulfill such requirements. The type I enzymes catalyze DNA strand passage by transiently breaking one DNA strand at a time, and the type II enzymes create transient breaks in both strands of a DNA segment for the enzyme-mediated passage of a second DNA segment (for reviews, see Refs. 1Reese R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 2Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The type I enzymes are further divided into two subfamilies IA and IB that are distinct in terms of their catalytic characteristics and amino acid sequences (3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Although the type II enzymes were thought to form a single subfamily, recent studies suggest that the enzyme DNA topoisomerase VI from archaeal hyperthermophiles may represent a separate subfamily (4Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gradelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).DNA topoisomerases catalyze the breakage of DNA strands via transesterification between an enzyme tyrosyl group and a DNA backbone phosphoryl group, forming a phosphotyrosine link between the two and leaving a deoxyribosyl hydroxyl group on the other end of the broken DNA strand (5Tse Y.-C.

Rejoining of the strand occurs via an apparent reversal of the DNA cleavage reaction; the hydroxyl group formed in the cleavage reaction acts as the nucleophile in a second transesterification, breaking the phosphotyrosine link and reforming the DNA phosphodiester bond. The rejoining reaction could be the exact microscopic reversal of the breakage reaction; conformational changes in the enzyme between the DNA cleavage and rejoining steps are plausible, however, and thus the two reactions could involve transition states that are not identical (12Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).For the type II DNA topoisomerases, sequence alignments of polypeptides other than those of the archaeal DNA topoisomerase VI class show a high degree of homology (see for example, Ref. 13Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Liu L. DNA Topoisomerase and Their Applications in Pharmacology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 271-297Google Scholar). All type II DNA topoisomerases act as homodimers of 1–3 subunits (14Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R.

Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes utilize ATP in their transport of a second DNA segment through such a transiently opened DNA gate (1Reese R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 2Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

According to the two-gate protein clamp model (22Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 23Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a homodimeric type II enzyme bound to a DNA segment (the gate or G segment) acts as an ATP-modulated protein clamp. A second DNA segment (the transported or T segment) can enter an open entrance gate of the protein clamp. The binding of ATP to the enzyme triggers the closure of the entrance gate, and this closure in turn causes a cascade of reactions: the entered DNA segment is forced through a transient opening in the DNA G segment created by the enzyme and expelled through the exit gate of the enzyme (22Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 23Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of a 92-kDa fragment of yeast DNA topoisomerase II spanning amino acid residues 409–1201 was reported in 1996 (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). 1Numbering of amino acid residues was corrected for the presence of an extra asparagine at position 72 of the reported sequence. 1Numbering of amino acid residues was corrected for the presence of an extra asparagine at position 72 of the reported sequence. The region of the single polypeptide yeast enzyme from amino acid residues 409 to about 660 corresponds to the C-terminal half of the B subunit or GyrB 2The abbreviations used are: GyrA and GyrBthe A and B subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase, respectivelyADPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateEenzymeWTwild typekbkilobase pairHMKheart muscle kinase.2The abbreviations used are: GyrA and GyrBthe A and B subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase, respectivelyADPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateEenzymeWTwild typekbkilobase pairHMKheart muscle kinase. protein ofEscherichia coli DNA gyrase and has been termed the B′ subfragment; the region of the yeast enzyme extending from the end of the B′ subfragment to around residue 1200 corresponds to the N-terminal two-thirds of the A subunit or GyrA protein of E. coli DNA gyrase and has been termed the A′ subfragment. The 92-kDa yeast B′A′ fragment forms a homodimer in the crystal and in solution, and this dimeric protein has been shown to cleave double-stranded DNA to form a pair of protein-DNA covalent links (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The last result shows that all residues involved in DNA breakage and rejoining are located within the yeast (B′A′)2 protein.Examination of the 92-kDa structure led to the suggestion that the conformation of the polypeptide in this structure corresponds to that of the yeast enzyme after it has cleaved the DNA G segment and pulled the enzyme-linked DNA ends apart for the passage of the T segment through the widened opening (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). A pair of short DNA helices, each with a four-nucleotide single-stranded extension at a 5′ end, has been modeled into a DNA-binding site in each half of the (B′A′)2protein (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This structural model is supported by recent protein footprinting experiments in which the effects of DNA binding on the citraconylation of individual lysyl side chains in the yeast enzyme were measured (25Li W. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31190-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Recently, the crystal structure of a 59-kDa fragment of E. coli GyrA protein, corresponding to the A′ portion of the 92-kDa yeast fragment, was reported (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This structure is believed to resemble closely the conformation of the polypeptide in a DNA-bound enzyme before the DNA is cleaved by the enzyme (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Based on the distribution of surface charges and the positions of the active site tyrosines in the crystal structure, a curved DNA segment has been modeled into the structure (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Whereas there are significant differences in the spatial arrangements of the various domains within the A′ subfragment in the yeast (B′A′)2 crystal structure and their counterparts in the 59-kDa E. coli GyrA fragment crystal structure, the remarkable conservation of the overall architecture of the polypeptide in the two structures provides strong support of the notion that these enzymes act similarly in their ATP-dependent transport of one duplex DNA segment through another.The crystal structures of the yeast DNA topoisomerase II 92-kDa fragment and the E. coli DNA GyrA 59-kDa fragment have provided much needed structural information for understanding the mechanism of DNA breakage/rejoining by the type II DNA topoisomerases. To gain further mechanistic insight on the reactions they catalyze, we have applied site-directed mutagenesis in the search of residues that are involved in the catalysis of DNA cleavage and rejoining. In the present communication, we report mutagenesis analysis of the A′ subfragment of yeast DNA topoisomerase II.DISCUSSIONThe solution of the three-dimensional structures of the 92-kDa yeast DNA topoisomerase II and the 59-kDa E. coli DNA GyrA fragment and the modeling of bound DNA into them have provided the much needed backdrop for deducing the roles of individual amino acid residues in the catalysis of DNA breakage and rejoining by the type II DNA topoisomerases. It is particularly significant that the conformation of the protein in one structure is believed to represent that of a type II DNA topoisomerase after it has cleaved a DNA and pulled it apart (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), whereas that in the other the state of the enzyme prior to its cleavage of DNA (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).The results reported in this work illustrate the importance of independent tests of conjectures based on structures and homology alignment of related enzymes. The polar residues His-735, His-736, Glu-738, and Gln-750 of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, for example, are highly conserved in a large number of type II DNA topoisomerases from bacteria, eukarea, and archaea, and their positions in the crystal structure of the 92-kDa yeast enzyme fragment are also suggestive of their involvement in DNA breakage and rejoining. Nevertheless, these residues can be replaced by alanine without affecting the functionality of the enzyme in vivo, indicating that they are nonessential in catalysis.From the results reported here, within the GyrA region of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, alanine substitution at five positions, Arg-690, Asp-697, Lys-700, Arg-704, and Arg-781 (side chains coloredred in Fig. 1, A and B), leads to dysfunction of the enzyme in vivo. Examination of Fig. 1,A and B, shows that Arg-781 and its neighboring active site tyrosine Tyr-782 (colored magenta) are located near the 5′-end of the DNA modeled into the protein structure, and Arg-690 and Lys-700 are posed near the 3′-end of the broken DNA. Before the enzyme-linked DNA ends are moved apart following DNA cleavage, however, the amino acid side chains near a pair of 5′ and 3′ ends derived from the same DNA strand must be close together. Therefore Arg-781 and Tyr-782 in one protomer are likely to be close to Arg-690 and Lys-700 of the other protomer of the same dimeric enzyme prior to the separation of the ends. Such a juxtaposed arrangement has also been implicated from the recently reported crystal structure of the 59-kDaE. coli GyrA fragment (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In Fig.6, A and B, theE. coli GyrA crystal structure with a DNA segment modeled into it is depicted (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For ease of comparison, the positions of the gyrase amino acid residues corresponding to those of the yeast enzyme selected for mutagenesis in this work are shown by the samered and blue color coding, and their yeast counterparts are specified in parentheses. It is clear that in the 59-kDa GyrA fragment structure, Arg-121 (Arg-781) and Tyr-122 (Tyr-782) of one protomer and Arg-32 (Arg-690) and Lys-42 (Lys-700) of the other protomer form a patch near a DNA strand modeled into the protein. This patch of highly conserved amino acid residues has been suggested to represent the DNA cleavage and rejoining site of the enzyme (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Therefore both crystal structures hint that in the DNA cleavage/rejoining reaction the active site tyrosyl group and the arginine side chain next to it are interacting with the 5′ side of the scissile phosphate, whereas a positively charged pair of residues, Arg-690 and Lys-700 in the yeast enzyme and Arg-32 and Lys-42 inE. coli GyrA protein, are interacting with the 3′ side of the scissile phosphate.The present work underscores the key importance of Arg-690 of yeast DNA topoisomerase II (Arg-32 of E. coli DNA gyrase A subunit) in the breakage and rejoining of a DNA strand. The experiment shown in Fig. 5 provides strong evidence that the Tyr-782/Arg-690 pair in the yeast enzyme cooperates in trans in the cleavage, and presumably rejoining, of the DNA strand. Such a transmechanism in DNA phosphoryl transfer has been previously shown for the yeast FLP recombinase (38Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3167-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Qian X.-H. Cox M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a member of a family of enzymes involved in site-specific recombination. In the DNA topoisomerase family, the type I enzymes act as monomers, and the type II enzymes act as dimers (3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). The available structural and biochemical evidence suggests, however, that all DNA topoisomerases may share an important common feature for either a type I or a type II enzyme, catalysis of DNA breakage and rejoining are most likely to occur in an interdomainal cleft, with catalytically essential residues from at least two distinct domains. For the type IA enzyme E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, the crystal structure of a 67-kDa fragment has led to the suggestion that the active site tyrosine Tyr-319 in domain III of the fragment may cooperate with residues in domains I and IV in DNA cleavage and rejoining (41Lima C. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-14642Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In support of this conjecture, mutagenesis and biochemical studies indicate that Glu-9 in domain I has a key role in DNA strand cleavage and rejoining (35Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the type IB DNA topoisomerases yeast DNA topoisomerase I and vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, such interdomainal active sites has also been implicated (42Lue N.F. Sharma A. Mondragón A. Wang J.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A priori, placing active site residues in different domains should make it easier to move the ends of the DNA strand after the cleavage reaction and to ensure the correct positioning of these ends for their subsequent rejoining. The recently solved crystal structure of a fragment of phage λ integrase has added an additional example of bipartite active sites; the active site tyrosine Tyr-342 of the enzyme is located on a flexible loop about 20 Å from other essential residues (Ref. 44Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 45Jayaram M. Science. 1997; 276: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar for a discussion on cis and trans mechanisms of DNA recombinases).The locations of the pair of residues Arg-690 and Tyr-782 in the model of yeast DNA topoisomerase II depicted in Fig. 1 are suggestive that this key arginine side chain may interact with the oxygen bridging the scissile phosphorus and the sugar moiety in the DNA backbone, and Lys-700 may augment the positioning of the 3′ side of the scissile strand. The guanidino group of Arg-690 could stabilize the negatively charged 3′-oxygen during DNA strand breakage/rejoining through both hydrogen bonding and charge-pair formation. The nucleotide sequence of a Caenorhabditis elegans gene encoding a type II DNA topoisomerase indicates, however, that in the C. elegansenzyme the position corresponding to Arg-690 of the yeast enzyme is a glutamine (46Sulston J. Du Z. Thomas K. Wilson R. Hillier L. Staden R. Halloran N. Green P. Thierry-Mieg J. Qui L. Dear S. Coulson A. Craxton M. Durbin R. Berks M. Metzstein M. Hawkins T. Ainscough R. Waterston R. Nature. 1992; 356: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus either hydrogen bonding rather than charge-pair formation is the important factor, or a neighboring arginine in the structure of the C. elegans enzyme is fulfilling the role of Arg-690 in the yeast enzyme.The roles of Asp-697 and Arg-704 of the yeast enzyme in the catalysis of DNA breakage and rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of Arg-704 in E. coli DNA gyrase, Arg-46 of the GyrA protein, has been suggested to serve a role of anchoring the 3′ end of the cleaved DNA together with Arg-47, which corresponds to Arg-705 of the yeast enzyme (26Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Arg-705 of the yeast enzyme was not selected for mutagenesis in the present study because the selection criterion of conservation of a common chemical group is violated at this position by the presence of a phenylalanyl residue in phage T4 DNA topoisomerase (13Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Liu L. DNA Topoisomerase and Their Applications in Pharmacology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 271-297Google Scholar). In the crystal structures depicted in Figs. 1 and 6, Arg-704 (Arg-46) and Asp-697 (Asp-39) form an ion pair, and the position of the highly conserved arginine appears to be too far from the DNA in the structural models for direct interaction with the scissile strand. Thus it appears that the primary role of the Arg-704 and Asp-697 pair is probably an indirect architectural one. The residue Asn-828 may serve a similar function.The requirement of residues from both halves of a dimeric type II DNA topoisomerase in each of the DNA cleavage/rejoining sites also provides new insight in the design of inhibitors of this class of enzymes (for reviews, see Refs. 47Liu L.F. DNA Topoisomerases and Their Applications in Pharmacology. Academic Press, Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar and 48Maxwell A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and references therein). Because the proper juxtaposition of these residues involves relative movements between the two enzyme halves, the binding of inhibitors to many different sites of the enzyme may interfere with the proper alignment of these residues and therefore inhibit the catalytic function of the type II DNA topoisomerases.Finally, it should be pointed out that although the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase has often been termed the “breakage-reunion subunit” of the enzyme because of the presence of the active site tyrosyl residue in it, neither GyrA by itself nor its yeast DNA topoisomerase II counterpart exhibits DNA cleavage/rejoining activity. On the other hand, DNA cleavage/rejoining activity is readily detected in E. coli GyrA in combination with the C-terminal half of GyrB (49Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 50Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 8289-8293Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), as well as in the yeast (B′A′)2 protein (24Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Thus one or more residues within the B′ subfragment of yeast DNA topoisomerase II or its homologues must also be present in the catalysis of the breakage and rejoining of DNA strands. Mutagenesis studies of the B′ subfragment of yeast DNA topoisomerase II are being completed and will be reported at a later date. Because of the double helix structure of DNA, its cellular transactions often require the passage of individual DNA strands or double helices through one another. The DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that have evolved to fulfill such requirements. The type I enzymes catalyze DNA strand passage by transiently breaking one DNA strand at a time, and the type II enzymes create transient breaks in both strands of a DNA segment for the enzyme-mediated passage of a second DNA segment (for reviews, see Refs. 1Reese R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 2Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The type I enzymes are further divided into two subfamilies IA and IB that are distinct in terms of their catalytic characteristics and amino acid sequences (3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Although the type II enzymes were thought to form a single subfamily, recent studies suggest that the enzyme DNA topoisomerase VI from archaeal hyperthermophiles may represent a separate subfamily (4Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gradelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerases catalyze the breakage of DNA strands via transesterification between an enzyme tyrosyl group and a DNA backbone phosphoryl group, forming a phosphotyrosine link between the two and leaving a deoxyribosyl hydroxyl group on the other end of the broken DNA strand (5Tse Y.-C.

Rejoining of the strand occurs via an apparent reversal of the DNA cleavage reaction; the hydroxyl group formed in the cleavage reaction acts as the nucleophile in a second transesterification, breaking the phosphotyrosine link and reforming the DNA phosphodiester bond. The rejoining reaction could be the exact microscopic reversal of the breakage reaction; conformational changes in the enzyme between the DNA cleavage and rejoining steps are plausible, however, and thus the two reactions could involve transition states that are not identical (12Stivers J.T.

Erythromycin and other macrolides are important antibacterial antibiotics. The primary mode of action of macrolides is inhibition of protein synthesis, although they can also interfere with ribosome assembly (1Oleinick N.L. Corcoran J.W. Hahn F.E.

Although the molecular mechanisms of action of erythromycin remain obscure, it is clear that the antibiotic blocks the elongation step of translation during early rounds of protein synthesis. The drug has a high affinity for ribosomes with nascent peptides shorter than 2–5 amino acids, but does not bind to ribosomes that carry long nascent peptide chains (9Cundliffe E. Gale F.R.S. Cundliffe E. Reynolds P.E. Richmond M.H. Waring M.J. The Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Action. John Wiley & Sons, London1972: 278-379Google Scholar). It was suggested that erythromycin sterically hinders growth of the nascent peptide chain (2Vazquez D. Corcoran J.W. Hahn F.E. Antibiotics III: Mechanism of Action of Antimicrobial and Antitumor Agents. Springer-Verlag, New York1975: 459-479Google Scholar) and may promote dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA (10Menninger J.R.

Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 810-818Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The clinical use of macrolides is significantly hampered by the growing number of resistant strains. Different mechanisms of resistance have been described (reviewed in Ref. 6Weisblum B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). We have recently described a novel mechanism of erythromycin resistance, which is based on interaction of specific short peptides with the ribosome. The discovery of this resistance mechanism came from an observation that overexpression of a short segment of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA (positions 1235–1268) rendered cells resistant to erythromycin (12Tenson T. DeBlasio A. Mankin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Tenson T. Mankin A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutational and biochemical analyses demonstrated that resistance is caused by translation of a pentapeptide open reading frame (ORF) 1The abbreviations used are: ORFopen reading frameE-peptidepentapeptide conferring erythromycin resistanceK-peptidepentapeptide conferring ketolide resistanceIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. encoded in E. coli 23 S rRNA and is mediated by interaction of the newly translated pentapeptide with the ribosome. The rRNA-encoded pentapeptide is not normally expressed because the Shine-Dalgarno region of the peptide ORF is sequestered in the 23 S rRNA secondary structure. However, the peptide expression can be activated by site-specific fragmentation of rRNA or by rRNA mutations that increase accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno region of E-peptide ORF (14Dam M. Douthwaite S. Tenson T. Mankin A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to get insights into peptide structural features that are essential for erythromycin resistance, other erythromycin resistance peptides were selected from in vivo expressed random peptide libraries (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was found that only short peptides, ranging in size from 3 to 6 amino acids, with specific amino acid sequence can confer erythromycin resistance. Analysis of more than 70 pentapeptides that can confer resistance to erythromycin (E-peptides) revealed a consensus sequence, MXLXV, which could be recognized in the majority of E-peptides and was especially pronounced in the most active E-peptides that could confer very high levels of erythromycin resistance (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). open reading frame pentapeptide conferring erythromycin resistance pentapeptide conferring ketolide resistance isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In vitro studies suggested that the ribosome is the most plausible target of action of E-peptides (12Tenson T. DeBlasio A. Mankin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that chemically synthesized peptides added exogenously to the cell-free translation mixture did not render ribosomes resistant to erythromycin. In contrast, ribosomes that could translate E-peptide mRNA exhibited increased resistance to erythromycin in a cell-free translation system (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, a model ofcis-acting E-peptide was proposed where a newly synthesized E-peptide remains tightly bound to the ribosome and prevents binding of erythromycin into its functional site. Although this model accounted for most of the experimental data, it did not satisfactorily explain why synthetic peptides were not functional in vitro. Furthermore, in order to explain erythromycin resistance of cells expressing E-peptide, we had to invoke a remote possibility that the ribosome-bound E-peptide could be displaced by a newly initiated growing nascent peptide chain. According to this model, E-peptide did not have to interact directly with the drug, and the only requirement for peptide activity was its tight binding to the ribosome in the vicinity of the erythromycin binding site. To test whether there is an interaction between the drug and peptide on the ribosome, we selected peptides conferring resistance to a chemically different macrolide with a mode of action similar to that of erythromycin. We report here isolation of pentapeptides conferring resistance to a new class of macrolide antibiotics, ketolides. The results of this study show a correspondence between peptide structure and the chemical nature of macrolides to which peptide confers resistance, suggesting direct interaction between the resistance peptide and macrolide antibiotic on the ribosome. This finding allowed us to propose a novel model of action of macrolide resistance peptides. Ketolide (HMR3004) was from Roussel Uclaf, France. Erythromycin was purchased from Sigma. E. coli JM109 strain (16Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J.

Construction of the library in the pPOT1AE vector has been described previously (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the physical map of the library plasmid is shown in Fig. 1. The mini-gene library (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol.

Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Twenty-five individual colonies that appeared on the plate were grown in liquid cultures. Plasmids were isolated from 3-ml cultures and used to transform fresh E. coli cells. Transformants were plated onto ampicillin plates, and individual colonies of transformed cells were streaked onto plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 60 μm ketolide with or without addition of 2 mm IPTG. All the selected clones exhibited IPTG-dependent ketolide-resistant phenotype co-transferable with the plasmids. The level of ketolide resistance of the isolated clones was tested in liquid cultures as described previously (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mini-genes in the selected plasmids were sequenced using CCW sequencing primer d(GCCATCGGAAGCTGTGG) (Fig. 1). Construction of a random five-codon mini-gene library was described previously (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this library, mini-genes, containing the ATG initiator codon, followed by four random codons and the TAA terminator codon, were cloned into the pPOT1AE vector where they are expressed from an IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter (Fig.1). This library has been used previously to select for clones that express peptides rendering cells resistant to erythromycin (E-peptides) (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked the question whether the amino acid sequence of the selected resistance peptides depends on the chemical structure of macrolide antibiotic used in selection. Ketolides represent a new generation of 14-member-ring macrolide antibiotics exhibiting increased activity toward erythromycin-resistant ribosomes (17Agouridas C. Bonnefoy A. Chantot J.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ednie L.M. Spangler S.K. Jacobs M.R. Appelbaum P.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The l-cladinose sugar moiety at position 3 of the erythromycin macrolide ring is replaced by a keto group in ketolides (Fig. 2). The general mechanism of action of ketolides is probably similar to that of erythromycin, and both macrolides have overlapping binding sites on the ribosome. 2L. Xiong, S. Shah, P. Mauvais, and A. S. Mankin, unpublished data., 3S. Douthwaite, personal communication.We used one of the ketolide derivatives, HMR3004, to select clones expressing ketolide resistance peptides. The minimal inhibitory concentration of HMR3004 for E. coliJM109 was 10 μm. Clones expressing ketolide resistance peptides (K-peptides) were selected by plating the library onto an agar plate containing 2 mm IPTG and 60 μmketolide. Several clones appeared on the plate after 24 h of incubation, and 25 clones were analyzed. Resistance phenotypes were co-transferable with plasmids isolated from the clones. Furthermore, dependence of ketolide resistance on the presence of IPTG clearly indicated that it was mediated by expression of plasmid-encoded peptide mini-genes (Fig. 3). Sequencing of plasmids from 25 isolated ketolide-resistant clones revealed 6 different peptide mini-genes (Table I), each found in several independent isolates. Remarkably, three mini-genes (clones K3, K9, and K17), which had different nucleotide sequences, encoded the same pentapeptide, MRFFV. The minimal inhibitory concentration of HMR3004 for clones expressing different K-peptides ranged from 60 to 100 μm and thus, significantly exceeded the drug concentration required to inhibit growth of the controlE. coli cells (Table II).Table IThe amino acid sequences of the selected K-peptides and nucleotide sequences of corresponding mini-genesCloneNo. of isolatesMini-gene sequencePeptide sequenceK17ATG TTA TAT AAA CCT TAAM L Y K PK23ATG AAG GAT ACT TCA TAAM K D T SK155ATG TCG TGG AAA ATA TAAM S W K IK33ATG CGC TTT TTT GTC TAAM R F F VK94ATG CGG TTC TTT GTT TAAM R F F VK173ATG CGG TTT TTT GTT TAAM R F F VThe number of independent isolates containing the same mini-gene is shown in the second column.

In previous studies, we found that the amino acid sequence of E-peptides conferring erythromycin resistance conformed to the consensus MXLXV, where the second and the fourth positions were significantly less conserved than the third and the fifth (the first position was occupied by methionine by default) (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence of the K-peptide MRFFV (see Table I) closely resembled that of the E-peptides MRLFV, which conferred resistance to a very high erythromycin concentration (up to 1 mg/ml) (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested whether peptides selected with one antibiotic could confer resistance to the other (K-peptides to erythromycin and, conversely, E-peptides to ketolide). The clone K3 expressing the MRFFV K-peptide and the clone expressing the E-peptide MRLFV were streaked onto agar plates containing ampicillin, IPTG, and either ketolide or erythromycin (Fig. 4). Cells expressing E-peptide were resistant to low concentrations of ketolide, while K-peptide could confer resistance to low concentrations of erythromycin (data not shown). Remarkably, however, only E-peptide rendered cells resistant to high erythromycin concentration and, conversely, only K-peptide conferred high level of ketolide resistance. Thus, different peptides exhibit a clear specificity toward different types of macrolide antibiotics. Unraveling the mechanism of peptide-mediated macrolide resistance may provide important clues for understanding the mode of action of macrolide antibiotics. It may also provide insights into interactions between the ribosome and the nascent peptide. In the current study, we investigated whether resistance peptides act simply by competing with the antibiotic for the ribosomal binding site, or whether macrolide resistance conferred by short peptides is mediated by direct interaction between the peptide and the drug on the ribosome. To address this question, peptides conferring resistance to a ketolide, a macrolide antibiotic different from erythromycin, were selected and their amino acid sequences were compared with those of E-peptides. The previously selected erythromycin resistance peptides conformed to a general sequence consensus, MXLXV, where the third position was the most conserved and occupied by leucine in the majority of E-peptides (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among the ketolide resistance peptides selected in the current study, neither had leucine in the third position. This result indicates that different peptides confer resistance to different macrolides. This conclusion was corroborated by comparing the resistance patterns conferred by a very similar E-peptide and K-peptide (MRLFV and MRFFV, respectively). The E-peptide rendered cells resistant to high concentrations of erythromycin, but not ketolide; conversely, expression of K-peptide afforded high level of ketolide resistance but did not protect the cell from high erythromycin concentrations (Fig. 4). Thus, the nature of the expressed peptide determines to which macrolide the cell will become resistant. Out of 25 analyzed ketolide-resistant clones, 10 expressed K-peptide MRFFV. This peptide is apparently one of the “best” peptides conferring resistance to the ketolide HMR3004 used in the selection. Cells expressing this peptide exhibited the highest level of ketolide resistance compared with other selected clones (Table II). Furthermore, this same peptide was encoded in three different mini-genes (Table I), demonstrating strong selection for a specific amino acid sequence. Since one of the best E-peptides had the sequence MRLFV, which differed from the K-peptide MRFFV only in the third amino acid position, one can suppose that, within this context, it is the third amino acid (leucine, in the E-peptide or phenylalanine, in K-peptide) that allows the peptide to discriminate between the two macrolides. We have previously demonstrated the cis-mode of E-peptide action so that only the ribosome that translated an E-peptide became resistant to erythromycin, while exogenously added E-peptide did not affect inhibition of cell-free translation by erythromycin (12Tenson T. DeBlasio A. Mankin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, a model of action of E-peptides was proposed in which the newly translated E-peptide remained bound to the ribosome in the vicinity of the peptidyl transferase center thus blocking the erythromycin-binding site (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Within this model, the peptide did not interact directly with the erythromycin molecule and resistance depended only on the relative affinities of the E-peptide and the drug to the ribosome. Our new results, however, show that the macrolide and newly synthesized peptide do interact with each other; such interaction is reflected in correlation between the chemical structure of macrolide and the amino acid sequence of resistance peptides. To reconcile the model with the new experimental data, we suggest that the newly synthesized peptide does not just passively occupy the drug binding site, but instead, actively displaces the macrolide from the ribosome (Fig. 5). During this process, the peptide directly interacts with the drug. In the previous model, which was based on an idea of tight association of E-peptides with the ribosome, we had to explain why E-peptide bound in the nascent peptide channel does not inhibit protein synthesis. Therefore, we had to speculate that after initiation of a new polypeptide synthesis, the growing nascent peptide chain has either to displace the E-peptide from its binding site or go around it. This problem is easily solved within the new model which does not require association of the resistance peptide with the ribosome. Instead, the peptide acts as a “bottle brush” that “cleans” the ribosome from the bound antibiotic. After antibiotic is removed, the ribosome can either initiate synthesis of a new polypeptide or bind another molecule of the drug. In the former case, when the nascent peptide becomes longer than 5 amino acids, the ribosome will become “resistant” to macrolides until completion of polypeptide translation because macrolides cannot bind to ribosomes with long nascent peptide chains (19Pestka S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 5: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Otaka T. Kaji A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2649-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, translation of macrolide resistance peptides opens for ribosomes a window of opportunity to translated cellular proteins. Notably, the new model is fully compatible with the cis-mode of the peptide action, because only the ribosome that translated the resistance peptide mini-gene would become transiently competent for translation of other genes, which, in an experiment, would be observed as antibiotic resistance. The correspondence between the peptide amino acid sequence and chemical nature of the macrolide strongly suggests a possibility of interaction between the resistance peptide and the antibiotic. However, free peptide apparently does not interact with the drug, since even 1000-fold excess of the synthetic E-peptide added to the cell-free translation system did not reduce inhibitory action of erythromycin (12Tenson T. DeBlasio A. Mankin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the peptide-drug interaction occurs most probably only on the ribosome. Previously, we have shown that only short peptides (3–6 amino acids long) could confer resistance to erythromycin (15Tenson T. Xiong L. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17425-17430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The size of active peptides is compatible with direct interaction between resistance peptide and the drug on the ribosome. Erythromycin hinders growth of nascent polypeptide when it reaches the size of 2–5 amino acids. Therefore, when the ribosome decodes the stop codon of an E- or K-peptide mini-gene, the newly synthesized pentapeptide should be in contact with the ribosome-bound antibiotic. The ribosome may constrain the newly synthesized peptide in a conformation competent for specific interaction with the antibiotic. Such interaction may reduce affinity of the drug to its binding site on the ribosome, and it can be ejected together with the completed peptide. The known mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are usually divided into three main groups: 1) mechanisms affecting accumulation of the drug in the cell, 2) mechanisms involving modification of the drug target, and, finally, 3) mechanisms based on modification of the drug. The proposed mechanism of action of macrolide resistance peptides does not fall within any of the three categories, but rather represents a hybrid of the latter two groups, since “modification of the drug” (its ability to bind to the ribosome) occurs directly within the target (the ribosome). Multiple examples of peptide sequences capable of conferring resistance to different macrolide antibiotics suggest that similar mechanisms of antibiotic resistance may potentially operate in nature and may account for macrolide resistance of some clinical pathogens.

During early development, the endosperm and embryo are surrounded by the nucellus, a maternal tissue that provides nutrients to the rapidly growing endosperm (1Evers A.D. Ann. Bot. ( London ). 1970; 34: 547-555Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Bennett M.D. Rao M.K. Smith J.B. Bayliss M.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1973; 266: 39-81Crossref Google Scholar). The nucellus is the predominant tissue during early seed development but undergoes a progressive programmed cell death 2T. Young and D. Gallie, manuscript in preparation. 2T. Young and D. Gallie, manuscript in preparation. to provide room for the expanding endosperm tissue. Following 12 DAF, the nucellus is insignificant and the mass of the seed is dominated by the endosperm and embryo. The highest level of protein synthetic activity in the seed occurs between 12 and 30 DAF when the bulk of the seed storage protein is synthesized in the endosperm and stored to provide the nutrients required for germination (3Greene F.C. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 40-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Greene F.C. Anderson O.D. Litts J.C. Gautier M.-F. Cereal Chem. 1985; 62: 398-405Google Scholar, 5Terce-Laforgue T. Sallantin M. Pernollet J.-C. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 105-112Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This developmental stage is followed by a rapid drop in protein synthesis when the endosperm undergoes its own programmed cell death and the embryo prepares for quiescence, a process that continues up to the mature dry stage of the seed by 45 DAF. Despite the reduced protein synthetic activity after 30 DAF, late embryogenesis abundant (lea) proteins are synthesized, which are thought to be required for the embryo to survive dessication during late seed development (reviewed in Ref. 6Delseny M. Gaubier P. Hull G. Saez-Vasquez J. Gallois P. Raynal M. Cooke R. Grellet F. Basra A.S. Stress-Induced Gene Expression in Plants. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Chur, Switzerland1994: 25-59Google Scholar). At maturity, however, the seed is virtually metabolically quiescent, and translational activity ceases despite the continued presence of the translational machinery in the embryo. Protein synthesis resumes quickly following the initiation of germination; formation of polysomes and protein synthesis are detected shortly following the onset of germination (7Marcus A. Feeley J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marcus A. Feeley J. Volcani T. Plant Physiol. 1966; 41: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen D.

Translational regulation in yeast and animal cells often occurs through changes in the phosphorylation state of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) whose function is to aid 40- and 60-S ribosomal subunit binding to the mRNA, resulting in the formation of the 80-S ribosome at the correct start codon. Our previous studies demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of two initiation factors, eIF2 and eIF4B, differed substantially in seed versus leaves of wheat (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), observations suggesting that the activity of these factors may be under developmental regulation.Wheat eIF4B, a single polypeptide (59 kDa), is thought to assist eIF4A and eIF4F in the ATP-dependent unwinding of secondary structure that may be present within a 5′-leader of an mRNA (12Browning K.S.

Sonenberg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). eIF4B is hypophosphorylated in mature wheat embryos, but is present predominantly as hyperphosphorylated isoforms in leaves (11Gallie D.R.

The posttranslational modification of eIF4B is similar in both plant and animal cells in that the isoforms are divided into an acidic cluster of four to six isoforms that are phosphorylated forms of a basic cluster of four isoforms (11Gallie D.R.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic cluster is substantially reduced in mature wheat embryos, but predominates in leaves, and undergoes rapid dephosphorylation in leaves following a heat shock (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The alteration in wheat eIF4B phosphorylation correlates with the repression of translation that occurs following a thermal stress (15Gallie D.R. Caldwell C. Pitto L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda ). 1995; 108: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further evidence suggesting a relationship between the phosphorylation state of eIF4B and translational activity comes from studies in animal cells: dephosphorylation of mammalian eIF4B occurred following heat shock (16Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11882-11889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), serum depletion (17Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5493-5497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or mitosis (18Bonneau A.-M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of mammalian eIF4B correlated with the reduction in translation following these treatments, whereas the phosphorylation of eIF4B that occurs following insulin treatment correlated with an increase in translation (19Manzella J.M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Hershey J.W.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of phosphorylated mammalian eIF4B was partially able to restore translation in an in vitrotranslation lysate prepared from heat-shocked HeLa cells in which the eIF4B had undergone dephosphorylation (16Duncan R.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).eIF2 is a three-subunit complex in plants as in other eukaryotes and is responsible for binding the initiator Met-tRNA to the 40-S ribosomal subunit (21Benne R.

The three subunits of wheat eIF2 are α (42 kDa), β (38 kDa), and γ (50 kDa) (24Metz A.M. Browning K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α occurs following amino acid starvation in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 25Pain V.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or viral infection (reviewed in Ref. 26Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 9: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar), heme deprivation, and heat shock in animal cells (27Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its phosphorylation inhibits the eIF2β-directed exchange of GTP for GDP, preventing eIF2 from participating in more than one round of translation initiation (reviewed in Refs. 28Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 29Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Merrick W.C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In wheat, eIF2α is also subject to phosphorylation: the factor is present in a hyperphosphorylated state in embryos of mature seed but is present in a hypophosphorylated state in leaves (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to mammalian eIF2, heat shock, whether of short or long duration, had little detectable impact on the phosphorylation state of the α subunit in wheat leaves (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mammalian eIF2β is present as a single major form under normal growth conditions (14Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but following either a heat shock or serum starvation, both a new acidic and basic species was observed (14Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5493-5497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, approximately four eIF2β isoforms were observed in wheat leaves, the distribution of which did not change significantly following a heat shock (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).eIF4A (47 kDa) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and an RNA-dependent ATPase in plants, animals, and yeast (31Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It can be found associated with eIF4G or eIFiso4G or as an independent factor (33Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only a single, dephosphorylated form of mammalian or yeast eIF4A has been observed; however, in plants andDrosophila, a phosphorylated isoform has been detected (34Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Lasko P. Lavoie C. Lachance P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 80aGoogle Scholar). Although dephosphorylated eIF4A normally predominates in leaves and mature seed, a maximum of 50% of the total available eIF4A can undergo phosphorylation following hypoxia or heat shock (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our previous observations showing that the phosphorylation state of several initiation factors is different in seed versusleaves of wheat (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggested that this was because of either tissue-specific differences or to differences in translational activity between mature seed (translationally quiescent) and young leaves (translationally active). This prompted us to examine whether the posttranslational modification of these factors may be subject to developmental control that would correlate with the regulation of protein synthetic activity known to occur during development. We found that the phosphorylation state of eIF4B, eIF2α, and eIF2β (and to a lesser extent, eIF4A) is developmentally regulated during seed development and germination but that the regulation of each differs temporally. The differences in the regulation of the phosphorylation state of these initiation factors may affect message selection or determine translational efficiency during plant development.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we observed that eIF4B was present in a hyperphosphorylated state during the period of seed development in which protein synthesis is most active (12–30 DAF) and underwent gradual dephosphorylation (35–45 DAF) during the late stage of development concomitant with the decline in protein synthetic activity that precedes the metabolically quiescent state of the mature seed. eIF4B remained in a hypophosphorylated state up to 10 h following imbibition but was rapidly converted to its hyperphosphorylated state between 20 and 48 h of germination.In contrast, phosphorylation of eIF2α occurs earlier during seed development than does the dephosphorylation of eIF4B, and eIF2α undergoes dephosphorylation much later during germination than does eIF4B. Interestingly, conversion of eIF2α to a hyperphosphorylated state during seed development occurred in a concerted manner, suggesting either that its phosphorylation occurs in a distributive fashion or that phosphorylation of each site is under temporal control during development. During germination, however, dephosphorylation of eIF2α occurred without the significant appearance of the intermediate isoforms, even though both the hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated isoforms were present simultaneously. This suggests that either eIF2α dephosphorylation occurs in a processive manner or that its phosphorylation is irreversible, and dephosphorylated eIF2α is generated only through new synthesis.The presence of multiple eIF2α phosphorylation sites in plants appears to differ from the single site present at serine-51 in mammalian eIF2α (41Colthurst D.R. Campbell D.G. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Pathak V.K. Schindler D. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As in mammalian cells, eIF2α activity in yeast is also regulated through phosphorylation at Ser-51, however, three additional sites close to the C terminus are constitutively phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by casein kinase II (43Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and remain so following heat shock, nitrogen starvation, or growth in poor carbon sources (44Romero D.P. Dahlberg A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations at these sites do not reduce growth, but can exhibit synthetic growth defects in combination with mutations affecting the activity of eIF2B (the factor required for GTP/GDP exchange in eIF2) or GCN2 (the kinase responsible for phosphorylating eIF2α), suggesting that their phosphorylation is necessary for optimal activity of the factor (43Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although human eIF2α does not contain consensus sites for and is not phosphorylated by casein kinase II, Artemia eIF2α contains four such sites and is phosphorylated by the enzyme in vitro (43Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mehta H.B. Dholakia J.N. Roth W.W. Parekh B.S. Montelaro R.C. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6705-6711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting considerable variation in the number of phosphorylation sites of eIF2α from various species.None of the phosphorylation sites in plant eIF2α can be considered as constitutively phosphorylated since the most hypophosphorylated species dominates in leaves and during early seed development. How phosphorylation at each site of wheat eIF2α affects its activity remains to be determined. However, as changes in eIF2α phosphorylation correlate with the substantial changes in protein synthetic activity during seed development, they do suggest a possible role for phosphorylation as a means to regulate eIF2α activity in plants. Phosphorylation at some sites may serve to promote translation initiation, whereas phosphorylation of other sites may serve to inhibit protein synthesis or alter those mRNAs selected for translation. In this respect, it should be noted that phosphorylation at Ser-51 in eIF2α inhibits factor activity in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 39Clemens M.J. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar), whereas it affects message selection in yeast (e.g. GCN4) through alterations in its re-initiation activity (46Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).eIF2β is required for ribosomal start site selection (48Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of mammalian eIF2β stimulates eIF2 activity (49Kramer G. Hardesty B. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1981; 20: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). eIF2β is multiply phosphorylated in wheat leaves (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as it is during early seed development, where approximately 4–5 isoforms were observed. During subsequent seed development however, eIF2β underwent progressive dephosphorylation until a single basic species remained at 45 DAF. The presence of phosphorylated eIF2β correlated with the high rate of protein synthetic activity characterizing the mid-development of the seed whereas dephosphorylation of eIF2β during late development correlated with a corresponding low level of protein synthesis, observations suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF2β may play a role in regulating translational activity.In contrast to the dynamic changes in phosphorylation of eIF4B, eIF2α, and eIF2β, eIF4A remained little changed during seed development or germination. The only exception to this was during the earliest stage of seed development when the seed is dominated by the nucellus, a maternal tissue that undergoes programmed cell death. During this developmental stage, 50% of the total eIF4A in the seed was phosphorylated, similar to the observations made in wheat leaves following a heat shock (11Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or in maize roots following hypoxia (34Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of eIF4A appears to occur in response to stress and as part of some types of programmed cell death. During this same early developmental period, eIF4B was subject to degradation and eIF2α was present as phosphorylated intermediates, which may reflect the fate of these factors in the nucellus and other tissues as they undergo rapid programmed cell death.Our observations suggest that the phosphorylation state of eIF4B, eIF2α, eIF2β, and even eIF4A is developmentally regulated but that the regulation of each exhibits some unique aspects. These differences may play a role in the changing translational environment of the developing seed and during acquisition of photosynthetic competence following germination as the complement of mRNAs can change dramatically from one developmental stage to another. Whether the translational requirements of mRNAs expressed only during specific developmental stages differs is unknown. However, changes in the phosphorylation status of the protein synthetic machinery may be a means by which necessary changes in the translational environment are achieved during plant development. Protein synthesis undergoes dramatic changes during plant growth, particularly during the development of the seed and its subsequent germination. From the perspective of protein synthetic activity, the development of wheat seed can be divided into three stages: early development (up to 10–12 days after flowering (DAF) 1The abbreviations used are: DAFdays after floweringIEFisoelectric focusingPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoreiseIFtranslation initiation factorsPABPpoly(A) binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: DAFdays after floweringIEFisoelectric focusingPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoreiseIFtranslation initiation factorsPABPpoly(A) binding protein. ), mid-development (approximately 12–30 DAF), and late development (30–45 DAF). During early development, the endosperm and embryo are surrounded by the nucellus, a maternal tissue that provides nutrients to the rapidly growing endosperm (1Evers A.D. Ann. Bot.

Two mutants,BstHU-A27S and BstHU-V42I, in which Ala27 and Val42 in BstHU were replaced by the corresponding amino acids Ser27 and Ile42, respectively, in the homologue from a mesophileB. subtilis (BsuHU), were less stable than the wild-type BstHU (63.9 °C), showing Tm values of 58.4 °C and 60.1 °C, respectively, as estimated by circular dichroism (CD) analysis at pH 7.0. The denaturation of two mutants was further characterized using differential scanning calorimetry; the Tm values obtained by calorimetric analysis were in good agreement with those estimated by CD analysis. The results suggest that Ala27 and Val42 are partly responsible for enhancing the thermostability of BstHU. When considered together with previous results, it is revealed that Gly15, Ala27, Glu34, Lys38, and Val42 are essential for the thermostability of thermophilic protein BstHU. Moreover, five thermostabilizing mutations were simultaneously introduced into BsuHU, which resulted in a quintuple mutant with a Tm value of 71.3 °C, which is higher than that of BstHU, and also resulted in insusceptibility to proteinase digestion.

A thorough understanding of molecular rules governing thermostability of proteins should provide invaluable insight into basic principles for a design of novel proteins by protein engineering. Both theoretical and experimental approaches have been undertaken to examine the thermostability of proteins and many different structural principles have been postulated for increased thermostability (for reviews, see Refs. 1Vieille C.

One convincing approach is a comparative study on proteins that are available from organisms living under different temperature conditions. Recently, Vogt et al. statistically compared the amino acid sequences and tertiary structures of mesophilic and thermophilic organisms and suggested that the increased hydrogen bonds and ion pairs may provide the most general explanation for thermostability in proteins (4Vogt G. Woell S. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We have pursued the investigation of the structural basis of thermostability of proteins using a histone-like bacterial DNA-binding protein HU (HU) 1The abbreviations used are: HUDNA-binding protein HUBstHUDNA-binding protein HU from B. stearothermophilusBsuHUDNA-binding protein HU fromB. subtilisDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryHTHhelix-turn-helixHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: HUDNA-binding protein HUBstHUDNA-binding protein HU from B. stearothermophilusBsuHUDNA-binding protein HU fromB. subtilisDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryHTHhelix-turn-helixHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. as a model protein.

The HU is a small basic polypeptide chain composed of 90–92 amino acids and occurs as a homotypic dimer in solution (5Drica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HU binds to DNA in a sequence-independent manner and has been thought to play an important role in the structure of the bacterial nucleoid, being involved in replication (6Hwang D.S. Kornberg A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Bacillus stearothermophilus HU (BstHU) is composed of 90 amino acids, and its tertiary structure has been extensively studied by both x-ray crystallographic (11Tanaka I. Appelt K. Dijk J. White S.W.

Biol. 1995; 254: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) methods. The BstHU has two distinct halves; the N-terminal half consists of two α-helices (α1 and α2), which are connected by a broad turn to create a V-shaped supersecondary structure (HTH motif), while the C-terminal half consists mainly of a three-stranded antiparallel β-pleated sheet. In a dimeric form, a pair of HTH motifs are entangled with each other to form a tightly packed hydrophobic core domain. In addition to BstHU, we have isolated three homologous HUs from mesophilic (Bacillus globigii andBacillus subtilis) and thermophilic (Bacillus caldolyticus) bacilli, and their amino acids have been sequenced (15Imber R. Kimura M. Groch N. Heinemann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Tanaka I. White S.W. Kimura M. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence comparison of the four HUs and the known three-dimensional structure of BstHU, the relative thermostability with respect to amino acid differences between the four proteins was discussed (16Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Tanaka I. White S.W. Kimura M. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study revealed 11 amino acid substitutions between the thermophilic and mesophilic proteins, which are almost all restricted to the molecular surface not implicated in the mode of DNA binding. Thus, it could be expected that these amino acid substitutions might give rise to additional hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges that would contribute to the thermostability of the thermophilic HU. To assess the contribution of the individual amino acids to the thermostability of BstHU, we constructedBstHU mutants, in which the amino acids were individually replaced with the corresponding amino acids in B. subtilisHU (BsuHU) and evaluated their thermostability. Previously, it has been shown that Gly15 in the bend between two α-helices (α1 and α2) and Glu34 and Lys38occurred at the molecular surface, significantly contributing to the thermostability of BstHU (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To this end, we extend this comparative study to the remaining six amino acid replacements: BstHU Ala27 toBsuHU Ser27, Ser31 to Thr31, Val42 to Ile42, Ala56 to Ser56, Met69 to Ile69, and Lys90 to Ala90-Gly91-Lys92. In the crystal structure of BstHU (Fig. 1), Ala27 resides on the outside of the second α-helix (α2) and is exposed to solvent. Since the Ala residue is a strong helix-forming amino acid, it could be suggested that Ala27in BstHU would contribute to thermostability by stabilizing the second α-helix (α2). Ser31 in BstHU is located on the solvent-facing surface of the second α-helix, and its side chain forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of Ala27. Since an equivalent hydrogen bond is probably formed through the side chain of the Thr27 residue in the mesophile BsuHU, the replacement from Ser27 to Thr was thought to be neutral. The Val42 inBstHU is in the β1-strand and is buried in the interior of the protein. It was therefore suggested that the larger side chain Ile in BsuHU would produce structural strain in the tightly packed core, resulting in destabilization of the mesophilic protein. Ala56 and Met69 in BstHU are substituted by Ser and Ile, respectively, in BsuHU. The former residue is on the outgoing β-ribbon closed to the disordered arms of the BstHU, and the latter is in the returning part of the disordered arm in BstHU. These residues are expected to be accessible to solvent and, therefore, were thought to have little effect on the thermostability of the protein. The C-terminal Lys90 in BstHU is replaced by the tripeptide Ala90-Gly91-Lys92 inBsuHU. It is shown that the C terminus is disposed on the molecular surface, and thus the significance of this replacement was unclear. In the present study, we reveal that Ala27 and Val42 are essential for the thermostability of theBstHU. Furthermore, on the basis of the present and previous results, we construct a quintuple mutant HU using the BsuHU gene as a prototype and discuss its hyperthermostability and resistance to proteolytic degradations. We previously described the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding BstHU andBsuHU (19Kawamura S. Kajiyama H. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). All genetic procedures, including site-directed mutagenesis were performed as described earlier (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem.

All procedures used for production, purification, and SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant proteins BstHU and BsuHU and the mutants thereof have been described previously (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thermostability of the protein was determined by monitoring the change in circular dichroism (CD) at 222 nm as a function of temperature, and thermodynamic parameters were obtained as described in Refs. 17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Since it was reported that the protein BsuHU showed the strong dependence of the CD spectral properties and stability under a variety of conditions (20Welfle H. Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Groch N. Heinemann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Welfle H. Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Schindelin H. Scholtz A. Heinemann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we measured all proteins using the same procedure and the same type of spectrophotometer, as described in previous papers (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Calorimetric measurements were carried out with a VP-DSC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) microcalorimeter with an personal computer. The scan rate was 1.0 K/min. Sample solutions for DSC measurements were prepared by dialyzing of HU proteins dissolved in water against 0.05m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 exhaustively. The protein concentrations were 22–33 μm. The concentrations of the protein solutions were determined using amino acid analysis of proteins after acid hydrolysis. Data analysis was done using the Origin software (MicroCal). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz with a Varian Unity Plus spectrometer. All NMR measurements were carried out at pD 7 and 25 °C. Dioxane was employed as the internal standard (3.743 ppm). The pD values were the pH meter readings without adjustment for isotope effects. Tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of the proteins (1 mg/ml) were carried out at 37 °C in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:1000 and 1:5000 (w/w), respectively. Proteolytic digestion was assayed by measuring the change in the amount of the uncleaved protein, which was separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a YMC-gel C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–56% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min. The effluents were monitored by absorption at 220 nm. SixBstHU mutant proteins, designated as BstHU-A27S,BstHU-S31T, BstHU-V42I, BstHU-A56S,BstHU-M69I, and BstHU-K90AGK, were engineered, in which Ala27, Ser31, Val42, Ala56, Met69, and Lys90 were changed to the corresponding amino acid residues in BsuHU. Expression of the mutated cDNAs was performed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells, using the T7 system as described previously (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins were purified from the soluble fractions of cells so as to give a single band on SDS-PAGE. Their behaviors during the purification steps were almost identical with that of the wild type protein. The yields of protein from a 1-liter culture were 15–20 mg. The integrity of the mutant protein was confirmed by measurements of far-ultraviolet CD as described previously. The CD spectrum of each mutant was almost indistinguishable from that of the wild type, indicating that none of these mutations affected the backbone conformation (data not shown). To define the amino acid replacements responsible for the thermostability of BstHU, the thermostabilities of the mutant proteins were analyzed by monitoring the change in the CD value at 220 nm as a function of temperature. Fig. 2 A shows the thermal denaturation curves of the wild type and the mutant proteins. In all cases, the unfolding transitions appeared to be monophasic, suggesting the absence of a folding intermediate in thermal denaturing process of global structure. Thus, on the basis of the assumption that the wild type BstHU and its mutants are denatured with a two-state model, thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the thermal denaturation curves, as summarized in TableI. Of five mutant proteins, the mutantsBstHU-A27S and BstHU-V42I were less stable by −5.5 °C (ΔΔG = −4.97 kJ/mol) and −3.8 °C (ΔΔG = −3.48 kJ/mol), respectively, in Tmthan the wild type BstHU. This result suggests that Ala27 and Val42 are the key residues to provide the extra thermostability to BstHU.Table IParameters characterizing the thermal denaturations of BstHU, BsuHU, and their mutantsProteinΔHmΔSmTmΔTmΔΔGkJ/molkJ/mol · K°C°CkJ/molBstHU304.20.90363.9BstHU-A27S319.60.96458.4−5.5−4.97BstHU-S31T338.80.94965.8+1.9+1.72BstHU-V42I228.80.68760.1−3.8−3.43BstHU-A56S347.01.03163.3−0.6−0.54BstHU-M69I331.20.98363.900BstHU-K90AGK296.60.87665.7+1.8+1.63BsuHU176.20.54848.6BsuHU-S27A186.90.57154.2+5.6+3.07BsuHU-I42V256.10.78752.6+4.0+2.19Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the thermal denaturation curves described in Fig. 2.

The table summarizes the results of four independent experiments. The contributions of Ala27 and Val42 to the thermal stabilization of BstHU were corroborated by constructing the mesophilic mutants BsuHU-S27A andBsuHU-I42V, in which Ser27 and Ile42in BsuHU were conversely replaced by Ala and Val, respectively, and the resulting mutants were characterized in terms of their thermostabilities. As shown in Fig. 2 B and Table I, the Tm values of BsuHU-S27A andBsuHU-I42V were increased by 5.6 °C (ΔΔG = 3.07 kJ/mol) and 4.0 °C (ΔΔG = 2.19 kJ/mol), respectively, compared with that of the wild-type BsuHU, demonstrating that these two amino acids, Ala27 and Val42, are both responsible for enhancing the thermostability of theBstHU. In contrast, the stabilities of BstHU-A56S andBstHU-M69I were almost identical to that of the wild type, and the mutants BstHU-S31T and BstHU-K90AGK were slightly more stable than the wild type. Two residues Ala56and Met69 are located in the solvent-exposed arm region. In the crystal structure of BstHU, the top part of the arm is not visible because of its flexible nature. It was therefore concluded that these substitutions in a mobile, solvent-exposed environment do not affect the conformational stability. The Tm values of the mutants BstHU-S31T and BstHU-K90AGK were higher by 1.9 °C and 1.8 °C than that of the wild type BstHU. The crystal structure of the BstHU shows that Ser31 resides on the solvent-facing surface, clustering together with Thr13 and Ala27, and forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of Ala27. Therefore, the increased stability of BstHU-S31T might be due to the rearrangement of a hydrogen bond formed between the side chain oxygen of the substituted Thr31 and the main chain carbonyl of Ala27. Another plausible interpretation is that the introduction of the larger side chain might give some preferential van der Waals contacts with Thr13 and/or Ala27. The mutant BstHU-K90AGK was also stable as compared with the wild type. At present, no explanation for thermostable property of this mutant has been obtained. In order to understand the molecular basis for destabilization of the mutant proteins, BstHU-A27S and BstHU-V42I, their structural features were examined by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis. As a result, the chemical shift change of some resonances were observed around aromatic regions at 6.2, 6.26, and 7.0 ppm inBstHU-A27S and 6.2, 6.28, and 6.49, and 7.0 ppm inBstHU-V42I, as compared with that of the wild-type HU (data not shown). Although the assignment of these resonances in theBstHU has still not been reported, Kakuta classified these to be derived from Phe residues (Phe29, Phe47, Phe50, and Phe79) in BstHU by DQF-COSY. 2Y. Kakuta, unpublished results. It is therefore likely that the replacement of Ala27 or Val42by Ser or Ile, respectively, may cause rearrangement of some Phe residues occupying the interior of the molecule. The present study, together with previous studies (17Kawamura S. Kakuta Y. Tanaka I. Hikichi K. Kuhara S. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggests that five amino acid residues, Gly15, Ala27, Glu34, Lys38, and Val42, are essential for thermostability of BstHU. To corroborate their involvement in thermostability, the thermal denaturations of five mutants (BstHU-G15E, BstHU-A27S,BstHU-E34D, BstHU-K38N, andBstHU-V42I) as well as the wild type were further characterized by DSC measurements. A typical excess heat capacity curve of the wild type BstHU is shown in Fig.3. The examined proteins, as is the case for the BstHU, gave single peaks in calorimetric measurements; the Tm values of the wild type and its five mutants could be calculated from these curves, as given in TableII. This measurement clearly showed the thermal destabilization of five mutant proteins as compared with the wild type and demonstrated the involvement of five amino acid residues in the thermostability of BstHU. Interestingly, the Tm values obtained by DSC measurement for the wild type and its mutant proteins were well coincident with those estimated by CD analysis. This observation, together with a single peak in calorimetric measurements, strongly suggests that BstHU as well as its mutants are denatured with a two-state model involving the native dimer and unfolded monomers.Table IIThe Tm values of the wild type BstHU and its mutants obtained by DSC measurement and CD analysisProteinTm valueDSCCD°CWild typeBstHU65.863.9BstHU-G15E55.754.0BstHU-A27S59.658.4BstHU-E34D63.561.6BstHU-K38N61.761.5BstHU-V42I59.660.1DSC measurements of proteins were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the same values estimated by CD analysis were reported in Refs. 16Wilson K.S.

In the foregoing work, it was shown that the combination of the three thermostabilizing substitutions (Glu15 in BsuHU to Gly, Asp34 to Glu, and Asn38 to Lys) significantly increased the thermostability of the mesophilic proteinBsuHU by 15.9 °C in Tm (18Kawamura S. Tanaka I. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taking the present result, the five thermostabilizing mutations (Glu15 to Gly, Ser27 to Ala, Asp34 to Glu, Asn38to Lys, and Ile42 to Val) were simultaneously introduced into the mesophilic protein BsuHU, and the thermostability of the resultant mutant (quintuple mutant) was examined, exactly in the same manner as described above. The thermal denaturation curves of the wild type BsuHU and the quintuple mutant as well as those of the five single mutant proteins with the constituent amino acid substitutions are shown in Fig. 4. The parameters characterizing the thermal denaturation are summarized in Table III. The simultaneous introduction of the five mutations greatly increased the thermostability of the protein with the Tm value of 71.3 °C compared with 48.6 °C for the wild-type BsuHU. The stabilization energy arising from the quintuple mutations seems to be somewhat greater than the sum of the constituent single substitutions but only by about 8.9% of the calculated value. This result indicated that the effects of the mutations on the thermostability are roughly independent of each other and nearly additive. This result suggests that the individual local reinforcements derived from the amino acid residues that reside far from each other contribute to the greater thermostability of the thermophilic protein BstHU. Interestingly, the Tmvalue of the quintuple mutant of BsuHU was higher than that of BstHU. As shown in Table I, the mutation of amino acids in BstHU to those of BsuHU such asBstHU-S31T was not always less stable, indicating that the amino acid sequence of BstHU was not optimized for thermal stability. Considering this idea, the higher stability of the quintuple mutant of BsuHU than BstHU may be reasonable.Table IIIStability of the mesophilic protein BsuHU and its five mutantsProteinTmΔTmΔΔGΔTm(sum)ΔΔG (sum)°C°CkJ/mol°CkJ/molBsuHU48.6BsuHU-D34E/N38K52.1+3.5+1.92BsuHU-E15G60.4+11.8+6.47BsuHU-S27A54.2+5.6+3.07BsuHU-I42V52.6+4.0+2.19Quintuple mutant71.3+22.7+12.44+24.9+13.65Thernodynamic parameters were calculated from the thermal denaturation curves described in Fig. 2.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8115-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the correlation was observed between the thermostability and the resistance to proteolytic degradation. To examine whether or not this rule is applicable to the protein HU, we analyzed the susceptibility of the quintuple mutant and wild-typeBsuHU to chymotrypsin and trypsin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.5, the rates of chymotryptic and tryptic degradations of the quintuple mutant were 200 and 11 times slower than that of the wild type BsuHU, respectively. Taking into account the substrate specificity of chymotrypsin and trypsin, the resistance of the quintuple mutant to proteolytic degradation seems to be independent of the substrate specificity of the protease. Imotoet al. (25Imoto T. Yamada H. Ueda T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that digestion by proteases proceeds mainly via the unfolded state of proteins. The stabilization of the quintuple mutant of BsuHU may depend on the stabilization of the folded state rather than the destabilization of the unfolded state, because mutations were involved in the formation of salt bridge or the introduction of favorable intermolecular interaction. Therefore, it is likely that the thermostabilizing mutations contribute to the decrease in the rate constant of unfolding. This series of studies on the thermostability ofBstHU revealed that its extra thermostability relative to the mesophilic protein BsuHU seems to be achieved mainly by stabilization of two α-helices (α1 and α2) with Gly15, Ala27, and Glu34 and by improvement of the intermolecularly close packing in the hydrophobic core with Ala27 and Val42 (TableIV). Moreover, the additional salt bridge between Glu34 and Lys38 on the hydrophobic surface is found to be also responsible for enhancing the thermostability of BstHU (Table IV). The amino acid residues found to be responsible for thermostability of BstHU are mapped in the crystal structure of BstHU (Fig.6).Table IVExplanations for enhanced thermostability of BstHUResidueExplanationReferenceGly15Enhanced stability of helix-turn-helix17Kawamura S.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is among the first intracellular events in the transduction of many external signals into the cell.

The src homology 2 (SH2) domain is a specific recognition module for phosphotyrosyl peptides and proteins (1Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and has been identified from a variety of enzymes and proteins in general. Individual SH2 domains appear to have a good degree of selectivity toward the sequences of phosphotyrosyl peptides (2Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F.

Recognition of a phosphotyrosyl protein by the proper SH2 domain is an important step in many signal transduction processes. Therefore, SH2 domains are attractive targets for the development of therapeutic agents against various human diseases (3Brugge J.S.

Phosphotyrosyl peptides containing 4–6 residues can bind SH2 domains with high affinity (2Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that inhibitors containing the phosphotyrosyl residue can become successful therapeutic agents. This is due both to the lability of the phosphate group toward hydrolysis and to its doubly negative charge at physiological pH, which significantly reduces cell permeability. Therefore, a phosphate replacement that is metabolically stable and possesses lesser (or preferably no) charge at physiological pH may be a crucial component for the development of SH2 domain inhibitors. Most efforts to date have used phosphonates, difluorophosphonates, dicarboxylic acids, and prodrugs as phosphate replacements (4Burke Jr T.R. Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Nomizu M. Roller P.P. Wolf G. Case R.

The carboxymethyl functionality is an attractive phosphate replacement because it is metabolically stable and contains only a single negative charge. The carboxymethyl-phenylalanyl (cmF) residue was used as a mimetic for a sulfated tyrosine residue in cholecystokinin, and the resulting compounds have similar potency to that of the parent peptide in an animal model (11Tilley J.W.

For SH2 domain binding, however, inhibitors incorporating the cmF residue showed dramatically reduced potency, by about 450-fold, as compared with those containing Tyr(P) (see Fig. 1). A similar degree of loss in potency was observed when the cmF residue was used as a replacement in an inhibitor against the src SH2 domain (5Gilmer T. Rodriguez M. Jordan S. Crosby R. Alligood K. Green M. Kimery M. Wagner C. Kinder D. Charifson P. Hassell A.M. Willard D. Luther M. Rusnak D. Sternbach D.D. Mehrotra M. Peel M. Shampine L. Davis R. Robbins J. Patel I.R. Kassel D. Burkhart W.

Therefore, there are serious concerns as to whether the carboxymethyl group truly functions as a phosphate surrogate in SH2 domain binding.

We present here the crystal structure of human p56lck SH2 domain in complex with an inhibitor containing singly charged cmF as the Tyr(P) mimic and show that the cmF residue could be a suitable replacement for Tyr(P). The carboxymethyl-phenylalanine residue was synthesized following protocols in the literature (11Tilley J.W. Danho W. Lovey K. Wagner R. Swistok J. Makofske R. Michalewsky J. Triscari J. Nelson D. Weatherford S. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The compound thus prepared is enantiomerically pure at the Cα atom (L-form). Details on the chemical synthesis will be presented elsewhere. 2P. L. Beaulieu et al., manuscript in preparation. Details on the measurement of the affinity of the inhibitors using surface plasmon resonance have been described earlier (15Morelock M.M. Ingraham R.H. Betageri R. Jakes S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, biotinylated EPQpYEEIPIA peptide was immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip. The Kd of this peptide for the SH2 domain was determined by titration of the SH2 domain over this surface from 100 to 0.31 nm. The affinities of other compounds were determined from competition experiments by preincubating the SH2 domain with varying concentrations of the inhibitors under study. The running buffer for the measurements contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% P-20, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The Kd of the pYEEI inhibitor was monitored frequently to ensure the reproducibility of the experimental measurements. Crystals of human p56lck SH2 domain in complex with the cmFEEI inhibitor were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The inhibitor stock solution was at 42 mm in Me2SO. The SH2 domain (final concentration, 18 mg/ml) was combined with a 1.2-fold molar excess of the inhibitor, giving a final concentration of about 4.5% for Me2SO. The reservoir solutions contained 100 mmsodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 30% PEG 8000, and 200 mmsodium acetate. X-ray diffraction data to 1.8 Å resolution were collected at cryo-temperature on a R-Axis imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator. The diffraction images were processed with DENZO (16Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Crystals are isomorphous to those in complex with the pYEEI inhibitor (14Tong L. Warren T.C. King J. Betageri R. Rose J. Jakes S. J. Mol.

Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Reflections between 6.0 and 1.8 Å resolution (after applying a 2ς cut-off) were used in the refinement. The inhibitor molecule was built into the electron density map with the program FRODO (18Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) after one cycle of simulated annealing positional refinement. Solvent molecules were identified after the refinement of restrained individual temperature factors from peaks in the difference electron density map that have reasonable hydrogen-bonding interactions with the SH2 domain.Table ISummary of crystallographic informationcmFEEI complexFree SH2 domainCell parametersa = 80.7 Å, b= 45.2 Å, c = 26.1 Åa = b = 58.8 Å, c = 110.5 ÅNumber of diffraction images5536Number of observations1970442626Number of unique reflections815113477Maximum resolution (Å)1.81.9Rmerge (%)6.86.0Reflections in refinement6.0–1.8 Å6.0–1.9 ÅNumber of reflections788312909Completeness (%)9591Number of water molecules107141R factor (%)22.624.0Root mean square deviation in bond lengths (Å)0.0110.014Root mean square deviation in bond angles (°)1.72.0 Open table in a new tab Crystals of the free p56lck SH2 domain were grown in the presence of a weak phosphotyrosyl inhibitor (Kd = 2.5 μmat pH 7.4).

X-ray diffraction data to 1.9 Å resolution were collected at cryo-temperature on a crystal measuring 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.3 mm3 (Table I). The crystals belong to space groupP43212, with two molecules of the SH2 domain in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the pYEEI complex at 1.8 Å resolution was used as the model for the structure determination by the molecular replacement method with the program Replace (19Tong L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 748-751Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The combined molecular replacement protocol (20Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. 1996; A52: 782-784Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) successfully located both SH2 molecules for this structure determination, whereas several attempts using traditional molecular replacement methods failed to locate the second molecule. The structure was refined using the slow cooling simulated annealing protocol with the program X-PLOR (17Brunger A.T. The X-PLOR Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Residues 155–162 and 170–177 in the two molecules were fitted to the electron density map after omit refinement. The inhibitor molecule was, however, not visible in the electron density map, and the crystal therefore contained free SH2 domain molecules (see “Results and Discussion”). The crystal structure of the human p56lck SH2 domain in complex with an inhibitor containing a phosphotyrosine replacement has been determined at 1.8 Å resolution. The doubly charged phosphotyrosine residue is replaced with a singly chargedp-(carboxymethyl)phenylalanine residue (Fig.1). Despite the large decrease in potency of the carboxylate inhibitor cmFEEI, it binds to the SH2 domain in a conformation very similar to that of the phosphate inhibitor pYEEI (14Tong L. Warren T.C. King J. Betageri R. Rose J. Jakes S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The conformations of the Ile residue at the pY+3 position are especially similar between the two inhibitors. Some of the observed differences in the side chains of the Glu residues of the inhibitors, especially those at the pY+2 position, are likely because of flexibility. The three nonbridging oxygen atoms (O1, O2, and O3) of the phosphate group (Fig. 2) make different interactions with the SH2 domain (13Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 14Tong L. Warren T.C. King J. Betageri R. Rose J. Jakes S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Two of them (O1and O2) participate in tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein, involving the main chain amide group of Glu-157, and the side chains of Arg-134, Arg-154, and Ser-164 (Fig.3). The third oxygen atom (O3) appears to have weaker interactions with the SH2 domain, making only one hydrogen bond to the side chain of Ser-158 in the BC loop (residues 157–161) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the cmF residue in the cmFEEI complex are almost superimposable on the O1 and O2 atoms of the phosphate group, maintaining the strongest interactions to the SH2 domain that are observed for the phosphate (Figs. 2 and 3). The apparently weaker interactions from the third oxygen atom of the phosphate appear to be sacrificed by the carboxylate inhibitor. Small conformational differences are observed between the phenyl ring of the Tyr(P) residue and that of the cmF residue (Fig. 2). Most of these differences can be interpreted to be a consequence of the differences in hybridization between the carboxylate and phosphate groups, and the requirement of placing the carboxylate oxygen atoms near the two oxygens (O1 and O2) of the Tyr(P) side chain to maintain optimal interactions with the SH2 domain. The phosphate group is tetrahedral, whereas the carboxylate group is planar. Consequently, a much smaller torsion angle across the CZ–CH bond (16 ° based on the structure) is needed to make the carboxylate oxygens in the cmF side chain pointing in the same direction as the two oxygens in the Tyr(P) side chain. In comparison, the Tyr(P) side chain has a torsion angle of close to 90 ° across the equivalent CZ–OH bond, which is also expected to be energetically more favorable. The small torsion angle in the cmF side chain places the carboxylate group almost in the plane of the phenyl ring. Possibly as a consequence of this, a rotation (Fig. 2 C) and translation (Fig.2 B) of the phenyl ring of the cmF side chain is observed, so that the carboxylate oxygens are in superposition with the phosphate oxygens. The guanidinium group of the side chain of Arg-134 shows a similar translation as the phenyl ring (Fig. 3), possibly to maintain optimal amino-aromatic interactions (21Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Because the cmFEEI inhibitor lacks any atoms at the O3position of the pYEEI inhibitor, it probably has weaker interactions with the BC loop. A small conformational change in this loop is observed, as compared with that of the pYEEI complex structure. Residue Ser-158 moves slightly away from the inhibitor (Fig. 3). A much larger rearrangement of the BC loop is observed in the crystal structure of the free p56lck SH2 domain, determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystals were grown in the presence of a weak pY-containing inhibitor (Kd = 2.5 μm). However, the inhibitor binding regions of the molecules are blocked by residues from neighboring molecules in the crystal. The extremely low pH of the crystallization solution (pH 4.5) is expected to significantly reduce the potency of the inhibitor (Ref. 10Charifson P.S. Shewchuk L.M. Rocque W. Hummel C.W. Jordan S.R. Mohr C. Pacofsky G.J. Peel M.R. Rodriguez M. Sternbach D.D. Consler T.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6283-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and see discussions below). This might explain the lack of inhibitor binding in these crystals. Residues Glu-155 (N–Cα bond) and Ser-162 (Cα–C bond) appear to be the hinge for the conformational change of the BC loop (Fig.4), which significantly affects the shape of the Tyr(P) binding pocket. In comparison, the BC loop in the freesrc SH2 domain was found to exist mostly in the closed conformation based on a crystal structure analysis (12Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The two molecules in the crystal assume essentially the same conformation for this loop (Fig. 4). Such a “gated” conformational change for the BC loop was first observed in the structure of p56lck SH2 domain in complex with phosphonomethyl-phenylalanine inhibitors (7Mikol V. Baumann G. Keller T.H. Manning U. Zurini M.G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the crystal lattice of the free SH2 domain, the BC loops in both molecules are involved in crystal packing interactions. However, the details of these interactions are different between the two molecules. Moreover, the BC loops in the phosphonomethyl-phenylalanine inhibitor complexes are essentially not involved in crystal packing (7Mikol V. Baumann G. Keller T.H. Manning U. Zurini M.G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The conformations of the BC loops in these two different crystalline lattices are essentially the same. It is therefore unlikely that the open conformation observed here is due solely to crystal packing effects. The closed conformation of this loop in the pYEEI complex enclose the Tyr(P) residue (Fig. 4). Additional stabilization of this conformation is probably provided by the hydrogen bond between Ser-158 at the tip of this loop and the phosphate group. The 450-fold loss in potency by the replacement of a phosphate group with a carboxylate group (Fig. 1) appears to be because of several factors. The loss of one negative charge is expected to have the greatest effect in weakening the interactions between the carboxylate inhibitor and the SH2 domain. This is partly reflected by the observed pH dependence of the potency of the pYEEI inhibitor. A 40-fold loss in potency against the src SH2 domain is observed for phosphotyrosine-containing inhibitors when the pH is lowered from 8.0 to 4.6 (10Charifson P.S. Shewchuk L.M. Rocque W. Hummel C.W. Jordan S.R. Mohr C. Pacofsky G.J. Peel M.R. Rodriguez M. Sternbach D.D. Consler T.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6283-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is believed that this loss in potency is because of the protonation of the phosphate group in solution, which will make the phosphate a singly charged species. The replacement of the bridging oxygen atom in the Tyr(P) residue with a methylene in the cmF residue results in the loss of a hydrogen bond to the SH2 domain (12Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This replacement leads to roughly a 40-fold loss in potency in the phosphonomethyl-phenylalanyl inhibitors as compared with Tyr(P) inhibitors (4Burke Jr T.R. Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Nomizu M. Roller P.P.

The fluorine atoms lower the pKa of the phosphonate and can also maintain the same hydrogen bond with the SH2 domain as the bridging oxygen atom of the Tyr(P) residue (10Charifson P.S. Shewchuk L.M.

It might be interesting to try to establish such interactions in the carboxymethyl-phenylalanine inhibitors. The apparently decreased interactions with the BC loop of the SH2 domain may also be detrimental for the potency of the carboxylate inhibitor, although the BC loop is in a closed conformation in the cmFEEI inhibitor complex. Finally, the bound conformation of the cmFEEI inhibitor may not be the most favorable energetically. The torsion angle of 16 ° across the CZ–CH bond probably would cause steric repulsions between the carboxylate group and the phenyl ring, lowering the potency of the inhibitor. The observed 450-fold loss in potency of the cmFEEI inhibitor in our study compares favorably with that observed for the cmFEEIE inhibitor against the src SH2 domain (5Gilmer T. Rodriguez M. Jordan S. Crosby R. Alligood K. Green M. Kimery M. Wagner C. Kinder D. Charifson P. Hassell A.M. Willard D. Luther M. Rusnak D. Sternbach D.D. Mehrotra M. Peel M. Shampine L. Davis R. Robbins J.

In that study, the cmF residue is present as a racemic mixture, and a 940-fold loss in potency was observed. Experiments with Tyr(P) have shown that theD-form of the residue has 6–20-fold reduced potency relative to the L-form (5Gilmer T. Rodriguez M. Jordan S. Crosby R. Alligood K. Green M. Kimery M.

Therefore, theL-form of the cmFEEIE inhibitor would be expected to have a potency loss of about 500-fold, in good agreement with our results on the cmFEEI inhibitor against the p56lck SH2 domain. The crystal structure of p56lck SH2 domain in complex with a nonphosphate inhibitor shows that the singly charged carboxymethyl group has a similar mode of interaction and is therefore a reasonable replacement for the phosphate group. The improvement in the pharmacokinetic properties of a carboxylate inhibitor versusa phosphate inhibitor probably outweighs the loss of potency in the carboxylate inhibitor. Moreover, the potency of the carboxylate inhibitors may be improved by the establishment of stronger binding to other areas of the protein, for example the BC loop and the pY+3 pocket, and by stabilization of the bound conformation of the inhibitor. A cyclic peptide containing a simple Tyr in place of Tyr(P) has been shown to inhibit Grb2 SH2 domain at 20 μmpotency (22Oligino L. Lung F.D. Sastry L. Bigelow J. Cao T. Curran M. Burke Jr T.R.

This crystal structure provides a starting point for the design of such carboxylate-containing inhibitors of the p56lck and other SH2 domains, preferably with nonpeptide moieties at the other positions (9Plummer M.S.

The carboxymethyl group as a phosphate replacement could also prove useful in the development of inhibitors against other protein targets that normally recognize phosphate groups."

These paraneurons express the two main types of nAChRs present in the peripheral nervous system; the one sensitive to α-bungarotoxin is formed by α7 subunits (18Garcı́a-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Stühmer W. Gutiérrez L.M. Criado M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the insensitive one is probably composed of α3, α5, and β4 subunits (19Criado M. Alamo L. Navarro A. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Campos-Caro A. Smillie F. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agulló F. Chapuli J. Juı́z J.M. Sala S. Sala F. Ballesta J.J.

Acetylcholine triggers catecholamine secretion through a mechanism that apparently involves the latter nAChR subtype (21Gu H. Wenger B.W. Lopez I. McKay S.B. Boyd R.T. McKay D.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The function of the α-bungarotoxin-sensitive nAChRs in chromaffin cells remains obscure. The high Ca2+ permeability of these receptors (22Séguéla P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests their involvement in the control of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Previously, we have shown that they are differentially expressed in adrenergic cells (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably providing these cells with an additional way of epinephrine release. Accordingly, α7 subunit expression is also restricted to adrenergic cells by a mechanism that appears to be mediated by the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1. This protein was found to be expressed exclusively in adrenergic cells and shown to bind to two sites within the proximal promoter of the α7 gene (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to further characterize the elements acting at this promoter. We report here that, in addition to the two Egr-1 sites previously described, at least two other positive regulatory elements exist. One of these elements, a GC-box, was shown to interact with Egr-1 (and also Sp1), whereas the other, an E-box, is recognized by transcription factors USF1 and USF2.DISCUSSIONNeuronal nAChRs play a significant role in the central and peripheral nervous systems, probably regulating transmitter release at many synapses (reviewed in Ref. 4Role L.W. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Their functional importance in these processes is evidenced just by taking into account the behavioral and cognitive effects of nicotine abuse (37Dani J.A. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 905-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and the involvement of neuronal nAChRs in the pathogeny of many neurological disorders (38Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Several genes that encode nAChR subunits have been identified (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), and, depending on the subunit composition, their heterologous expression has shown clear differences in electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (5Papke R.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 509-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is important to understand how the expression of the different subunits is regulated. The present study was aimed to characterize the cis-elements andtrans-acting factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the nAChR α7 subunit gene.From 5′-end deletion analysis (Fig. 1), we determined that the region located between nucleotides −77 and +43 was necessary for the basal promoter activity observed in SHSY-5Y cells. Additional positive elements, outside this region, may be operative in chromaffin cells, as demonstrated by the slight increase in the activity of larger constructs (see Fig. 1 and also Ref. 23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a comparison of larger fragments of the α7 promoter). However, the most striking fact was the large stepwise loss in promoter activity of p51α7LUC with respect to a larger construct (p77α7LUC). Since the region between −51 and −77 contains an E-box and a GC-rich sequence (labeled 3 and4 in Fig. 1 A, respectively), these elements appeared to be essential for promoter activity. Consequently, when any of these elements was mutated in the context of p77α7LUC, promoter activity was reduced to ∼50% (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, these elements seem necessary but not sufficient for maximal promoter activity, since simultaneous mutation of other two downstream GC-boxes (labeled1 and 2 in Fig. 1 A), while keeping intact elements 3 and 4, produced a large decrease in activity (Fig.2). This is also the case for other double mutant in which elements 1 and 3 had been removed. Therefore, a primary conclusion of this study is that the basal activity of the α7 subunit promoter is not defined by a predominant unique element; it rather seems to reflect the cumulative and concerted action of several transcription factors.Element 3 corresponds to an E-box (Fig. 1). Several class B E-box binding proteins have been identified and shown to bind the CACGTG consensus site (39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These include USF, which preferentially binds to this region when a thymidine residue precedes the consensus region (TCACGTG; see Ref. 39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Element 3 in the α7 promoter region has exactly this sequence. Our band shift assays identified USF1 and USF2 as the transcription factors that are binding to element 3. Although some minor complexes were only displaced by USF1 antibodies, the major band was supershifted by both anti-USF1 and USF2 antibodies, indicating that a heterodimer of both proteins constitutes the main E-box binding factor. Interestingly, nuclear extracts of human SHSY-5Y and bovine chromaffin cells yielded essentially the same band shift pattern, suggesting that regulation of the α7 promoter may follow similar pathways in both species. This assumption, however, will have to be confirmed once information about the human α7 promoter is available. The avian α7 promoter, by contrast, does not contain such an unambiguous USF binding site (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernández M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although several CANNTG sequences are present in the proximal promoter region. Their functionality, if any, has not been explored.The other main elements in the core region of the α7 promoter are composed of GC-boxes. Our previous study indicated that the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1 was able to bind to elements 1 and 2 in the context of p38α7LUC (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed these results in a broader context (p77α7LUC) and shown that Egr-1 can also bind to another site (element 4). Moreover, the functionality of these elements is demonstrated when they are eliminated from p77α7LUC by site-directed mutagenesis; the three elements are needed for maximal basal activity, although they do not appear equivalent (Fig. 2). Thus, it is interesting that the individual mutation of site 4 produced a marked decrease in promoter activity, whereas its counterparts at sites 1 and 2 did not produce this effect, unless the mutations take place simultaneously. Therefore, a certain hierarchical order is suggested, in which site 4 appears critical for basal promoter activity, whereas at least one of the other two needs also to be operative. The co-transfection experiments with the Egr-1 expression plasmid (Fig. 8) confirmed that the three GC-boxes are involved in Egr-1 activation, but again in a nonequivalent manner. Thus, sites 2 and 4 can be individually removed without affecting Egr-1 activation, but site 1 needs to remain intact for maximal activation. In addition, when this site and any of the other two are simultaneously mutated, Egr-1 activation is abolished. Taken together, these results indicate that Egr-1 can bind to the three sites and perform its action by binding at least to two of them (preferentially the most promoter-proximal and -distant ones), probably through a synergistic mechanism.In Fig. 9, we postulate a hypothesis on the basal transcriptional regulation of the α7 subunit gene, which takes into account our results and have been suggested by a recent model applied to the promoter of the nAChR β4 subunit gene (16Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As happens with several nAChR subunits, the promoter of the α7 subunit is in a class of promoters that lack a canonical TATA box and, like many of them, it contains several GC-boxes (boxes 1, 2, and 4; Fig. 9) to which Egr-1 can bind. Upon binding to at least two elements, Egr-1 may be involved in interactions with other transcriptional co-activators and the basal transcription machinery to activate α7 subunit expression. The Egr-1 sites that have been detected are probably interrelated, perhaps by direct Egr-1 contacts (elements 1 and 2) or through other proteins (elements 1 and 2 with element 4). In addition, USF proteins are also critical in transcriptional activation upon interacting with the E-box of element 3. It is believed that USF1 affects transcription by interacting with the TFIID complex (40Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 41Kokubo T. Takada R. Yamashita S. Gong D.-W. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17554-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, specifically, with the TFIID subunit TAFII55 (42Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the case of the α7 subunit promoter, the USF binding element is not closely adjacent to the transcription initiation site; hence, USF binding proteins may carry out their action through an additional protein, as it happens with PC5, a co-factor that has been demonstrated to mediate transcriptional activation by USF1 (43Halle J.-P. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 272: 1753-1760Google Scholar). Finally, a cooperative effect of Egr-1 (at site 1) and USF (at site 3) on transcriptional initiation appears plausible, if we consider that the double mutant of these elements (pmut 3–1 α7LUC) showed a decrease in promoter activity larger than the mere addition of the effects produced by the respective single mutants (pmut 1α7LUC and pmut 3 α7LUC). For this reason, we have depicted a complex of co-activators whose action may depend on their simultaneous interactions with USF and Egr-1 proteins.Although a number of neuronal genes appear to be regulated in a cell type-specific manner by silencer elements (44Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramı́rez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altschuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we have not detected them in the α7 subunit promoter. If they exist, they might be acting at sites not included in our constructs. Another possibility of tissue- or cell-specific regulation could be through the antagonistic effect that other factors can exert by binding at the E- and GC-boxes. For instance, members of the Sp transcription factor family could bind to G/C-rich elements and block the activating effect of Egr-1. Although neither Sp1 nor Sp3 was shown to interact with the GC-boxes in the context of our gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from chromaffin and SHSY-5Y cells, we have demonstrated that recombinant Sp1 can bind to element 4 in the basal promoter of the α7 subunit. Therefore, depending on the concentration, cell cycle-regulated expression, or phosphorylation state of Egr-1 and Sp factors, an interplay between them could be established, as has been demonstrated for other promoters (34Skerka C.

According to a previous study (39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the surrounding sequence of element 3 in the α7 subunit promoter is optimal for the binding of USF proteins, but certain physiological conditions could alter binding specificity or protein availability. Finally, if certain co-activators are needed for coupling to the RNA polymerase II complex, as we propose in Fig. 9, their concentration, functionality, etc. in a determined cellular type would also be significant in regulating α7 subunit expression.

This variety arises, at least in part, from the different combinations of subunits that can form functional nAChRs (5Papke R.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 509-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since each of the subunits exhibits well defined and restricted expression patterns in vivo (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), it is of interest to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the expression of nAChR subunit genes. At present, both positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements have been described in several nAChR subunits (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernández M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M.

The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla constitute a good model system in which to study the function and regulation of neuronal nAChRs. These paraneurons express the two main types of nAChRs present in the peripheral nervous system; the one sensitive to α-bungarotoxin is formed by α7 subunits (18Garcı́a-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Stühmer W. Gutiérrez L.M. Criado M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the insensitive one is probably composed of α3, α5, and β4 subunits (19Criado M. Alamo L. Navarro A. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Campos-Caro A. Smillie F. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agulló F. Chapuli J. Juı́z J.M. Sala S. Sala F. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine triggers catecholamine secretion through a mechanism that apparently involves the latter nAChR subtype (21Gu H. Wenger B.W. Lopez I. McKay S.B. Boyd R.T. McKay D.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The function of the α-bungarotoxin-sensitive nAChRs in chromaffin cells remains obscure. The high Ca2+ permeability of these receptors (22Séguéla P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests their involvement in the control of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Previously, we have shown that they are differentially expressed in adrenergic cells (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably providing these cells with an additional way of epinephrine release. Accordingly, α7 subunit expression is also restricted to adrenergic cells by a mechanism that appears to be mediated by the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1. This protein was found to be expressed exclusively in adrenergic cells and shown to bind to two sites within the proximal promoter of the α7 gene (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to further characterize the elements acting at this promoter. We report here that, in addition to the two Egr-1 sites previously described, at least two other positive regulatory elements exist. One of these elements, a GC-box, was shown to interact with Egr-1 (and also Sp1), whereas the other, an E-box, is recognized by transcription factors USF1 and USF2. DISCUSSIONNeuronal nAChRs play a significant role in the central and peripheral nervous systems, probably regulating transmitter release at many synapses (reviewed in Ref. 4Role L.W. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Their functional importance in these processes is evidenced just by taking into account the behavioral and cognitive effects of nicotine abuse (37Dani J.A. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 905-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and the involvement of neuronal nAChRs in the pathogeny of many neurological disorders (38Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Several genes that encode nAChR subunits have been identified (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), and, depending on the subunit composition, their heterologous expression has shown clear differences in electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (5Papke R.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 509-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is important to understand how the expression of the different subunits is regulated. The present study was aimed to characterize the cis-elements andtrans-acting factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the nAChR α7 subunit gene.From 5′-end deletion analysis (Fig. 1), we determined that the region located between nucleotides −77 and +43 was necessary for the basal promoter activity observed in SHSY-5Y cells. Additional positive elements, outside this region, may be operative in chromaffin cells, as demonstrated by the slight increase in the activity of larger constructs (see Fig. 1 and also Ref. 23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a comparison of larger fragments of the α7 promoter). However, the most striking fact was the large stepwise loss in promoter activity of p51α7LUC with respect to a larger construct (p77α7LUC). Since the region between −51 and −77 contains an E-box and a GC-rich sequence (labeled 3 and4 in Fig. 1 A, respectively), these elements appeared to be essential for promoter activity. Consequently, when any of these elements was mutated in the context of p77α7LUC, promoter activity was reduced to ∼50% (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, these elements seem necessary but not sufficient for maximal promoter activity, since simultaneous mutation of other two downstream GC-boxes (labeled1 and 2 in Fig. 1 A), while keeping intact elements 3 and 4, produced a large decrease in activity (Fig.2). This is also the case for other double mutant in which elements 1 and 3 had been removed. Therefore, a primary conclusion of this study is that the basal activity of the α7 subunit promoter is not defined by a predominant unique element; it rather seems to reflect the cumulative and concerted action of several transcription factors.Element 3 corresponds to an E-box (Fig. 1). Several class B E-box binding proteins have been identified and shown to bind the CACGTG consensus site (39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These include USF, which preferentially binds to this region when a thymidine residue precedes the consensus region (TCACGTG; see Ref. 39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Element 3 in the α7 promoter region has exactly this sequence. Our band shift assays identified USF1 and USF2 as the transcription factors that are binding to element 3. Although some minor complexes were only displaced by USF1 antibodies, the major band was supershifted by both anti-USF1 and USF2 antibodies, indicating that a heterodimer of both proteins constitutes the main E-box binding factor. Interestingly, nuclear extracts of human SHSY-5Y and bovine chromaffin cells yielded essentially the same band shift pattern, suggesting that regulation of the α7 promoter may follow similar pathways in both species. This assumption, however, will have to be confirmed once information about the human α7 promoter is available. The avian α7 promoter, by contrast, does not contain such an unambiguous USF binding site (6Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernández M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although several CANNTG sequences are present in the proximal promoter region. Their functionality, if any, has not been explored.The other main elements in the core region of the α7 promoter are composed of GC-boxes. Our previous study indicated that the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1 was able to bind to elements 1 and 2 in the context of p38α7LUC (23Criado M. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juı́z J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed these results in a broader context (p77α7LUC) and shown that Egr-1 can also bind to another site (element 4). Moreover, the functionality of these elements is demonstrated when they are eliminated from p77α7LUC by site-directed mutagenesis; the three elements are needed for maximal basal activity, although they do not appear equivalent (Fig. 2). Thus, it is interesting that the individual mutation of site 4 produced a marked decrease in promoter activity, whereas its counterparts at sites 1 and 2 did not produce this effect, unless the mutations take place simultaneously. Therefore, a certain hierarchical order is suggested, in which site 4 appears critical for basal promoter activity, whereas at least one of the other two needs also to be operative. The co-transfection experiments with the Egr-1 expression plasmid (Fig. 8) confirmed that the three GC-boxes are involved in Egr-1 activation, but again in a nonequivalent manner. Thus, sites 2 and 4 can be individually removed without affecting Egr-1 activation, but site 1 needs to remain intact for maximal activation. In addition, when this site and any of the other two are simultaneously mutated, Egr-1 activation is abolished. Taken together, these results indicate that Egr-1 can bind to the three sites and perform its action by binding at least to two of them (preferentially the most promoter-proximal and -distant ones), probably through a synergistic mechanism.In Fig. 9, we postulate a hypothesis on the basal transcriptional regulation of the α7 subunit gene, which takes into account our results and have been suggested by a recent model applied to the promoter of the nAChR β4 subunit gene (16Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As happens with several nAChR subunits, the promoter of the α7 subunit is in a class of promoters that lack a canonical TATA box and, like many of them, it contains several GC-boxes (boxes 1, 2, and 4; Fig. 9) to which Egr-1 can bind. Upon binding to at least two elements, Egr-1 may be involved in interactions with other transcriptional co-activators and the basal transcription machinery to activate α7 subunit expression. The Egr-1 sites that have been detected are probably interrelated, perhaps by direct Egr-1 contacts (elements 1 and 2) or through other proteins (elements 1 and 2 with element 4). In addition, USF proteins are also critical in transcriptional activation upon interacting with the E-box of element 3. It is believed that USF1 affects transcription by interacting with the TFIID complex (40Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 41Kokubo T. Takada R. Yamashita S. Gong D.-W. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17554-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, specifically, with the TFIID subunit TAFII55 (42Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the case of the α7 subunit promoter, the USF binding element is not closely adjacent to the transcription initiation site; hence, USF binding proteins may carry out their action through an additional protein, as it happens with PC5, a co-factor that has been demonstrated to mediate transcriptional activation by USF1 (43Halle J.-P. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 272: 1753-1760Google Scholar). Finally, a cooperative effect of Egr-1 (at site 1) and USF (at site 3) on transcriptional initiation appears plausible, if we consider that the double mutant of these elements (pmut 3–1 α7LUC) showed a decrease in promoter activity larger than the mere addition of the effects produced by the respective single mutants (pmut 1α7LUC and pmut 3 α7LUC). For this reason, we have depicted a complex of co-activators whose action may depend on their simultaneous interactions with USF and Egr-1 proteins.Although a number of neuronal genes appear to be regulated in a cell type-specific manner by silencer elements (44Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramı́rez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altschuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we have not detected them in the α7 subunit promoter. If they exist, they might be acting at sites not included in our constructs. Another possibility of tissue- or cell-specific regulation could be through the antagonistic effect that other factors can exert by binding at the E- and GC-boxes. For instance, members of the Sp transcription factor family could bind to G/C-rich elements and block the activating effect of Egr-1. Although neither Sp1 nor Sp3 was shown to interact with the GC-boxes in the context of our gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from chromaffin and SHSY-5Y cells, we have demonstrated that recombinant Sp1 can bind to element 4 in the basal promoter of the α7 subunit. Therefore, depending on the concentration, cell cycle-regulated expression, or phosphorylation state of Egr-1 and Sp factors, an interplay between them could be established, as has been demonstrated for other promoters (34Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Cui M.-Z. Parry G.C.N. Oeth P. Larson H. Smith M. Huang R.-P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27411-47421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A similar effect could take place upon binding of Myc family members to the E-box element 3. According to a previous study (39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the surrounding sequence of element 3 in the α7 subunit promoter is optimal for the binding of USF proteins, but certain physiological conditions could alter binding specificity or protein availability. Finally, if certain co-activators are needed for coupling to the RNA polymerase II complex, as we propose in Fig. 9, their concentration, functionality, etc. in a determined cellular type would also be significant in regulating α7 subunit expression. Neuronal nAChRs play a significant role in the central and peripheral nervous systems, probably regulating transmitter release at many synapses (reviewed in Ref. 4Role L.W. Berg D.K.

According to a previous study (39Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the surrounding sequence of element 3 in the α7 subunit promoter is optimal for the binding of USF proteins, but certain physiological conditions could alter binding specificity or protein availability. Finally, if certain co-activators are needed for coupling to the RNA polymerase II complex, as we propose in Fig. 9, their concentration, functionality, etc. in a determined cellular type would also be significant in regulating α7 subunit expression.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Mammalian Kv channels are encoded by a family of 19 known genes, each with its own unique profile of pharmacological and biophysical properties and tissue distribution (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Kv channel expression is known to be regulated in complex ways in both embryonic and adult cells. One member of this family, Kv1.4, is expressed in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (3Lesage F. Attali B. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,4Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

The functional channel consists of four identical subunits and has properties resembling a typical rapidly inactivating “A” current channel (5Lee T.E. Philipson L.H. Nelson D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within neurons, Kv1.4 channels are found in nerve terminals where they are thought to underlie the rapid after-hyperpolarization during action potentials (6Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This channel is sensitive to external 4-aminopyridine and Ba2+ (7Wymore R.S. Korenberg J.R. Kinoshita K.D. Aiyar J. Coyne C.

The mKv1.4 gene is known to generate at least three transcripts, 2.4, 3.5, and 4.5 kb in size (3Lesage F. Attali B. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), that are under the control of a single GC-rich promoter (4Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J.

The 2.4-kb transcript has been found only in skeletal muscle and in the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 where it is up-regulated during myotube formation (3Lesage F. Attali B. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 3.5- and 4.5-kb transcripts, which are expressed in heart and brain, begin at a single transcription initiation site and differ only by their use of alternate polyadenylation sites in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (4Wymore R.S.

The 5′-UTRs of typical mammalian genes are relatively short (average length, ∼150 nt) and lack both AUGs stable secondary structure (10Pesole G. Fiormarino G. Saccone C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 140: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By contrast, the 5′-UTR ofmKv1.4 (mouse Kv1.4) is long (∼1.2 kb), contains 18 upstream AUG codons, and has a predicted complex secondary structure with numerous stable hairpin structures (Fig.1). Several of the upstream AUG codons are contained within a favorable context for initiation (11Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and are followed by open reading frames as long as 40 amino acids, none of which is contiguous with the authentic coding region. At least three mechanisms are known for eukaryotic translation initiation, namely 5′ → 3′ scanning, “shunting,” and internal ribosome entry. In the scanning model, the 40 S ribosomal subunit (bound to the ternary complex) binds to the 5′ cap complex and travels in a 5′ → 3′ direction until it encounters an initiator AUG codon in a favorable context; the 60 S ribosomal subunit then joins the complex, and peptide synthesis begins (11Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Translation initiation of most vertebrate genes is thought to occur by this mechanism. The shunting mechanism is also 5′ cap-dependent but differs from scanning in that the 40 S subunit bypasses the majority of the 5′-UTR by shunting or “jumping” to a region at or near the authentic site of translation initiation, avoiding having to scan through most of the 5′-UTR (12Futterer J. Kiss-Laszlo Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, translation initiation by internal ribosome entry involves the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) at or near the authentic AUG, thereby eliminating the requirement both for the presence of a 5′ cap structure and for scanning through the greater part of the 5′-UTR (for review see Refs. 14Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stewart S.R. Semler B.L. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 242-255Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presence of upstream AUG codons and stable secondary structures are both known to interfere with ribosome scanning and to inhibit translation initiation at the authentic start site of typical vertebrate genes (17Gabelle A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-198Google Scholar, 18Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control, eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar, 19Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The presence of both of these features in the 5′-UTR of mKv1.4 thus suggests the possibility that translation initiation for this gene may occur by some mechanism other than 5′ cap-dependent scanning. Here we report that the 5′-UTR ofmKv1.4 contains an IRES that can initiate efficient translation of a reporter protein in a 5′ cap-independent fashion. We propose that translation initiation by internal ribosome entry may represent a general and important mechanism for regulation of expression of this gene as well as other members of the extended family of potassium-selective channels. Bicistronic constructs (20Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) containing the reporter genes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase (LUC) were gifts from Peter Sarnow. The SV40 promoter and the T7 promoter control transcription of both reporter genes in the SV construct and the T7 vector, respectively. The intercistronic spacer of both vectors contains a unique SalI site for cloning. The cDNA for mKv1.4 was isolated from mouse brain by reverse transcription-PCR using the following primer pair: sense, 5′-AGCTAGAGAGCAAGACTGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-ATAAGGCCATATGGCTGTTGC-3′. The 5′-UTR was amplified by PCR to generate SalI restriction sites on both the 3′ and 5′ ends using the following primer pair: sense, 5′-AGCTAGAGTCGACGACTGGGATGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACTCACCATCGCCACGTCGACGGTGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the intercistronic spacers of both constructs (SV and T7) at the unique SalI site, and its orientation was determined by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. This procedure removed 13 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the full-length 5′-UTR. Constructs containing a hairpin loop were generated by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides shown below, which are flanked bySalI extensions, and cloning this synthetic DNA fragment into the SalI site in the intercistronic spacer: The underlined regions form 19-nt RNA stems with a calculated free energy of −41 kcal/mol, and a SalI site is restored at only one of the two ends (the right-hand end above) after insertion. The orientation of this insert was determined by DNA sequencing, and clones were chosen that had the restored SalI site at the 3′ end of the insert. The 200-nt 3′-proximal region of the 5′-UTR was amplified by PCR using the following primers (which generated SalI sites at their termini): sense, 5′-AGGCAAGCTGTCGACAGCAACGCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCTAGAGTCGACGACTGGGATGG-3′. After digestion with SalI, the PCR-amplified fragment was cloned into the SalI site of the intercistronic spacer. The orientation of this fragment was determined by DNA sequencing. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 1 g/liter glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h prior to transfection cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/90-mm plate. On the day of transfection, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then covered with 8 ml of fresh medium. 20 μg of DNA (isolated either from cesium chloride density gradients or by use of the Qiagen Maxi-prep (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA)) was combined with 50 μl of 2 mCaCl2 and 450 μl of sterile water. The DNA solution was combined with 500 μl of 2× HBS (275 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 42 mm HEPES, 12 mmdextrose) by vortexing for 15 s. The solution was held at room temperature for 20 min and gently pipetted onto the cells, and the cells were washed and resuspended as described above. 64–72 h after transfection, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and extracted on lysis buffer. Cell lysates were pelleted, and the supernatants were assayed for LUC activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). CAT activity was measured with the Promega CAT assay kit. DNA templates for in vitro transcriptions were linearized withHpaI, and transcriptions using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase were performed as described by Roehl and Semler (21Roehl H.H. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the modification that all transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mmm7GpppG cap analog. All transcripts were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, twice precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol, and desalted using spin column chromatography. RNAs were quantitated by spectrophotometry. Translations were performed in 50% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 40% (v/v) ribosomal salt wash from HeLa cells. Ribosomal salt wash was prepared from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells as described by Brown and Ehrenfeld (22Brown B.A. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1979; 97: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). All translation reactions (total volume, 20 μl) were programmed with 500 ng of in vitro transcribed RNA and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. LUC and CAT activities were determined as described above. To test for the presence of an IRES in the 5′-UTR of mKv1.4, we introduced this sequence into the intercistronic spacer of a bicistronic vector (20Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) containing two reporter proteins, CAT and LUC, present on a single transcript under the control of the SV40 promoter. Translation of CAT occurs by the 5′ cap-dependent ribosome scanning mechanism, whereas efficient translation of LUC, on the other hand, occurs only if the intercistronic spacer contains a sequence with IRES activity that allows internal binding of ribosomes. These constructs were transfected into NIH-3T3 or COS-1 cells, and CAT and LUC activities were measured 64–72 h post-transfection. CAT activity served as an indicator of transfection efficiency, and results (determined in triplicate) for each experimental condition are displayed as the ratio of LUC to CAT activity. Representative results of such transfections are shown in Fig.2. The control vector lacking themKv1.4 5′-UTR sequence (Fig. 2, line 1) shows some LUC activity in NIH-3T3 cells, possibly because of leaky translation termination at the CAT stop codon and ribosomal read-through (11Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To reduce this background activity, we inserted a stable hairpin structure downstream from the CAT stop codon, as indicated in line 2 of Fig. 2. This structure has a predicted free energy of −41 kcal/mol and reduces translational read-through to negligible values (Fig. 2, line 2). All subsequent studies of the IRES were carried out using constructs containing this stem-loop. In the presence of the 1.2-kb 5′-UTR ofmKv1.4 (Fig. 2, line 3), LUC/CAT activity is increased to nearly 400, indicating that this sequence possesses IRES activity. A construct containing only the 3′-most 200 nt of the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2, line 4) also shows activity comparable with that of the 1.2-kb fragment, suggesting that IRES activity is largely contained within this region. Neither the 1.2-kb nor the 200-nt fragments exhibit substantial IRES activity when cloned into the SVsl vector in theantisense direction (Fig. 2, lines 5 and6), confirming the sequence specificity of this activity. Similar results were obtained when transfections were carried out in COS-1 cells (data not shown). IRES-dependent translation initiation is expected to be 5′ cap-independent, and extracts from poliovirus-infected cells have been used to suppress cap-dependent translation while not affecting IRES activity in a bicistronic expression vector (23Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). In poliovirus-infected cells, viral mRNA is translated efficiently, whereas translation of host mRNA is severely inhibited due to the proteolytic cleavage of the eIF-4G (formerly called p220 or eIF-4γ) subunit of the cap binding complex eIF-4F (24Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by viral proteinase 2A. The only cellular mRNAs translated in poliovirus-infected cells are those that use a 5′ cap-independent internal ribosome entry mechanism. If themKv1.4 5′-UTR does indeed encode an IRES, its translation should be 5′ cap-independent, and translation initiation should be unaffected by the presence of extracts from poliovirus-infected cells. We inserted the 1.2-kb fragment of the 5′-UTR of mKv1.4 into the intercistronic spacer of a bicistronic construct similar to the one used in the transfection experiments, but with transcription directed by the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The stem-loop sequence described above was inserted downstream of the CAT stop codon to reduce leaky translation termination and ribosomal read-through. Bicistronic mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the m7GpppG 5′ cap analog. RNAs were then added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 40% ribosomal salt wash from either poliovirus-infected or uninfected HeLa cells. In the presence of extracts from uninfected HeLa cells, the control vector RNA lacking the 1.2-kb mKv1.4 sequence showed detectable CAT activity but little or no LUC activity, leading to a low LUC/CAT ratio (Fig. 3 A). Insertion of the 1.2-kb mKv1.4 5′-UTR resulted in a significant increase in the LUC/CAT ratio, suggesting that the mKv1.4 5′-UTR was able to efficiently direct translation of the downstream cistron via an internal ribosome entry mechanism. Insertion of the mKv1.4 5′-UTR into the intercistronic spacer in the antisense orientation displayed considerably reduced levels of IRES-like activity (Fig. 3 A) compared with those detected in the sense orientation. When extracts from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells were added to thein vitro translation reactions, dramatic effects were seen on the translation of the upstream cistron. Because CAT activity was reduced to nearly background levels in the presence of extracts from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells, the ratio of LUC/CAT is not meaningful in evaluating IRES activity. Thus, the data shown in Fig. 3 Bwere expressed as CAT or LUC activity in extracts from infected cells relative to the maximum values obtained when translations were carried out in the presence of extracts from uninfected cells (1.9 × 103 units for CAT, and 1.8 × 106 for LUC). The data reveal a dramatic suppression of cap-dependent translation (CAT activity) compared with cap-independent translation (LUC activity) when translations were carried out in the presence of extracts from poliovirus-infected cells. Although ∼20% of maximum LUC expression is retained, CAT activity is reduced to ∼0.3% of its maximum. Fig. 3 B also shows that this remaining LUC activity is dependent on the presence of themKv1.4 5′-UTR and that the LUC signal with the insert in the antisense direction is very low. These data show that the IRES activity in the mKv1.4 5′-UTR is 5′ cap-independent. Translation initiation by internal ribosome entry was first demonstrated for picornaviruses (23Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 25Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has since been shown for other RNA viruses (26Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liu D.X. Inglis S.C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6143-6154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although the precise mechanism for internal ribosome loading is not yet understood, at least one picornavirus IRES has been shown to initiate translation in a completely 5′ end-independent manner (28Chen C.Y. Sarnow P. Science. 1995; 268: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, only a few cellular genes are known to be translated in this manner, includingAntennapedia in Drosophila (29OH S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and Bip (30Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor 2 (31Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and c-myc (32Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Huez G. Prats A.C. J. Biol.

Thus, mKv1.4 represents one of a limited number of mammalian genes known to contain a functional IRES. The 200-nt stretch in mKv1.4 containing IRES activity shares two important characteristics with known IRES elements from RNA viruses, namely a polypyrimidine tract (Fig. 1 A) and extensive computer-predicted RNA secondary structures (Fig. 1 B) that might be targeted by trans-acting cellular factors necessary for the formation of the 40 S pre-initiation complex. Indeed,trans-acting cellular factors corresponding to known cellular RNA binding proteins have been shown to have functional interactions with IRES elements of picornavirus and hepatitis C virus (33Hellen C.U.

Known IRES elements have also been reported to have complex secondary structures (41Le S.Y. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and stem-loop elements within these regions are thought to contain motifs necessary for IRES activity (42Lopez de Quinto S. Martinez-Salas E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rijnbrand R. van der Straaten T. van Rijn P.A. Spaan W.J. Bredenbeek P.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 451-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computer-predicted models of the 200-nt mKv1.4 IRES-containing region predict a similarly complex structure with multiple hairpin loops (Fig.1 B). Because the 5′-UTR of mKv1.4 is significantly longer (∼1.2 kb) than that of the average mammalian gene, and contains multiple (eighteen) abortive upstream AUGs, the IRES present in the 200-nt stretch might bind cellular factors that ultimately enable the ribosome to efficiently translate the channel protein from the authentic translation initiation site. In support of this possibility, we have obtained preliminary data from electrophoretic mobility shift experiments showing specific binding of cellular proteins to the mKv1.4 IRES. 2L. E.-C. Leong, D. Negulescu, G. A. Gutman, and B. L. Semler, unpublished data. Our demonstration of IRES activity in the 5′-UTR of mKv1.4 may account for its normal translation despite the presence of several unusual features (length, abortive AUGs, and stable secondary structure) that are known to inhibit 5′ cap-dependent ribosome scanning. We have also previously shown (4Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15629-15634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that AUUUA motifs present in the long 3′-UTR of Kv1.4 can significantly inhibit translation, presumably by affecting translation initiation, and that alternate use of polyadenylation sites plays a role in regulating this process. The UTRs of many other mammalian Kv channel transcripts also show strikingly different structures from the typical vertebrate pattern. Inspection of Fig. 4 shows that there isno Kv transcript known to have either of its UTRs as short as the typical mean values, and most are considerably longer. It should be noted that lengths of these UTRs represent only lower limits, because the ends of many of these transcripts have not yet been mapped (including, for example, both of the long UTRs of Kv1.1), and many longer transcripts have yet to be characterized at all (e.g.>9-kb transcripts of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3). Fig. 4 also illustrates the presence of multiple upstream AUGs in the 5′-UTRs and of AUUUA motifs in the 3′-UTRs of many Kv transcripts. The UTRs of Kv genes are not only strikingly unusual with respect to their lengths and their containing these unusual motifs, but as has been pointed out by us and others (see Ref. 2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar), their sequences are considerably more highly conserved than in most other mammalian genes, lending further support to the notion that they have been conserved over evolutionary time for some important function(s). Thus, translational control by internal ribosome entry may be important not only for Kv1.4 but may represent a mechanism more generally utilized for regulation of gene expression by the extended family of Kv genes. In fact, despite the more limited data available for the UTRs of other families of potassium selective channels, it is not difficult to find examples of transcripts whose UTRs share the unusual features we have described in Kv1.4. The mouse calcium-activated K+channel slowpoke (44Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), for example, has at least three abortive AUGs in its >820-nt 5′-UTR and three AUUUA motifs in its >627-nt 3′-UTR. Likewise, the recently described transcript of the human inward rectifier hGIRK1 (45Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has no fewer than 12 AUGs in its >1360-nt 5′-UTR and five AUUUA motifs in its 314-nt 3′-UTR. Translation initiation through the use of internal ribosome entry and its regulation by 3′ elements may therefore be a significant factor in the regulation of expression not only of Kv1.4 and its voltage-gated cousins but also of other members of the extended family of K+-selective ion channels.

Energy-minimized structures of the CRP were calculated by minimization of the x-ray crystallographic structure of CRP in either the exclusively “closed” form where the α-helices of the carboxyl-terminal domain are folded close to the amino-terminal domain and in the exclusively “open” form where the α-helices of the carboxyl-terminal domain are folded away from the amino-terminal domain. Neutron scattering models show that the CRP SANS data follow closely the data curve predicted for unligated CRP in the open form, whereas the cAMP-ligated data are more in agreement with the data predicted for the minimized cAMP-ligated CRP structure in the closed form. Thus, it appears that CRP undergoes a conformational change from the open form to the closed form in solution upon ligation with cAMP. The SANS data from the CRP* and cAMP-ligated CRP* are coincidental, which implies that there is very little structural difference between the two species of CRP*. This is in agreement within vivo results, which show that whereas CRP activates transcription in the cell only in the presence of cAMP, CRP* activates transcription in the absence of cAMP, implying that CRP* is already in the correct conformation for the activation of transcription.

The nature of this conformational change is not known, because only the structures of the cAMP-ligated CRP complex and of the DNA-cAMP-ligated CRP complex have been determined from x-ray crystallography studies (7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 8McKay D.B. Steitz T.A.

CRP exists as a homodimer of 45,000 g mol−1 consisting of a β-pleated sheet amino-terminal domain, which contains the cAMP binding site and a carboxyl-terminal domain consisting of several α-helices that bind to specific DNA sequences. In the crystal phase, the cAMP-ligated CRP dimer is asymmetric where one monomer is in an “open” form in which the α-helices are swung out away from the amino-terminal domain and the other monomer is in a “closed” form in which the α-helices are swung in close to the amino-terminal domain (7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence connecting the two domains is, thus, called the “hinge” region. The x-ray crystal structure of the cAMP-ligated CRP dimer complexed with a 30-base pair DNA sequence is exclusively in the closed form (8McKay D.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1981; 290: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recent energy minimization computations of the two forms in solution show that the lowest energy conformation of the cAMP-ligated CRP dimer is exclusively the closed form in solution (9Garcia A.E. Harman J.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The implication is that the asymmetry of the CRP dimer in the crystal lattice is due to crystal packing forces and that the structural change responsible for the activation of transcription is a change from the open to the closed form in solution. This is substantiated by NMR measurements on fluorinated derivatives of CRP, which imply that the conformational change involves the hinge region (1Hinds M.G. King R.W. Feeney J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and proton NMR measurements, which show that CRP in solution tightens up and becomes more rigid upon binding of cAMP (2Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4040-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is, however, evidence that the conformational change may not simply involve a transition from the open to the closed form of CRP upon binding to cAMP in solution. A comparison of the secondary structure of free CRP and cAMP-ligated CRP by Raman spectroscopy (3DeGrazia H. Harman J.G. Tan G. Wartell R.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3557-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) shows a structural shift from 44% α-helix, 28% β-strand, 18% turn, and 10% undefined in the free form to 37% α-helix, 33% β-strand, 17% turn, and 12% undefined in the ligated form, implying that the conformational change does not conserve the α-helical and β-strand structure as it would in a shift of the CRP dimer from the exclusively open to the closed form in solution. A conformational change involving alterations in the α-helical and β-strand structure of CRP is also implied by an empirical model of CRP secondary structure based on its sequence. This sequence-based empirical model predicts α-helices in unligated CRP in place of the β-strands in the amino-terminal domain of the x-ray crystallographic structure of the cAMP-ligated CRP complex (10Kypr J. Mrazek J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition to the contradictory evidence concerning the nature of the conformational change in CRP, there is also experimental evidence that a cAMP-induced conformational change is not always necessary for the activation of transcription. For example, in vivotranscription was observed to be activated even in the absence of cAMP by a mutant of CRP where two amino acid residues have been replaced in the amino-terminal domain of CRP, T127L and S128A (CRP*) (11Moore J.L. The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis. The George Washington University, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar). This implies that CRP* is already in the transcriptionally activated conformation and that cAMP binding is unlikely to initiate a conformational change. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements have been employed to determine the conformation and size of proteins in solution (12Timmins P.A. Zacci G. Eur. Biophys. J. 1988; 15: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using D2O as the solvent to maximize the difference in neutron scattering between the solvent and the protein, the conformation of the protein can be determined from the dependence of the scattered neutron intensity on the scattering angle and the size of the protein in terms of the radius of gyration (Rg) can be determined from the scattered neutron intensity near zero scattering angle (13Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar). In addition, the SANS data can be compared with scattered neutron intensity curves generated from the energy-minimized crystallographic x-ray structure of the protein to determine in more detail the conformation of the protein in solution. In this investigation, SANS measurements were performed on solutions of CRP in the absence and presence of cAMP and compared with model scattered intensity curves calculated from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of CRP dimer in exclusively the closed and in exclusively the open forms. For comparison, SANS measurements were also performed on solutions of CRP* in the absence and presence of cAMP. The characterization and mutagenesis of the wild type and mutant of CRP have been described previously by Moore (11Moore J.L. The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis. The George Washington University, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar). A New Brunswick Fermentor Scientific, Inc. SF116 was also used in place of the 5-liter shaker flasks for preparations of CRP and CRP*. An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast SDS-electrophoresis gel with 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mass % bromphenol blue and 20 volume % glycerol was run to determine the purity of the protein preparations. A protein analysis was also performed by comparing the absorbance at 562 nm of samples of the solution to those of bovine serum albumin solutions after adding 4 mass % CuSO4 and bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce. The protein solutions were dialyzed at 4 °C in 50 mmpotassium phosphate-potassium hydroxide buffer (pH = 7.0) containing 0.2 mm sodium EDTA, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm KCl, and 5 volume % glycerol (phosphate buffer) in D2O with two changes in the buffer solution. The concentrations of the CRP and the mutant were determined by UV absorption spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 3.5 × 104 cm liter mol−1 at 280 nm (14Ghosaini L.R. Brown A.M. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5257-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ligand solutions were made up by dissolving known masses of the sodium salt of the cyclic nucleotide in the D2O buffer. The sodium salt of cAMP, potassium phosphate, NaOH, EDTA, dithiothreitol, glycerol, Tris, HCl, bromphenol blue, and KCl were reagent grade from Sigma. The SANS measurements were performed on the NG3 30 m SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, MD (15Hammouda B. Krueger S. Glinka C.J. J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. 1993; 98: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Unligated CRP solutions were measured at 0.036 and 0.096 mm and unligated CRP* at 0.049 and 0.138 mm in the D2O solvent. CRP was also measured at both concentrations in the presence of 0.270 and 17.1 mm cAMP, whereas CRP* solutions at both concentrations were measured in the presence of 17.1 mm cAMP. To limit aggregation effects, the lower concentration solutions were used to obtain the data at the lower scattering angles where information about the overall size of the protein is obtained, whereas the higher concentration solutions were used to obtain the higher angle data, which provide information about the shape of the protein. In the higher angle scattering region, aggregation effects are much smaller than in the lower angle region, but the scattered intensity is also much lower, so a higher concentration of CRP and CRP* in solution is needed in the higher angle region. Data were taken at a wavelength λ = 5 Å, with a spread Δλ/λ = 0.34 for the CRP samples and Δλ/λ = 0.15 for the CRP* samples. A sample-to-detector distance of 5.5 m and a source-to-sample distance of 7.02 m were used for the 0.036 and 0.049 mm samples to obtain the lower angle data. The 0.096 and 0.138 mm samples were measured at a sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m and a source-to-sample distance of 3.92 m to obtain the higher angle data. The source and sample apertures were 5.0 and 1.27 cm, respectively. Neutrons were detected on a 64.0 × 64.0-cm two-dimensional position-sensitive detector with 1.0-cm resolution. The center of the detector was offset by 20.0 cm at both sample-to-detector distance positions to provide a large overlap between the two configurations and to measure to a large enough scattering angle to allow an accurate determination of the incoherent background scattering due to hydrogen in the sample. The scattered intensity, I, was corrected for solvent absorbance and scattering on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the relation, Icor=Isample−Tsample/TsolventIsolventEquation 1 where Tsample andTsolvent are the measured transmissions of neutrons through the sample and solvent, respectively. The corrected data were placed on an absolute scale by calibration against the scattering from a silica gel standard sample and then radially averaged to obtain I(Q) as a function of Q, where Q = 4πsinθ/λ, and 2θ is the scattering angle. The radially averaged data exhibit a distinct flat region beyondQ = 0.35 Å−1 due to the incoherent scattering from hydrogen in the samples. This background scattering was subtracted from the data taken at both instrument configurations, normalizing for the difference in the protein concentrations. The background-subtracted data for both configurations were simultaneously corrected (desmeared) for instrument resolution effects, and Fourier transformed to obtain the distance distribution function,P(r), using two different methods: the Svergun method (16Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar), as implemented in the program GNOM (17Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar), and the Glatter method (18Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1977; 10: 415-421Crossref Google Scholar), as implemented in the program GLATTER, with resolution effects incorporated by Skov Pederson et al. (19Skov Pederson J. Posselt D. Mortensen K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 321-333Crossref Google Scholar). Both methods assume the scattering results from a dilute, monodispersed solution of globular particles. In addition, it is assumed that the particles have a sharp boundary such that there is a maximum diameter,Dmax, beyond which there is no significant scattering mass. The desmeared scattered intensity,I(Q), is related to P(r) by the equation, I(Q)=4πV0∫0DmaxP(r)sin(Qr)/Qr drEquation 2 where the two conditions, P(0) = 0 andP(2r ≥ Dmax) = 0, are satisfied. 4πP(r) is defined as the number of distances, r, between scattering centers within the particle. The I(Q) versus Qdata taken at both instrument configurations are combined in the desmearing process, and I(Q) versus Q data were obtained over a usable range 0.012 ≤Q ≤ 0.3 Å−1. The results from the two desmearing methods were averaged to produce the final desmearedI(Q) versus Q data andP(r) versus r data. In the small angle limit, the scattered intensity can be approximated by the Guinier equation (13Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar), I(Q)=I(0)exp−Q2Rg2/3Equation 3 where I(0) is the scattered intensity atQ = 0. The radius of gyration of the particle,Rg, is defined as the mean square distance from the center of scattering mass. A plot of ln(I)versus Q 2 should contain a linear region with slope Rg2/3 and intercept ln(I(0)). Thus, Rg can be obtained directly from the SANS measurements. The range of validity for the Guinier approximation depends upon the shape of the particle. However, Guinier fits are generally made in a Q range centered about the relation, QRg ∼ 1.0. Details of the data desmearing procedure are illustrated in Fig.1, which shows the smearedI(Q) versus Q data for the unligated CRP sample measured in D2O solvent. Thedotted line is the best fit to the data using the Glatter (18Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1977; 10: 415-421Crossref Google Scholar, 19Skov Pederson J. Posselt D. Mortensen K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 321-333Crossref Google Scholar) method, in which the data are represented by a series of B-splines. The data were fitted several times using different estimates for Dmax. The fit that resulted in the smoothestP(r) function for which theDmax value was clearly not too large, and for which the calculated I(Q) still fitted well to the experimental data, was chosen as the best solution. Dmax values of 65 ± 5 Å in Equation 2proved to fit the smeared data best in all cases. The “x” points show the desmeared data resulting from the dotted line fit. Errors on the desmeared data were determined by averaging the best-fit results from both the Svergun (16Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and Glatter (18Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1977; 10: 415-421Crossref Google Scholar, 19Skov Pederson J. Posselt D. Mortensen K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 321-333Crossref Google Scholar) methods. The I(Q) versus Q data obtained from SANS measurements can be compared with that calculated from the energy-minimized x-ray crystallographic structure using a Monte Carlo technique (20Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1987; 27: 909-915Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Since hydrogen atoms are not included in the x-ray structure, each amino acid is better represented by a homogeneous sphere positioned according to its α-carbon coordinates. The size and neutron scattering strength of each sphere are calculated from the known volume and chemical composition of the amino acid, respectively, thus taking into account the contribution of hydrogen. Once a sphere has been drawn around each amino acid, a box is drawn around the entire molecule, with the option to include a region of bound water up to 5 Å thick. The bulk solvent can be any H2O/D2O mixture, and the protein can be hydrogenated or deuterated. Points are then generated at random within the box. The distance distribution function,P(r), for the total volume is calculated directly in real space by making a histogram representing the distances between all possible pairs of points, weighted according to the product of the neutron scattering strengths at each point. Rgis calculated directly from the second moment ofP(r) and I(Q) is found using Equation 2. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the cAMP-ligated CRP dimer shows that it can exist in an open and closed form in the crystal phase. The CRP dimers were generated from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank file 3GAP.pdb exclusively in either the closed or open form by superimposing a copy of the monomer in the closed from on the monomer in the open form and vice versa (20Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1987; 27: 909-915Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The energetics of the structures were then minimized using the steepest descent method for 1000 iterations, after which the conjugate gradient method was used until convergence was achieved (maximum derivative less than 0.04 kJ mol−1). Computational results were obtained using software programs from Biosym/MSI of San Diego. Energy minimizations, using the AMBER forcefield, were done with the Discover program, and structure analysis and comparison were performed with the DeCipher program. Energy-minimized structures for the unliganded CRP were generated in the same manner, using the cAMP-ligated x-ray structure, with the cAMP removed, as the starting structure. The desmeared I(Q) versus Q data for the CRP and the cAMP-ligated CRP solutions are plotted in Fig. 2. It should be emphasized that at the levels of 0.036 mm CRP and 0.270 mm cAMP concentrations, the CRP is only about 90% ligated, so that the scattering would contain some contribution from unligated CRP. At higher cAMP concentrations of approximately 17.1 mm, where the CRP would be fully ligated (21Moore J.L. Gorshkova I.I. Brown J.W. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21273-21278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), aggregation was observed in the CRP solutions as indicated by a sharp upward inflection of the neutron scattering intensity near Q = 0 and, thus, these data were not analyzed. The scattering curve for CRP in the presence of cAMP deviates significantly as shown in Fig. 2 from that of the unligated CRP above Q = 0.15 Å−1. This deviation results from a conformational change in CRP upon ligation with cAMP and is in contrast to the coincidence of the desmeared SANS data from solutions of CRP* in the absence and presence of 17.1 mm cAMP shown in Fig.3. (Aggregation at this cAMP concentration was not observed for the CRP* solutions.) The nearly coincidental curves in Fig. 3 show that CRP*, contrary to CRP, undergoes very little conformational change in the presence of cAMP, as implied by the in vivo activation of transcription by CRP* in the absence of cAMP.Figure 3Desmeared SANS intensity versus Q from 0.049 and 0.138 mm unligated CRP* (•) and CRP* + 17.1 mm cAMP (■) in D2O solvent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The radii of gyration calculated from the second moment of the distance distribution function, P(r), using all of the desmeared data in Figs. 2 and 3 are presented in TableI. For comparison, Table I also lists the radii of gyration obtained by averaging the results from several Guinier fits over the Q range limited to 0.02 ≤Q ≤ 0.08 Å−1 for unligated and ligated CRP and CRP*. The radii of gyration calculated by the two methods are essentially the same for the unligated and cAMP-ligated CRP* solutions (approximately 22.3 ± 0.3 Å), indicating again virtually no difference between the size of CRP* and cAMP-ligated CRP*. This is in contrast with the results from the CRP solutions, using the two methods, which exhibit a consistent shrinkage of about 1.0 Å upon cAMP ligation. The slightly larger Rg values determined for CRP from the Guinier fits compared with those determine from the 2nd moment of P(r) may be due to the effect of some aggregation in the sample on the Guinier-derivedRg. The Rg values calculated from P(r) are not significantly affected by small deviations in the scattering curve due to aggregation effects at small Q, where the Guinier-derivedRg values were determined.Table IComparison of the Radii of Gyration (Rg) for CRP and CRPSampleRg from Guinier fitRg from 2nd moment of P(r)ExperimentalCalculated open formaCalculated from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of CRP.Calculated closed formaCalculated from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of CRP.ÅÅUnligated CRP23.0 ± 0.322.0 ± 0.220.5 ± 0.418.7 ± 0.3cAMP-ligated CRP22.1 ± 0.321.6 ± 0.219.2 ± 0.319.2 ± 0.3Unligated CRP*22.6 ± 0.322.2 ± 0.2cAMP-ligated CRP*22.9 ± 0.322.3 ± 0.2a Calculated from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of CRP. Open table in a new tab The desmeared data in Fig. 2 are compared in Fig.4 to model scattering curves calculated from their corresponding energy-minimized x-ray structures, using 2000 randomly placed points in the volume occupied by the molecule. Three iterations were performed for each of four structures, i.e.unligated CRP dimer in the exclusively open and closed forms, and cAMP-ligated CRP dimer in the exclusively open and closed forms. The final model curves represent the average of the three iterations. The unligated CRP scattered intensity, along with the model intensities calculated from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of CRP with cAMP removed, are plotted in Fig. 4 A as a function of the dimensionless parameter, Q·Rg(QRg). Plotting the curves in this manner maximizes the differences in structure due to changes in overall shape, while minimizing changes in Rg. In Fig.4 A, the experimental desmeared SANS data fit very closely the model curve for unligated CRP exclusively in the open form. The close agreement between the desmeared SANS data and the model curve of CRP in the open form indicates that the open form of CRP is the preferred conformation of unligated CRP in solution. This is further substantiated by the radii of gyration obtained from the second moment of P(r) for the energy-minimized x-ray structures listed in Table I. The Rg value from the desmeared unligated CRP data is 22.0 ± 0.2 Å, which compares more favorably with 20.5 ± 0.4 Å for the minimized, exclusively open form of CRP than with 18.7 ± 0.3 Å for the minimized, exclusively closed form of CRP. The desmeared scattered intensity for cAMP-ligated CRP is plotted in Fig. 4 B as a function of QRg, along with the model intensities obtained from the energy-minimized x-ray structures of cAMP-ligated CRP. The model curves for the minimized exclusively closed and open forms of the cAMP-ligated CRP are less separated than the corresponding model curves for unligated CRP in Fig.4 A and have Rg values of approximately 19.2 ± 0.3 Å in each case, compared withRg = 21.6 ± 0.2 Å for the desmeared data in Table I. However, the desmeared data appear to follow more closely the model curve calculated from the minimized structure of cAMP-ligated CRP dimer exclusively in the closed form. The SANS results show that the conformational change that occurs in CRP upon ligation with cAMP can well be described as a change from the open to the more compact closed form of CRP. This is further evident in the distance distribution functions, P(r), plotted for unligated and cAMP-ligated CRP in Fig.5 A. In the presence of cAMP, the peak shifts slightly toward smaller r values, indicating that cAMP-ligated CRP is more compact than nonligated CRP. Fig.5 B shows the P(r) functions obtained from the energy-minimized x-ray structures that fit most closely to the data. The distributions look remarkably similar to those in Fig.5 A, with the peak in the distribution for the cAMP-ligated CRP in the closed form occurring at a lower value than that for the nonligated CRP in the open form. The SANS results show that ligation of CRP by cAMP apparently induces a conformational change in CRP from the exclusively open form in solution to the more contracted closed form, whereas CRP* remains essentially unchanged in the presence of cAMP in solution. It should be emphasized that the energy-minimized open form of unligated CRP is based on energy minimization of the x-ray crystal structure of cAMP-ligated CRP, exclusively in the open form, with cAMP removed, because the x-ray crystal structure of unligated CRP is unavailable. The good agreement between this conformation of unligated CRP and the experimental SANS curve does imply that this energy-minimized open form may indeed be the stable conformation of unligated CRP in solution. These results agree with NMR measurements, which show a tightening up of CRP into a more rigid protein upon cAMP binding (2Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4040-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the change of approximately 1 Å in the radius of gyration also agrees with the 0.7 ± 0.1 Å shrinkage observed in the Stokes radius of CRP upon ligation with cAMP (22Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3200-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the change in CRP is in agreement with earlier small angle x-ray scattering measurements, which also indicate a contraction in the shape of CRP upon binding of cAMP, the x-ray measurements exhibited a larger change inRg from 29 Å for unligated CRP to 25 Å for the cAMP-ligated CRP complex (5Kumar S.A. Murthy N.S. Krakow J.S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 109: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Calculations on the energy-minimized unligated and ligated CRP structures show thatRg would contract only from 20.5 Å for the open form of CRP to 19.2 Å for the closed form of the complex. The x-ray scattering results show not only a large change inRg, but also an absoluteRg value 6–9 Å larger than could be calculated from the x-ray crystallographic structures. The presence of aggregates in the small angle x-ray scattering samples could easily account for the higher Rg values and larger relative change in Rg in the presence of cAMP. The change to the closed form for the cAMP-ligated CRP complexes in solution also agrees with molecular dynamics simulations on the cAMP-ligated CRP complex, which predict that the closed form is the more energetically stable form of this complex in solution (9Garcia A.E. Harman J.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, the x-ray crystallographic structure of the cAMP-ligated CRP complexed with DNA shows that the cAMP-ligated CRP exists exclusively in the closed form for this ternary complex (8McKay D.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1981; 290: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Lack of growth for CRP crystals in the absence of cAMP may arise from the CRP in solution being exclusively in the open form. The energy-minimized structures for unligated CRP in the open form and cAMP-ligated CRP in the closed form are shown in Fig.6, which illustrates the small, but significant, structural differences between the two forms. A model proposed by Garges and Adhya (23Garges S. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the conformational change of CRP upon cAMP binding involves four structural changes in CRP: 1) a change in the orientation of the D α-helix (Fig. 6), 2) an interaction between the cAMP and DNA binding domains, 3) re-alignment of the CRP monomers, and 4) more importantly, the “pushing away” of the DNA-binding F α-helices (Fig. 6) from the protein. These changes also allow the two F α-helices to bind into two adjacent grooves of DNA. The changes described by the model with respect to the interaction between the cAMP and DNA binding domains and a change in the distance between the DNA-binding F α-helices are also shown in Fig. 6 in the transition from the unligated open form of CRP (Fig. 6 A) to the ligated closed form of CRP (Fig. 6 B). The distance between the F α-helices in the closed form is more conducive to DNA binding as evident by the cAMP-CRP-DNA crystal structure, which is exclusively in the closed form. Thus, the changes described in this model support the SANS results, which show a conformational change from unligated CRP in exclusively the open form to the closed form upon cAMP ligation in solution. The lack of significant changes in the CRP* scattering curves upon complexation with cAMP implies that CRP* undergoes little, or possibly no, structural change in the presence of cAMP. This is in agreement with the observation that transcription is activated in the absence of cAMP in cells which contain CRP* (11Moore J.L. The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis. The George Washington University, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar), implying that unligated CRP* is already in the correct conformation for binding of the DNA. To substantiate that this conformation is the closed form, fits of the energy-minimized structure of CRP* to the SANS data must await the determination of a good starting structure for CRP* from x-ray crystallography."

E1A expression caused accumulation of wild type p53 more than 10-fold within 24 h after dexamethasone treatment. The cell lines that express E1A mutants containing a deletion either in the amino terminus or the conserved region 1 were unable to accumulate p53. p53 accumulated was degraded efficiently in vitro in the S10–0 extract (S10–0) prepared from MA1 cells in an ATP and ubiquitin-dependent manner, but not in S10–24 prepared after treatment with dexamethasone for 24 h. The p53 polyubiquitination activity in S100–0 was calcium-dependent and reduced greatly in S100–24. Ubiquitin affinity chromatography revealed that p53 ubiquitination activity in eluates thought to contain ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes decreased greatly in S100–24 as compared with S100–0. The accumulation of p53 was accompanied by the increase in the level of Mdm2, which has been shown to degrade p53 through binding to it. The high p53 level, however, was maintained until the late stage of the apoptotic process. These results indicate that the stabilization of p53 by E1A occurs through modification of a ubiquitin-specific enzyme(s) in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

The p53 protein, one of the tumor suppressors is primarily involved with the maintenance of genomic integrity. The level of wild type p53 in cells is maintained at a low level due to a short protein half-life but is increased steeply by stabilization in response to external stress signals, e.g. ionizing radiation (1Kastan M.B.

In the case of the adenovirus E1A gene, the products E1A interact with multiple cellular factors and perturb the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and in some cases they induce apoptosis in a wild type p53-dependent manner (19Debbas M.

Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region is also required for stabilization of p53 (20Lowe S.W.

Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3526-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism of this stabilization has not yet been clarified. The turnover of p53 has been shown to be regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system (28Ciechanover A. DiGiuseppe J.A. Bercovich B. Orian A. Richter J.D. Schwartz A.L. Brodeur G.M. Proc.

E2s transfer ubiquitin to specific substrates and form the polyubiquitin chain at a particular Lys residue in collaboration with members of the ubiquitin ligase family, E3s. The polyubiquitin chain targets the substrate for degradation by the proteasome (30Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 31Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 accumulates markedly in a temperature-sensitive mutant of mouse BALB/3T3 cells at the restrictive temperature owing to a defect in E1 (32Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 is also shown by the action of human papillomavirus E6 protein. E6 protein associates with cellular E6-AP protein, a ubiquitin ligase (33Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M.

Hall P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) binds to p53 and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (36Haupt Y.

Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). In reverse, the level of Mdm2 is regulated by p53, and the transcription of themdm2 gene is stimulated by p53 (38Barak Y.

Calpain activity is regulated by autoproteolysis and the inhibitor protein calpastatin (44Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Zalewska T.

In the present study, the mechanism of wild type p53 stabilization in a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB was studied with its derivative cell line MA1, in which the expression of E1A can be regulated by dexamethasone (45Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the amino terminus and CR1 of E1A was studied by establishing the cell lines that express the mutant E1A containing a deletion in either of these regions in response to dexamethasone but fail to induce apoptosis. The results indicate that stabilization of p53 occurred exclusively by modification of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by E1A. The p53 polyubiquitination activity was much reduced in MA1 cells after E1A expression. Stabilization of p53 was accompanied by the elevation of Mdm2; however, the high level of p53 was maintained thereafter, indicating that the accumulated p53 is insensitive to the action of Mdm2 accumulated. Bovine erythrocyte ubiquitin, yeast apyrase, creatine phosphokinase, and creatine phosphate were purchased from Sigma.

After automatic synthesis, protecting groups were removed and peptides were released from supporting resins by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (Kanto Chemicals, Japan) in the presence of reducing agents. Biotinylated ubiquitin was prepared from bovine erythrocyte ubiquitin by reacting with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) as described (47Nakajima T. Kimura M. Kuroda K. Tanaka M. Kikuchi A. Seino H.

The ECL detection system was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. MA1 cells were established from human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB by introducing the adenovirus E1A 12 S cDNA linked to the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat. MA1 cells express E1A protein (E1A12 S) in response to dexamethasone and elicit apoptosis (45Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). B12 and T5 cells were similarly established from KB cells by introducing mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-linked E1A 12 S cDNA containing a deletion either from codon 17 to 23 or 54 to 69, respectively (Fig. 1 A). These cell lines were cultivated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For the viability assay, both floating and adherent cells were pooled and assessed by trypan blue exclusion (45Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). For construction of E1A12SΔ17–23 cDNA containing a deletion from codon 17 to 23, pBRE1A12S was cleaved at thePvuII site between codons 22 and 23. The DNA was shortened by successive digestion with ExoIII and mung bean nuclease and circularized by blunt end ligation. The extent of deletion and the joining of two ends in phase was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid DNA was then cleaved with HindIII andBglII, and the fragment containing the E1A12SΔ17–23 cDNA was inserted between theHindIII–BglII site of pMTV-dhfr (48Lee F. Mulligan R. Berg P. Ringold G. Nature. 1981; 294: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), displacing the dihydrofolate reductase cDNA to generate pMTVE1A12SΔ17–23. E1A12SΔ54–69 cDNA was constructed by using site-specific mutagenesis according to Kunkelet al. (49Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). M13E1A12S was constructed by insertion of the E1A 12 S cDNA at the KpnI–PstI site of M13mp18. The sense strand of M13E1A12S was annealed with the 31-base oligonucleotide lacking codons 54–69, and the antisense strand was synthesized with T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA ligase. The double-stranded DNA was then transfected to E. coli ung + cells (BMH71–18 mutS), and the recombinant plasmid, M13E1A12SΔ54–69, was isolated. The DNA was cleaved with HindIII and BglII, and the fragment containing the E1A12 S cDNA Δ54–69 was similarly inserted into pMTV-dhfr to generate pMTVE1A12SΔ54–69. Subconfluent cultures of MA1 cells, treated or untreated with 1 μm dexamethasone, were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 mNaCl, 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4), once in 10 volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), and then resuspended in 10 volumes of hypotonic buffer. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the swollen cells were collected in a 7.5-ml Dounce vessel and precipitated by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove excess buffer. The cells were then disrupted by homogenization with a tight pestle 40 times on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the turbid supernatant (S10 extract) was collected. Aliquots of the S10 extracts were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 6 h to prepare the S100 extracts, which lack most of the proteasome activity. 25–50 μg of protein in SDS-solubilized whole cell lysate (45Nakajima T.

Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated in TBS-T (25 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% thimerosal at room temperature for 1 h to minimize nonspecific binding of antibody. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody at an appropriate dilution as indicated in the figure legends at room temperature for 1 h and washed three times in TBS-T for 15 min. The membrane was then incubated with secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 at room temperature for 1 h and washed three times in TBS-T for 15 min. Immune complexes were detected by ECL by treating the membrane with the ECL detection system. Protein concentration was determined by a dye-binding assay (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). MA1 cells (approximately 2 × 108 cells) treated with dexamethasone for 24 h were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 10 ml of RIPA buffer (2 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride·HCl). The lysate was centrifuged at 1,700 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. p53 was immunoprecipitated from supernatant with 10 μl of pAb421 and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose FF beads overnight. The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with 10 ml of RIPA buffer, resuspended in RIPA buffer to give a 10% suspension, and stored at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with hypotonic buffer and resuspended in the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.5% just before the degradation assay. Ubiquitin-Sepharose beads (∼25 mg of ubiquitin/ml of swollen gel) were prepared as described by Ciechanover et al. (52Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4 ml of swollen ubiquitin-Sepharose beads were stuffed in a 16/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with 15 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT) containing 2 mm ATP. 15 mg of protein of S100–0 and S100–24 were incubated after the addition of 10 mm DTT on ice for 30 min to dissociate ubiquitin conjugates of E1 and E2s, and endogenous ubiquitin was removed by ultrafiltration with Macrosep-10k after 1:40 dilution with buffer A. The samples were concentrated to a final volume of 2 ml. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of buffer A containing 4 mm ATP, 20 mmphosphocreatine, and 10 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase and applied to the ubiquitin-Sepharose columns after the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. After unadsorbed fractions were collected, the columns were washed with 24 ml of buffer A containing 2 mm ATP, and adsorbed components were eluted with 12 ml of 1 m KCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (KCl fraction), 12 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 12 ml of 2 mm AMP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 40 μm sodium pyrophosphate (AMP fraction), 12 ml of 10 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (DTT fraction) and 12 ml of 2 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (pH 9 fraction). Fractions of 4 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The AMP, DTT, and pH 9 fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Macrosep-10k (Pall Filtron). The salts in the eluates were removed by another ultrafiltration to a final volume of 0.4 ml with Microsep-1k (Pall Filtron) after 1:100 dilution with hypotonic buffer. Degradation of p53 was performed in either the S10 or the S100 extracts. The latter lacks most of the proteasome. Ubiquitination of p53 was carried out with the S100 extracts. For degradation assays in the S10 extract, the reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 unit/μl creatine phosphokinase, 0.2 μg/μl bovine erythrocyte ubiquitin, and 150 μg of protein in S10. The degradation in the S100 extract was performed in the reaction mixture (6–30 μl) containing 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 30–150 μg of protein in S100. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min or at 30 °C for 40–80 min and terminated by boiling the mixture for 5 min after the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (280 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm DTT, 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) (50Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Aliquots of the mixture were subjected to Western blotting using anti-p53 polyclonal antibody FL-393 and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to rabbit IgG. For ubiquitination assays, the reaction mixture contained 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.2 μg/μl biotinylated ubiquitin, 200 μg of protein in S100–24 as a source of p53 and 1 mg of protein in S100–0. S100–0 was prepared from MA1 cells, and S100–24 was prepared from MA1 cells treated with dexamethasone for 24 h. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated on ice for 5 min. After the addition of 4-fold volumes of RIPA buffer to the reaction mixture, both ubiquitinated and unprocessed p53 were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with 1 μl each of pAb421 and Bp53–12 and 2.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose FF beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and then boiled after the addition of 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Aliquots of 10 μl of the sample were subjected to Western blot analysis. Ubiquitinated p53 was detected by HRP-conjugated streptavidin, and unprocessed p53 was detected by anti-p53 polyclonal antibody FL-393 and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to rabbit IgG. The MA1 cell line, established from human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells by introducing the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-linked E1A 12 S cDNA, elicited apoptosis following the induction of E1A12 S in response to dexamethasone and began to lose viability after about 36 h (Fig.1 B). Western blot analysis showed that after induction of E1A expression, the level of p53 increased steeply and reached a maximal level of more than 10-fold higher than the original at 24 h (Fig. 1 C), while the level of p53 mRNA was unchanged (45Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, topoisomerase IIα began to be degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway reducing the level to 150 of the original as previously shown (45Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar, 47Nakajima T. Kimura M. Kuroda K. Tanaka M. Kikuchi A. Seino H. Yamao F. Oda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The E1A domain required for the induction of apoptosis has been mapped in the amino terminus and CR1 (23White E. Cipriani R. Sabbatini P. Denton A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2968-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mymryk J.S. Shire K. Bayley S.T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1187-1193PubMed Google Scholar). These regions are required for binding to p300 (Fig. 1 A) (25Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the function of this domain, the expression vectors, pMTV-E1AΔ17–23 and pMTV-E1AΔ54–69, that express E1A12S lacking the codons between 17 and 23 and between 54 and 69, respectively in response to dexamethasone (dex) (Fig. 1 A), were introduced into KB cells with pSV2neo (54Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar), and the cell lines B12 and T5 were established. Upon treatment with dexamethasone, both cells expressed mutant E1A (Fig. 1 C) but failed to induce apoptosis (Fig.1 B). Neither accumulation of p53 nor degradation of topoisomerase IIα was induced significantly (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the function of the amino terminus and the CR1 of E1A is required for stabilization of p53, and the increase in the p53 level correlates with the induction of topoisomerase IIα degradation. Although the mechanism of induction of p53 stabilization by E1A has not yet been clarified, it has been shown that p53 is degraded either by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or by calpain in a calcium-dependent manner. To determine the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and/or calpain in p53 degradation, the S10 extracts were prepared from MA1, B12, and T5 cells before and after treatment with dexamethasone, and p53 levels in these cell extracts were directly compared by Western blotting. p53 was scarcely detected in the extracts prepared from these cells before treatment with dexamethasone. Only the case of the MA1 0 h extract (S10–0) is shown in Fig. 2 A,lane 1. The p53 level in the MA1 24-h extract (S10–24), prepared after treatment with dexamethasone for 24 h, was almost 50-fold higher than the original level (lane 2), while those in B12 and T5 48-h extracts, prepared from B12 and T5 cells treated with dexamethasone for 48 h, were very low and similar to the original level (lanes 3and 4). The degradation reaction of p53 in vitro was performed by incubating an aliquot of S10–24 as a source of p53 in S10–0 at 30 °C for 80 min in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 0.4 μg/μl ubiquitin, and various protease inhibitors. After the reaction, the mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the amount of p53 undegraded was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, most of p53 was degraded (lane 2). The presence of Z-LLnV-OH, a proteasome inhibitor or apyrase that destroys ATP, suppressed p53 degradation almost completely (lanes 3 and 4), while the presence of calpastatin peptide, an inhibitor of calpain or EGTA that chelates with calcium protected p53 from degradation only slightly (lanes 5 and 6). To assay the calpain activity for degradation of p53 in the absence of the proteasome, the S100 extract (S100–0), which lacks most of the proteasome, was prepared from MA1 cells, and p53 was prepared by immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody pAb421 and protein A-Sepharose FF beads. The p53 conjugated beads were incubated in S100–0 at 30 °C for 80 min in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 but in the absence of ATP and ubiquitin. Degradation of p53 was analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-p53 polyclonal antibody FL393 after electrophoresis (Fig. 2 C). Under these conditions, a small but significant fraction of p53 was degraded (lane 2). Calpastatin peptide (lane 3) and EGTA (lane 5) protected p53 from degradation significantly, but the presence of apyrase (lane 4) and EDTA (lane 6) had no effect on the protection. These results suggested that the degradation of p53 in MA1 cells occurs primarily by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, although calpain is partly involved. The presence of a very small amount of p53 in B12 and T5 cells after treatment with dexamethasone suggested that the E1A mutants containing a deletion in eith"

S-modulin binds to the ROS membrane at high Ca2+concentration, and N-terminal myristoylation is necessary for this property (the calcium-myristoyl switch). S-modulin has four EF-hand motifs, of which two (EF-2 and -3) are functional. Here, we report on the roles of EF-2 and -3 in S-modulin function (calcium binding, membrane association, and inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation) by site-directed mutants (E85M and E121M). Surprisingly, E121M, which has a mutation in EF-3, neither binds Ca2+ nor inhibits phosphorylation. In contrast, E85M binds one Ca2+ and has the same membrane affinity as wild-type S-modulin, but has lost the ability to inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation. It is suggested that the binding of Ca2+to EF-3 is probably required for EF-2 to be a functional Ca2+-binding site and to induce exposure of the myristoyl group; and that the binding of Ca2+ to EF-2 is important for the interaction with rhodopsin kinase.

In vertebrate rod photoreceptors, cGMP-gated cation channels are opened in the dark-adapted state (1Stryer L. Annu. Rev.

Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Science. 1991; 251: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). At high Ca2+concentrations (dark-adapted state), S-modulin inhibits phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin, but does not interfere at low Ca2+ concentrations (light-adapted state). Therefore, S-modulin and recoverin contributes to increased light sensitivity in the dark-adapted state. S-modulin and recoverin are Ca2+-binding proteins which contain covalently attached fatty acyl groups at their N terminus (12Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to these proteins induces exposure of the fatty acyl groups, which enables them to associate with ROS membrane (13Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This property is the so-called “Ca2+-myristoyl switch” (13Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). There are four EF-hand motifs in S-modulin and recoverin, but only two of them (EF-2 and -3) are thought to be able to bind Ca2+ (15Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. Mckay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, S-modulin function (inhibition of frog rhodopsin phosphorylation) is mediated by the binding of Ca2+ ions to EF-2 and -3. We made site-directed mutants of S-modulin that lack Ca2+binding ability in their EF-2 or -3. The present study describes the Ca2+ binding properties, membrane-association, and inhibitory effects on rhodopsin phosphorylation of wild-type S-modulin and these mutants. The results suggest that EF-3 first binds Ca2+, which enables S-modulin to associate with ROS membrane and to bind Ca2+ at EF-2. Subsequent EF-2 binding of Ca2+ ions probably causes a conformational change permitting interaction of S-modulin with rhodopsin kinase, which inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation. Oligonucleotides, 5′-GGTCATATGTAGCGCTATCATGTACATCTTAAA-3′ and 5′-TTGAATATTGCCGTAATGATTTCAAGCACCATTTTTTT-3′ were used as antisense primers to generate site-directed mutants, E85M and E121M, respectively. The S-modulin cDNA fragment (10Kawamura S. Hisatomi O. Kayada S. Tokunaga F. Kuo C.-H. J. Bioi. Chem. 1993; 268: 14579-14582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the SMD-NTF primer (16Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were used as a template and sense primer, respectively, for the polymerase chain reactions. cDNA fragments encoding E85M and E121M were inserted between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET-16b (Novagen) plasmid vector, designated pET-E85M and pET-E121M, respectively. The procedures for expression and purification of recombinants follow Hisatomi et al. (16Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression vectors, pET-Smd (16Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), pET-E85M, and pET-E121M were transfected toEscherichia coli BL21DE3 (Novagen) with (+myr) or without (−myr) pBB131, an expression vector ofN-myristoyltransferase. The recombinant proteins were expressed by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Recombinant proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea buffer, refolded by dialysis, and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex column. The fraction containing recombinant S-modulins was dialyzed against the buffer containing 5 mm Ca2+ and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. Recombinant S-modulins were eluted with 5 mmEGTA. Purified recombinant proteins were injected onto a reverse-phase C-18 column. Recombinant S-modulin was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile (1.3%/min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, monitoring absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm. Binding of Ca2+ions to S-modulin or mutant proteins was evaluated by ultrafiltration (17Blatt W.F. Robinson S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 26: 151-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were extensively dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove EGTA and calcium, then 20 μmol of each calcium-free protein in 1 ml of 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) were placed in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). 1 ml of 0.2 mm CaCl2 solution in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was then added, and the solution was thoroughly mixed. The calcium-protein mixtures were then centrifuged, and the amounts of calcium in the filtrated fractions were measured by atomic absorption (Shimazu AA-660). Spectroscopic measurement was carried out as described by Hisatomi et al. (16Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4500) at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm, in a mixture containing 2 μmrecombinant protein, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). The free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by adding 1 m CaCl2. Frog ROS were isolated by flotation with 45% sucrose in gluconate buffer (40 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and washed with gluconate buffer containing 4 m urea to eliminate endogenous S-modulin, s26 (cone homologue of S-modulin) and other peripheral proteins. Urea-stripped ROS membranes were mixed with gluconate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin to prevent nonspecific binding of the recombinant proteins to the ROS membrane and tube. After washing with gluconate buffer containing various concentrations of Ca2+(Ca2+ gluconate buffer), the ROS membranes were resuspended in Ca2+ gluconate buffer containing recombinant proteins (120 pmol). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the soluble and membrane fractions after centrifugation (37,000 × g for 5 min) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The integrated densities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands of the recombinant proteins were quantified by a two-dimensional densitometer (The Discovery Series, pdi Inc.). Phosphorylation of rhodopsin was measured by the methods of Kawamura (9Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and Sanada et al. (18Sanada K. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Fukada Y. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 15459-15462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the phosphorylation assay, ROS were isolated in phosphorylation buffer (115 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) in complete darkness, and washed with the buffer to eliminate endogenous S-modulin, s26, and ATP. The reaction was carried out in 25 μl of the mixture containing 10 μm (final concentration) rhodopsin and various concentrations of S-modulin and/or its mutants in phosphorylation buffer. The free calcium concentration in the mixture was adjusted by adding 1 m CaCl2solution. The reaction mixtures were exposed to light for 2 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of a mixture of ATP (0.1 mm final concentration), [γ-32P]ATP (168 TBq/μmol, 0.25 μm), and GTP (0.5 mm). After 2 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 150 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min) of the reaction mixture, the precipitates were washed with 500 μl of phosphorylation buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of32P incorporated into rhodopsin was quantified by using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film). It has been established that the conserved glutamic acid at position 12 of the Ca2+-binding loop is important for coordinating Ca2+ (19Strynadka C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Glati J. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of each Ca2+-binding site, EF-2 or EF-3 was inactivated by replacing glutamic acid with the hydrophobic amino acid, methionine. Myristoylated wild-type (+myr) and mutant S-modulins, E85M (+myr) and E121M (+myr), and unmyristoylated wild-type (−myr) were expressed and purified as described in the experimental procedures. Myristoylated recombinant proteins eluted from a C-18 column at almost the same retention time (Fig. 1, b,c, and d), which is longer than that of wild-type (−myr) (Fig. 1 a) and suggests that these recombinants expressed with N-myrstoyltransferase are in fact myristoylated. The number of Ca2+ ions bound to each of these proteins was quantified in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+ (TableI). As expected, wild-type (+myr) and E85M (+myr) bind two and one Ca2+ per a molecule, respectively. On the other hand, E121M (+myr) can not bind Ca2+. These results indicate that Ca2+ binding to EF-3 is necessary for EF-2 to bind Ca2+ at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. It has been reported that EF-3 has the conformation of a classic EF-hand, but EF-2 is rather different (21Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding to EF-3 may be required to raise the Ca2+ affinity of EF-2, in order for EF-2 to become functional.Table IThe number of Ca2+ ions bound to myristoylated wild-type (+myr), E85M (+myr), and E121M (+myr) S-modulins (per molecule) in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+AssayNo. of calcium ions boundWild-type2.1 ± 0.10E86M0.97 ± 0.02E121M0.02 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab E85M (+myr) and E121M (+myr) can be purified in the same way as for wild-type S-modulin, so it seems that the structure of S-modulin is not largely disrupted by the mutagenesis. Fig. 2shows the tryptophan emission spectra of the wild-type and mutant S-modulins. Wild-type (+myr), E85M (+myr) and E121M (+myr) showed almost the same spectrum in the presence of 1 nmCa2+ (Fig. 2, upper panel), but different from wild-type (−myr). This suggests that E86M (+myr) and E121M (+myr) are in fact myristoylated in a similar way to the wild-type (+myr), and that the mutations of glutamic acid to methionine in EF-2 and EF-3 do not significantly change the environment of the three tryptophan residues in the Ca2+-free form of these proteins. However, the emission spectra of mutants were different from that of wild-type at a concentration of 0.1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2,lower panel). The spectrum of the wild-type is red-shifted by an increasing Ca2+ concentration (16Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); that of E85M (+myr) shows a smaller red shift; and that of E121M (+myr) was not affected by Ca2+ concentration. The red shift observed in E85M (+myr), which can bind one Ca2+ ion per molecule, is probably caused by the binding of Ca2+ to EF-3. Each myristoylated recombinant, (wild-type (+myr), E85M (+myr), or E121M (+myr)) was mixed with urea-stripped ROS membranes at various Ca2+ concentrations and separated by centrifugation into membrane and soluble fractions. The soluble fraction (containing proteins free from ROS membranes) and the membrane fractions (containing proteins bound to ROS membranes) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The densities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands of the wild-type and mutant S-modulins were analyzed quantitatively, and the ratio of membrane-bound protein, (membrane fraction)/(membrane + soluble fraction), was plotted against Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3). This shows that E85M (+myr) has almost the same membrane affinity as the wild-type. As exposure of the myristoyl group is essential for membrane binding (13Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), our results suggest that binding of Ca2+ to EF-3 induces exposure of the myristoyl group. It has been reported that ejection of the myristoyl group is required for rotation at Gly-42, unclamping of the myristoyl group, and melting of part of the N-terminal helix (21Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to EF-3 may induce these changes until the level necessary for membrane association. As E121M (+myr) can not bind Ca2+ at concentrations less than 0.1 mm Ca2+, it can hardly bind to the ROS membrane at all, although in the presence of 1 mmCa2+, E121M (+myr) does bind slightly. This may be explained by the binding of Ca2+ to EF-2 or inactivated EF-3 at very high (more than 1 mm) Ca2+concentration, which is well above normal physiological Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 4 shows the incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphatic acid into rhodopsin in the presence of various concentrations of wild-type (+myr), E85M (+myr), or E121M (+myr) S-modulins. Wild-type (+myr) inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation at a high (0.1 mm) Ca2+concentration, but neither E85M (+myr) nor E121M (+myr) can inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation even at high Ca2+ concentrations. This suggests that Ca2+ binding to EF-2 is important for the inhibitory activity of rhodopsin phosphorylation. To investigate whether E85M (+myr) can interact with rhodopsin kinase or not, its effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation by wild-type (+myr) was investigated. Fig. 5 shows the incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphatic acid into rhodopsin plotted against the concentration of E85M (+myr) in the presence of wild-type (+myr). The inhibitory effect of wild-type (+myr) is not affected by E85M (+myr), indicating that E85M (+myr) does not compete with wild-type (+myr) for binding with rhodopsin kinase. This strongly suggests that the Ca2+ binding to EF-2 is important for recognition of rhodopsin kinase. Ames et al. (23Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that unmyristoylated recoverin exhibits heterogeneous and uncooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions, but these two Ca2+ ions bind cooperatively to myristoylated recoverin with a Hill coefficient of 1.75. One explanation of this difference between myristoylated and unmyristoylated recoverins is that the myristoyl group accommodated within the protein moiety may reduce the Ca2+ affinity of EF-3 to a level lower than that of the EF-2 of unmyrisotylated S-modulin. When Ca2+ concentration is high, EF-3 binds Ca2+, which causes the myristoyl group to be exposed and EF-2 to be functional, upon which it binds Ca2+. As with myristoylated wild-type (+myr), unmyristoylated wild-type (−myr) binds to a phenyl-Sepharose column in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This suggests that a hydrophobic region of the protein moiety, in addition to the myristoyl group, is exposed by binding of Ca2+ (13Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, both unmyrstoylated E85M (−myr) and E121M (−myr) lose affinity for phenyl-Sepharose. We conclude that exposure of the hydrophobic region is probably caused by Ca2+binding at EF-2. The upper part of Fig.6 illustrates the conformational changes of S-modulin deduced from our present analysis. The lower part of Fig. 6 represents the corresponding three-dimensional structure of bovine recoverin during Ca2+ binding (15Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. Mckay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M.

The structure of N-terminal region in the single Ca2+-bound form is different from that in the Ca2+-free form but similar to the double Ca2+-bound form. It is consistent with our model that the conformational change induced by the Ca2+ binding to the EF-3 (shown in blue) may expose the N-terminal myristoyl group. The structure of EF-2 (shown in red) in the single Ca2+-bound form is also largely different from that in the Ca2+-free form. This difference is probably important for EF-2 to be a functional Ca2+-binding site. One of the largest conformational differences is shown at the region corresponding to amino acids from 180 to 186 (shown ingreen) between single Ca2+-bound and double Ca2+-bound forms. In the Ca2+-free and single Ca2+-bound forms, this region appears to form an α-helix, which undergoes a conformational change to a random coil when Ca2+ to EF-2. The conformational change of this region may induce an interaction with rhodopsin kinase.

Initially the HMGI/Y proteins were considered as specific components of constitutive chromatin (17Strauss F. Varshavsky A.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that they are involved in the modulation of transcription of specific genes (for review see Ref. 19Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the human interferon-β (IFN-β) gene and the gene encoding the α-subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor showed transcriptional activation upon binding of HMGI(Y) proteins to positive regulatory domains (PRD), which facilitate binding of transcription factors (20Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 21Thanos D. Maniatis T.

More recently, HMGI/Y proteins were identified as components of a repressor complex that inactivates the promoter of the T cell receptor α-chain gene (23Bagga R. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and as crucial host proteins in the HIV-1 preintegration complex (24Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cytological studies of insect polytene chromosomes have demonstrated that the cHMGI protein is present in many transcriptionally active loci and in nucleoli, suggesting that HMGI/Y proteins are involved in polymerase I and II transcription (25Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are highly abundant in undifferentiated and rapidly dividing cells (25Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Johnson K.R. Disney J.E. Wyatt C.R. Reeves R. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 60-76Google Scholar). Elevated levels of HMGI/Y in differentiated tissues have been found to be correlated with progressive and neoplastic transformations (27Ram T.G. Reeves R.B. Hosick H.L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2655-2660PubMed Google Scholar, 28Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Disruption or rearrangements of their genes lead to tumorigenesis (29Berner J.M. Meza-Zapeda L.A. Kools P.F.J. Forus A.

Whereas different biological effects of HMGI/Y proteins have been described, the molecular and biochemical mechanism of affecting DNA and chromatin structure is not well defined. The spatial organization of HMGI/Y·DNA complex remains only partially understood. NMR data of a complex of a truncated form of the protein and a DNA dodecamer show that the central part of the AT-hook domain, the Arg-Gly-Arg motif, interacts with the bases and the sugar within the minor groove of the DNA double helix (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, several residues flanking this motif interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone and are responsible for the strength of the overall protein DNA binding (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Moreover, the central AT-hook motif mediates specific DNA binding and cooperates the other two AT-hooks (32Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we report the mapping of the regions of the cHMGI protein involved in contacts with various types of DNA, including linear synthetic poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), four-way junction DNA, and a region of the promoter of the IFN-β gene. The mapping was performed by means of protein hydroxyl radical-footprinting technique (33Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The data presented show that the interaction of cHMGI protein with DNA involves residues of two or three AT-hook motifs dependent on the DNA type and/or the protein to DNA ratio. Large regions flanking these motifs also contribute to the binding of cHMGI to DNA. The cHMGI protein was overexpressed inEscherichia coli (12Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Claus P. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

The dried cHMGI was quantified gravimetrically. 100 μg (9.64 nmol) of the cHMGI protein were phosphorylated at Ser3 (8Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

The reaction was stopped by precipitation of the proteins with 30% (w/v) CCl3COOH for 30 min at 0 °C. The pellet was washed with 30% CCl3COOH, 0.2% HCl in acetone, twice with pure acetone and dried. The synthetic linear poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) DNA was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The approximate average length of this DNA was 5000 bp. The 34-bp fragment of the promoter of the IFN-β gene containing the PRDII/NRDI sites was prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides. The sequence of the top strand was 5′-GAAGTGAAAGTGGGAAATTCCTCTGAATAGAGAG-3′ (PRDII site is underlined). Four-way junction c was prepared according to Bianchi (36Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). 100 pmol of the radioactively end-labeled protein (15,000–30,000 cpm) were incubated in the presence or absence of DNA in 257 mm NaCl and 14.3 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, buffer at room temperature for 15 min. The chemical digestions were started by sequential addition of 1 μl each of the following freshly prepared solutions: (i) 20 mm EDTA and 10 mm(NH2)2Fe(II)(SO4)2; (ii) 0.2 m sodium ascorbate; and (iii) 0.375% H2O2. If not specified otherwise, the reactions were stopped after 40 min by addition of 3.3 μl of 4-fold SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 16% glycerol, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The reaction products were separated on 16.5% polyacrylamide gels using the Tricine-glycine-SDS buffer system (37Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and scanned by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Size markers were obtained by limited digestions of the end-labeled cHMGI protein with trypsin or proteinase Glu-C (V8). 100 pmol of end-labeled cHMGI were digested with 17 ng of trypsin in 10 μl of 180 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 0 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.14 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK). The cleavage with proteinase Glu-C (V8) was carried out in the presence of 50 ng of enzyme in 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 180 mm NaCl at 0 °C for 2 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and immediate boiling of the probe. The end-labeled peptides 1–48 and 1–6 were obtained by cleavage of the cHMGI protein with hydroxylamine (38Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and trypsin (8Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

The assignment of the hydroxyl radical fragments was accomplished using a standard curve. The phosphorimages were essentially analyzed according to Heyduk et al. (39Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Baichoo and Heyduk (40Baichoo N. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10830-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorimages of the full lanes width were scanned and the intensities were plotted versus mobility (ImageQuant Software, Molecular Dynamics). The intensity plots were aligned to correct distortions between different lanes using ALIGN software (gift from Dr. T. Heyduk, St. Louis, MO). The aligned intensity plots were imported into EXCEL (Microsoft), gel-loading efficiencies, and the extent of cleavages were normalized. The electrophoretic mobilities were transformed into amino acid residue positions and mean values for each position was calculated. Finally each amino acid residue position was compared in a difference plot: Δnorm = (Iwithout DNA − Iwith DNA)/Iwithout DNA, where Δnorm is the normalized difference,Iwithout DNA is the mean value of the corrected phosphorimager intensity of single residue position measured in the absence of DNA, and Iwith DNA is the mean value of corrected phosphorimager intensity of the same position measured in the presence of DNA. Cutting frequencies within tryptic protein footprints were calculated by integrating intensities of the bands subtracted from background (ImageQuant). During electrophoresis, digestion products shorter than 7 or longer than 90 residues were not resolved. Therefore, the difference plots were calculated excluding these regions (39Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of the products of a limited digestion of protein labeled at its NH2 terminus yields a characteristic pattern. With DNA-binding proteins, changes in the electrophoretic pattern can be observed. In the presence of DNA, disappearing or fading of bands in defined regions (footprints) can be related to a protection of the protein at sites contacting the DNA. To map on theChironomus HMGI protein regions of DNA binding it was (i) radioactively phosphorylated at Ser3, (ii) partially digested with sequence specific proteinases or hydroxyl radicals in the presence or absence of DNA, and (iii) the digestion products were separated on polyacrylamide gels. (iv) Finally the gels were subjected to quantitative scanning and objective data analysis, i.e.corrections for gel loading, cleavage efficiency, and the transformation of the electrophoretic mobility of the bands into residue numbers (39Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Baichoo N. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10830-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the cHMGI protein at Ser3could be used as an end-labeling procedure because this is a unique target of Cdc-2 kinase, and because its modification does not change the DNA binding properties of the protein (8Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Limited digestion of the labeled cHMGI by proteinase Glu-C or trypsin followed by electrophoresis yielded patterns in which the individual bands could be assigned to peptides of defined lengths (Fig.1, A, Glu-C andtrypsin, and B). Application of end-labeled peptides 1–48, 1–32, and 1–6 facilitated this assignment. Nonlinear regression enabled transformation of the relative mobilities of the cleavage products into residue sites within the protein (Fig.1 B). In the absence of DNA, trypsin cut the cHMGI protein preferentially at five positions, amino acid residues 27/28, 31/32, 53/54, 76, and 84/85 (two adjacent lysine residues are present in four of the sites, and therefore the precise position of cleavage is uncertain). In the presence of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) DNA, some bands nearly disappeared, whereas the intensity of others was only slightly reduced. (Fig. 1 A, lanes marked trypsin). In particular, the cutting frequencies at the tryptic cleavage sites 53/54 and 76 were strongly reduced, whereas the cutting frequencies at position 27/28 and 85/85 were increased (Fig. 1 C). The percentage of cleavage at sites 31/32 remained almost unchanged. These results show that regions corresponding to the second and the third AT-hook motif in the protein were protected after DNA binding, whereas other regions were more exposed. Since trypsin (like other proteinases), because of relatively large size, does not gain access to all cleavage sites of a protein and is able to cleave the peptide backbone at certain positions, these data provide only preliminary information on the structure of the cHMGI·DNA complex. To obtain more precise information on regions of the protein that contact the DNA, hydroxyl radicals were used as a chemical proteinase (33Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,41Greiner P.D. Hughes K.A. Gunasekera A.H. Meares C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical footprinting patterns exhibited relatively small changes after binding to DNA and were therefore difficult to analyze by visual comparison (Fig. 1 A, hydroxyl radical). A quantitative analysis of the data showed that defined regions were protected from chemical proteolysis, whereas others were not. A comparison of the mean intensities (radioactivity) measured in the lanes (from Fig. 2 A) is shown in Fig. 2 C. The plot of normalized differences measured between corresponding lanes with and without poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) DNA shows the protected and exposed regions of the DNA-bound protein (Fig. 2 D). The protected and the exposed regions found by this procedure matched those found in the enzymatic approach (compare Fig. 1 C and Fig. 2 D). The sizes and positions of the DNA-protected areas were constant over a wide range of digestion time (Fig. 2, C and D). For further experiments, 40 min of digestion were selected since under these conditions the ratio of small to long fragments is well balanced (Fig. 2 C,40 min), and 55–70% of the protein remained uncleaved (Fig. 2 B), suggesting conditions of single cleavage (42Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 130: 132-181Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Furthermore, simultaneous DNA digestion by hydroxyl radicals was low under these conditions (not shown). Earlier work has revealed that mammalian HMGI protein binds strongly to poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (9Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because this synthetic DNA is also a good ligand of cHMGI, we chose it for our experiments. cHMGI was footprinted in the presence of concentrations of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) ranging from 16 to 120 bp per protein molecule (Fig. 3,A and B). At lower ratios (16 bp:1 and 32 bp:1) protection was observed at amino acid residues 10–22 and 54–60. In addition, protection at amino acid residues 30–40 was detected. The region between residues 10 and 20 corresponds to part of the first AT-hook sequence motif and adjacent NH2-terminal stretch. The region 53–60 constitutes the second AT-hookmotif. At protein to DNA ratios of 60 bp:1 (Fig. 3 B) and 120 bp:1 (not shown) an additional region, amino acid residues 75–81, which comprises the third AT-hook, was protected. Under these conditions, protection of region 30–40 was no longer observed, and in contrast to lower DNA to protein ratios, a large portion of the protein (residues 29 to 50) was found to be highly susceptible to digestion and should therefore be exposed to the solvent. At all concentrations of DNA used an enhanced susceptibility to digestion was observed for the negatively charged COOH terminus of the protein. In vivo binding sites of the insect HMGI on the DNA are not known. Because most properties of this protein are identical or similar to those of mammalian HMGI, we analyzed the binding determinants of cHMGI in complexes with a DNA sequence comprising a mammalian ligand. A 34-bp DNA carrying PRDII/NRDI elements of the promoter region of the human IFN-β gene was selected for the experiments. The stoichiometry of cHMGI binding to this DNA is 1:1. 2M. Gymnopoulos and J. R. Wiśniewski, unpublished results. Footprinting revealed protection of residues 46–82 and 8–10 (Fig. 3, C andD). The NH2-terminal located region corresponds to part of the first AT-hook motif, whereas the large protected region comprises the other two AT-hooks and areas flanking these motifs. Regions of cHMGI rich in negatively charged residues (20–44 and 85–90), as in the complex with poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) were found to be cleaved more frequently than without DNA and therefore probably exposed to solvent in complex with the DNA. Chironomus and human HMGI proteins specifically recognize cruciform DNA (3Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cHMGI was footprinted at different concentration ratios of DNA to protein (1:4, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1) (Fig. 3 E). The results were almost identical at all four conditions and showed protection of residues 9–15 and 51–74. The first region corresponds to part of the first AT-hook motif, whereas the second one comprises the second AT-hook motif and residues between the second and third AT-hooks (Fig.3 F). Interestingly, the third AT-hook was not protected in the presence of the cruciform DNA. The regions of amino acid residues 26–34, 38–48, and >82 were found to be more susceptible in the presence of four-way junction DNA and are thus probably exposed within the complex. Histones and the HMG proteins are the most abundant components of chromatin (for review see Refs. 43van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Arents G. Moundrianakis E. Elgin S.C.R. Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 1-26Google Scholar and 44Wiśniewski J.R. Grossbach U. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 177-187PubMed Google Scholar). In the structure of the histones and HMG1/2 proteins, well characterized folded domains are found in central positions. Another characteristic structural feature shared by these proteins is the presence of large structurally undefined regions, termini, bristles, ortails. Two groups of the HMG proteins, the families HMGI/Y and HMG14/17, are thought to be composed mainly of flexible regions of undefined structure. Binding to DNA induces a spatial ordering of regions containing residues involved in contacting DNA. Binding of the HMGI protein to DNA simultaneously leads to specific ordering of the protein structure (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and induces changes in the conformation of the DNA (10Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Johnson K.R. Reeves R. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 963-976PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nissen M.S. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4355-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Heyduk T. Heyduk E.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The contacts of the entire HMGI molecule to DNA in protein-DNA complexes have been unknown. Here we have mapped for the first time the regions of an HMGI protein that are involved in the binding to DNAs of various types. Our protein footprinting experiments revealed some general and some DNA structure-specific features of the cHMGI·DNA complex (Fig.4). Binding of cHMGI to poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), to cruciform DNA and to HMGI binding site in interferon-β promoter DNA (PRII/NRDI) involved contacts by the first and second AT-hook motifs and led to exposition to the solvent of large parts of the region joining these two motifs and the COOH-terminal acidic tail of the protein. At ratios higher than 30 bp of the poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) per protein molecule, the third AT-hook motif was also protected. This suggests a lower DNA-binding affinity of the third motif as compared with the other two motifs and also that the entire protein occupies more than 30 bp on this DNA. This is reminiscent of the situation observed in human HMGI, where the third AT-hook exhibited a several orders of magnitude lower DNA-binding affinity in comparison to the second motif (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Also, an 18-bp-long DNA molecule was found not to accommodate the entire HMGI protein (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 27-bp PRDII/NRDI-DNA fragment and a 40-bp PRDI/PRDII/NRDI-DNA fragment were able to bind only one molecule of an HMGI-C (45Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or HMGI (32Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), respectively. Binding of cHMGI protein to the 34-bp PRDII/NRDI-DNA appears to involve all three AT-hook motifs and also residues in front of the second motif and between the second and the third motif. These data suggest that the protein contacts with this DNA are more extensive in comparison to those found in poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and probably reflect a capability of the cHMGI to recognize specific sequence contexts and/or a specific conformation of this DNA, which are absent in the poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT). This DNA with alternating A/T residues has a widened minor groove and is conformationally flexible in solution (46Drew H Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 535-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), resulting in a weaker binding of the HMGI protein as compared with binding to rigid or intrinsically curved AT-rich DNA (47Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5063-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The PRDII/NRDI-DNA is intrinsically pre-bent by about 20°, and binding of human HMGI to this DNA induces a partial reversal bending (13Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A similar unbending of the PRDII/NRD-DNA was also exhibited by the insect HMGI protein. 3T. Heyduk and J. R. Wiśniewski, unpublished results. Our finding that the insect HMGI protein makes extensive contacts with this specific DNA is in accordance with data from recent NMR studies that suggest extensive contacts between HMGI and PRDII-DNA and have revealed that 19 of the 42-residues-long HMGI(2/3) peptide are directly involved in the interaction with a PRDII-dodecamer (31Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In contrast, in complexes with cruciform DNA the third motif of the cHMGI protein remained unprotected, suggesting that this DNA cannot accommodate the entire protein or that the protein has a specific conformation in a complex with the cruciform DNA. Because this type of DNA is able to accommodate up to two HMGI molecules (48Hill D.A. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3523-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the second possibility appears to be more probable. Interestingly, in this complex the region joining the second and the third motif was protected. It contains another sequence motif, PKRP (Fig. 4), which occurs not only in the HMGI/Y proteins but is also characteristic for proteins of the families HMG14/17 and HMG1/2. Peptides carrying this motif interact specifically with the minor groove of the DNA (35Wiśniewski J.R. Heβler K. Claus P. Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because all of these proteins exhibit preferential binding to cruciform DNA, it is possible that this motif plays a role in the recognition of this type of DNA. Four-way junction DNA has been suggested as a model for DNA in chromatin at the site where it enters and exits the nucleosome (49Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20699-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,50Varga-Weisz P. Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. Schroth G.P. van Holde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The binding of HMGI to this DNA may reflect a constitutive function of this protein in the organization of chromatin, in contrast to specific functions as organization of promoter complexes of particular genes. We have recently shown that phosphorylation at various residues may be involved in the adaptation of members of the HMGI/Y family to fulfill different cellular functions (8Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In further studies, this possibility could be checked by investigating the binding of various phosphoforms of HMGI/Y proteins to DNA as well as to nucleosomes. By means of the protein-footprinting technique applied in this study it would also be possible to map contacts of the cHMGI protein within reconstituted chromatin or its selected components. We thank Dr. U. Grossbach for the continuous support and interest in this work, Dr. T. Heyduk (St. Louis University) for providing the ALIGN software for the quantitative analysis of the phosphorimages and stimulating discussion."

Using P60H as reference, the P60 cells cultured in a methionine medium had slightly lower TCII receptor activity and normal total cobalamin content, a moderately reduced microsomal and mitochondrial cobalamin(III) reductase activity but only trace amounts of the methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin cofactors. When transferred to a homocysteine medium without methionine, P60H cells showed a slightly enhanced TCII receptor activity, but the other cobalamin-related functions were essentially unchanged. In contrast, the methionine-dependent P60 cells responded to homocysteine medium with a nearly 6-fold enhancement of TCII receptor expression and a doubling of both the hydroxycobalamin content and the microsomal reductase activity.

In both cell lines, TCII receptor activity was further increased when growth in homocysteine medium was combined with N2O exposure.These data suggest that low methionine and/or high homocysteine exert a positive feedback control on TCII receptor activity. The concurrent increase in hydroxycobalamin content and in microsomal reductase activity are either subjected to similar regulation or secondary to increased cobalamin transport.

Disturbance of cellular Met metabolism is a common feature of cancer cells. This trait, known as Met dependence, becomes apparent when cells are cultured in a medium where Met is replaced with homocysteine (Hcy). 1The abbreviations used are: HcyhomocysteineCH3THFmethyltetrahydrofolateCH3CblmethylcobalaminCbl(s)cobalamin(s)TCIItranscobalamin IICRcobalamin(III) reductaseAdoCbladenosylcobalaminMCMmethylmalonyl-CoA mutaseCNCblcyanocobalaminOHCblhydroxycobalaminDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBAEEbenzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units.

The biochemical basis for Met dependence is related to an imbalance between Met consumption and formation. In most cells, Met is formed from Hcy in a reaction catalyzed by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (Met synthase, EC 2.1.1.13.). This enzyme uses methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) as substrate, and methylcobalamin (CH3Cbl) serves as cofactor (2Banerjee R. Chem . Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A common finding in the Met-dependent cells is a low rate of Hcy remethylation (1Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar), which seems related to lack of CH3Cbl (3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H.

Physiol. 1991; 149: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Certain inborn errors in cobalamin (Cbl) metabolism (5Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Cbl deficiency as well as N2O exposure, are associated with marked reduction in Hcy remethylation and may render the cells fully or partly dependent on an exogenous supply of Met. Thus, these clinical conditions may have biochemical characteristics similar to those observed in Met-dependent cancer cells. Cellular Cbl metabolism is only partly characterized (Fig. 1). Cbl crosses the cell membrane as a complex with transcobalamin II (TCII). This transport is mediated by a specific TCII receptor (6Bose S. Seetharam B. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the lysosomes, Cbl is released from this complex (5Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), followed by an axial ligand exchange (7Mellman I. Willard H.F. Youngdahl-Turner P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol.

The Cbl(III) then becomes reduced to Cbl(II) (9Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23010-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably by a NADH-linked Cbl(III) reductase (CR) located either in the microsomes or in the mitochondrial membrane (8Pezacka E.H.

Nutr. 1996; 126: 2947-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Cbl(II) thus formed becomes bound to the cytosolic Met synthase. Alternatively, it undergoes an additional reduction in the mitochondria, probably catalyzed by a NADPH-dependent enzyme (10Watanabe F. Saido H. Yamaji R. Miyatake K. Isegawa Y. Ito A. Yubisui T. Rosenblatt D.S. Nakano Y. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2947-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), to Cbl(I), followed by conversion to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) (11Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Arch . Biochem . Biophys. 1978; 189: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This Cbl species serves as the cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) (EC5.4.99.2), which is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (2Banerjee R.

Cooper B.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated key processes operating at different levels along the Cbl pathway, from transport to metabolism to the catalytic function of the Cbl-dependent enzymes. These processes were studied in the Met-dependent P60 and the Met-independent P60H variants of a human glioma cell line, cultured in a Met medium and after transfer to a medium lacking Met but supplemented with Hcy, and also during N2O exposure which irreversibly inactivates Met synthase (14Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3742-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

They are both variants of the GaMg cell line, established from a human glioblastoma multiform tumor in a 42-year-old female (15Akslen L.A. Andersen K.-J. Bjerkvig R. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 797-803PubMed Google Scholar). Their different abilities to utilize Hcy for growth were developed by culture for about 50 passages in a medium containing Met (P60) or a medium in which Hcy replaced Met (P60H) (13Fiskerstrand T. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Stem cultures were kept in DMEM supplemented with 330 μmnon-essential amino acids, 0.6 g/liter l-glutamine, 1.5 μm CNCbl, 10 μm folic acid, 5 μm thymidine, 40 μm hypoxanthine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. P60 was kept in a medium containing 50 μm Met (Met medium) whereas P60H was kept in a Met-free medium supplemented with 200 μm Hcy thiolactone (Hcy medium). P60H cells were grown one passage in Met medium prior to the start of experiments. The cells were cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C with relative humidity of 98%. Cells were always seeded in Met medium, at a density of approximately 1,000 cells/cm2 and 10,000 cells/ml. For most experiments, we used 10-cm dishes. T175 flasks were used for CR, titanium citrate, and NADPH assay. 6-cm dishes were used for conventional assay of Met synthase. To reach early logarithmic growth phase, P60 cells were incubated for 3 days and P60H for 4 days. The medium was then changed to either Met medium or Hcy medium. The cells were allowed to incubate with the fresh medium for 3 h, and they were then placed in modular incubation chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) and exposed to either air or N2O for 48 h (3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were in late exponential growth phase when harvested. Dishes for measurement of TCII receptor activity were harvested by use of a rubber policeman after removing the medium and adding 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Dishes for the other assays were trypsinized (0.1 mg/ml, BioWhittaker, Gaithersburg, MD). Samples for analysis of Cbl were washed with PBS-containing albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and the final pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of this solution and frozen at −80 °C. Samples for analysis of MCM were resuspended in 300 μl of 20% glycerol and frozen at −80 °C. Samples for analysis of CR were washed with PBS-containing trypsin inhibitor (10 BAEE units/ml), resuspended in isolation buffer (see below), and then placed on ice, and the activity was determined the same day. The details of the sample preparation for analysis of Cbl has been published before (3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fiskerstrand T. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cbl was extracted by heating in the presence of acetic acid and N-ethylmaleimide. Separation of the different forms of Cbl was performed by reversed-phase HPLC (16Jacobsen D. Green R. Zagalak B. Friedrich W. Vitamin B12. Walter de Gruyter Co., New York1979: 663-664Crossref Google Scholar). The retention times for the Cbl forms were: 10.5 min (OHCbl), 12 min (CNCbl), 14 min (AdoCbl), and 16 min (CH3Cbl). Total Cbl and Cbl in the various fractions were determined by a radioimmunodilution assay (17van Kapel J. Spijkers L.J.M. Lindemans J. Abels J. Clin . Chim . Acta. 1983; 131: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Salivary R-binder was used as binding protein. The assays were performed according to Seligman and Allen (18Seligman P.A. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1766-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the DEAE-Sephadex method using 2 pmol of human TCII-[57Co]Cbl. The cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer consisting of 140 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the homogenate was extracted with Triton X-100 (1%) for 12 h at 5 °C. Triton X-100 completely solubilizes TCII receptor (19Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A modification (20Christensen B. Refsum H. Garras A. Ueland P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 1096-1105PubMed Google Scholar) of the method developed by Weissbach et al. (21Weissbach H. Peterkofsky A. Redfield B.G. Dickermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3318-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for measurement of Met synthase activity in cell extracts. This is the conventional assay and measures conversion of [14C]CH3-THF and Hcy to [14C]Met. The titanium citrate and NADPH assays are anaerobic assays. N2 was bubbled through all reagent solutions, and the reaction was carried out in stoppered serum vials (air exchanged with N2). Titanium citrate or NADPH was used as reductant, and the titanium citrate assay was run either in the presence (total) or absence (holo) of OHCbl, whereas Cbl was omitted from the NADPH assay. As in the conventional assay, [14C]CH3-THF was converted to [14C]Met, and the radioactive Met was determined (22Banerjee R. Chen Z. Gulati S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The assay measures the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This assay was performed by an automated HPLC assay described by Riedel et al. (23Riedel B. Ueland P.M. Svardal A.M. Clin . Chem. 1995; 41: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sonicated cellular suspension in glycerol was transferred to a cooled rack in a Gilson ASPEC (Gilson Medical Electronics), which performed the enzyme reaction and sample injection. AdoCbl (total activity) or water (holoactivity) was added to the cell suspension, and the enzyme reaction was started by adding dl-methylmalonyl-CoA. After 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid, then the protein precipitate was removed by filtration, and the samples were injected on a reversed phase C18 column which separated the succinyl-CoA product from methylmalonyl-CoA. Fractionation of cells was essentially performed according to the procedure described by Pezacka et al. (8Pezacka E.H. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1993; 1157: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The washed cells (10 million cells/ml) in isolation buffer (10 mm Tris-acetate, 1.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 BAEE units/ml trypsin inhibitor, 90 nm aprotinin, 5 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) were disintegrated in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Whole cells, the nuclei, and cell walls were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant obtained was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for isolation of microsomes. The mitochondria were kept in 150–200 μl of isolation buffer and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Microsomes were resuspended in 150–200 μl of a 50 mm Tris buffer with 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and kept on ice until analysis. The purity of the fractions was determined by the measurement of the following marker enzymes: NADH-cytochrome c reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The CR activity (8Pezacka E.H. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1993; 1157: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was determined at 40 °C by measuring the rate of conversion of OHCbl to Cbl(II) in the presence of NADH (0.2 mm). Absorbance was read at 526 nm, and the differential molar extinction coefficient of OHCbl to Cbl(II) was 5.6 × 103m−1 cm−1. Protein in the fractions was measured by the BCA assay using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). We investigated Cbl metabolism and function in two variants of a human glioma cell line, one is Met-dependent (P60) and the other is selected on the basis of growth in a Hcy medium and is Met-independent (P60H). The Met dependence of P60 cells developed during long-term culture in the presence of Met and folic acid, but such conversion only rarely occurs (data not shown). P60 cells did not attain Met-independent growth by culture in a medium containing Hcy (and no Met) and/or high folate, and repeated exposure to a demethylating agent was required to develop a Met-independent revertant (3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar). Also, change in the growth requirements of the P60H cells was never observed. Thus, both variants seem phenotypically stable. The parameters investigated include key steps in a series of events from binding of Cbl at the cell surface (transport, level 1), cellular Cbl retention and metabolism (level 2), and finally the activities of the two Cbl-dependent enzymes, Met synthase and MCM (level 3) (Fig. 1). The functions were measured under standard culture conditions and under conditions assumed to pose a metabolic stress on the Met synthase pathway. Such stress was induced by transferring the cells to a Hcy medium which makes conversion of Hcy to Met essential for cell survival. We also exposed the cells to N2O which irreversibly inactivates Met synthase (14Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3742-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The TCII receptor expression level has been shown to respond to different physiological signals such as cell proliferation (24Hall C.A. Colligan P.D. Begley J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and differentiation (25Amagasaki T. Green R. Jacobsen D.W. Blood. 1990; 76: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular Cbl status (25Amagasaki T. Green R. Jacobsen D.W. Blood. 1990; 76: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cortisone level (26Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are no data relating TCII receptor expression level to the catalytic activity of the two Cbl-dependent enzymes. We determined the TCII receptor activity in P60H and P60 cells cultured in a Hcy medium and after N2O exposure. The receptor activity was lower (22 fmol/106 cells) in P60 than in P60H cells (41 fmol/106 cell) when cultured under standard conditions (Met medium). Exposure to N2O by itself had no effect. However, transfer of the cells to a Hcy medium caused a marked increase in TCII receptor activity which was further increased by N2O. This induction was particularly pronounced in the P60 cells, which responded to the combination of medium shift plus N2O with a nearly 10-fold increase in activity, to 175 fmol/106 cells (Fig.2). In human melanoma cells, Liteplo et al. (4Liteplo R.G. Hipwell S.E. Rosenblatt D.S. Sillaots S. Lue-Shing H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated a relation between Met dependence and impaired Cbl retention despite normal uptake. In both P60 and P60H cell lines, we found a total Cbl level of about 500 fmol/106 cells, and CNCbl and OHCbl were the predominating Cbl species. However, CNCbl accounted for 20% of the total Cbl pool in the P60H cells and 37% in P60, suggesting a more extensive metabolism of CNCbl in P60H cells. The OHCbl content in P60H remained essentially unchanged in response to culture in Hcy medium and N2O. In contrast, P60 cells transferred to Hcy medium showed a dramatic increase in OHCbl content from about 250 to 600 fmol/106 cells (Fig. 2) and in total Cbl (data not shown). From these data, the following conclusions can be made. First, the high Cbl levels in P60 cells cultured in the Hcy medium are in agreement with the marked induction of the TCII receptor activity in these cells. Secondly, high OHCbl in P60H and P60 cells suggests that the rate of decyanation of CNCbl catalyzed by cyanocobalamin β-ligand transferase (8Pezacka E.H. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1993; 1157: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Mellman I. Youngdahl-Turner P. Willard H.F. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 916-920Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) does not limit the provision of Cbl in either cell line. Finally, the accumulation of OHCbl in P60 cells suggest that the hypothetical block in Cbl traffic is located distal to the site of intracellular ligand transfer. NADH-linked cobalamin reductase (CR) functions further down the metabolic route. It catalyzes the reduction of OHCbl(III) to Cbl(II)in vitro (8Pezacka E.H. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1993; 1157: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe F. Saido H. Yamaji R. Miyatake K. Isegawa Y. Ito A. Yubisui T. Rosenblatt D.S. Nakano Y. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2947-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and is the last common step before Cbl is directed into two separate pathways, i.e. association with Met synthase (2Banerjee R. Chem . Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23010-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or formation of AdoCbl which is the cofactor of MCM (11Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Arch . Biochem . Biophys. 1978; 189: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We measured NADH-linked CR activity in the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of P60 and P60H cell lines. In a Met medium, both the microsomal and mitochondrial activities were lower in P60 compared with P60H cells. The activities were 16 ± 7 and 34 ± 17 in microsomes and 51 ± 28 and 139 ± 7 in mitochondria for P60 and P60H, respectively (values are average of three experiments ± S.D.). When cells were transferred from Met to a Hcy medium, the mitochondrial enzyme activities in the two cell lines were essentially unaffected whereas the activity of the microsomal enzyme was enhanced, especially in P60 cells. N2O exposure was without effect (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate for the first time specific induction of CR under conditions of metabolic strain of the Met synthase pathway. Selective response of microsomal CR serves to distinguish the microsomal CR from the mitochondrial isoenzyme. The up-regulation was most pronounced in the P60 cells and thus represents the third and presumably last process in a sequence of metabolic steps being more responsive in the P60 cells than in the P60H cells. We have previously demonstrated in an intact cell assay that P60H but not P60 cells efficiently remethylate Hcy to Met when cultured in the Hcy medium (13Fiskerstrand T. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This can probably be related to the very low level of CH3Cbl in the P60 cells, consistent with impaired function of Met synthase (3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar,13Fiskerstrand T. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells belonging to the cblE complementation group are characterized by normal Met synthase activity when measured by a conventional assay, but reveal a functional Met synthase deficiency in an intact cell assay; hence, they resemble P60 cells. Recently, Gulatiet al. provided evidence that cblE cells have a defect in the auxiliary redox proteins that activate Met synthase. cblE cells had normal activity as determined by the conventional assay or an assay using titanium citrate as a reductant, but low activity was measured when the physiological reductant, NADPH, was employed (28Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present work, we investigated a possible Met synthase defect in the P60 cells by comparing the activity obtained by the three different assays (Table I). The titanium citrate assay gave the highest values, followed by the NADPH assay and the conventional assay. Independent of the assay, the enzyme activity in P60 relative to that in P60H cells was constant, and N2O caused a substantial reduction (>60%) in both cell lines. Compared with the enzyme activities obtained by Gulati et al. (28Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), normal activity was detected in all assays including the NADPH assay in P60 cells, whereas P60H showed very high values. Notably, previous data have shown a frequent discrepancy between activity of Met synthase in vitro and remethylation of Hcy in intact cells (1Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fiskerstrand T. Christensen B. Tysnes O.B. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fiskerstrand T. Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Taken together, the activity profile obtained with different assay formats is not consistent with a mutant Met synthase or defective reductive activation in P60 cells.Table IMethionine synthase activity determined by different assaysMethionine synthase assayP60H cellsP60 cellsAirN2OAirN2Opmol/min/mg proteinConventional223 ± 5338 ± 13115 ± 6818 ± 7NADPH415 ± 2841 ± 6113 ± 213 ± 2Titanium citrate (total)946 ± 51259 ± 13190 ± 2183 ± 4Titanium citrate (holo)930 ± 11196 ± 8244 ± 831 ± 1After change of medium, the cells were preincubated for 3 h and then exposed to air or N2O for 48 h.

All assays measure the conversion to [14C]Met from [14C]CH3THF and Hcy. It is well recognized that Cbl deficiency affects both total and holo MCM activity (29Cardinale G. Dreyfus P.M. Auld P. Abeles R.H. Arch . Biochem . Biophys. 1969; 131: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Kennedy D. Cannavan A. Molloy A. O′Harte F. Taylor S. Kennedy S. Blanchflower W. Br. J.

Biochem. 1994; 58: 556-557Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Recently, Riedel et al. found that holo MCM in intact glioma cells is highly dependent on the level of its cofactor. 2B. Riedel, T. Fiskerstrand, H. Refsum, and P. M. Ueland, submitted for publication. We found that the MCM activity, especially the total level, was markedly lower in P60 cells compared with the P60H cells (Fig. 2). Total Cbl in P60 cells (mainly CNCbl and OHCbl) was equal to (Met medium) or even higher than (Hcy medium) the level in P60H cells, whereas AdoCbl was low. This points to the level of AdoCbl rather than the level of total Cbl as the factor regulating MCM activity. Culture in Hcy or N2O exposure had minimal effects on total and holo MCM in the P60 cells, whereas the P60H cells responded to N2O exposure with a slight decrease of holo MCM in a Met medium but an increase in a Hcy medium. The changes in holo MCM activity mirrored the alterations in AdoCbl level, further supporting the recent data from Riedel et al. 2 Our observations (Fig.2) can be synthesized into a model for the regulation of Cbl metabolism in the glioma cell line (Fig. 1). When the cells were grown in a Hcy medium, the TCII receptor activity increased. The response was further enhanced by N2O and was particularly pronounced in the P60 cells which have low remethylation. This could be explained by feedback control at the level of TCII receptor expression mediated by the substrate and/or product of the Cbl-dependent Met synthase. The absence of an N2O effect on TCII receptor activity in a Met medium (high cellular Hcy, high Met) and the high TCII expression in Hcy medium which is further enhanced by N2O (high cellular Hcy, low Met) point to low Met as the regulatory signal. Enhanced Cbl transport may account for the high level of intracellular Cbl observed in P60 cells cultured in a Hcy medium, but the metabolic signal (low Met) may also directly affect Cbl metabolism and retention. Likewise, the enhanced activity of microsomal CR in P60 cells may be secondary to an increase in OHCbl content (substrate) or is caused by a direct positive control. The stimulatory effects of Hcy medium (especially when combined with N2O) on the TCII receptor were most clearly demonstrated in Met-dependent P60 cells which also accumulated OHCbl during culture in a Hcy medium. The low level of both AdoCbl and CH3Cbl, combined with consequent impaired function of both Cbl-dependent enzymes in the Met-dependent cells, provides the strongest evidence for an upstream location of the defect, probably in proximity of the CR. The alternative explanation of an isolated defect in CH3Cbl synthesis combined with a cross-talk between the two Cbl-dependent enzyme systems is not in agreement with data on Cbl mutant cells. cblA and -B are mutants that affect MCM, but the CH3Cbl content and the activity of Met synthase are normal. cblG and -E mutants have a low Met synthase activity and cellular level of CH3Cbl, but the AdoCbl content is normal (5Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although some cases with cblG and -E disease have slightly decreased activity of MCM in intact cells, the levels are still much higher than those observed in cblA and -B, and patients with cblG and -E disease have no symptoms indicating dysfunction of MCM (32Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cause of the metabolic difference in the P60 cells has not been identified. Notably, the low mitochondrial CR activity in P60 cells relative to P60H cells (Fig. 2) was equal to the reduction observed incblC cells relative to control fibroblasts (10Watanabe F. Saido H. Yamaji R. Miyatake K. Isegawa Y. Ito A. Yubisui T. Rosenblatt D.S. Nakano Y. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2947-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the low CR activity in the cblC cell line was not due to reduction in levels of the enzyme but in its affinity for NADH cofactor. This enzyme has still not been cloned, but our findings suggest that gene(s) coding for CR are candidates for mutation screening in Met-dependent cancer cells. In conclusion, the present work provides evidence for a regulatory network involving Cbl transport, uptake, metabolism, and Met synthase function. A positive feedback control of TCII receptor expression by Met depletion may represent a key component of this system. The Met dependence of the P60 cells seems to be related to disruption of this network in the proximity of CR. It is not clear whether the reductive steps required for AdoCbl and CH3Cbl formation are carried out by the same reductase system, and further elucidation of the molecular defect responsible for the Met dependence will depend on additional knowledge of the enzymes involved in intracellular Cbl reduction."

Helix 8 and a portion of the adjoining cytoplasmic region (loop 8–9) constitute the GabP “consensus amphipathic region” (CAR), a potential channel-forming domain that is found to be evolutionarily conserved within the APC (amine-polyamine-choline) transporter superfamily. Upon the polar surface of the CAR, all known gab permeases display a “signature cysteine” not found in other members of the APC superfamily, suggesting that discrete features within the CAR might play a role in imparting specificity (kcat/Km) to the translocation reaction. Here we show that among the five cysteine residues in the E. coli GabP, only Cys-300, the signature cysteine, can restore wild type properties to the Cys-less GabP mutant. We conclude (i) from partial reaction studies (equilibrium exchange, counterflow) that rapid translocation of the GABA binding site from one side of the membrane to the other is greatly facilitated by Cys-300 and (ii) from pharmacological studies that loss of Cys-300 has little effect on the affinity that GabP exhibits for a structurally diverse array (kojic amine, 5-aminovaleric acid, GABA, nipecotic acid, andcis-4-aminocrotonic acid) of competitive ligands. These results raise the possibility that other GABA transporters might rely analogously upon conserved cysteine residues positioned within the amphipathic helix 8 and loop 8–9 regions. gab permease (GabP) is the exclusive mediator of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) transport across theEscherichia coli plasma membrane.

Recent evidence indicates that a “consensus amphipathic region” (or CAR) within transmembrane helix 8 and/or the adjoining cytoplasmic loop (loop 8–9) could play a significant role in the recognition and/or the translocation of these ligands. The association of functionality with the CAR prompts consideration that this domain might play a role in the mechanism of many transporters from the APC superfamily. amine-polyamine-choline transporter superfamily γ-aminobutyric acid or 4-aminobutyrate isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside consensus amphipathic region mouse-cationic-amino acid-transporters sensitive polar surface. amine-polyamine-choline transporter superfamily γ-aminobutyric acid or 4-aminobutyrate isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside consensus amphipathic region mouse-cationic-amino acid-transporters sensitive polar surface. The amphipathic nature of the CAR makes it structurally appropriate to form an interface between incompatible surfaces, such as between the lipid bilayer and a hydrophilic transport conduit. Consistent with such a function, the CAR is known to influence the catalytic properties of both the mouse cationic amino acid transport (MCAT) proteins and the GabP (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem.

To investigate the possibility that discrete elements within the CAR have a significant role in determining transport specificity, we have focused on Cys-300 of the E. coli GabP, a “signature cysteine” found in the CAR of GABA transporters but not other members of the APC superfamily.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) as implemented commercially by Bio-Rad. Single-stranded phagemid DNA (from pSCK-GP8 or pSCK-GP9) containing uracil was produced from the E. coli strain, CJ236 (obtained from Bio-Rad), infected with the kanamycin-resistant helper phage, VCSM13 (obtained from Stratagene). All mutations were verified by complete sequencing of gabP. The fully sequencedgabP inserts were subcloned into the expression vectors pSCK-380Z. LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1% NaCl) was used to grow bacterial cells. Antibiotic supplements (ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 40 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 40 μg/ml) were added as appropriate for different constructs. For transport experiments, cells grown overnight (16 h) were diluted 100-fold into fresh medium containing 1 mmIPTG (to induce gabP expression from the plasmid) (for SK35) or diluted into medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 0.2% ammonium sulfate (to cause catabolite repression of chromosomal genes in CC118), and 1 mm IPTG. The cells were harvested in logarithmic phase after about 4 h of growth at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Cells were harvested in logarithmic growth and washed twice with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The cell pellet was resuspended in this buffer such that theA600 was 6–7. Transport reactions were initiated by adding 90 μl of washed cells with rapid vortex mixing to 10 μl of solution containing 100 μm[3H]GABA (3 μCi/ml). Uptake was rapidly quenched by adding 1 ml of a “stop solution” (buffer containing 20 mm HgCl2) to the rapidly mixing reaction vessel. The “quenched” reaction was vacuum-filtered. The reaction vessel was then rinsed with 1 ml of “wash buffer” (buffer containing 5 mm HgCl2). Finally, the filter was rinsed with 4 ml of wash buffer. The filter was dissolved in scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity (disintegrations/min) was calculated by a Beckman LS3801 scintillation spectrometer using stored quench curves and automatic quench compensation (H number determination). 1.5 ml of twice washed cells were incubated with 30 mm sodium azide at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 4 °C and resuspended in 30 μl of the same composition as supernatant (control) or with 10 mm GABA to preload the cells. Counterflow was initiated by diluting 5 μl of preloaded cells into 1 ml of solution containing 10 μm [3H]GABA (0.25 μCi/ml). The reaction was quenched at timed intervals and filtered as described above. The results were expressed as “GABA uptake ratio,” which is the [3H]GABA uptake achieved by preloaded or non-preloadedgabP-positive strains divided by the equilibrium uptake achieved by the gabP-negative SK45 strain. Twice washed cells were poisoned with 30 mm sodium azide and loaded with 10 mm[3H]GABA (40 μCi/ml) at room temperature for 4 h. Efflux was initiated by diluting preloaded cells (5 μl) 400-fold into 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 30 mm NaN3. Exchange was initiated by diluting preloaded cells 200-fold into 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm GABA and 30 mmNaN3. The reactions were rapidly quenched by adding 1 ml of an ice-cold stop solution. The quenched samples were vacuum-filtered and processed for scintillation counting as described above. Transporters were expressed as GabP-LacZ hybrid proteins so that the β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity, assayed by the method of Miller (7Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 398-404Google Scholar), could be used to assess whether defective transport proteins were expressed at levels comparable with the wild type. Hybrid formation has no statistically significant effect on the GABA transport activity of GabP (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments show that the CAR of all knowngab permeases (i.e. from E. coli,Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) contains a signature cysteine that is not found at this position in the CAR of other APC superfamily members (Fig.1). To probe the functional significance of these conserved cysteine residues, we have studied the role of all five cysteines in the E. coli GabP. GabP tolerates loss of cysteine residues at four (158, 251, 291, and 443) out of five positions, where 50% of wild type activity was observed following site-directed replacement with Ala and somewhat less with Ser (Fig.2 A). In contrast, a dramatic loss of transport activity was observed when Cys-300 was replaced by Ser (Fig. 2 A), and similar results (i.e.indistinguishable from GabP-negative) were obtained when Cys-300 was replaced with Gly, Lys, Asp, Tyr, or Pro (not shown). Alanine was the best substituent for Cys-300, yielding a residual activity that was perhaps 5% percent of wild type (Fig. 2 A). Beginning with the C300A mutant, we found that without further loss of activity a Cys-less GabP (i.e. pSCK-GP9) could be constructed by replacing the remaining four cysteine residues at positions 158, 251, 291, and 443 with Ala. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of the Cys-less GabP (Fig. 2 B) showed that restoring the signature cysteine at position 300 also restored transport activity (>50% of wild type), whereas restoring a single cysteine at either position 158, 251, 291, or 443 did not (Fig. 2 B). Does loss of Cys-300 impact energy coupling or the kinetics of GABA translocation? Whereas [3H]GABA transport catalyzed by the wild type GabP is measured on the time scale of seconds (Fig.3 A), transport catalyzed by the Cys-less GabP mutant occurs over tens of minutes (Fig.3 B). A similar transport defect is fully evident in the C300A point mutant, which is likewise slow, requiring many tens of minutes to approach steady state (not shown). These results indicate that loss of Cys-300 slows the kinetics of one or more steps in the GabP cycle but does not abolish energy coupling per se. Transport kinetics are of paramount importance in real biological systems since “slow” acquisition of GABA (5% of the normal rate) under nitrogen-limited conditions would place the organism at a competitive disadvantage (accounts for evolutionary conservation of Cys-300). In nature, organisms losing Cys-300 would actually encounter far greater disadvantages because whereas the Ser substituent (completely defective) can be attained via a single missense mutation, the more functional Cys to Ala conversion requires two changes in codon 300. The translocation defect associated with loss of Cys-300 is also apparent when the membrane is de-energized. Efflux of [3H]GABA from azide-poisoned cells was rapidly catalyzed by either the wild type GabP or by the mutant with a single Cys at position 300 (C300). In contrast, efflux from cells expressing the Cys-less GabP was comparable with background leakage from the GabP-negative strain, SK45 (Fig.4 A). These results indicate that Cys-300 is the only cysteine that has a dramatic effect on the ability of GabP to catalyze rapid net translocation of substrate when poisoned cells are preloaded with [3H]GABA and diluted into GABA-free medium. Can the translocation defect be localized to a discrete portion of the transport cycle? Equilibrium exchange of [3H]GABA across the membrane of azide-poisoned cells was rapidly catalyzed by either the wild type GabP or by the mutant with a single cysteine at position 300 (Fig. 4 B). These experiments indicate that Cys-300 is the only cysteine that has a dramatic effect on the ability of GabP to catalyze rapid equilibrium exchange (no net flux) of cytoplasmic [3H]GABA for unlabeled GABA in the extracellular medium. Defects in GabP-mediated efflux (Fig. 4 A) and exchange (Fig.4 B) associated with loss of Cys-300 are also reflected in counterflow experiments (Fig. 5). In counterflow (8Rosenberg T. Wilbrandt W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1957; 41: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Franco P.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7379-7386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rising phase reflects the exchange rate (rapid for wild type GabP), whereas the falling phase reflects the rate of net efflux (likewise rapid for wild type GabP). The rising phase of counterflow catalyzed by the C300A point mutant was found: (a) to be markedly slower than wild type (indicating a severe exchange defect) and (b) to require preloading with unlabeled GABA. Like GabP C300A mutant, the Cys-less GabP exhibits a slow but significant counterflow activity that depends upon preloading (not shown). Counterflow cannot occur if net efflux is faster than exchange, and therefore these counterflow experiments involving Cys-less GabP or the C300A mutant (Fig. 5) indicate that both efflux and exchange are slow, confirming that loss of Cys-300 compromises net translocation via effects on the exchange partial reaction (Fig. 4). Is a defect in the substrate binding domain likely to account for poor exchange activity in GabP mutants lacking Cys-300? Although the rates of [3H]GABA uptake, efflux, and equilibrium exchange are all greatly diminished in mutants lacking the signature cysteine, there is strong evidence to indicate that loss of Cys-300 is not accompanied by denaturation of the ligand binding domain. The ligand binding site of Cys-less GabP is clearly intact since GABA as well as known inhibitors of the wild type GabP (2King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 3King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C.E. J.

Cys-300, the signature cysteine residue in theE. coli GabP, lies physically about midway through transmembrane helix 8 where the GabP SPS begins (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The GabP SPS is a functionally defined, 20-residue domain that extends out of helix 8 and into the adjoining cytoplasmic loop 8–9. The GabP SPS is in fact part of a larger amphipathic domain, the consensus amphipathic region or CAR, that is highly conserved (10Reizer J. Finley K. Kakuda D. MacLeod C.L. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within the APC superfamily (Fig.1). The first evidence to indicate that the CAR might be important came from “domain swaps” among kinetically distinguishable MCAT proteins (APC family members). These experiments showed that MCAT transport properties are conferred by a cassette from loop 8–9 and not by other substantial differences in the rest of the protein (5Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequences similar to this loop 8–9 cassette from the mammalian MCATs are “ … found overlapping the end of putative transmembrane domain VIII and the following hydrophilic region in all bacterial and fungal permeases [e.g. GabP] … ” (11Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the APC superfamily. The indicated region of homology overlap thus coincides physically with the functionally defined GabP SPS (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). That the homology (11Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) exactly overlaps functionality (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests a potential mechanistic relationship between the fully cytoplasmic MCAT cassette (loop 8–9) and the partially cytoplasmic GabP SPS that extends out of transmembrane segment VIII. What is the mechanistic significance of the SPS? While a complete answer to this question is not yet available, some insight is gleaned from analyzing how Cys-300 affects the elements of catalytic specificity, defined by the ratio,kcat/Km (12Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar). Our results show that neither the rank order of potency for competitive inhibitors nor the absolute affinity for the individual ligands is substantially affected by loss of Cys-300 (Fig. 6), reflecting that the signature cysteine has little role in mediating carrier-cosubstrate interactions in the ground state. In contrast, the rate of [3H]GABA translocation is greatly diminished when Cys-300 is removed (Fig. 4), suggesting that a rate-limiting step (i.e. a transition state) in the translocation reaction does depend upon Cys-300. To what extent might the present results and concepts be extended to othergab permeases, as well as to other transporters from the APC superfamily and perhaps beyond? The hazard in extrapolating from the properties ofE. coli GabP to other systems clearly increases as one moves away from discussing close GabP homologs and toward the discussion of more distant homologs or non-homologs. Nevertheless, a gathering together of information from homologous andanalogous systems may provide a useful framework for future progress in this area. Although the signature cysteines described here are restricted to GABA transporters, the kinetic significance of the CAR as a whole can be traced to distant APC homologs like the MCAT proteins, which lack these cysteines. Closs et al. (5Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that different MCAT subtypes exhibit kinetics that are determined exclusively by “ … a divergent stretch of 41 amino acids … ” that connect the eighth and ninth membrane-spanning domains. Likewise, GABA transporters from the nervous system also contain an amphipathic loop 8–9 segment. These CAR-like domains in mammalian GABA transporters arestructurally analogous to the GabP SPS (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in that (i) they are positioned directly opposite the extracellular loops that have been implicated as determinants of substrate selectivity (13Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), (ii) they exhibit amphipathic character (1Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), (iii) they contain a highly conserved Cys residue that aligns 2Alignments between the CAR and CAR-like regions of bacterial and mammalian GABA transporters can be criticized on grounds of “poor homology.” But this is to misunderstand both the definition (21Saier M.H. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 71-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of “homology” and our stated hypothesis which is that these amphipathic structures are analogous (nothomologous). Analogous structuresarise by evolutionary convergence from distinct primordial structures, whereas homologous structures divergefrom one and only one primordial structure. As a result,homologous protein structures are obliged to exhibit sequence similarity. In contrast, analogous protein structures need not exhibit any sequence similarity. Clearly, two independent protein segments can converge toward amphipathicity with only incidental primary sequence similarity. Moreover, gaps of 3 or 4 residues (instead of 1 or 2 residues) in these “incidental” or fortuitous sequence similarities can serve to enhance amphipathicity in the secondary structure, even though gaps “penalize” the sequence similarity score. In the “convergence scenario,” a high similarity score is not relevant per se since primary sequence similarity provides only one of many potential paths toward a functionally significant (evolutionarily selectable) amphipathicanalogy in the secondary structure. with the GabP signature cysteine (14King S.C. Blum K. Noble K.P. Handbook of Psychiatric Genetics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 163-198Google Scholar) and which may serve as the sensitive target for the subset of inhibitory sulfhydryl reagents that are able to gain access to the cytoplasm (15Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These characteristics are consistent with the notion that GABA transporters have a translocation pathway guarded symmetrically on either side of the membrane by functionally significant loops. Other transporters may also have cytoplasmic loop domains that affect translocation (16Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol.

The foregoing inter-relationships are consistent with the notion that nature may have created analogous structures and mechanisms via evolutionary convergence from distinct ancestral genes (21Saier M.H. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in order to meet common exigencies associated with controlling transmembrane solute distribution. Wright et al. (22Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W2138254650,"We have used a sensitive bioassay of calcium-mediated volume changes in mammalian absorptive intestinal epithelial cells to screen extracts of the skin of the amphibian<i>Xenopus laevis</i> for the presence of factors affecting ion transport. A 66-residue peptide, purified using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography techniques, caused isotonic volume reduction of guinea pig jejunal villus cells in suspension. This volume reduction required extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was prevented by the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker niguldipine. Structural analysis demonstrated the presence of eight cysteines and a primary structure homologous to that of the neurotoxin/cytotoxin family found in the venom of certain poisonous snakes. The structure of the peptide was identical to that of xenoxin-1 purified from dorsal gland secretions of <i>X. laevis</i> (Kolbe, M., Huber A., Cordier, P., Rasmussen, U., Bouchon, B., Jaquinod, M., Blasak, R., Detot, E., and Kreil, G. (1993) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 268, 16458–16464). Xenoxin-1 (10 nm) caused volume changes that required extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and were comparable in magnitude and direction to changes caused by BayK-8644 (100 nm), a dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>channel agonist. The initial rate of dihydropyridine-sensitive<sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was substantially increased by xenoxin-1. Staurosporine (10 nm) prevented volume changes caused by ATP (250 μm) but had no effect on volume changes caused by BayK-8644 or xenoxin-1. We conclude that xenoxin-1 directly activated dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in villus cells and that a mammalian homologue to xenoxin-1 may exist."
