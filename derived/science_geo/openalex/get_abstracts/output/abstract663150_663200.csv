https://openalex.org/W3104612611,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, their use in medical computer vision tasks faces several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations through application to the pandemic-caused need for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution highlights significant benefits obtained through (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance over individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages for validating results; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; and, (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We find that ensemble approaches markedly improved classification and localization performance, and that inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helps guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs."
https://openalex.org/W3100301707,"Background Empirical data on conditions that increase risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression are needed to identify high risk individuals. We performed a comprehensive quantitative assessment of pre-existing clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization. Methods Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients from an integrated health system (Geisinger) with system-level outpatient/inpatient COVID-19 testing capacity and retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data to assess pre-COVID-19 pandemic clinical phenotypes associated with hospital admission (hospitalization). Results Of 12,971 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with sufficient pre-COVID-19 pandemic EHR data at Geisinger, 1604 were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 354 required hospitalization. We identified 21 clinical phenotypes in 5 disease categories meeting phenome-wide significance (P&lt;1.60x10 -4 ), including: six kidney phenotypes, e.g. end stage renal disease or stage 5 CKD (OR = 11.07, p = 1.96x10 -8 ), six cardiovascular phenotypes, e.g. congestive heart failure (OR = 3.8, p = 3.24x10 -5 ), five respiratory phenotypes, e.g. chronic airway obstruction (OR = 2.54, p = 3.71x10 -5 ), and three metabolic phenotypes, e.g. type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.80, p = 7.51x10 -5 ). Additional analyses defining CKD based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, confirmed high risk of hospitalization associated with pre-existing stage 4 CKD (OR 2.90, 95% CI: 1.47, 5.74), stage 5 CKD/dialysis (OR 8.83, 95% CI: 2.76, 28.27), and kidney transplant (OR 14.98, 95% CI: 2.77, 80.8) but not stage 3 CKD (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.48). Conclusions This study provides quantitative estimates of the contribution of pre-existing clinical phenotypes to COVID-19 hospitalization and highlights kidney disorders as the strongest factors associated with hospitalization in an integrated US healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W3099763054,"The present study investigates if the total replacement of dietary fishmeal (FM) with poultry by-product meal (PBM), supplemented with methionine influences the muscle fatty acids composition, normal gut morphology, histological traits of the liver, muscle, and gill, liver enzymes, immune and antioxidant response, and stress-related gene in juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer in relation to growth and feed utilization. Barramundi (3.58±0.01g) were randomly distributed into six 300 L seawater recirculating tanks (25 fish/tank) and fed two formulated isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets for 6 weeks. The control diet had FM as the sole animal protein source, whereas other test diet had only PBM as an animal protein source. Dietary PBM affected the fish performance and feed utilization. Regarding muscle fatty acid profile, total saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids elevated while total PUFA particularly n-3 LC-PUFA and EPA decreased in PBM fed fish than control diet fed fish. Liver, muscle, gill, and intestinal histology showed no obvious alteration in control diet fed fish, however, more lipid droplets and hepatic vacuolization in the liver, necrotic myotome in muscle, hyperplasia in secondary lamellae in gill and short and broken folds in the intestine were observed in PBM fed fish. Similar to light microscopy observation of intestinal morphology, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed shorter and smaller microvilli in fish fed PBM. Histopathological alterations in the liver of PBM fed fish were further associated with the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and the significant upregulation of stress-related genes, HSP70 and HSP90. Also, a negative influence on lysozyme activity, and antioxidant enzymatic activities were recorded in fish fed PBM. Overall, it can be concluded that a total substitution of FM protein by methionine supplemented PBM negatively influenced the growth performance, liver health, histological traits of different organs, immune and antioxidant response, and expression of stress-related genes in juvenile barramundi."
https://openalex.org/W3104595578,"Introduction Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17 March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. Methods 95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37 ± 11 years, 176 ± 8 cm, 71 ± 12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0–10 visual analogic scale (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an improved well-being (WB+, increase &gt;2 in VAS score) and those who did not (WB-) during CFN. Results Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB+ and 76 WB-. There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD was correlated to VAS. Conclusion Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress, change on physical activity…) beyond the scope of the present study. However, these results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3105121197,"Cryptography is commonly used to secure communication and data transmission over insecure networks through the use of cryptosystems. A cryptosystem is a set of cryptographic algorithms offering security facilities for maintaining more cover-ups. A substitution-box (S-box) is the lone component in a cryptosystem that gives rise to a nonlinear mapping between inputs and outputs, thus providing confusion in data. An S-box that possesses high nonlinearity and low linear and differential probability is considered cryptographically secure. In this study, a new technique is presented to construct cryptographically strong 8×8 S-boxes by applying an adjacency matrix on the Galois field GF (2 8 ). The adjacency matrix is obtained corresponding to the coset diagram for the action of modular group <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math> on a projective line PL ( F 7 ) over a finite field F 7 . The strength of the proposed S-boxes is examined by common S-box tests, which validate their cryptographic strength. Moreover, we use the majority logic criterion to establish an image encryption application for the proposed S-boxes. The encryption results reveal the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed S-box design in image encryption applications."
https://openalex.org/W3100197573,"The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) plays a critical role in different components of anti-tumor immunity. However, the specific role of EZH2 in modulating MHC Class I antigen presentation and T cell infiltration have not been investigated in HCC. This study analyzed the expression and clinical significance of EZH2 in HCC. The EZH2 genetic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. The EZH2 mRNA and protein levels were found to be significantly higher in HCC than in adjacent normal liver tissues in multiple datasets from the GEO and TCGA databases. High expression of EZH2 was significantly correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, progression-free survival, and relapse-free survival in almost all patients with HCC. The gene set variance analysis (GSVA) showed that the expression of EZH2 is positively correlated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and negatively correlated with major MHC class I antigen presentation molecules. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that high EZH2 expression is positively associated with the MYC and glycolysis signaling pathway and negatively associated with the interferon-gamma signaling pathway in HCC tissues. These findings demonstrate that EZH2 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3102512821,"Image encryption is an effective method for protecting private images during communication. In this paper, a novel image encryption method is proposed based on a 5D hyperchaotic system. Since a 5D hyperchaotic system can generate more complex dynamic behavior than a low-dimensional system, it is used in this paper to generate pseudorandom number sequences. The generated sequences are processed to obtain new sequences. The randomness of the new sequences is improved by recombination and rearrangement. The experimental results and theoretical analysis show that the method possesses a large key space and can resist differential attacks, statistical analysis, entropy analysis, clipping attacks and noise attacks. Therefore, it is very secure and can be used for secure communication."
https://openalex.org/W3100952479,"Neuronal activity within the physiologic range stimulates lactate production that, via metabolic pathways or operating through an array of G-protein-coupled receptors, regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission. The recent discovery that lactate exerts a tight control of ion channels, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic plasticity-related intracellular signaling cascades opens up the possibility that lactate regulates synaptic potentiation at central synapses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular lactate (1–2 mM) induces glutamatergic potentiation on the recurrent collateral synapses of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. This potentiation is independent of lactate transport and further metabolism, but requires activation of NMDA receptors, postsynaptic calcium accumulation, and activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor sensitive to cholera toxin. Furthermore, perfusion of 3,5- dihydroxybenzoic acid, a lactate receptor agonist, mimics this form of synaptic potentiation. The transduction mechanism underlying this novel form of synaptic plasticity requires G-protein βγ subunits, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase, PKC, and CaMKII. Activation of these signaling cascades is compartmentalized in a synapse-specific manner since lactate does not induce potentiation at the mossy fiber synapses of CA3 pyramidal cells. Consistent with this synapse-specific potentiation, lactate increases the output discharge of CA3 neurons when recurrent collaterals are repeatedly activated during lactate perfusion. This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms by which lactate, acting via a membrane receptor, contributes to the memory formation process."
https://openalex.org/W3098813933,"Background Institutional delivery is an important indicator in monitoring the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Despite the international focus on reducing maternal mortality, progress has been low, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with more than 295,000 mothers still dying during pregnancy and childbirth every year. Institutional delivery has been varied across and within the country. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the individual and community level determinants, and spatial distribution of institutional delivery in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was done based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total weighted sample of 11,022 women was included in this study. For spatial analysis, ArcGIS version 10.6 statistical software was used to explore the spatial distribution of institutional delivery, and SaTScan version 9.6 software was used to identify significant hotspot areas of institutional delivery. For the determinants, a multilevel binary logistic regression analysis was fitted to take to account the hierarchical nature of EDHS data. The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Proportional Change in Variance (PCV), and deviance (-2LL) were used for model comparison and for checking model fitness. Variables with p-values&lt;0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were fitted in the multivariable multilevel model. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were used to declare significant determinant of institutional delivery. Results The spatial analysis showed that the spatial distribution of institutional delivery was significantly varied across the country [global Moran’s I = 0.04 (p&lt;0.05)]. The SaTScan analysis identified significant hotspot areas of poor institutional delivery in Harari, south Oromia and most parts of Somali regions. In the multivariable multilevel analysis; having 2–4 births (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.34–0.68) and &gt;4 births (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.32–0.74), preceding birth interval ≥ 48 months (AOR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.03–2.20), being poorer (AOR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.10–2.30) and richest wealth status (AOR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.54–3.87), having primary education (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.16–1.87), secondary and higher education (AOR = 3.44; 95% CI: 2.19–5.42), having 1–3 ANC visits (AOR = 3.88; 95% CI: 2.77–5.43) and &gt;4 ANC visits (AOR = 6.53; 95% CI: 4.69–9.10) were significant individual-level determinants of institutional delivery while being living in Addis Ababa city (AOR = 3.13; 95% CI: 1.77–5.55), higher community media exposure (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.44–2.79) and being living in urban area (AOR = 4.70; 95% CI: 2.70–8.01) were significant community-level determinants of institutional delivery. Conclusions Institutional delivery was low in Ethiopia. The spatial distribution of institutional delivery was significantly varied across the country. Residence, region, maternal education, wealth status, ANC visit, preceding birth interval, and community media exposure were found to be significant determinants of institutional delivery. Therefore, public health interventions should be designed in the hotspot areas where institutional delivery was low to reduce maternal and newborn mortality by enhancing maternal education, ANC visit, and community media exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3100046282,"Background Kenya has a high prevalence of adolescent pregnancy and low access to and use of adolescent sexual reproductive health services. Despite the enactment of evidence-based policies to address this problem, adolescents continue to face health problems and barriers to adolescent sexual reproductive health information and services. Main objective This study describes barriers to and facilitators of access to adolescent sexual and reproductive health services in Kisumu and Kakamega counties, Kenya. Methodology We used a qualitative design. Through 61 data collection sessions, 113 participants were engaged in key informant interviews, in-depth interviews, and/or focus group discussions. Trained Research Assistants (RAs) engaged adolescents, health care workers, teachers, county leaders, and community representatives. Data were captured using audio recorders and field notes. Socio-demographic data were analyzed for descriptive statistics, while audio recordings were transcribed, translated, and coded. Thematic analysis was done with NVivo. Results Findings show that the barriers of access to sexual reproductive health services and information were negative health workers’ attitudes, distance to the health facility, unaffordable cost of services, negative social cultural influences, lack of privacy and confidentiality. Facilitators to adolescent sexual reproductive health services were few and included getting priority for school going adolescents and enabling environment for partnerships on adolescent health issues. Conclusions Adolescents in Kakamega and Kisumu face a myriad of barriers when seeking sexual reproductive health information and/or health services. We recommend that counties sensitize all stakeholders on adolescent sexual reproductive health problems, and support development of multi-sectoral, sustainable solutions to adolescent health needs."
https://openalex.org/W3099627492,"The triple burden of malnutrition is an incessant issue in low- and middle-income countries, and fish has the potential to mitigate this burden. In Ghana fish is a central part of the diet, but data on nutrients and contaminants in processed indigenous fish species, that are often eaten whole, are missing. Samples of smoked, dried or salted Engraulis encrasicolus (European anchovy), Brachydeuterus auritus (bigeye grunt), Sardinella aurita (round sardinella), Selene dorsalis (African moonfish), Sierrathrissa leonensis (West African (WA) pygmy herring) and Tilapia spp . (tilapia) were collected from five different regions in Ghana. Samples were analyzed for nutrients (crude protein, fat, fatty acids, several vitamins, minerals, and trace elements), microbiological quality (microbial loads of total colony counts, E . coli , coliforms, and Salmonella), and contaminants (PAH4 and heavy metals). Except for tilapia, the processed small fish species had the potential to significantly contribute to the nutrient intakes of vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. High levels of iron, mercury and lead were detected in certain fish samples, which calls for further research and identification of anthropogenic sources along the value chains. The total cell counts in all samples were acceptable; Salmonella was not detected in any sample and E . coli only in one sample. However, high numbers of coliform bacteria were found. PAH4 in smoked samples reached high concentrations up to 1,300 μg/kg, but in contrast salted tilapia samples had a range of PAH4 concentration of 1 μg/kg to 24 μg/kg. This endpoint oriented study provides data for the nutritional value of small processed fish as food in Ghana and also provides information about potential food safety hazards. Future research is needed to determine potential sources of contamination along the value chains in different regions, identify critical points, and develop applicable mitigation strategies to improve the quality and safety of processed small fish in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3102324109,"Background Although proximal gastrectomy (PG) is a recognized surgical procedure for early proximal gastric cancer, total gastrectomy (TG) is sometimes selected due to concern about severe gastroesophageal reflux. Esophagogastrostomy by the double-flap technique (DFT) is an anti-reflux reconstruction after PG, and its short-term effectiveness has been reported. However, little is known about the long-term effects on nutritional status and quality of life (QOL). Methods Gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted PG (LAPG) with DFT or laparoscopy-assisted TG (LATG) between April 2011 and March 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were reviewed to assess nutritional status, and the Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale (PGSAS)-45 was used to assess QOL. Results A total of 36 patients (LATG: 17, LAPG: 19) were enrolled. Four of 17 LATG patients (24%) were diagnosed with Stage ≥II after surgery, and half received S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. BW and PNI were better maintained in LAPG than in LATG patients until 1-year follow-up. Seven of 16 LATG patients (44%) were categorized as “underweight (BMI&lt;18.5 kg/m 2 )” at 1-year follow-up, compared to three of 18 LAPG patients (17%; p = 0.0836). The PGSAS-45 showed no significant difference in all QOL categories except for decreased BW ( p = 0.0132). Multivariate analysis showed that LATG was the only potential risk factor for severe BW loss (odds ratio: 3.03, p = 0.0722). Conclusions LAPG with DFT was superior to LATG in postoperative nutritional maintenance, and can be the first option for early proximal gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3104044080,"Introduction The ever-changing market of new psychoactive substances (NPS) poses challenges for laboratories worldwide. Analytical toxicologists are constantly working to keep high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) screening libraries updated for NPS. This study sought to use the online crowd-sourced HighResNPS database for spectrum comparison screening, thereby broadening its utility to all HR-MS instruments. Method HighResNPS allows formation of a set of consensus fragment ions for a NPS and prioritises among multiple entries of collision-induced fragment ions. A subset of 42 NPS samples was analysed in data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) modes on two different instruments. HighResNPS-computed spectra were generated with either Absolute (all fragment ions set to 100%) or Fractional (50% intensity reduction of former fragment ion) intensity. The acquired NPS data were analysed using the consensus library with computed ion intensities and evaluated with vendor-neutral screening software. Results Overall, of the 42 samples, 100% were identified, with 88% identified as the top candidate. Three samples had the correct candidate proposed as the second highest ranking NPS. In all three of those samples, the top proposed candidate was a positional isomer or closely related compound. Absolute intensity assignment provided identical scoring between the top two proposed compounds in two samples with DIA. DDA had a slightly higher identification rate in the spectra comparison screening with fractional intensity assignment, but no major differences were observed. Conclusion The fractional intensity assignment was slightly more advantageous than the absolute assignment. It was selective between proposed candidates, showed a high identification rate and had an overall higher fragmentation scoring. The candidates proposed by the HighResNPS library spectra comparison simplify the determination of NPS for researchers and toxicologists. The database provides free monthly updates of consensus spectra, thereby enabling laboratories to stay at the forefront of NPS screening by LC-HR-MS with spectra screening software."
https://openalex.org/W3099142500,"Purpose Cardiomyocyte organization and performance underlie cardiac function, but the in vivo mobility of these cells during contraction and filling remains difficult to probe. Herein, a novel trigger delay (TD) scout sequence was used to acquire high in-plane resolution (1.6 mm) Spin-Echo (SE) cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) at three distinct cardiac phases. The objective was to characterize cardiomyocyte organization and mobility throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods Nine healthy volunteers were imaged with cDTI at three distinct cardiac phases (early systole, late systole, and diastasis). The sequence used a free-breathing Spin-Echo (SE) cDTI protocol (b-values = 350s/mm 2 , twelve diffusion encoding directions, eight repetitions) to acquire high-resolution images (1.6x1.6x8mm 3 ) at 3T in ~7 minutes/cardiac phase. Helix Angle (HA), Helix Angle Range (HAR), E2 angle (E2A), Transverse Angle (TA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), diffusion tensor eigenvalues (λ 1-2-3 ), and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in the left ventricle (LV) were characterized. Results Images from the patient-specific TD scout sequence demonstrated that SE cDTI acquisition was possible at early systole, late systole, and diastasis in 78%, 100% and 67% of the cases, respectively. At the mid-ventricular level, mobility (reported as median [IQR]) was observed in HAR between early systole and late systole (76.9 [72.6, 80.5]° vs 96.6 [85.9, 100.3]°, p&lt;0.001). E2A also changed significantly between early systole, late systole, and diastasis (27.7 [20.8, 35.1]° vs 45.2 [42.1, 49]° vs 20.7 [16.6, 26.4]°, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion We demonstrate that it is possible to probe cardiomyocyte mobility using multi-phase and high resolution cDTI. In healthy volunteers, aggregate cardiomyocytes re-orient themselves more longitudinally during contraction, while cardiomyocyte sheetlets tilt radially during wall thickening. These observations provide new insights into the three-dimensional mobility of myocardial microstructure during systolic contraction."
https://openalex.org/W3106358934,"Background Latrine utilization is the actual behavior in a practice of regularly using existing latrines for safe disposal of excreta. Latrine utilization is a common problem in semi-urban areas of developing countries, including Ethiopia. Since the status of latrine utilization and associated factors among semi-urban areas of northeastern Ethiopia, including Alansha in South Wollo Zone is unknown, local data is needed in order to assess the need for planning of intervention programs for the improvement of latrine utilization to support consistent and sustained latrine utilization. This study is designed to address this knowledge gap. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March, 2019 among 401 systematically selected households. Data were collected by trained workers using a pre-tested, structured questionnaire via face-to-face interviews and on-the-spot observations of the latrines. A systematic random sampling method was used to select participant households. Data were entered using EpiData version 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The wealth index status of participants was estimated using principal component analysis. Data were analyzed using a binary logistic regression model at 95% confidence interval (CI). From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with p- value &lt; 0.05 were taken as statistically significant and independently associated with latrine utilization. Model fitness was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Result We found that the prevalence of latrine utilization among households was 71.8% (95% CI [67.5–76.1%]) while 28.2% (95% CI [23.9–32.5%]) did not utilize latrines. About one-fifth (21.7%) of participant households were found to have a pit latrine with slab and 78.3% (311) used pit latrines without slab. The hygienic condition of the majority (82.9%) of the latrines was dirty and only 17.1% clean. Household family size from one to three persons (AOR: 3.99, 95% CI [1.20–6.24]), presence of primary or secondary school student in a house (AOR: 2.33, 95% CI [1.42–3.83]), number of years since latrine was constructed (≥ 2 years) (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI [1.12–2.95]) and a frequency of daily cleaning of the latrine (AOR: 2.19, 95% CI [1.12–4.28]) were factors significantly associated with latrine utilization. Conclusion Seven out of ten households utilized a latrine. Factors significantly associated with latrine utilization were household family size from one to three persons, presence of primary or secondary school student in the house, time since household latrine had been constructed of two or more years and daily frequency of latrine cleaning. Therefore, it is recommended that measures to promote behavioral change towards further improvement in sustainable and consistent latrine utilization should be carried out based on the evidence of the determinant factors found in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3098934820,"Background Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is comprised of lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and enlarged perivascular space (EPVS). We investigated the cumulative effect of SVD on 3-month functional outcome following ischemic stroke using the total SVD score. Methods The total SVD score of 477 acute ischemic stroke patients with adequate brain MRI was analyzed. We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to investigate the independent impact of total SVD score on ordinal modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3-month after ischemic stroke. Results Mean age was 66±14 years, and 61% were men. The distribution of the total SVD score from 0 to 4 was 27%, 24%, 26%, 16%, and 7%, respectively. The proportion of mRS scores 2 or greater was 16% and 47% in total SVD score 0 and 4, respectively. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis results showed that compared with the total SVD score of 0, total SVD scores of 2, 3, and 4 were independently associated with higher mRS scores with adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.68 (1.02–2.76), 2.24 (1.25–4.00), and 2.00 (1.02–4.29). Lacunes, CMBs, WMHs but not EPVS were associated with mRS scores at 3 months. However, the impact of each SVD marker on stroke outcome was smaller than that of the total SVD score. Conclusion We found an independent association between total SVD scores and functional outcome at 3 months following ischemic stroke. The total SVD score may be useful for stratification of patients who are at a high-risk of unfavorable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3105582718,"Although current malaria therapies inhibit pathways encoded in the parasite's genome, we have looked for anti-malaria drugs that can target an erythrocyte component because development of drug resistance might be suppressed if the parasite cannot mutate the drug's target. In search for such erythrocyte targets, we noted that human erythrocytes express tyrosine kinases, whereas the Plasmodium falciparum genome encodes no obvious tyrosine kinases. We therefore screened a library of tyrosine kinase inhibitors from Eli Lilly and Co. in a search for inhibitors with possible antimalarial activity. We report that although most tyrosine kinase inhibitors exerted no effect on parasite survival, a subset of tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed potent anti-malarial activity. Moreover, all inhibitors found to block tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 specifically suppressed P. falciparum survival at the parasite egress stage of its intra-erythrocyte life cycle. Conversely, tyrosine kinase inhibitors that failed to block band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation but still terminated the parasitemia were observed to halt parasite proliferation at other stages of the parasite's life cycle. Taken together these results suggest that certain erythrocyte tyrosine kinases may be important to P. falciparum maturation and that inhibitors that block these kinases may contribute to novel therapies for P. falciparum malaria."
https://openalex.org/W3099562091,"Background Community attitude towards mental health problems and help-seeking behavior plays a major role in designing effective community based mental health interventions. This study aimed to assess the attitude, help-seeking behavior, and associated factors of the Jimma zone community towards mental health and mental health problems.

A respondent from each of the 423 systematically selected households was interviewed using a pretested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. Accordingly, a community’s attitude towards mental health problems was measured by the adapted version of the “Community Attitude towards Mentally Ill questionnaire (CAMI)” and help-seeking behavior was measured by a general help-seeking questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23.0 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the independent predictors of the outcome variable. Results Among the total 420 study participants (197,46.9%) of them had an overall unfavorable attitude towards mental illness. The majority (153,36.4%) of the study participants agreed on avoidance of anyone who has mental health problems and (150,35.7%) participants described marrying a person with a mental health problem or recovered from the problem is foolishness. Moreover, regression analysis showed family monthly income (AOR = 0.24, 95%CI:0.06–0.91) and occupational status (AOR = 0.57, 95%CI:0.34–0.96) were found to be the predictors of community attitude towards mental health problems. The study finding also revealed a significant number of the respondents preferred non- medical treatment approaches. Conclusion Almost half of the respondents had an unfavorable attitude towards mental health problems and the traditional and religious help-seeking intention was high. This suggests the need for designing effective community based mental health interventions to improve the general public attitude and help-seeking behavior towards mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W3102913342,"Background Adolescents tend to experience heightened vulnerability to risky and reckless behavior. Adolescents living in rural settings may often experience poverty and a host of risk factors which can increase their vulnerability to various forms of health risk behavior (HRB). Understanding HRB clustering and its underlying factors among adolescents is important for intervention planning and health promotion. This study examines the co-occurrence of injury and violence, substance use, hygiene, physical activity, and diet-related risk behaviors among adolescents in a rural setting on the Kenyan coast. Specifically, the study objectives were to identify clusters of HRB; based on five categories of health risk behavior, and to identify the factors associated with HRB clustering. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted of a random sample of 1060 adolescents aged 13–19 years living within the area covered by the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Participants completed a questionnaire on health behaviors which was administered via an Audio Computer-Assisted Self–Interview. Latent class analysis on 13 behavioral factors (injury and violence, hygiene, alcohol tobacco and drug use, physical activity, and dietary related behavior) was used to identify clustering and stepwise ordinal logistic regression with nonparametric bootstrapping identified the factors associated with clustering. The variables of age, sex, education level, school attendance, mental health, form of residence and level of parental monitoring were included in the initial stepwise regression model. Results We identified 3 behavioral clusters (Cluster 1: Low-risk takers (22 . 9%); Cluster 2: Moderate risk-takers (67 . 8%); Cluster 3: High risk-takers (9 . 3%) ). Relative to the cluster 1, membership of higher risk clusters (i.e. moderate or high risk-takers) was strongly associated with older age (p&lt;0.001), being male (p&lt;0.001), depressive symptoms (p = 0.005), school non-attendance (p = 0.001) and a low level of parental monitoring (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion There is clustering of health risk behaviors that underlies communicable and non-communicable diseases among adolescents in rural coastal Kenya. This suggests the urgent need for targeted multi-component health behavior interventions that simultaneously address all aspects of adolescent health and well-being, including the mental health needs of adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3106421945,"Bears are omnivores particularly well-adapted to variations in the nutritional composition, quality and availability of food resources. Artificial feeding practices have been shown to strongly influence diet composition and seasonality, as well as to cause alterations in wintering and movement in brown bears ( Ursus arctos ). In this study, we investigated seasonal differences (hypophagia vs hyperphagia) in food quality of two brown bear subpopulations in the Polish Carpathians using faecal nitrogen (FN) and carbon (FC) estimates. The subpopulations inhabit areas that differ in artificial feeding practices: no artificial feeding occurs in the western subpopulation (Tatra Mountains), while artificial food targeted to ungulates is provided and used year-round in the eastern subpopulation (Bieszczady Mountains). We also compared these results with faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) to explore how FN and FC correlate with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and if the seasonal patterns are apparent. We found that in Tatra Mts bears fed on significantly higher quality diet, as shown by FN and FC values, and had significantly higher FC levels in hyperphagia, when they accumulate fat reserves for wintering. The pattern in FCM levels for Tatra subpopulation followed the changes in energy intake during the seasons of hypo- and hyperphagia, while in Bieszczady Mts, the area with intensive feeding, no seasonal patterns could be observed. Artificial feeding practices may disrupt nutrient phenology and seasonality, relative to subpopulations with natural diets. We showed that the availability of human-provided foods may alter not only the overall dietary quality, but also hormonal patterns linked to seasonal nutritional requirements. Combining FN, FC and FCM proved to be a useful tool for reconstructing diet quality and related physiological patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3100188676,"Containment measures have been applied in several countries in order to limit the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The scope of this study is to analyze the evolution of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic throughout Italy and factors associated to the different way it spread in the Italian Regions, starting from the day that the first indigenous cases were detected through day 81 (6 days after the end of the strict lockdown). Data were obtained from daily reports and are represented as number (and percentage) of cases/100,000 persons. A lockdown with movement restrictions, especially across Regions, was declared at day 20. At day 81, 219,070 cases (363/100,000 persons) were diagnosed. A regression analysis based on the Gompertz model predicts a total number 233,606 cases (386/100,000 persons) at the end of the epidemic. The 21 areas, divided into Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, showed a wide range in the frequency of cases at day 81 (58–921, median 258/100,000 persons) and total predicted cases (58–946, median 267/100,000 persons). Similarly, the predicted time for the end of the wave of the epidemic (considering as surrogate marker the time at which 99% of the total cases are predicted to occur) was highly variable, ranging from 64 to 136 (median 99) days. We analyzed the impact of local and interventional variables on the epidemic curve in each Region. The number of cases correlated inversely with the distance from the area in which first cases were detected and directly also with the gross domestic product pro capite (as a marker of industrial activity) of the Region. Moreover, an earlier start of the lockdown (i.e. in the presence of a lower number of cases) and wider testing were associated with a lower final number of total cases. In conclusion, this analysis shows that population-wide testing and early lockdown enforcement appear effective in limiting the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3101466381,"Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). VDZ selectively binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks trafficking of a specific subset of gastrointestinal-homing T-lymphocytes to inflamed tissue. Although VDZ has shown promising results in numerous clinical studies a subgroup of patients do not respond adequately. Mechanistic insights and prognostic biomarkers able to predict which patients might benefit from VDZ therapy are currently lacking. Circulating exosomes were isolated from serum of blood donors and VDZ-treated patients by polymer-based precipitation. The surface expression of α4β7 integrin was evaluated by flow cytometry and the levels of exosome-bound VDZ were investigated by Promonitor-VDZ ELISA kit. The capacity of exosomes to interfere with the adhesion of VDZ-treated CD4+ T cells was assessed by adhesion assay. In this study, we showed that serum exosomes isolated from both blood donor and ulcerative colitis patients express on their surface the VDZ target α4β7 integrin. We observed an increased exosomal sequestration of VDZ in anti-TNF exposed patients compared to anti- TNFα naïve patients, according to a greater expression of α4β7 integrin on vesicles surface. Circulating exosomes could compete for VDZ binding with CD4+ T cells since we found that the amount of VDZ bound to T cells was impaired in the presence of exosomes. In addition, we demonstrated that exosomes bind VDZ, which consequently becomes unable to block MadCAM-1-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes. Circulating exosomes might contribute to drug sequestration, possibly affecting the therapeutic efficacy of VDZ in IBD patients. Our data suggest that previous biologic therapy may have altered the sequestration capacity of circulating exosomes, thus reducing the efficacy of VDZ in patients who failed anti-TNF agents."
https://openalex.org/W3102325597,"Introduction As of December 2019, pregnant women in the Netherlands are offered pertussis vaccination to protect their newborn infant against pertussis infection. However, the manner in which pregnant women decide about this maternal pertussis vaccination is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the decision-making process regarding maternal pertussis vaccination, and to explore the related needs among the vaccine-hesitant subgroup of orthodox Protestant women. Methods Charmaz’s grounded theory approach was used to develop a decision-making framework. To construct this framework we used an explorative multimethod approach in which in-depth interviews and online focus groups were supplemented by a literature search and research group meetings. This study was carried out in a hypothetical situation since the maternal pertussis vaccination had yet to be implemented in the Dutch immunisation programme at the time of the study. Results Twenty-five orthodox Protestant women participated in an interview, an online focus group, or in both. The findings of this study resulted in a decision-making framework that included three stages of decision-making; an Orientation stage, a value-based Deliberation stage, and Final decision stage. The Orientation stage included the needs for decision-making categorised into Information needs and Conversation needs. Women indicated that -if they were to receive sufficient time for Orientation and Deliberation- they would be able to reach the stage of Final decision. Conclusion The decision-making framework resulting from our findings can be used by health care professionals to provide women with information and consultation in the decision-making process. Future studies should investigate whether the stages of and needs for decision-making can be found across other vaccine-hesitant subgroups and vaccinations."
https://openalex.org/W3102717261,"In recent years, the health and economic effects of air pollution have attracted considerable attention, and health and insurance services have been closely related to residents’ welfare. However, there are few studies on the influence of pollution on household purchases of insurance. Using data from the 2013 and 2015 China Household Finance Surveys, this study investigates the effect of air pollution on insurance purchases using Logit and Poisson regression models. It is found that air pollution significantly increases the probability of household insurance purchases and the level of premium expenditure, although the impact of air pollution on insurance purchases shows a degree of heterogeneity. Health insurance is more sensitive to air pollution than life insurance and other types of insurance. In areas where NO 2 and O 3 are the main types of pollutants, air pollution has a greater impact on household insurance purchases."
https://openalex.org/W3101228803,"Choosing a comprehensive and cost-effective way of articulating and annotating the sentiment of a text is not a trivial task, particularly when dealing with short texts, in which sentiment can be expressed through a wide variety of linguistic and rhetorical phenomena. This problem is especially conspicuous in resource-limited settings and languages, where design options are restricted either in terms of manpower and financial means required to produce appropriate sentiment analysis resources, or in terms of available language tools, or both. In this paper, we present a versatile approach to addressing this issue, based on multiple interpretations of sentiment labels that encode information regarding the polarity, subjectivity, and ambiguity of a text, as well as the presence of sarcasm or a mixture of sentiments. We demonstrate its use on Serbian, a resource-limited language, via the creation of a main sentiment analysis dataset focused on movie comments, and two smaller datasets belonging to the movie and book domains. In addition to measuring the quality of the annotation process, we propose a novel metric to validate its cost-effectiveness. Finally, the practicality of our approach is further validated by training, evaluating, and determining the optimal configurations of several different kinds of machine-learning models on a range of sentiment classification tasks using the produced dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3103392581,"The IKZF1 gene, which encodes the Ikaros transcription factor, is frequently deleted or mutated in patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias that express oncogenes, like BCR-ABL, which activate the JAK-STAT5 pathway. Ikaros functionally antagonizes the transcriptional programs downstream of IL-7/STAT5 during B cell development, as well as STAT5 activity in leukemic cells. However, the mechanisms by which Ikaros interferes with STAT5 function is unknown. We studied the genomic distribution of Ikaros and STAT5 on chromatin in a murine pre-B cell line, and found that both proteins colocalize on &gt;60% of STAT5 target regions. Strikingly, Ikaros activity leads to widespread loss of STAT5 binding at most of its genomic targets within two hours of Ikaros induction, suggesting a direct mechanism. Ikaros did not alter the level of total or phosphorylated STAT5 proteins, nor did it associate with STAT5. Using sequences from the Cish , Socs2 and Bcl6 genes that Ikaros and STAT5 target, we show that both proteins bind overlapping sequences at GGAA motifs. Our results demonstrate that Ikaros antagonizes STAT5 DNA binding, in part by competing for common target sequences. Our study has implications for understanding the functions of Ikaros and STAT5 in B cell development and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3098845664,"Objective Decision aids (DAs) are useful in providing information for decision-making on using epidural anesthesia during birth. To date, there has been little development of DAs for Japanese pregnant women. Herein, we investigated the effect of a DA on the decision of pregnant women whether to have epidural anesthesia or not for labor during vaginal delivery. The primary outcome was changes in mean decision conflict score. Methods In this non-randomized controlled trial, 300 low-risk pregnant women in an urban hospital were recruited by purposive sampling and assigned to 2 groups: DA (intervention) and pamphlet (control) groups. Control enrollment was started first (until 150 women), followed by intervention enrollment (150 women). Pre-test and post-test scores were evaluated using the Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) for primary outcome, knowledge of epidural anesthesia and satisfaction with decision making for secondary outcomes, and decision of anesthesia usage (i.e., with epidural anesthesia, without epidural anesthesia, or undecided). Results Women in the DA group (n = 149: 1 excluded because she did not return post-test questionnaire) had significantly lower DCS score than those in the pamphlet group (n = 150) (DA: -8.41 [SD 8.79] vs. pamphlet: -1.69 [SD 5.91], p &lt; .001). Knowledge of epidural anesthesia and satisfaction with decision-making scores of women who used the DA were significantly higher than those of women who used the pamphlet (p &lt; .001). Women in the DA group showed a significantly lower undecided rate than those in the pamphlet group. The number of undecided women in the DA group significantly decreased from 30.2% to 6.1% (p &lt; .001), whereas that in the pamphlet group remained largely unchanged from 40.7% to 38.9%. Conclusion This study indicates that a DA can be useful in helping women make a decision whether to have epidural anesthesia or not for labor during vaginal delivery."

Methods One hundred and nineteen young male handball players (under-13 [U13; n = 82] and under-15 [U15; n = 37]). Tests included anthropometric measurements, countermovement jump (CMJ), triple leg-hop for distance, linear sprint test (5, 10 and 20 m), and a modified version of the 505 COD test. Results Results showed moderate to very large differences ( P &lt; 0.05) in age, predicted age at peak height velocity (APHV), distance from PHV (DPHV), height, and body mass between the age categories. Moreover, U15 players demonstrated higher performances in all jump tests and lower sprint times in 10- (ES = 0.84) and 20-m (ES = 0.51) and a higher 505 deficit (ES = 0.38) than the U13 players ( P &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed for the 505 COD test between groups (ES = 0.12; P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Our results suggest that during the transition from pre- to post-puberty, young handball players should focus on transferring their progressive improvements in strength, speed, and power capacities to COD performance."
https://openalex.org/W3103581556,"Electrochemical bioreactor systems have enjoyed significant attention in the past few decades, particularly because of their applications to biobatteries, artificial photosynthetic systems, and microbial electrosynthesis. A key opportunity with electrochemical bioreactors is the ability to employ cofactor regeneration strategies critical in oxidative and reductive enzymatic and cell-based biotransformations. Electrochemical cofactor regeneration presents several advantages over other current cofactor regeneration systems, such as chemoenzymatic multi-enzyme reactions, because there is no need for a sacrificial substrate and a recycling enzyme. Additionally, process monitoring is simpler and downstream processing is less costly. However, the direct electrochemical reduction of NAD(P) + on a cathode may produce adventitious side products, including isomers of NAD(P)H that can act as potent competitive inhibitors to NAD(P)H-requiring enzymes such as dehydrogenases. To overcome this limitation, we examined how nature addresses the adventitious formation of isomers of NAD(P)H. Specifically, renalases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of 1,2- and 1,6-NAD(P)H to NAD(P) + , yielding an effective recycling of unproductive NAD(P)H isomers. We designed several mutants of recombinant human renalase isoform 1 (rhRen1), expressed them in E . coli BL21(DE3) to enhance protein solubility, and evaluated the activity profiles of the renalase variants against NAD(P)H isomers. The potential for rhRen1 to be employed in engineering applications was then assessed in view of the enzyme’s stability upon immobilization. Finally, comparative modeling was performed to assess the underlying reasons for the enhanced solubility and activity of the mutant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3098190194,"The acrosome reaction (AR) is a strictly-regulated, synchronous exocytosis that is required for sperm to penetrate ova. This all-or-nothing process occurs only once in the sperm lifecycle through a sequence of signaling pathways. Spontaneous, premature AR therefore compromises fertilization potential. Although protein kinase A (PKA) pathways play a central role in AR across species, the signaling network used for AR induction is poorly understood in birds. Mechanistic studies of mammalian sperm AR demonstrate that PKA activity is downstreamly regulated by Src family kinases (SFKs). Using SFK inhibitors, our study shows that in chicken sperm, SFKs play a role in the regulation of PKA activity and spontaneous AR without affecting motility. Furthermore, we examined the nature of SFK phosphorylation using PKA and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, which demonstrated that unlike in mammals, SFK phosphorylation in birds does not occur downstream of PKA and is primarily regulated by calcium-dependent tyrosine phosphatase activity. Functional characterization of SFKs in chicken sperm showed that SFK activation modulates the membrane potential and plays a role in inhibiting spontaneous AR. Employing biochemical isolation, we also found that membrane rafts are involved in the regulation of SFK phosphorylation. This study demonstrates a unique mechanism for regulating AR induction inherent to avian sperm that ensure fertilization potential despite prolonged storage."
https://openalex.org/W3100551633,"Purpose To investigate the efficacy of botulinum toxin injection without electromyographic guidance for the treatment of consecutive esotropia. Methods A retrospective study was performed on 49 subjects with consecutive esotropia who received botulinum toxin injection in the medial rectus muscles without the use of electromyographic guidance. Treatment was considered successful if the final ocular alignment was orthotropic or esodeviation was ≤10 prism diopters (PD) during distant fixation. Results The mean age was 15.2 ± 8.3 years. The mean esodeviation before injection was 21.8 ± 9.1 PD at distance and 21.3 ± 8.3 PD at near. The mean number of injections per patient was 1.3 ± 0.7, and 46 patients (93.9%) received two or fewer injections. At 6 months after the final injection, the mean angle of esodeviation was 7.3 ± 6.0 PD at distance and 7.5 ± 6.6 PD at near (all p&lt;0.001), and 69.4% showed successful alignment. By multivariate analysis, an initial postoperative esodeviation of ≤18 PD at one month after exotropia surgery was considered to be a predictive factor for successful botulinum toxin injection ( P = 0.007). Vertical deviation and/or ptosis occurred in 4 patients (8.2%) at two weeks after injection, which all resolved within three months. There was no recurrence of exotropia up to the final follow-up examination. Conclusion Botulinum toxin injection without electromyographic guidance is safe and effective in the treatment of consecutive esotropia without causing recurrent exotropia. Successful botulinum toxin injection is likely in patients with an initial postoperative esodeviation of 18PD or less at one month after exotropia surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3101409883,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is characterized by expansion of myeloid cells in the liver and spleen, which leads to a severe splenomegaly associated with higher risk of mortality. This increased cellularity is thought to be a consequence of recruitment of cells to the viscera. We studied whether the local proliferation of splenic myeloid cells contributes to increased splenic cellularity. We found that a monocyte-like population of adherent splenic cells from Leishmania donovani -infected hamsters had enhanced replicative capacity ex vivo and in vivo (BrdU incorporation, p&lt;0.0001). In vitro assays demonstrated that proliferation was more pronounced in the proinflammatory M1 environment and that intracellular infection prevented proliferation. Secondary analysis of the published splenic transcriptome in the hamster model of progressive VL revealed a gene expression signature that included division of tumoral cells (Z = 2.0), cell cycle progression (Z = 2.3), hematopoiesis (Z = 2.8), proliferation of stem cells (Z = 2.5) and overexpression of proto-oncogenes. Regulators of myeloid cell proliferation were predicted in-silico (CSF2, TLR4, IFNG, IL-6, IL-4, RTK signaling, and STAT3). The in-silico prediction was confirmed with chemical inhibitors of PI3K/AKT, MAPK and STAT3 which decreased splenic myeloid cell division ex vivo . Hamsters infected with L . donovani treated with a STAT3 inhibitor had reduced in situ splenic myeloid proliferation (p = 0.03) and parasite burden. We conclude that monocyte-like myeloid cells have increased STAT3-dependent proliferation in the spleen of hamsters with visceral leishmaniasis and that inhibition of STAT3 reduces myeloid cell proliferation and parasite burden."

https://openalex.org/W3104969240,"miR-92a miRNAs are immune molecules that regulate apoptosis (programmed cell death) during the immune response. Apoptosis helps to maintain the dynamic balance in tissues of fish under hypoxia stress. The aim of this study was to explore the role and potential mechanisms of miR-92a in the liver of tilapia under hypoxia stress. We first confirmed that CaSR (encoding a calcium-sensing receptor) is a target gene of miR-92a in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) using luciferase reporter gene assays. In GIFT under hypoxia stress, miR-92a was up-regulated and CaSR was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner. Knocked-down CaSR expression led to inhibited expression of p53 , TP53INP1 , and caspase-3/8 , reduced the proportion of apoptotic hepatocytes, and decreased the activity of calcium ions induced by hypoxia in hepatocytes. GIFT injected in the tail vein with an miR-92a agomir showed up-regulation of miR-92a and down-regulation of CaSR , p53 , TP53INP1 , and caspase-3/8 genes in the liver, resulting in lower serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities under hypoxia stress. These findings suggest that stimulation of miR-92a interferes with hypoxia-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes of GIFT by targeting CaSR , thereby alleviating liver damage. These results provide new insights into the adaptation mechanisms of GIFT to hypoxia stress."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of OSA on brain tumor incidence based on the Korea National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) dataset. The KNHIS data between 2007 and 2014 were analyzed, and the primary endpoint was newly diagnosed malignant brain tumor. A total of 198,574 subjects aged ≥ 20 years with newly diagnosed OSA were enrolled in the study, and 992,870 individuals were selected as a control group based on propensity score matching (PSM) by gender and age. The average follow-up duration was 4.8 ± 2.3 years. The hazard ratios (HRs) for brain tumor for patients with OSA were 1.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42–2.21) in Model 1 (not adjusted with any covariate) and 1.67 (95% CI: 1.34–2.09) in Model 2 (adjusted for income level, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and COPD). In subgroup analysis by gender, the odds ratios (OR) of OSA were 1.82 (95% CI: 1.41–2.33) in men and 1.26 (95% CI: 0.74–2.03) in women.

https://openalex.org/W3100871252,"Objective Lack of awareness about Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most commonly cited reason why many persons with type 2 diabetes are non-compliant with referral instruction to undergo retinal screening. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a culturally, geographically and socially appropriate, locally adapted five-month-long health education on referral compliance of participants. Method A prospective randomized, open-label parallel group study was conducted on persons with type 2 diabetes who underwent basic eye screening at a diabetes hospital between September 2017 and August 2018. Participants who were noncompliant with referral instruction to visit a hospital for advanced DR management were randomly divided into health education intervention group (n = 143) and control group (n = 156). Both groups received information regarding DR and referral instruction at the diabetes hospital. The intervention group was provided personalized education followed by telephonic reminders. The primary endpoint was ‘increase in referral compliance’ and the secondary endpoint was ‘increase in knowledge of DR’. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify significant predictors of compliance to referral. Results A total of nine participants dropped and 290 completed the post intervention survey. The compliance rate in intervention group was found to be significantly higher than the control group (64.3% vs 28.2%; OR 4.73; 95% CI 2.87–7.79; p&lt;0.001). Participants in the intervention group acquired better knowledge on DR (p&lt;0.05). Apart from intervention, referral compliance rate was also found to be significantly associated with participants’ self-perception of vision problem (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.02–4.01; p = 0.045) and participants’ income (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06–1.44; p = 0.008).

https://openalex.org/W3103807977,"The most economical method of drill cuttings disposal may be their application in land reclamation which allows for the wastes recovery. However, the wastes application into the soil should ensure that the quality of the environment would not be deteriorated. These investigations were aimed at identifying the effect of drill cuttings, which were the mixture of different types of drilling wastes, on the physicochemical properties of acidic soil and growth of red clover ( Trifolium pratense L.). The experimental design comprised 5 treatments, which differed in a dose of the drill cuttings: 0% (control), 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 15% of dry weight. A six-week pot experiment was conducted to determine the influence of the wastes on the plant growth. The results showed that the drill cuttings addition significantly changed the chemical and physicochemical properties of the soil, such as: electrical conductivity (EC), pH, base saturation, content of carbonate, alkaline cations (Ca 2+ , Na + , K + , Mg 2+ ), organic matter, total organic carbon (TOC), and available phosphorus form. However, the most important factors that influenced the growth of red clover were pH, base saturation, content of Mg 2+ and plant available phosphorus. The red clover biomass was increased from 1.5 to 2.5 times depending on the dose of wastes. We concluded that the examined wastes can be used for reclamation of the acid and unfertile degraded soils, but the amount of wastes should not exceed 5% of the soil, because the highest total clover biomass was observed just at this dose."
https://openalex.org/W3104806479,"Animal responses occur according to a specific temporal structure composed of two states, where a bout is followed by a long pause until the next bout. Such a bout-and-pause pattern has three components: the bout length, the within-bout response rate, and the bout initiation rate. Previous studies have investigated how these three components are affected by experimental manipulations. However, it remains unknown what underlying mechanisms cause bout-and-pause patterns. In this article, we propose two mechanisms and examine computational models developed based on reinforcement learning. The model is characterized by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is choice—an agent makes a choice between operant and other behaviors. The second mechanism is cost—a cost is associated with the changeover of behaviors. These two mechanisms are extracted from past experimental findings. Simulation results suggested that both the choice and cost mechanisms are required to generate bout-and-pause patterns and if either of them is knocked out, the model does not generate bout-and-pause patterns. We further analyzed the proposed model and found that it reproduced the relationships between experimental manipulations and the three components that have been reported by previous studies. In addition, we showed alternative models can generate bout-and-pause patterns as long as they implement the two mechanisms."

ABPI was measured at recruitment and the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cardiovascular death (major cardiovascular events; MACE) and any amputation were recorded over a median (inter-quartile range) follow-up of 3.3 (1.0–7.1) years. The association of high, compared to normal, low (0.5–0.9) or very low (&lt;0.5), ABPI with clinical events was estimated using Cox proportional hazard analyses, adjusting for traditional risk factors and reported as hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals. 596 (38.9%), 676 (44.1%), 157 (10.2%) and 104 (6.8%) participants had normal, low, very low and high ABPI, respectively. Participants with high ABPI had increased risk of MACE, MI and death by comparison to those with either normal ABPI [1.69 (1.07, 2.65), 1.93 (1.07, 3.46) and 1.67 (1.09, 2.56)] or either low or very low ABPI [1.51 (1.02, 2.23), 1.92 (1.16, 3.19) and 1.47 (1.02, 2.14)] after adjusting for other risk factors. Findings were similar in a sensitivity analysis excluding people with ABPI only measured in one leg (n = 120). Participants with high ABPI also had an increased risk of MACE and MI compared to those with very low ABPI alone. High ABPI is a strong indicator of excess risk of cardiovascular events amongst people with PAD."
https://openalex.org/W3101250552,"A concise and robust method for 2D particle shape evaluation and reconstruction is proposed using the concept of the internal rolling of covering discs within the outline of a particle. By downscaling the covering disc size for capturing multiscale features, the calculation of the Euclidean distance can effectively yield three indices for sphericity, roundness and roughness. The geometric-based evaluations of particle morphology are dimensionless and precisely distinguishable between shapes after calibration and validation against constructed particles and natural sands. A sphericity-roundness diagram is provided to visualize the particle shape characterization, and a probabilistic density surface in the sphericity-roundness diagram is then proposed to statistically represent the distributions of the particle shapes. The concept of internal rolling is also utilized for particle shape reconstruction using a limited number of balls to replicate the indices of sphericity, roundness and roundness characteristic curve. The probabilistic density surface is duplicated for statistical particle shape reconstruction, which provides an effective approach for numerical investigations of the relationships between particle shapes and mechanical behavior. The effect of image quality on 2D shape evaluation is also examined by using a minimum area per particle, and the proposed method is intuitively extendable to 3D measurements using rolling covering spheres."
https://openalex.org/W3103780745,"Aim Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is an indolent mature B-cell-neoplasm with involvement of the bone marrow. At least 90% of LPLs carry MYD88-L265P mutation and some of them (~10%) transform into diffuse large B-cell-lymphoma (DLBCL). Material and methods Over the past 15 years we have collected 7 cases where the both LPL and DLBCL were diagnosed in the same patient. Clinical records, analytical data and histopathological specimens were reviewed. FISH studies on paraffin-embedded tissue for MYC , BCL2 and BCL6 genes were performed, as well as MYD88-L265P mutation and IGH rearrangement analysis by PCR. A mutational study was done by massive next generation sequencing (NGS). Results There were 4 women and 3 men between 36–91 years of age. Diagnoses were made simultaneously in 4 patients. In two cases the LPL appeared before the DLBCL and in the remaining case the high-grade component was discovered 5 years before the LPL. In 6 cases both samples shared the MYD88-L265P mutation. IGH rearrangement analysis showed overlapping features in two of 6 cases tested. Mutational study was evaluable in three cases for both samples showing shared and divergent mutations. Conclusions These data suggest different mechanisms of DLBCL development in LPL patients."
https://openalex.org/W3104807725,"C-peptide is usually considered as a marker of insulin secretion and has no physiological function. This study aimed to assess the association between serum C-peptide level as independent risk factor and breast cancer and explored the possible underlying mechanisms. This was a population-based cohort study. All the data was collected according to a standard protocol. The C-peptide and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins-3(IGFBP-3) concentrations were measured in blood. The breast cancer deaths were confirmed by National Death Index records. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to determine the hazard ratio of serum C-peptide level for breast cancer deaths. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the association between serum C-peptide and IGFBP-3 level, and the linear trend was tested by using a linear model. A total of 8,373 women 17 years of age or older were included in the study, and 57 breast cancer deaths were observed over the study period. The result of survival analysis showed that breast cancer deaths increased with increasing levels of serum C-peptide. The hazard ratio was 1.69 (95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.45). The levels of circulating IGFBP-3 were positively associated with changes in serum C-peptide levels and showed a strong linear trend in the covariance analysis. Serum C-peptide level was associated with increased risk of breast cancer death. Our results suggest that the increased risk of breast cancer death can be via a pathway that serum C-peptide level positive associated with the change in serum IGFBP-3 level."
https://openalex.org/W3098635262,"The aim of this article is to provide a detailed description of the Chikwawa lung health cohort which was established in rural Malawi to prospectively determine the prevalence and causes of lung disease amongst the general population of adults living in a low-income rural setting in Sub-Saharan Africa.A total of 1481 participants were randomly identified and recruited in 2014 for the baseline study. We collected data on demographic, socio-economic status, respiratory symptoms and potentially relevant exposures such as smoking, household fuels, environmental exposures, occupational history/exposures, dietary intake, healthcare utilization, cost (medication, outpatient visits and inpatient admissions) and productivity losses. Spirometry was performed to assess lung function. At baseline, 56.9% of the participants were female, mean age was 43.8 (SD:17.8) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 21.6 Kg/m2 (SD: 3.46).The cohort has reported the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms (13.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-15.4), spirometric obstruction (8.7%, 95% CI, 7.0-10.7), and spirometric restriction (34.8%, 95% CI, 31.7-38.0). Additionally, an annual decline in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] of 30.9mL/year (95% CI: 21.6 to 40.1) and forced vital capacity [FVC] by 38.3 mL/year (95% CI: 28.5 to 48.1) has been reported.The ongoing phases of follow-up will determine the annual rate of decline in lung function as measured through spirometry and the development of airflow obstruction and restriction, and relate these to morbidity, mortality and economic cost of airflow obstruction and restriction. Population-based mathematical models will be developed driven by the empirical data from the cohort and national population data for Malawi to assess the effects of interventions and programmes to address the lung burden in Malawi. The present follow-up study started in 2019."
https://openalex.org/W3102738091,"The efficiency of cell reprogramming in two-dimensional (2D) cultures is limited. Given that cellular stemness is intimately related to microenvironmental changes, 3D cell cultures have the potential of overcoming this limited capacity by allowing cells to self-organize by aggregation. In 3D space, cells interact more efficiently, modify their cellular topology, gene expression, signaling, and metabolism. It is yet not clear as how 3D culture environments modify the reprogramming potential of fibroblasts. We demonstrate that 3D spheroids from dermal fibroblasts formed under ultra-low attachment conditions showed increased lactate production. This is a requisite for cell reprogramming, increase their expression of pluripotency genes, such as OCT4 , NANOG and SOX2 , and display upregulated cystathionine-β-synthase ( CBS ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production. Knockdown of CBS by RNAi suppresses lactic acid and H 2 S production and concomitantly decreases the expression of OCT4 and NANOG . On the contrary, H 2 S donors, NaHS and garlic-derived diallyl trisulfide (DATS), promote the expression of OCT4 , and support osteogenic trans-differentiation of fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that CBS mediated release of H 2 S regulates the reprogramming of dermal fibroblasts grown in 3D cultures and supports their trans-differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3103871946,"Chromatin structure, including nucleosome positioning, has a fundamental role in transcriptional regulation through influencing protein-DNA interactions. DNA topology is known to influence chromatin structure, and in doing so, can also alter transcription. However, detailed mechanism(s) linking transcriptional regulation events to chromatin structure that is regulated by changes in DNA topology remain to be well defined. Here we demonstrate that nucleosome positioning and transcriptional output from the fission yeast fbp1 and prp3 genes are altered by excess topoisomerase activity. Given that lncRNAs ( l ong n on c oding RNAs) are transcribed from the fbp1 upstream region and are important for fbp1 gene expression, we hypothesized that local changes in DNA topological state caused by topoisomerase activity could alter lncRNA and fbp1 transcription. In support of this, we found that topoisomerase overexpression caused destabilization of positioned nucleosomes within the fbp1 promoter region, which was accompanied by aberrant fbp1 transcription. Similarly, the direct recruitment of topoisomerase, but not a catalytically inactive form, to the promoter region of fbp1 caused local changes in nucleosome positioning that was also accompanied by altered fbp1 transcription. These data indicate that changes in DNA topological state induced by topoisomerase activity could lead to altered fbp1 transcription through modulating nucleosome positioning."
https://openalex.org/W3105829394,"Temporal variability of the neural signal has been demonstrated to be closely related to healthy brain function. Meanwhile, the evolving brain functions are supported by dynamic relationships among brain regions. We hypothesized that the spatial variability of brain signal might provide important information about brain function. Here we used the spatial sample entropy (SSE) to investigate the spatial variability of neuroimaging signal during a steady-state presented face detection task. Lower SSE was found during task state than during resting state, associating with more repetitive functional interactions between brain regions. The standard deviation (SD) of SSE during the task was negatively related to the SD of reaction time, suggesting that the spatial pattern of neural activity is reorganized according to particular cognitive function and supporting the previous theory that greater variability is associated with better task performance. These results were replicated with reordered data, implying the reliability of SSE in measuring the spatial organization of neural activity. Overall, the present study extends the research scope of brain signal variability from the temporal dimension to the spatial dimension, improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of brain activities and the theory of brain signal variability."
https://openalex.org/W3097983668,"Many questions can be explored thanks to whole-genome data. The aim of this study was to overcome their main limits, software availability and database accuracy, and estimate the feasibility of red blood cell (RBC) antigen typing from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. We analyzed whole-genome data from 79 individuals for HLA-DRB1 and 9 RBC antigens. Whole-genome sequencing data was analyzed with software allowing phasing of variable positions to define alleles or haplotypes and validated for HLA typing from next-generation sequencing data. A dedicated database was set up with 1648 variable positions analyzed in KEL (KEL), ACKR1 (FY), SLC14A1 (JK), ACHE (YT), ART4 (DO), AQP1 (CO), CD44 (IN), SLC4A1 (DI) and ICAM4 (LW). Whole-genome sequencing typing was compared to that previously obtained by amplicon-based monoallelic sequencing and by SNaPshot analysis. Whole-genome sequencing data were also explored for other alleles. Our results showed 93% of concordance for blood group polymorphisms and 91% for HLA-DRB1. Incorrect typing and unresolved results confirm that WGS should be considered reliable with read depths strictly above 15x. Our results supported that RBC antigen typing from WGS is feasible but requires improvements in read depth for SNV polymorphisms typing accuracy. We also showed the potential for WGS in screening donors with rare blood antigens, such as weak JK alleles. The development of WGS analysis in immunogenetics laboratories would offer personalized care in the management of RBC disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3100566877,"Biological nomenclature is the entry point to a wealth of information related to or associated with living entities. When applied accurately and consistently, communication between and among researchers and investigators is enhanced, leading to advancements in understanding and progress in research programs. Based on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic identifications, inter-laboratory comparisons of &gt;900 samples taken from rivers, streams, and lakes across the U.S., including the Great Lakes, provided data on taxon-specific error rates. Using the error rates in combination with frequency of observation (FREQ; as a surrogate for rarity), six uncertainty/frequency classes (UFC) are proposed for approximately 1,000 taxa. The UFC, error rates, FREQ each are potentially useful for additional analyses related to interpreting biological assessment results and/or stressor response relationships, as weighting factors for various aspects of ecological condition or biodiversity analyses and helping set direction for taxonomic research and refining identification tools."
https://openalex.org/W3099470557,"Respiratory mucosal infection by airborne microbes is a common event that occurs every day. We report here that intranasal administration of non-replicating adenovirus (Ad) particles to mice could either confer rapid protection against influenza virus (IFV) challenge independent of adaptive immunity, or exacerbate influenza by triggering rapid death. The life-or-death outcome hinges on the time interval between Ad administration and IFV challenge in conjunction with specific mouse/IFV strains. Intranasal instillation of Ad particles 1–47 days prior to IFV challenge conferred rapid protection against influenza in Balb/c mice whereas exposure to Ad 39 days prior to challenge with a specific IFV strain or 1 day post-challenge with that IFV strain induced rapid death in C57BL/6 mice. Notably, consecutive administrations of Ad prior to IFV challenge conferred a synergy in triggering a potent anti-influenza state; even a detrimental Ad exposure 39 days before challenge with the deadly IFV strain was reversed to a beneficial one by subsequent Ad boosts. Results revealed an intricate relationship between infection and innate immunity that is a linchpin around which effects revolve from protective immunity to collateral damage. It is urgent to repeat the experiments with an expanded scope for characterizing the status that defines susceptibility or resistance to IFV infection and subsequently reveal the underlying mechanisms. Whether broad heterologous protective effects induced by AdE and adaptive immunity elicited by vaccination could confer synergy during mitigation of a pandemic remains to be seen."
