https://openalex.org/W2082015621,"We live in a macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) world, but our best description of the structure of matter is at the atomic and molecular scale. Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter. The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends. Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so; the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 A resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle. The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control."

GDC-0449, a drug that ramps down this signaling pathway by binding to the Hh pathway component Smoothened, was recently shown to induce rapid and dramatic tumor regression in a patient with metastatic medulloblastoma, but the tumor eventually developed resistance to the drug. Yauch et al. (p. 572 , published online 3 September) show that resistance arose because the tumor acquired a mutation in Smoothened that disrupts binding of the drug. Identification of this resistance mechanism may facilitate the design of next-generation drugs for this type of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2002426440,"While largely studied because of their harmful effects in DNA damage, protein/lipid oxidation and apoptosis, there is a growing appreciation that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may have beneficial effects in some tissues. In the mammalian haematopoietic system, haematopoietic stem cells contain low ROS levels, but unexpectedly, the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), produce significantly elevated levels of ROS. Edward Owusu-Ansah and Utpal Banerjee have discovered the apparent functional significance of this difference in ROS level in the two progenitor types in Drosophila. They show that the developmentally regulated, moderately high ROS level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation, and establishes a signalling role for ROS in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generally considered to be deleterious to cells. Despite the fact that, in mammals, haematopoietic stem cells contain low levels of ROS, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) unexpectedly produce relatively high levels of ROS. Here it is shown that the equivalent class of cells to CMPs in Drosophila display increased levels of ROS in vivo, apparently priming them for differentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced during various electron transfer reactions in vivo, are generally considered to be deleterious to cells1. In the mammalian haematopoietic system, haematopoietic stem cells contain low levels of ROS. However, unexpectedly, the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) produce significantly increased levels of ROS2. The functional significance of this difference in ROS level in the two progenitor types remains unresolved2,3. Here we show that Drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors, which are largely akin to the mammalian myeloid progenitors4, display increased levels of ROS under in vivo physiological conditions, which are downregulated on differentiation. Scavenging the ROS from these haematopoietic progenitors by using in vivo genetic tools retards their differentiation into mature blood cells. Conversely, increasing the haematopoietic progenitor ROS beyond their basal level triggers precocious differentiation into all three mature blood cell types found in Drosophila, through a signalling pathway that involves JNK and FoxO activation as well as Polycomb downregulation. We conclude that the developmentally regulated, moderately high ROS level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation, and establishes a signalling role for ROS in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate. Our results lead to a model that could be extended to reveal a probable signalling role for ROS in the differentiation of CMPs in mammalian haematopoietic development and oxidative stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2031721811,"In hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through the continual accretion of smaller ones. The tidal disruption of these systems is expected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distances that reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. The number, luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significant clues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey of these components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vast extent. Here we report a panoramic survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants of dwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of M31. An improved census of their surviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of M31's satellites brighter than $M_V < -6$ await discovery. The brightest companion, Triangulum (M33), is surrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for a recent encounter with M31. This panorama of galaxy structure directly confirms the basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals the shared history of M31 and M33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W2143967889,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) is the major atheroprotective particle in plasma. Recent studies demonstrate that myeloperoxidase (MPO) binds to HDL in vivo, selectively targeting apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) of HDL for oxidative modification and concurrent loss in cholesterol efflux and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activating activities, generating a “dysfunctional HDL” particle. We now show that (patho)physiologically relevant levels of MPO-catalyzed oxidation result in loss of non-cholesterol efflux activities of HDL including anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions. One mechanism responsible is shown to involve the loss of modified HDL binding to the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B1, and concurrent acquisition of saturable and specific binding to a novel unknown receptor independent of scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-A1. HDL modification by MPO is further shown to confer pro-inflammatory gain of function activities as monitored by NF-κB activation and surface vascular cell adhesion molecule levels on aortic endothelial cells exposed to MPO-oxidized HDL. The loss of non-cholesterol efflux activities and the gain of pro-inflammatory functions requires modification of the entire particle and can be recapitulated by oxidation of reconstituted HDL particles comprised of apoA1 and nonoxidizable phosphatidylcholine species. Multiple site-directed mutagenesis studies of apoA1 suggest that the pro-inflammatory activity of MPO-modified HDL does not involve methionine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, oxidant-sensitive residues previously mapped as sites of apoA1 oxidation within human atheroma. Thus, MPO-catalyzed oxidation of HDL results not only in the loss of classic atheroprotective reverse cholesterol transport activities of the lipoprotein but also both the loss of non-cholesterol efflux related activities and the gain of pro-inflammatory functions.

HDL is currently thought to function primarily in mediating reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the net transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for ultimate elimination into the intestinal lumen as biliary cholesterol for excretion in feces (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RCT involves multiple biochemical processes, including both lipid poor apoA1 and HDL serving as acceptors of cholesterol efflux from peripheral cholesterol loaded cells, maturation of HDL from a nascent relatively cholesterol poor particle into a cholesterol-laden spherical form through interaction with lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), and delivery of cholesterol to liver and steroidogenic tissues through the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) (2Tall A.R.

Although the RCT related functions of apoA1 and HDL are thought to primarily account for both the atheroprotective activity and the strong inverse association of HDL cholesterol and apoA1 levels and cardiovascular risks, other non-cholesterol efflux-related activities have also been identified and thus potentially contribute to the protective functions of HDL (3Barter P.J. Nicholls S. Rye K.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). For example, early seminal studies by Chisolm and co-workers (4Hessler J.R. Robertson Jr., A.L. Chisolm 3rd, G.M. Atherosclerosis. 1979; 32: 213-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) showed anti-inflammatory properties of HDL where the cytotoxicity of oxidized low density lipoprotein for vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in culture could be prevented by HDL. Subsequent studies by Fogelman and co-workers (5Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin.

Circulation. 2001; 103: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have considerably extended upon these findings, including early demonstration that the anti-inflammatory function of HDL may become pro-inflammatory during the acute phase response, such as during acute influenza A infection. HDL shows anti-inflammatory activities when incubated with cultured vascular endothelial cells activated by cytokines (7Baker P.W. Rye K.A. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and bolus infusion of HDL promotes anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, such as in a porcine model of acute inflammation (8Cockerill G.W. Huehns T.Y. Weerasinghe A. Stocker C. Lerch P.G. Miller N.E. Haskard D.O. Circulation. 2001; 103: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for SR-B1 binding of HDL in mediating many anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities of HDL via initiation of a cascade of downstream signaling pathways involving activation of both Akt and MAPKs and eventual endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activation (9Li X.A.

Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), a growing body of data support the notion that both acute phase responses and chronic inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), can render HDL “dysfunctional” or “pro-inflammatory,” lacking in biological activities important in RCT (11Nicholls S.J. Zheng L. Hazen S.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Navab M. Reddy S.T. Van Lenten B.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S145-S149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HDL isolated from patients with CVD or chronic inflammatory disorders are less effective at preventing low density lipoprotein-induced monocyte migration in vitro (13Ansell B.J. Navab M. Hama S. Kamranpour N. Fonarow G. Hough G. Rahmani S. Mottahedeh R. Dave R. Reddy S.T. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2751-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Recent studies have extended such observations to direct in vivo measures of RCT, demonstrating that inflammation impairs reverse cholesterol transport in murine models of endotoxemia (14McGillicuddy F.C. de la Llera Moya M. Hinkle C.C. Joshi M.R. Chiquoine E.H. Billheimer J.T. Rothblat G.H. Reilly M.P. Circulation. 2009; 119: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism that may contribute to impairment in HDL function during inflammation and CVD is oxidative modification of the particle by myeloperoxidase (MPO). Zheng et al. (15Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) first discovered that MPO, a leukocyte-derived heme protein implicated in atherosclerosis, binds to HDL via a specific binding domain on apoA1, promoting selective targeting of the lipoprotein in human plasma and atherosclerotic plaque for oxidative modification and a resultant loss of cholesterol efflux function. Independent studies have confirmed these observations (17Bergt C. Pennathur S. Fu X. Byun J. O'Brien K. McDonald T.O. Singh P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chait A. Brunzell J. Geary R.L. Oram J.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9001-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as well as shown that site-specific oxidative modification of apoA1 within nascent HDL may inhibit the ability of the particle to activate LCAT, a critical process in HDL particle maturation and presumably the overall RCT pathway (19Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Shao B. Cavigiolio G. Brot N. Oda M.N. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12224-12229Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus far, the functional consequences of MPO-mediated oxidative modification of HDL have only been linked to inhibition in the classic atheroprotective functions of the particle, namely inhibition in cholesterol efflux activity and LCAT activation. The impact of MPO-catalyzed oxidation of HDL on alternative processes critical to RCT such as SR-B1 interaction and non-cholesterol efflux-related activities of the particle remains unknown. Herein we show that apoA1 oxidation by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system at levels comparable with those observed within apoA1 recovered from human atheroma results in total ablation of HDL-mediated anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities through a mechanism involving loss of SR-B1 binding. We further show that MPO-dependent modification of HDL confers pro-inflammatory activities to the intact particle but not individual components of HDL, resulting in vascular endothelial cell activation as monitored by both NF-κB activation and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) up-regulation and enhanced surface protein expression. Pathophysiological levels of MPO-catalyzed oxidation of HDL confer acquisition of saturable and specific binding activity to an unknown receptor(s) distinct from classic scavenger receptors (SR-B1, CD36, and SR-A1) on multiple primary and immortalized endothelial cells. MPO was purified from detergent extracts of human leukocytes by lectin affinity and gel filtration chromatography, as described previously (21Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H.

HDL (1.063 < d < 1.21) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from human plasma as described previously (22Paromov V.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol.

Recombinant human apoA1 was generated in an Escherichia coli expression system and isolated by sequential column chromatographies as described (19Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Reconstituted nascent HDL (rHDL) was prepared using a sodium cholate dialysis method (25Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mass spectrometry confirmed a particle with a molar ratio similar to the starting composition of 100:10:1, POPC:cholesterol: apoA1, and <0.1% residual cholate as determined by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. rHDL particle size was characterized by native gel electrophoresis and dual beam light scattering, confirming a 96 Å particle size. HDL was iodinated by the method of Bolton and Hunter (26Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 80 dpm/ng protein and subsequently modified by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system as outlined below. Protein content was determined by a Lowry assay (27Lowry O.H. Rosbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biological materials isolated from the blood of healthy donors (e.g. MPO, HDL, apoA1) were performed under protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all of the participants gave written informed consent. MPO-mediated modification of HDL and apoA1 was carried out as described previously at a mol ratio of 10 mol of H2O2/mol of apoA1 (16Zheng L. Settle M. Brubaker G. Schmitt D. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D.

Protein bound chlorotyrosine (ClTyr) was quantified by stable isotope dilution HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) interfaced with a Cohesive HPLC (Franklin, MA) with Ionics redesigned source as an upgrade (21Brennan M.L.

All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee of Cleveland Clinic. All of the mice used were on a C57Bl6/J background (>10 generations) and maintained on normal chow. CD36 knock-out (KO), SR-A1 KO, and CD36/SR-A1 double knock out (DKO) mice were generously provided by Dr. Maria Febbraio (Cleveland Clinic). Mice peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) were elicited by thioglycollate injection as previously described (28Park Y.M. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 136-145PubMed Google Scholar). MPMs were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum overnight, and nonadherent cells were removed by washing. Cholesterol efflux (total) and LCAT activity were determined as previously described (19Wu Z. Wagner M.A. Zheng L. Parks J.S. Shy 3rd, J.M. Smith J.D. Gogonea V. Hazen S.L. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were serum-deprived for 6 h with simultaneous incubation with 500 μg of protein/ml of HDL or 500 μg of protein/ml oxidized HDL. Where indicated, individual components (lipids extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

After 6 h, apoptosis was measured with an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or APO-BRDU kit (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry of labeled cells was performed on a FACScan. An alternate endothelial cell type, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), and an alternate apoptogenic trigger, UV irradiation (254 nm, 12.4 watts, for 10 min), were used where indicated. Surface VCAM-1 protein levels were determined in HUVEC (TNF-α-induced VCAM-1) and BAEC (no TNF-α addition). The cells were incubated with 500 μg of protein/ml of HDL, 500 μg of protein/ml of oxidized HDL or, where indicated, individual protein and lipid components for 6 h. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min. Surface VCAM-1 protein was determined using anti-VCAM-1 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) as a secondary antibody, detection by SureBlue tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) and measuring absorbance at 450 nm on a 96-well plate reader (Spectramax 384 Plus; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) after the addition of 1 m HCl to stop the reaction. Caspase-3 activity in HUVEC was determined as described previously (9Li X.A. Guo L. Dressman J.L. Asmis R. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Conversion of tritium-labeled arginine (GE Healthcare) to citrulline was used as a measure of eNOS activity. HUVEC were treated with the indicated protein concentrations of HDL or oxHDL for 10 min, and the media were collected and spun down to pellet debris. Arginine and citrulline separation was achieved by HPLC, and the [3H]citrulline peak was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. BAEC were treated with HDL or oxidized HDL for 6 h, and NF-κB activation in whole cell extracts was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with supershift detected using antibody specific to p65 subunit of NF-κB (31Bauer J.A.

IκB kinase (IKK) activity was determined by immunoprecipitation of the IKK complex using IKKγ antibody, followed by performance of a kinase assay using recombinant GST-IκB-α(1–54) and [32P]ATP as substrates, as described previously (32DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). As an additional specificity control, recombinant mutant GST-IκB-α where serines 32 and 36 were mutated to alanine was generated and used as substrate. Binding to SR-B1 was assessed as described previously (33Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Binding to wild type and knock-out MPMs was performed as described previously (35Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G.

Specific binding was calculated as total binding minus binding in the presence of 30-fold excess of unlabeled HDL (nonspecific binding). Competition binding experiments with 125I-labeled oxidized HDL isolated from plasma and oxidized rHDL synthesized with the pan Trp → Phe mutant apoA1 were performed at 30-fold molar excess of the unlabeled ligands. All of the experiments were performed at least three times. The results are reported as the means ± S.E. of at least triplicate determinations. Student's two-tailed t test was used for statistical analyses, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Nonlinear regression was used to fit binding curves with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. In initial studies, we sought to test the hypothesis that HDL oxidation by (patho)physiologically relevant levels of the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in a loss of anti-apoptotic activity concurrent with loss of classic cholesterol efflux and LCAT activation properties of the particle. To do so we first exposed isolated human HDL to the MPO oxidant system and confirmed that exposure to the complete MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in the loss of HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux activity when the modified lipoprotein was incubated with cholesterol-loaded macrophages (Fig. 1A), as well as inhibition of LCAT-catalyzed cholesteryl ester formation (Fig. 1B). MPO is the only known enzyme in mammals capable of generating chlorinating oxidants, enabling quantification of protein-bound ClTyr levels to serve as a specific “dosimeter” of exposure to MPO-mediated oxidation in vivo (36Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The specificity of ClTyr as a post-translational modification of proteins formed by MPO-generated chlorinating oxidants has been confirmed in multiple models of inflammation using MPO knock-out mice (21Brennan M.L.

Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30463-30468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore quantified ClTyr levels in the MPO-oxidized HDL preparations and confirmed that the degree of oxidation produced in vitro (Fig. 1C) is comparable with levels previously observed in apoA1 recovered from human atherosclerotic aortic tissues, where ClTyr levels as high as 25 mmol of ClTyr/mol of Tyr have been observed (15Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Functional impairment in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and LCAT activity and parallel increases in HDL apoA1 ClTyr content showed an absolute requirement for the presence of each of the components of the oxidation system (MPO, H2O2, and Cl−) because eliminating any one of the components inhibited ClTyr production and functional impairment in the classic cholesterol transporting functions of HDL (Fig. 1). For all subsequent functional characterization studies described below for HDL exposed to MPO-catalyzed oxidation, the oxHDL preparations used were first similarly characterized by mass spectrometry to confirm that the degree of oxidation was pathophysiologically relevant (as indicated by levels of ClTyr within range observed for apoA1 recovered from human arterial tissues) and to be accompanied by significant impairment in cholesterol efflux and LCAT activating activities. HUVECs undergo apoptosis upon serum deprivation, and previous studies have shown that isolated human HDL, but not low density lipoprotein, inhibits serum starvation-induced endothelial cell apoptosis (40Nofer J.R. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In cells that were serum-deprived for 6 h, the level of apoptosis as measured by both annexin staining (Fig. 2A) and TUNEL (Fig. 2B) increased nearly 3-fold. As expected, simultaneous incubation with 500 μg of protein/ml of isolated HDL markedly reduced the level of endothelial cell apoptosis. In contrast, the same concentration of MPO-oxHDL was ineffective at preventing HUVEC apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, anti-apoptotic activity required the presence of the intact native particle because co-incubation of comparable levels of isolated human plasma-derived apoA1 and liposomes generated from HDL lipids failed to promote anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 2). Because plasma HDL is a heterogeneous group of lipoproteins (41Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) with varying lipid composition, we next sought to identify the components of the lipoprotein involved in the anti-apoptotic activity. rHDL was prepared using human apoA1 (isolated from plasma) as the sole protein and the relatively oxidant-resistant lipid POPC as the sole phospholipid. Exposure of serum-starved HUVEC to 500 μg of protein/ml of rHDL recapitulated the anti-apoptotic activity observed with isolated human plasma derived HDL, demonstrating that an intact particle comprised of only apoA1 and a relatively nonoxidizable phosphatidylcholine molecular species was all that is needed for facilitating the anti-apoptotic activity of HDL (Fig. 2). Interestingly, oxidation of rHDL with MPO resulted in the loss of the anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar behavior for rHDL versus oxidized rHDL and the loss of macrophage cholesterol efflux activity and LCAT activation were also observed (data not shown). The similar anti-apoptotic activity of plasma HDL and rHDL but not with isolated apoA1 or HDL lipid liposomes, highlights the importance of the structural integrity of HDL for its anti-apoptotic activity, as well as the likelihood that oxidation of the protein (apoA1) and not the lipid component of rHDL is responsible for ablating the anti-apoptotic effect. To further explore the generality of these observations, the anti-apoptotic activities of isolated human HDL versus MPO-generated oxHDL were examined using multiple distinct endothelial cells (HUVECs, BAECs, and human aortic endothelial cells) to alternative apoptogenic triggers. Ultraviolet light exposure is a classic apoptogenic trigger. When each of the endothelial cell lines were irradiated with 254-nm UV light, a nearly 10-fold increase in apoptosis was observed, which was markedly attenuated by concomitant addition of 500 μg of protein/ml of isolated human HDL. In contrast, neither MPO-generated oxHDL nor the individual components of native HDL (isolated lipid poor apoA1 or liposomes produced from HDL extracted lipids) reduced the rate of apoptosis significantly (Fig. 2, C and D; data for only HUVECs and BAECs shown).

Chemotherapy causes further bone loss, and bone-specific treatments are only palliative. Multiple tumor-secreted factors act on the bone microenvironment to drive a feed-forward cycle of tumor growth. Effective treatment requires inhibiting upstream regulators of groups of prometastatic factors. Two central regulators are hypoxia and transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta. We asked whether hypoxia (via HIF-1alpha) and TGF-beta signaling promote bone metastases independently or synergistically, and we tested molecular versus pharmacological inhibition strategies in an animal model.We analyzed interactions between HIF-1alpha and TGF-beta pathways in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), of 16 genes tested, were additively increased by both TGF-beta and hypoxia, with effects on the proximal promoters. We inhibited HIF-1alpha and TGF-beta pathways in tumor cells by shRNA and dominant negative receptor approaches. Inhibition of either pathway decreased bone metastasis, with no further effect of double blockade. We tested pharmacologic inhibitors of the pathways, which target both the tumor and the bone microenvironment. Unlike molecular blockade, combined drug treatment decreased bone metastases more than either alone, with effects on bone to decrease osteoclastic bone resorption and increase osteoblast activity, in addition to actions on tumor cells.Hypoxia and TGF-beta signaling in parallel drive tumor bone metastases and regulate a common set of tumor genes. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors, by acting on both tumor cells and the bone microenvironment, additively decrease tumor burden, while improving skeletal quality. Our studies suggest that inhibitors of HIF-1alpha and TGF-beta may improve treatment of bone metastases and increase survival."
https://openalex.org/W1991723371,"Cell encapsulation is a promising approach for long-term delivery of therapeutic agents. Nonetheless, this system has failed to reach clinical settings, as the entrapped cells provoke a host immune reaction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), however, potentially may overcome this impediment and serve as a promising platform for cell-based microencapsulation. They are known to be hypoimmunogenic and can be genetically modified to express a variety of therapeutic factors. We have designed alginate-PLL microcapsules that can encapsulate human MSCs (hMSCs) for extended periods, as demonstrated by fluorescence and H(3)-thymidine assays. The encapsulated hMSCs maintained their mesenchymal surface markers and differentiated to all the typical mesoderm lineages. In vitro and in vivo immunogenicity studies revealed that encapsulated hMSCs were significantly hypoimmunogenic, leading to a 3-fold decrease in cytokine expression compared to entrapped cell lines. The efficacy of such systems was demonstrated by genetically modifying the cells to express the hemopexin-like protein (PEX), an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Live imaging and tumor measurements showed that encapsulated hMSC-PEX injected adjacent to glioblastoma tumors in nude mice led to a significant reduction in tumor volume (87%) and weight (83%). We clearly demonstrate that hMSCs are the cell of choice for microencapsulation cell based-therapy, thus bringing this technology closer to clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2025218263,"The emergence of terrestrial life witnessed the need for more sophisticated circulatory systems. This has evolved in birds, mammals and crocodilians into complete septation of the heart into left and right sides, allowing separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, a key requirement for the evolution of endothermy. However, the evolution of the amniote heart is poorly understood. Reptilian hearts have been the subject of debate in the context of the evolution of cardiac septation: do they possess a single ventricular chamber or two incompletely septated ventricles? Here we examine heart development in the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans (a chelonian), and the green anole, Anolis carolinensis (a squamate), focusing on gene expression in the developing ventricles. Both reptiles initially form a ventricular chamber that homogenously expresses the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx5. In contrast, in birds and mammals, Tbx5 is restricted to left ventricle precursors. In later stages, Tbx5 expression in the turtle (but not anole) heart is gradually restricted to a distinct left ventricle, forming a left-right gradient. This suggests that Tbx5 expression was refined during evolution to pattern the ventricles. In support of this hypothesis, we show that loss of Tbx5 in the mouse ventricle results in a single chamber lacking distinct identity, indicating a requirement for Tbx5 in septation. Importantly, misexpression of Tbx5 throughout the developing myocardium to mimic the reptilian expression pattern also results in a single mispatterned ventricular chamber lacking septation. Thus ventricular septation is established by a steep and correctly positioned Tbx5 gradient. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the evolution of the amniote ventricle, and support the concept that altered expression of developmental regulators is a key mechanism of vertebrate evolution."

Nf1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein that terminates Ras signalling by stimulating hydrolysis of Ras-GTP. We compared the effects of inhibitors of MEK in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) initiated by inactivating Nf1 in mouse bone marrow and in acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) in which cooperating mutations were induced by retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Here we show that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in MPD, but induce objective regression of many Nf1-deficient AMLs. Drug resistance developed because of outgrowth of AML clones that were present before treatment. We cloned clone-specific retroviral integrations to identify candidate resistance genes including Rasgrp1, Rasgrp4 and Mapk14, which encodes p38alpha. Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38 kinase activity in resistance to MEK inhibitors. This approach represents a robust strategy for identifying genes and pathways that modulate how primary cancer cells respond to targeted therapeutics and for probing mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance."

Moreover, the role of Pi in phosphorylation reactions, ATP production, DNA structure, and synthesis has led to the view that Pi availability could be an important determinant of cell growth. However, these issues have not been clearly addressed to date, and the role of either Pi or PiT proteins in cell proliferation is unknown.

In vivo, PiT1 depletion greatly reduced tumor growth when engineered HeLa cells were injected into nude mice. We provide evidence that this effect on cell proliferation is specific to PiT1 and not shared by PiT2 and is not the consequence of impaired membrane Na+-Pi transport. Moreover, we show that modulation of cell proliferation by PiT1 is independent from its transport function because the proliferation of PiT1-depleted cells can be rescued by non-transporting PiT1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2029342368,"In E. coli, 10 to 15% of growing bacteria produce dimeric chromosomes during DNA replication. These dimers are resolved by XerC and XerD, two tyrosine recombinases that target the 28-nucleotide motif (dif) associated with the chromosome's replication terminus. In streptococci and lactococci, an alternative system is composed of a unique, Xer-like recombinase (XerS) genetically linked to a dif-like motif (dif(SL)) located at the replication terminus. Preliminary observations have suggested that the dif/Xer system is commonly found in bacteria with circular chromosomes but that assumption has not been confirmed in an exhaustive analysis. The aim of the present study was to extensively characterize the dif/Xer system in the proteobacteria, since this taxon accounts for the majority of genomes sequenced to date. To that end, we analyzed 234 chromosomes from 156 proteobacterial species and showed that most species (87.8%) harbor XerC and XerD-like recombinases and a dif-related sequence which (i) is located in non-coding sequences, (ii) is close to the replication terminus (as defined by the cumulative GC skew) (iii) has a palindromic structure, (iv) is encoded by a low G+C content and (v) contains a highly conserved XerD binding site. However, not all proteobacteria display this dif/XerCD system. Indeed, a sub-group of pathogenic epsilon-proteobacteria (including Helicobacter sp and Campylobacter sp) harbors a different recombination system, composed of a single recombinase (XerH) which is phylogenetically distinct from the other Xer recombinases and a motif (dif(H)) sharing homologies with dif(SL). Furthermore, no homologs to dif or Xer recombinases could be detected in small endosymbiont genomes or in certain bacteria with larger chromosomes like the Legionellales. This raises the question of the presence of other chromosomal deconcatenation systems in these species. Our study highlights the complexity of dif/Xer recombinase systems in proteobacteria and paves the way for systematic detection of these components in prokaryotes."

Previous studies have shown that immunization of BALB/c mice with an IFN-gamma-producing C. neoformans strain, H99gamma, results in complete protection against a second pulmonary challenge with an otherwise lethal cryptococcal strain. The current study evaluated local anamnestic cell-mediated immune responses against pulmonary cryptococcosis in mice immunized with C. neoformans strain H99gamma compared to mice immunized with heat-killed C. neoformans (HKC.n.). Mice immunized with C. neoformans strain H99gamma had significantly reduced pulmonary fungal burden post-secondary challenge compared to mice immunized with HKC.n. Protection against pulmonary cryptococcosis was associated with increased pulmonary granulomatous formation and leukocyte infiltration followed by a rapid resolution of pulmonary inflammation, which protected the lungs from severe allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM)-pathology that developed in the lungs of mice immunized with HKC.n. Pulmonary challenge of interleukin (IL)-4 receptor, IL-12p40, IL-12p35, IFN-gamma, T cell and B cell deficient mice with C. neoformans strain H99gamma demonstrated a requirement for Th1-type T cell-mediated immunity, but not B cell-mediated immunity, for the induction of H99gamma-mediated protective immune responses against pulmonary C. neoformans infection. CD4(+) T cells, CD11c(+) cells, and Gr-1(+) cells were increased in both proportion and absolute number in protected mice. In addition, significantly increased production of Th1-type/pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and conversely, reduced Th2-type cytokine production was observed in the lungs of protected mice. Interestingly, protection was not associated with increased production of cytokines IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha in lungs of protected mice. In conclusion, immunization with C. neoformans strain H99gamma results in the development of protective anti-cryptococcal immune responses that may be measured and subsequently used in the development of immune-based therapies to combat pulmonary cryptococcosis."
https://openalex.org/W2105665802,"Genes present in only certain strains of a bacterial species can strongly affect cellular phenotypes and evolutionary potentials. One segment that seemed particularly rich in strain-specific genes was found by comparing the first two sequenced Helicobacter pylori genomes (strains 26695 and J99) and was named a ""plasticity zone"".We studied the nature and evolution of plasticity zones by sequencing them in five more Helicobacter strains, determining their locations in additional strains, and identifying them in recently released genome sequences. They occurred as discrete units, inserted at numerous chromosomal sites, and were usually flanked by direct repeats of 5'AAGAATG, a sequence generally also present in one copy at unoccupied sites in other strains. This showed that plasticity zones are transposable elements, to be called TnPZs. Each full length TnPZ contained a cluster of type IV protein secretion genes (tfs3), a tyrosine recombinase family gene (""xerT""), and a large (>or=2800 codon) orf encoding a protein with helicase and DNA methylase domains, plus additional orfs with no homology to genes of known function. Several TnPZ types were found that differed in gene arrangement or DNA sequence. Our analysis also indicated that the first-identified plasticity zones (in strains 26695 and J99) are complex mosaics of TnPZ remnants, formed by multiple TnPZ insertions, and spontaneous and transposable element mediated deletions. Tests using laboratory-generated deletions showed that TnPZs are not essential for viability, but identified one TnPZ that contributed quantitatively to bacterial growth during mouse infection and another that affected synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in cell culture.We propose that plasticity zone genes are contained in conjugative transposons (TnPZs) or remnants of them, that TnPZ insertion is mediated by XerT recombinase, and that some TnPZ genes affect bacterial phenotypes and fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1971947849,"During the menstrual cycle, the ovarian steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone control a dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) leading to a receptive state for blastocyst implantation and the establishment of pregnancy. A key marker gene of this decidualization process is the prolactin gene. Several transcriptional regulators have been identified that are essential for decidualization of ESCs, including the Hox genes HoxA-10 and HoxA-11, and the forkhead box gene FOXO1A. While previous studies have identified downstream target genes for HoxA-10 and FOXO1A, the role of HoxA-11 in decidualization has not been investigated. Here, we show that HoxA-11 is required for prolactin expression in decidualized ESC. While HoxA-11 alone is a repressor on the decidual prolactin promoter, it turns into an activator when combined with FOXO1A. Conversely, HoxA-10, which has been previously shown to associate with FOXO1A to upregulate decidual IGFBP-1 expression, is unable to upregulate PRL expression when co-expressed with FOXO1A. By co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate physical association of HoxA-11 and FOXO1A, and binding of both factors to an enhancer region (-395 to -148 relative to the PRL transcriptional start site) of the decidual prolactin promoter. Because FOXO1A is induced upon decidualization, it serves to assemble a decidual-specific transcriptional complex including HoxA-11. These data highlight cooperativity between numerous transcription factors to upregulate PRL in differentiating ESC, and suggest that this core set of transcription factors physically and functionally interact to drive the expression of a gene battery upregulated in differentiated ESC. In addition, the functional non-equivalence of HoxA-11 and HoxA-10 with respect to PRL regulation suggests that these transcription factors regulate distinct sets of target genes during decidualization."

Apoptosis is triggered when a peptide containing a BH3 motif or a small molecule BH3 peptidomimetic, such as ABT 737, binds to the relevant Bcl-2 family members. ABT-737 is an antagonist of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-w but not of Mcl-1. Here we describe new structures of mutant BH3 peptides bound to Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These structures suggested a rationale for the failure of ABT-737 to bind Mcl-1, but a designed variant of ABT-737 failed to acquire binding affinity for Mcl-1. Rather, it was selective for Bcl-x(L), a result attributable in part to significant backbone refolding and movements of helical segments in its ligand binding site. To date there are few reported crystal structures of organic ligands in complex with their pro-survival protein targets. Our structure of this new organic ligand provided insights into the structural transitions that occur within the BH3 binding groove, highlighting significant differences in the structural properties of members of the Bcl-2 pro-survival protein family. Such differences are likely to influence and be important in the quest for compounds capable of selectively antagonizing the different family members."
https://openalex.org/W2007653885,"Background Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that plays a critical role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Overnutrition-associated obesity is known to be accompanied by hyperleptinemia. However, the physiological actions of leptin in the metabolic responses to high-fat diet (HFD) intake remain to be completely elucidated. Here we characterized the metabolic features of mice fed high-fat diets and investigated the impact of leptin upon the lipogenic program which was found to be suppressed by HFD feeding through a proteomics approach. Results When maintained on two types of high-fat diets for up to 16 weeks, mice with a higher fat intake exhibited increased body fat accumulation at a greater pace, developing more severely impaired glucose tolerance. Notably, HFD feeding at 4 weeks elicited the onset of marked hyperleptinemia, prior to the occurrence of apparent insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Proteomic analysis revealed dramatically decreased expression of lipogenic enzymes in the white adipose tissue (WAT) from HFD-fed mice, including ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). The expression of ACL and FAS in the liver was similarly suppressed in response to HFD feeding. By contrast, HFD-induced downregulation of hepatic ACL and FAS was significantly attenuated in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. Furthermore, in the liver and WAT of wild type animals, intraperitoneal leptin administration was able to directly suppress the expression of these two lipogenic enzymes, accompanied by reduced triglyceride levels both in the liver and serum. Conclusions These results suggest that leptin contributes to the metabolic responses in adaptation to overnutrition through suppressing the expression of lipogenic enzymes, and that the lipogenic pathway represents a key targeted peripheral component in exerting leptin's liporegulatory actions."

Expression of GPIHBP1 in cultured cells confers the ability to bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (1Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E. Qiao X. Peale P. Bunting S. Walzem R.L.

The discovery of the role of GPIHBP1 in lipolysis prompted interest in defining which portions of GPIHBP1 are important for its function (e.g. for its ability to bind LPL). Mature GPIHBP1 is a relatively short protein with only two noteworthy structural domains (Fig. 1). First, the amino terminus of the protein contains a strongly acidic domain (amino acids 24–48 in the mouse sequence) with a large number of aspartates and glutamates (2Ioka R.X. Kang M.J. Kamiyama S. Kim D.H. Magoori K. Kamataki A. Ito Y. Takei Y.A. Sasaki M. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Takahashi S. Sakai J. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol.

This negatively charged domain is absolutely critical for binding LPL, a protein that contains two well characterized positively charged “heparin-binding domains” (3Hata A. Ridinger D.N.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, GPIHBP1 contains a cysteine-rich Ly6 domain (amino acids 63–135 in the mouse sequence). The function of the Ly6 domain in LPL binding is less clearly defined. The Ly6 domain is an ancient motif containing either 8 or 10 cysteines that are organized in a highly characteristic spacing pattern (6Fry B.G. Wüster W. Kini R.M. Brusic V. Khan A. Venkataraman D.

Mammalian genomes contain ∼25–30 Ly6 proteins, of which the best studied are urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and CD59. In those proteins, as well as in other Ly6 proteins, crystallographic studies have shown that each of the cysteines is involved in a disulfide bond, producing a three-fingered structural motif (8Llinas P.

In the case of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and CD59, the Ly6 motif is crucial for ligand binding (8Llinas P. Le Du M.H. Gårdsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. Gilquin B. Stura E.A. Ménez A.

Dis. 1996; 22: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). But in the case of GPIHBP1, one could argue that this domain might be dispensable, simply because it is plausible that the acidic domain would be sufficient for binding the positively charged domains within LPL. On the other hand, other considerations suggest that the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain might actually be important for GPIHBP1 function. First, the cysteines that define the Ly6 domain are perfectly conserved in the GPIHBP1 of every mammalian species from platypus to human, suggesting that the three-fingered structure of this domain is important (14Young S.G. Davies B.S. Fong L.G. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Bensadoun A. Beigneux A.P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2007; 18: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Second, Beigneux et al. (15Beigneux A.P. Franssen R. Bensadoun A. Gin P. Melford K. Peter J. Walzem R.L. Weinstein M.M. Davies B.S. Kuivenhoven J.A. Kastelein J.J. Fong L.G. Dallinga-Thie G.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) found that a missense mutation adjacent to a conserved cysteine (Q115P) impaired the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL. The latter observation led us to entertain the possibility that the Ly6 domain could be functionally important in LPL binding. To explore the functional relevance of the GPIHBP1 Ly6 domain, we decided to mutate the highly conserved cysteines in GPIHBP1 (Fig. 1), because those mutations would be predicted to disrupt the structure of the three-fingered motif. For other Ly6 proteins, mutation of conserved cysteines appears to impair protein function. Mutation of several (but not all) of the Ly6 cysteines in CD59 reduces the ability of that molecule to inhibit complement-mediated membrane attack (13Petranka J. Zhao J. Norris J. Tweedy N.B. Ware R.E. Sims P.J. Rosse W.F. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also, missense mutations involving cysteines were found in a secreted Ly6 protein, SLURP1, in association with a recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (16Favre B. Plantard L. Aeschbach L. Brakch N.

Unfortunately, the function and the binding partner for SLURP1 are unknown, so no one has been able to use biochemical assays to rigorously assess the impact of cysteine mutations on protein function. In contrast, GPIHBP1 has a well established function—binding LPL, and a cell-based system for assessing LPL binding has been developed (1Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E.

In the current study, we sought to assess the impact of Ly6 cysteine mutations on the LPL binding capacity of GPIHBP1. But as we embarked on these studies, we worried that the cell-based assay system might be inadequate, for the simple reason that cysteine mutations sometimes interfere with the ability of proteins to reach the cell surface (13Petranka J.

Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also developed a cell-free, monoclonal antibody-based assay system for assessing the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL. Both the cell-based binding system and the cell-free system were used to test the possibility that the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1, like the acidic domain, is critical for binding LPL. Expression vectors for S-protein-tagged versions of mouse and human GPIHBP1 have been described previously (1Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E. Qiao X. Peale P. Bunting S. Walzem R.L. Wong J.S. Blaner W.S. Ding Z.M. Melford K. Wongsiriroj N. Shu X. de Sauvage F. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Bensadoun A. Young S.G. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Constructs for soluble untagged and S-protein-tagged mouse GPIHBP1 proteins were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by truncating the protein (i.e. by replacing the GPI anchoring signal with a stop codon, G198X). Another soluble S-protein-tagged mouse GPIHBP1 construct was generated by introducing a premature stop codon at residue 136 (N136X). Also, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create human and mouse GPIHBP1 constructs in which specific cysteines within the Ly6 domain were changed to alanine and also an S-protein-tagged mouse GPIHBP1 construct in which the sole N-linked glycosylation site was replaced with glutamine (N76Q). We also performed studies with mutant GPIHBP1 proteins in which all of the aspartates and glutamates between residues 24 and 33 or residues 38 and 48 were replaced with alanine (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol.

Gin P. Melford K. Peter J. Walzem R.L. Weinstein M.M. Davies B.S. Kuivenhoven J.A. Kastelein J.J. Fong L.G. Dallinga-Thie G.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. To express the GPIHBP1 proteins, 1–5 × 106 CHO pgsA-745 cells (19Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) were electroporated with 2–5 μg of plasmid DNA with the nucleofector II apparatus (Lonza) and the Cell Line T Nucleofector kit (Lonza). A stable CHO cell line expressing a V5-tagged human LPL was obtained from Dr. Mark Doolittle (University of California, Los Angeles) and then adapted for growth in 95% serum-free/protein-free medium (CHO III from Gibco). Conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold with Amicon Ultra 30,000 centrifugal filters (Millipore). The presence of LPL in the conditioned media was assessed by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the V5 tag (1:200; Invitrogen). CHO pgsA-745 cells were electroporated with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and grown in 6-well plates in serum-free medium. Cell culture medium was collected 3 days later and concentrated 20-fold with Amicon Ultra 10,000 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). The presence of soluble GPIHBP1 in the conditioned medium was assessed by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse GPIHBP1 (1:1000; Novus). Mouse and human GPIHBP1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were used to immunize rats or mice, respectively. Splenocytes from immunized animals were fused with myeloma cells, and stable hybridomas were selected. A mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 14, against human GPIHBP1 bound to the human GPIHBP1 expressed by CHO cells that had been transfected with a human GPIHBP1 expression vector, as judged by Western blotting. A rat monoclonal antibody against mouse GPIHBP1, clone 11A12, was evaluated for its ability to bind to both wild-type and truncated GPIHBP1 constructs (see “Results”). Hybridomas were adapted to serum/protein-free medium, and immunoglobulins in the medium were purified on a protein G-agarose column (Roche Applied Science). The purity of immunoglobulins was documented with Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We tested the ability of LPL to bind to soluble GPIHBP1 proteins that had been immobilized on monoclonal antibody 11A12-coated agarose beads. First, antibody 11A12 was conjugated to beaded agarose with the Aminolink Plus kit (Pierce). Next, 50 μl of concentrated medium containing soluble GPIHBP1 and 20 μl of concentrated medium containing V5-tagged human LPL were incubated overnight with 40 μl of antibody 11A12-coated agarose beads in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The beads were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Finally, the bound GPIHBP1 (along with any LPL that had been bound by GPIHBP1) was eluted from the beads with 200 μl of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5 (this step was repeated three times). Centrifugation steps were performed at 500 × g for 2 min. The amounts of GPIHBP1 and LPL in each fraction were assessed by Western blotting. 5 × 106 CHO pgsA-745 cells were electroporated with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and seeded in triplicate wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. 24 h after the electroporation, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with V5-tagged human LPL (400 μl/well). In some wells, heparin was added to the incubation medium (final concentration, 500 units/ml). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were washed six times in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2, and cell extracts were collected in radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.02% SDS) along with complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The amounts of LPL and GPIHBP1 in cell extracts were assessed by Western blotting. Proteins were size-fractionated on 12% Bis-Tris SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. The antibody dilutions for Western blots were 1:1000 for a goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (Abcam); 1:1000 for a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the acidic domain of mouse GPIHBP1 (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol.

Antibody binding was detected with an Odyssey infrared scanner (Li-Cor). To determine whether GPIHBP1 proteins reached the cell surface, we tested whether GPIHBP1 could be released into the medium with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) (1Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E. Qiao X. Peale P. Bunting S. Walzem R.L. Wong J.S. Blaner W.S. Ding Z.M. Melford K. Wongsiriroj N. Shu X. de Sauvage F. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Bensadoun A.

CHO pgsA-745 cells (1 × 106 cells) were electroporated with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and seeded in duplicate wells of a 24-well plate. 24 h after the electroporation, the cells were incubated with PIPLC (5 units/ml) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the medium was harvested, and cell extracts were collected in radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer containing complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). In other experiments, we assessed the amount of GPIHBP1 expression on the surface of cells compared with the total amount of GPIHBP1 within cells. CHO pgsA-745 cells (2 × 106 cells) were electroporated with 4 μg of plasmid and then seeded in four wells of a 24-well plate. 24 h after the electroporation, the cells were incubated with a goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (1:400 for 2 h at 4 °C) in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS/Mg/Ca). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were washed six times in ice-cold PBS/Mg/Ca, and the cell extracts were collected in radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer containing complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). To judge the amount of GPIHBP1 on the cell surface, we performed Western blots on cell extracts with an IRdye680-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Li-Cor; 1:800). To assess the total amount of GPIHBP1 in cells, we simultaneously performed a Western blot with the rat monoclonal antibody 11A12 (1:100) or the mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 14) (1:100). The binding of antibodies was detected with an IRdye800-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Li-Cor, 1:2000) or donkey anti-mouse IgG (Li-Cor; 1:2000). The intensity of each band was quantified with an Odyssey infrared scanner (Li-Cor). The ratio of GPIHBP1 on the cell surface (680-nm channel) compared with total GPIHBP1 (800-nm channel) was determined for each GPIHBP1 construct and expressed as percentage of the ratio observed with wild-type GPIHBP1. To assess the accessibility of the acidic domain in mutant GPIHBP1 proteins, GPIHBP1-expressing CHO pgsA-745 cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the acidic domain of mouse GPIHBP1 (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (1:400 for 2 h at 4 °C) in ice-cold PBS/Mg/Ca. After washing the cells, the amount of rabbit IgG bound to the cell surface was determined by Western blotting with an IRdye680-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Li-Cor; 1:800). To assess the total amount of GPIHBP1 in cells, we used the goat polyclonal antibody against the S-protein tag (Abcam; 1:1000), followed by an IRdye800-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Li-Cor; 1:5000). Western blots were performed with the Odyssey infrared scanner (Li-Cor). CHO pgsA-745 cells (1 × 106 cells) were electroporated with 2 μg of plasmid and plated on coverslips in 24-well plates. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, blocked with blocking buffer (PBS/Mg/Ca containing 10% donkey serum), and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antiserum against the S-protein tag (Abcam; 1:400). In some experiments, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After washing, the cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize DNA. The images were obtained with an Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 40× objective, an AxioCam MRm, and an ApoTome and were processed with the AxioVision 4.2 software (all from Zeiss). To assess the impact of specific cysteine mutations on the trafficking of GPIHBP1 to the cell surface, CHO pgsA-745 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant human GPIHBP1 constructs, and levels of GPIHBP1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2A) and cells that had been permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2B). Each of the GPIHBP1 mutants (C65A, C68A, C77A, C83A, C89A, C110A, C114A, C130A, C131A, and C136A) was easily detected at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2A). We also assessed the ability of PIPLC to release wild-type and mutant GPIHBP1 proteins from the cell surface. For these experiments, we transfected CHO pgsA-745 cells with wild-type and mutant GPIHBP1 constructs or mouse wild-type and nonglycosylated (N76Q) GPIHBP1 constructs. After 24 h, the cells were treated with PIPLC, and the amount of GPIHBP1 released into the medium was assessed by Western blotting. Nonglycosylated GPIHBP1 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (20Beigneux A.P. Gin P. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Bensadoun A. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1312-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); thus, it was not surprising that the amount of GPIHBP1 released into the medium by PIPLC was lower with the N76Q mutant than with wild-type GPIHBP1 (Fig. 3). Significant amounts of the cysteine mutants could be released from the surface of cells with PIPLC, although the absolute amount released tended to be slightly lower than the amount released from cells expressing wild-type GPIHBP1 (Fig. 3). The amount of GPIHBP1 at the cell surface, relative to the amount in the cells, was also assessed by Western blotting. CHO pgsA-745 cells were transiently transfected with S-protein-tagged wild-type and mutant human GPIHBP1 constructs and S-protein-tagged wild-type and nonglycosylated mouse GPIHBP1 (N76Q) constructs. After incubating the cells with an antibody against the S-protein tag, cell extracts were prepared. The ratio of cell surface expression of GPIHBP1 (as judged by binding of the S-protein antibody) to the total cellular GPIHBP1 expression (as judged by antibody against GPIHBP1) was determined for each GPIHBP1 protein with Western blots (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the amount of the nonglycosylated GPIHBP1 at the cell surface was low, only 31% of the amount of wild-type GPIHBP1 (Fig. 4). The levels of the cysteine mutants at the cell surface also tended to be somewhat lower, ranging from 67 to 87% of wild-type GPIHBP1 (Fig. 4). The fact that significant amounts of the cysteine mutants were expressed at the cell surface allowed us to test their ability to bind LPL. V5-tagged human LPL was incubated with CHO pgsA-745 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant GPIHBP1, and the amount of LPL bound to the cells was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 5). Cells expressing wild-type GPIHBP1 bound LPL avidly, and this binding was largely blocked by heparin (Fig. 5). In contrast, cells expressing the cysteine mutants bound little if any LPL (Fig. 5). We considered the possibility that the absence of LPL binding to the cysteine mutants might be secondary to major conformational changes in GPIHBP1 that would limit accessibility to the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 (i.e. that the altered conformation of the Ly6 domain would cause the acidic domain to be buried). If this were the case, one might reasonably expect to find impaired binding of an anti-acidic domain antiserum to the cysteine mutants. We previously generated a rabbit antiserum against the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 and showed that it blocked LPL binding to GPIHBP1 (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the current study, we tested the ability of that antiserum to bind to wild-type and mutant GPIHBP1 molecules on the surface of live CHO cells. As expected, the rabbit antiserum did not bind to cells that had been transfected with empty vector or to cells expressing a mutant GPIHBP1 in which all of the aspartates and glutamates between residues 38 and 48 were replaced with alanine (D/E(38–48)A) (Fig. 6). However, the antiserum bound equally well to cells expressing wild-type GPIHBP1, GPIHBP1-Q114P, and GPIHBP1-C88A (Fig. 6), suggesting that the acidic domains in those mutants remain accessible to large proteins such as IgG. We generated a new rat monoclonal antibody, 11A12, against mouse GPIHBP1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Antibody 11A12 bound to wild-type GPIHBP1 and to a soluble GPIHBP1 truncated before the GPI-anchoring motif (G198X); however, the antibody did not bind to a soluble GPIHBP1 protein truncated after the last cysteine of the Ly6 domain (N136X) (Fig. 7A). These data suggest that the epitope for antibody 11A12 resides within the carboxyl-terminal portion of GPIHBP1 between residues 136 and 198. Antibody 11A12 did not bind to human GPIHBP1 (not shown). We expressed soluble versions of GPIHBP1 (proteins without a GPI anchor, truncated at residue 198). Soluble GPIHBP1 protein, along with LPL, were incubated with agarose beads coated with antibody 11A12 (Fig. 7B). After washing the beads three times with the incubation buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), the soluble GPIHBP1 (along with any GPIHBP1-bound LPL) was eluted from the agarose beads with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5 (Fig. 7B). The amounts of GPIHBP1 and LPL in each fraction, at each step of the assay, were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 7B). In preliminary studies, we found that the antibody 11A12-coated beads captured GPIHBP1 and that the soluble GPIHBP1 was readily eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5 (Fig. 8A). Not surprisingly, no GPIHBP1 was captured when the beads were coated with control rat IgG (supplemental Fig. S1). The antibody 11A12-coated beads had no ability to bind to LPL in the absence of GPIHBP1 (Fig. 8B). However, LPL was captured by GPIHBP1 when both GPIHBP1 and LPL were incubated with the beads, and both GPIHBP1 and LPL were eluted from the beads with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5 (Fig. 8C). We next used this assay to evaluate LPL binding properties of mutant GPIHBP1 proteins. Changing all of the aspartates and glutamates between residues 38 and 48 to alanine (D/E(38–48)A) abolished the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL in cell-based assays (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas changing all of the aspartates and glutamates between residues 24 and 33 to alanine (D/E(24–33)A) had only small effects on LPL binding (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody-based assay yielded results that were highly consistent with the cell-based assays reported earlier (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When a soluble version of the D/E(24–33)A mutant and LPL were added to the beads, both proteins bound and could be eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5 (Fig. 8D). On the other hand, when the soluble D/E(38–48)A mutant and LPL were incubated with the beads, all of the LPL appeared in the unbound fraction, and only the mutant GPIHBP1 was bound by the beads (Fig. 8E). We also tested the LPL binding properties of a soluble version of GPIHBP1 harboring a Q114P substitution. In cell-based binding assays, this mutation nearly abolishes LPL binding (15Beigneux A.P. Franssen R. Bensadoun A. Gin P. Melford K. Peter J. Walzem R.L. Weinstein M.M. Davies B.S. Kuivenhoven J.A. Kastelein J.J. Fong L.G. Dallinga-Thie G.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with those results, we found that a secreted GPIHBP1 harboring a Q114P mutation could not bind LPL (i.e. GPIHBP1 was bound by the beads, but the LPL appeared in the unbound fraction) (Fig. 8F). In cell-based LPL binding assays (Fig. 5), GPIHBP1 proteins harboring a cysteine-to-alanine mutation could not bind LPL. However, in view of the fact that at least some of the cysteine mutants reached the cell surface less efficiently than wild-type GPIHBP1 (Figs. 3 and 4), we considered it to be important to test the LPL binding properties of the cysteine mutants in the cell-free, monoclonal antibody-based assay (Fig. 9). In these experiments, the soluble version of wild-type GPIHBP1 bound LPL (Fig. 9A), whereas soluble versions of GPIHBP1 with C63A, C75A, C109A, C113A, and C130A mutations did not bind LPL (Fig. 9, B–F). Similarly, soluble versions of GPIHBP1 harboring C66A, C81A, C88A, C129A, or C135A mutations were unable to bind LPL (supplemental Fig. S2). GPIHBP1 is an Ly6 protein of endothelial cells that binds LPL and is crucial for the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (1Beigneux A.P. Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E. Qiao X. Peale P. Bunting S. Walzem R.L. Wong J.S. Blaner W.S. Ding Z.M. Melford K. Wongsiriroj N. Shu X. de Sauvage F. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Bensadoun A. Young S.G. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated that the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 is absolutely required for LPL binding (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the hypothesis that the structural integrity of the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1 also might be required for LPL binding. Our approach was to assess the LPL binding properties of GPIHBP1 mutants harboring cysteine-to-alanine mutations in the Ly6 domain, substitutions that would be predicted to perturb the conserved three-fingered structure of that region. We found that LPL binding was abolished with all 10 of the cysteine mutants, a finding confirmed with two independent assays. In the first assay, we found that cells expressing cysteine mutants could not bind LPL when it was added to the incubation medium. The second assay relied on the development of a new rat monoclonal antibody, 11A12, that binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of mouse GPIHBP1. Antibody 11A12-coated agarose beads readily capture soluble wild-type GPIHBP1, which in turn binds LPL. However, when any of the 10 cysteines in the soluble GPIHBP1 were changed to alanine, the immobilized GPIHBP1 was incapable of binding LPL. We feared that mutation of cysteines within the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1 might prevent GPIHBP1 from trafficking to the cell surface, a result that would have made us completely reliant on the monoclonal antibody-based LPL binding system. Before embarking on our experiments, our fears appeared well founded; mutation of several of the cysteines within CD59 blocked trafficking of the molecule to the cell surface (13Petranka J. Zhao J. Norris J. Tweedy N.B. Ware R.E. Sims P.J. Rosse W.F. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and mutations of cysteines in the ligand-binding repeats of the LDL receptor have similar effects (18Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). However, as it turned out, mutations of cysteines in GPIHBP1 had only minor effects on cell surface expression of GPIHBP1. Under the experimental conditions that we used (CHO cells and GPIHBP1 expression vectors driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter), cell surface expression of the cysteine mutants was at most ∼33% lower than the wild-type proteins. Interestingly, the cysteine mutants reached the cell surface significantly better than a nonglycosylated GPIHBP1 mutant, which is known to be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (20Beigneux A.P. Gin P. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Bensadoun A. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1312-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From the perspective of the current study, the fact that the cysteine mutants reached the cell surface at a relatively high efficiency was a welcome surprise because it meant that we were able to document the LPL binding properties of the cysteine mutants with two completely independent assay systems. The parsimonious interpretation of our findings is that the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL requires both the acidic domain and the Ly6 domain. However, one could conceivably argue that the acidic domain is all that is required for LPL binding and that the Ly6 mutations merely change the conformation of the protein, burying the acidic domain and limiting its accessibility to LPL. However, we think that this scenario is somewhat unlikely, for several reasons. First, the Ly6 domains of two Ly6 family members, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and CD59, are known to participate in ligand binding, and the strong conservation of the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1 supports the idea that it is functionally important. Second, because all 10 cysteine-to-alanine mutations blocked LPL binding, one would have to argue that all 10 of the mutations blocked accessibility of the acidic domain in a very similar fashion, and that seems unlikely to us. Third, the binding of an anti-acidic domain antiserum to a GPIHBP1-C88A mutant was normal, making it unlikely that the acidic domain is buried and inaccessible to LPL. Each of these considerations leads us to suspect that both the acidic domain and the Ly6 domain have essential roles in LPL binding. We speculate that the highly acidic domain in GPIHBP1 (which is always present but is poorly conserved in terms of its precise amino acid sequence) may represent a rather promiscuous “negatively charged bait” for attracting positively charged proteins and that the “lock and key” specificity for LPL binding may depend on the Ly6 domain. If we are correct in our suggestion that two different domains in GPIHBP1 participate in LPL binding, then what about LPL? Does LPL have two GPIHBP1-binding domains? The principal heparin-binding domain of LPL involves several positively charged residues (Lys430, Arg432, Lys434, Lys440, and Lys441) and is required for LPL binding to negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (5Sendak R.A. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These very same amino acid residues are required for the binding of LPL to GPIHBP1 (17Gin P. Yin L. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Ryan R.O. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G. Young S.G. Beigneux A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29554-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of course, these findings beg the question of which region of LPL interacts with the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1. By analogy with the two-domain scenario for GPIHBP1, it is tempting to speculate that two GPIHBP1-binding domains exist in LPL and that the Ly6-binding domain still needs to be identified. Ultimately, crystallographic studies of GPIHBP1-LPL interactions will likely be required for definitive answers. Several missense mutations in SLURP1 have been identified in association with Mal de Meleda, the recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (16Favre B. Plantard L. Aeschbach L. Brakch N. Christen-Zaech S. de Viragh P.A. Sergeant A. Huber M. Hohl D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of these mutations, C77R and C99Y, involve the seventh and tenth cysteine, respectively, of the Ly6 domain); another involves the introduction of a proline adjacent to a conserved cysteine (L98P) (16Favre B. Plantard L. Aeschbach L. Brakch N. Christen-Zaech S. de Viragh P.A. Sergeant A. Huber M. Hohl D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter mutation was intriguing because we have already identified, in a human patient with severe chylomicronemia, a GPIHBP1 mutation involving the introduction of a proline adjacent to a cysteine (15Beigneux A.P. Franssen R. Bensadoun A. Gin P. Melford K. Peter J. Walzem R.L. Weinstein M.M. Davies B.S. Kuivenhoven J.A. Kastelein J.J. Fong L.G. Dallinga-Thie G.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). That mutation, Q115P, dramatically reduced the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL. Our current findings, along with the Mal de Meleda experience (16Favre B. Plantard L. Aeschbach L. Brakch N. Christen-Zaech S. de Viragh P.A. Sergeant A. Huber M. Hohl D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), should prompt human geneticists to look for mutations in conserved cysteines in GPIHBP1 in human patients with chylomicronemia. Indeed, while we were preparing this manuscript, Dallinga-Thie et al. (21Dallinga-Thie G.M. Beigneux A.P. Franssen R. Hertecant J. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Kastelein J.J. Bensadoun A. Fong L.G.

https://openalex.org/W2137180907,"The general idea that optical radiation may cool matter was put forward by Pringsheim already in 1929. Doppler cooling of dilute atomic gases is an extremely successful application of this concept, and more recently anti-Stokes cooling in multilevel systems has been explored, culminating in the optical refrigeration of solids. Collisional redistribution of radiation is a proposed different cooling mechanism that involves atomic two-level systems, though experimental investigations in gases with moderate density have so far not reached the cooling regime. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of an atomic gas based on collisional redistribution of radiation, using rubidium atoms subject to 230 bar of argon buffer gas pressure. The frequent collisions in the ultradense gas transiently shift a far red detuned laser beam into resonance, while spontaneous decay occurs close to the unperturbed atomic resonance frequency. During each excitation cycle, a kinetic energy of order of the thermal energy k_B T is extracted from the dense atomic sample. In a proof of principle experiment with a thermally non-isolated sample, we experimentally demonstrate relative cooling by 66 K. The cooled gas has a density of more than 10 orders of magnitude above the typical values in Doppler cooling experiments, and the cooling power reaches 87 mW. Future prospects of the demonstrated effect include studies of supercooling beyond the homogeneous nucleation temperature and optical chillers."
https://openalex.org/W2005930974,"Background Often described as an extremely rare zoonosis, cowpox virus (CPXV) infections are on the increase in Germany. CPXV is rodent-borne with a broad host range and contains the largest and most complete genome of all poxviruses, including parts with high homology to variola virus (smallpox). So far, most CPXV cases have occurred individually in unvaccinated animals and humans and were caused by genetically distinguishable virus strains. Methodology/Principal Findings Generalized CPXV infections in banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) and jaguarundis (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) at a Zoological Garden were observed with a prevalence of the affected animal group of 100% and a mortality of 30%. A subsequent serological investigation of other exotic animal species provided evidence of subclinical cases before the onset of the outbreak. Moreover, a time-delayed human cowpox virus infection caused by the identical virus strain occurred in a different geographical area indicating that handling/feeding food rats might be the common source of infection. Conclusions/Significance Reports on the increased zoonotic transmission of orthopoxviruses have renewed interest in understanding interactions between these viruses and their hosts. The list of animals known to be susceptible to CPXV is still growing. Thus, the likely existence of unknown CPXV hosts and their distribution may present a risk for other exotic animals but also for the general public, as was shown in this outbreak. Animal breeders and suppliers of food rats represent potential multipliers and distributors of CPXV, in the context of increasingly pan-European trading. Taking the cessation of vaccination against smallpox into account, this situation contributes to the increased incidence of CPXV infections in man, particularly in younger age groups, with more complicated courses of clinical infections."

https://openalex.org/W2112467695,"Lplastin, a conserved modular F-actin bundling protein, is ectopically expressed in tumor cells and contributes to cell malignancy and invasion. The underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear, in part, because specific inhibitors of Lplastin are lacking. We used recombinant alpaca-derived L plastin single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) as effector of Lplastin function in cells. Key findings were compared with Lplastin down-regulation by RNAi. We show that nanobodies strongly interact with Lplastin by targeting discrete conformational epitopes with nano-molar affinity. A nanobody that selectively interacts with the tandem ABDs in L-plastin completely inhibits F-actin bundling at equimolar ratios, in contrast to a control green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobody. This “knockout” nanobody inhibits filopodia formation, motility, and invasion when expressed in PC-3 cells. Lplastin RNA interference showed no significant effect on filopodial integrity and only marginally restrained the motile properties of cells. L-plastin nano-bodies uniquely expose a fundamental role for this protein in filopodia formation and cell migration. Therefore, these molecules represent a potent instrument to ablate functions of structural proteins without manipulating gene expression. In addition, we show that they can be instrumental in uncovering new functions of proteins that remain obscured by RNAi.—Delanote, V., Vanloo, B., Catillon, M., Friederich, E., Vandekerckhove, J., Gettemans, J.

https://openalex.org/W2067274612,"Background Climate change directly affects species by altering their physical environment and indirectly affects species by altering interspecific interactions such as predation and competition. Recent studies have shown that the indirect effects of climate change may amplify or counteract the direct effects. However, little is known about the the relative strength of direct and indirect effects or their potential to impact population persistence. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the effects of altered precipitation and interspecific interactions on the low-density tiller growth rates and biomass production of three perennial grass species in a Kansas, USA mixed prairie. We transplanted plugs of each species into local neighborhoods of heterospecific competitors and then exposed the plugs to a factorial manipulation of growing season precipitation and neighbor removal. Precipitation treatments had significant direct effects on two of the three species. Interspecific competition also had strong effects, reducing low-density tiller growth rates and aboveground biomass production for all three species. In fact, in the presence of competitors, (log) tiller growth rates were close to or below zero for all three species. However, we found no convincing evidence that per capita competitive effects changed with precipitation, as shown by a lack of significant precipitation × competition interactions. Conclusions/Significance We found little evidence that altered precipitation will influence per capita competitive effects. However, based on species' very low growth rates in the presence of competitors in some precipitation treatments, interspecific interactions appear strong enough to affect the balance between population persistence and local extinction. Therefore, ecological forecasting models should include the effect of interspecific interactions on population growth, even if such interaction coefficients are treated as constants."

Our objective was to assess whether changing incidence of type 1 diabetes in a group of children and adolescent from the Midwest United States was associated with changes in BMI.Data from 1618 (52.1% M/47.9% F) newly-diagnosed children and adolescents (<19 years) with T1DM, admitted to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) between January 1995 and December 2004, was analyzed in relationship to body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS).An overall, 10-year cumulative incidence of 27.92 per 100,000 (19.12 to 41.72/100,000) was observed, with an average yearly cumulative incidence of 2.39%. The increase was largest in the younger age groups, 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 having an average yearly increase of 2.4, 2.3, and 3.0%, respectively, corresponding to a relative 10-year increase of 25.3, 33.8, and 38.0%, respectively. Age at diagnosis was inversely correlated with BMI SDS (p<0.001) and remained significant for both males and females.Annual incidence of T1DM increased two-fold at CHW over the 10-year study period. The majority of the increase was observed in the youngest age groups, which also appeared to be the heaviest. This research adds to the growing literature supporting the hypothesis that excess weight gain during childhood may be a risk factor for early manifestation of T1DM."
https://openalex.org/W1971952583,"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) activate cellular receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKS) such as VEGFR-1, -2, and -3. These receptors are activated upon ligand binding to the extracellular receptor domain (ECD), resulting in receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular kinase domain. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of activation of the human VEGFR-2 expressed in human HEK293, monkey COS-1, and porcine aortic endothe-lial cells. To study the role of dimerization in receptor activation we created a series of dimerization-promoting transmembrane domain (TMD) mutants lacking the extracellular domain. The TMDs consisted of 23 valine and 2 glutamic acid residues spaced 7 aa apart in different positions of the transmembrane helix. All TMDs dimerized VEGFR-2, each in a specific orientation, giving rise to a series of either active or inactive receptor dimers. One particular TMD, V6/13E, gave rise to highly active kinase dimers, while all the other dimerizing TMD mutant receptors had 6- to 10-fold lower activity. When the V6/13E TMD was introduced into the full-length receptor in place of the native TMD, it promoted ligand-independent activation. Nonactivating TMDs, on the other hand, gave rise to inactive receptor mutants, both in the absence and in the presence of VEGF. These data demonstrate that dimer-ization is necessary, but not sufficient, for receptor activation, and that ligand-mediated receptor activation requires specific orientation of receptor monomers. Our study also shows that dimerization is mimicked by distinct dimerization-promoting TMDs that position the intracellular kinase domain either in an active or inactive conformation.—Dell'Era Dosch, D., Ballmer-Hofer, K.

https://openalex.org/W2071913562,"Background Dysfunctions of the prefrontal cortex have been previously reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies reported that first-degree relatives of individuals with ASD show atypical brain activity during tasks associated with social function. However, developmental changes in prefrontal dysfunction in ASD and genetic influences on the phenomena remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex as measured with near-infrared spectroscopy, in children and adults with ASD during the letter fluency test. Moreover, to clarify the genetic influences on developmental changes in the prefrontal dysfunction in ASD, unaffected siblings of the ASD participants were also assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings Study participants included 27 individuals with high-functioning ASD, age- and IQ-matched 24 healthy non-affected siblings, and 27 unrelated healthy controls aged 5 to 39 years. The relative concentration of hemoglobin ([Hb]) in the prefrontal cortex was measured during the letter fluency task. For children, neither the [oxy-Hb] change during the task nor task performances differed significantly among three groups. For adults, the [oxy-Hb] increases during the task were significantly smaller in the bilateral prefrontal cortex in ASD than those in control subjects, although task performances were similar. In the adult siblings the [oxy-Hb] change was intermediate between those in controls and ASDs. Conclusion/Significance Although indirectly due to a cross-sectional design, the results of this study indicate altered age-related change of prefrontal activity during executive processing in ASD. This is a first near-infrared spectroscopy study that implies alteration in the age-related changes of prefrontal activity in ASD and genetic influences on the phenomena."

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inducible disease in laboratory animals and a widely accepted model of MS. EAE is induced by autoreactive CD4+ T cells specific for myelin antigens or by immunization with myelin antigens or their peptide fragments. Proteolipid protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and especially MBP are candidate autoantigens in MS. Immunoreactive MBP fragments appear in the cerebrospinal fluid in MS patients (4Hellings N. Barée M. Verhoeven C. D'hooghe M.B. Medaer R. Bernard C.C. Raus J. Stinissen P. J. Neurosci.

There are three transcription start sites in the MBP gene. Transcription from the first site generates Golli-BG21 and -J37. The classic MBP isoforms are transcribed from the two downstream sites (7Feng J.M. Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of the common exons, the fragmentation of the MBP isoforms can generate similar immunogenic peptides, including the fragment of the 1–15-residue immunogenic region and a source of a dominant T cell clonotype in EAE (8Menezes J.S. van den Elzen P.

The expression of the classic MBP transcripts is restricted to myelin-forming cells. BG21 and J37 are expressed in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (7Feng J.M. Neurochem.

Crystallin αB (CRYAB), a member of the small heat shock protein family (12van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. Bajramovic J.J. el Ouagmiri M. Polman C.H. Lassmann H. Ravid R. Nature. 1995; 375: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), also plays an important role in EAE acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system. As a result, CRYAB−/− mice show worse EAE (13Ousman S.S. Tomooka B.H. van Noort J.M. Wawrousek E.F. O'Connor K.C. Hafler D.A. Sobel R.A. Robinson W.H. Steinman L. Nature. 2007; 448: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Antibodies against CRYAB are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients and in the serum from EAE mice (14Stoevring B.

Furin, PC1/3, PC2, PC4, PC5/6, PC7, and PACE4 proprotein convertases (PCs) selectively cleave the RX(K/R/X)R sequence motif and transform inactive precursors into biologically active proteins and peptides (15Seidah N.G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). PCs are synthesized as pre-proproteins in which the N-terminal prodomain functions as an autoinhibitor. To become active, PCs autoproteolytically remove the prodomain (16Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Self-activated PCs are then capable of activating the downstream proteinases, including MMPs. Because of the overlapping substrate preferences and cell/tissue expression, there is a level of redundancy in the functionality of PCs (17Scamuffa N. Calvo F. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M.

In MS, MMPs could be responsible for the influx of inflammatory mononuclear cells into the central nervous system, contribute to myelin destruction, and affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (20Rosenberg G.A. Neuroscientist. 2002; 8: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Rosenberg G.A. Lancet Neurol. 2009; 8: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). MMPs comprise a family of 24 enzymes that are expressed by many cell types, especially in malignancy and inflammation. Membrane-tethered MMPs are distinguished from soluble MMPs by the additional transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (MT1–3-MMP and MT5-MMP). In contrast to these four MMPs, MT6-MMP/MMP-25 is attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. All MMPs are synthesized as zymogens and require proteolytic removal of the N-terminal prodomain to become active proteinases. Lipid raft-associated MMP-25 with the RX(K/R)R motif in its propeptide is activated by furin (16Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 22Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Among MMPs, the expression of MMP-25 (initially called leukolysin) is most selectively linked to the leukocyte lineage cells and up-regulated in certain cancer types, including brain tumors (23Sohail A. Sun Q. Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Cho J.A. Fridman R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because BG21 relocates to the caveolae-enriched lipid rafts upon phorbol ester stimulation of T cells (24Feng J.M. Fernandes A.O. Campagnoni C.W. Hu Y.H. Campagnoni A.T. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 152: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the presence of both BG21 and MMP-25 in the lipid raft compartment increases the opportunity for the selective MMP-25 proteolysis of the Golli proteins in the stimulated immune system cells. Earlier, we determined that MMP-25 was superior to all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms (25Shiryaev S.A. Savinov A.Y. Cieplak P. Ratnikov B.I. Motamedchaboki K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that MMP-25 proteolysis of the MBP isoforms generated, with a near quantitative yield, the immunogenic N-terminal 1–15-residue peptide. This peptide selectively stimulated the proliferation of the PGPR7.5 T cell clone isolated from mice with EAE and specific for the 1–15-residue peptide. Consistent with our results, MMP-25 is up-regulated in the spinal cord of mice with EAE induced by adoptive transfer of MBP-reactive T cells (26Toft-Hansen H. Babcock A.A. Millward J.M. Owens T. J. Neuroinflammation. 2007; 4: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We now hypothesized that persistent inflammation caused by viral and bacterial infections is an integral step to both MMP-25 activation and Golli-MBP degradation and to the onset of autoimmune MS. To test our hypothesis, we demonstrated that LPS caused the up-regulation of PCs, MMP-25, and BG21 in the antigen-presenting macrophages. These events correlated with both the enhanced specific proteolysis of BG21 (a positive regulator of MS) and, simultaneously, the proteolytic inactivation of CRYAB (a negative regulator of MS) and to the presentation of the fragmented MBP sequence by the activated macrophages, thus stimulating the activation and proliferation of the reactive T cell populations resulting in autoimmunity and leading to MS. Collectively, our experimental results suggest that persistent inflammation caused by viruses and bacteria stimulates the PC/MMP-25/BG21 proteolytic pathway in the activated antigen-presenting cells and that these events represent a step to MS. As a result of our studies and because of its both restricted cell/tissue expression pattern and cell surface localization, we have concluded that MMP-25 is a novel and promising drug target in MS.

The primer sequence we used for the RT-PCR amplification of furin, PC1/3, PC2, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 (the calculated size of the PCR products was as follows: 399, 457, 261, 456, 510, and 471 bp, respectively) was reported earlier (32Cheng M. Watson P.H. Paterson J.A. Seidah N. Chrétien M. Shiu R.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

Total RNA was isolated from intact RAW264.7 cells or cells treated for 24 h with 1 μg/ml LPS using a TRIzol reagent and then additionally purified using a mini RNA Isolation II kit column (ZymoResearch). The purified RNA samples (250 ng) were used in the amplification reactions (normally, 30–35 cycles) containing the specific primers (600 nm), Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and TaqDNA polymerase, or a One-Step RT-PCR system (Qiagen). The resulting PCR products were sequenced to confirm their authenticity. Murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 300 bp) was used as a control. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen). RNA (3.0 μg) was primed with oligo(dT) and then reverse-transcribed using the QuantiTech reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Q-RT-PCR was performed using an Mx3000p instrument (Stratagene). The cDNA (25 ng) and the primers (400 nm) were used in the duplicate 30-μl reactions with the 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of the primers is shown in supplemental Table S1. PCRs (40 cycles) were performed using 15 s of denaturing at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 58 °C, and 30 s of elongation at 72 °C. PCR product amplification was monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence and normalized relative to the Rox dye standard. A standard curve was generated with β-actin primers for each tested cDNA sample, and it proved to be linear over 4 orders of magnitude. This curve was used to determine the relative differences in cDNA from changes in CT (cycle threshold) values. Cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum in LabTek chamber slides were fixed 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked using 2% bovine serum albumin. For PC2 staining cells were additionally permeabilized for 4 min using 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with the primary polyclonal antibodies (dilution 1:500–1:1000) followed by a 2-h incubation with the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). The slides were mounted in the Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for the nuclear staining. Images were acquired at a ×400 magnification on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus MagnaFire digital camera and the MagnaFire 2.1C software. Frozen brain sections from 10 healthy patients and 10 patients with MS were stained with the SMI94 and SMI99 MBP and the 11-5B CNPase antibodies followed by a diaminobenzidine-based detection method employing the Envision Plus horseradish peroxidase system (DakoCytomation) and an automated Dako immunostainer. The slides were counterstained, dehydrated, and mounted with permanent mounting media. For all tissues examined, the immunostaining procedure was done in parallel using the preimmune serum. To generate the heat map and the hierarchical clustering of MMPs and their physiological inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1, -2, -3, and -4 and RECK), the neurocrine data set (NCBI GEO code GSE3526) of the genome-wide profiling of 356 samples of 65 normal tissue types was used. The original raw array data were processed using the RMA algorithm and further normalized and analyzed using GeneSpring and the HCE program (33Seo J. Shneiderman B. Computer. 2002; 35: 80-86Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The processed data were then normalized per every chip and gene using the default procedure in GeneSpring. Per chip normalization was to the 50th percentile. Per gene normalization was to the median. Hierarchical clustering of the array data (log10 data) was computed using the average linkage (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) and correlation distance measure options of the HCE program (33Seo J. Shneiderman B. Computer. 2002; 35: 80-86Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Clustering of the tissue types was done using the whole gene set. The subset of genes was then extracted, and the clustering of genes was performed within the individual tissue types. MBP, BG21, J37, and CRYAB (10 μm each) were co-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the individual MMPs (1–100 nm; 1:100–1:10,000 enzyme/substrate molar ratio) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 μm ZnCl2. MBP, BG21, and J37 (∼10 μm each) were also co-incubated for 3 h with furin (1:4 enzyme/substrate molar ratio) and PC2 (3–12 activity units) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.6, respectively, both supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Brij-35. One activity unit was equal to the amount of the enzyme that was required to cleave 1 pmol/min of the pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide substrate at 37 °C. Where indicated GM6001 (2.5 μm) and dec-RVKR-cmk (5 μm) were added to the reactions to inhibit MMPs and PCs, respectively. The cleavage reactions were stopped using a 5× SDS sample buffer. The digest samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS using an Autoflex II MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). For MS analysis, the reactions were cooled on ice, and equal volumes of a sample and of a sinapic acid (20 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution were co-crystallized directly on the MALDI target plate and allowed to dry for 5 min. Mass spectra were processed with FlexAnalysis 2.4. The singly charged cleavage products, which were observed only in the cleavage reactions but not in the controls, were recorded and processed further. The synthetic peptide 102VRRRRRYALS (1332 Da) that spans the furin cleavage sites in the human MMP-25 prodomain was synthesized by GenScript. The peptide (1.5 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with furin or PC2 (1 activity unit each) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.6, respectively, both supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Brij-35. The mass of the intact peptide and the 102VRRRRR cleavage product (898 kDa) was determined by MALDI-TOF MS. dec-RVKR-cmk (5 μm) was added to the reactions to inhibit the PC activity. For mass spectrometric analysis, equal volumes of a sample and of an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (20 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution were co-crystallized directly on the MALDI target plate and allowed to dry for 5 min. To predict and rank the MMP and furin cleavage sites in the CRYAB, MBP, BG21, and J37 sequence, we used a specialized computer program we have developed and validated earlier (25Shiryaev S.A. Savinov A.Y. Cieplak P. Ratnikov B.I. Motamedchaboki K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, the E. coli-derived BG21 and J37 samples were purified using an Affinity Pak Detoxi-Gel kit (Thermo Scientific) to remove LPS. MBP, BG21, and J37 (5 μm each) were digested for 1 h at 37 °C by the individual MMPs (an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:100) or for 3 h with furin (an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:4). The irradiated splenocytes from B10.PL mice (1 × 106) were co-incubated for 1 h with the digest reactions. As controls, intact MBP, BG21, and J37 and the murine MBP-(2–18)/Golli-MBP-(135–151)-peptide ASQKRPSQRSKYLATAS (5 μm each) were used. The CD4+ T cells (5 × 105; clone PGPR7.5) specific for murine 1–15-residue peptide presented in the major histocompatibility complex H-2U context were then added to the reactions for 72 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi) was added to the cells for 14 h. The incorporation of the label into the T cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting. MS is characterized by the active degradation of the myelin sheath resulting in the multiple regions of focal myelin loss (lesions or plaques) in the central nervous system and by infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes that are reactive against myelin antigens. The results of our Western blotting and immunostaining studies support these conclusions and show the loss of MBP in the chronic active plaques of MS patients. The decrease in MBP correlates both with the presence of the phagocytic macrophages, which co-localize with fragmented MBP, and with a loss of oligodendrocytes in the plaque (Fig. 1). To support the characteristic association of MMP-25 (leukolysin) with the bone marrow-derived leukocyte lineage cells, we analyzed the publicly available data of the genome-wide profiling of 356 samples of 65 normal human tissues each of which included over 47,000 human gene transcripts. A subset of the resulting data that relates to the human MMPs and their physiological inhibitors (TIMPs and RECK) indicates a unique association of MMP-25 with the bone marrow (Fig. 2). Indeed, MMP-25 is the only MMP that is highly e"
https://openalex.org/W2058508891,"Background Type 2 diabetes develops due to a combination of insulin resistance and β-cell failure and current therapeutics aim at both of these underlying causes. Several negative regulators of insulin signaling are known and are the subject of drug discovery efforts. We sought to identify novel contributors to insulin resistance and hence potentially novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Methodology An arrayed cDNA library encoding 18,441 human transcripts was screened for inhibitors of insulin signaling and revealed known inhibitors and numerous potential novel regulators. The novel hits included proteins of various functional classes such as kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors, and GTPase associated proteins. A series of secondary assays confirmed the relevance of the primary screen hits to insulin signaling and provided further insight into their modes of action. Conclusion/Significance Among the novel hits was PALD (KIAA1274, paladin), a previously uncharacterized protein that when overexpressed led to inhibition of insulin's ability to down regulate a FOXO1A-driven reporter gene, reduced upstream insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, and decreased insulin receptor (IR) abundance. Conversely, knockdown of PALD gene expression resulted in increased IR abundance, enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, and an improvement in insulin's ability to suppress FOXO1A-driven reporter gene activity. The present data demonstrate that the application of arrayed genome-wide screening technologies to insulin signaling is fruitful and is likely to reveal novel drug targets for insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2068121747,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP-dependent efflux pump involved in transport of xenobiotics from cells that, when overexpressed, can mediate multidrug resistance in mammalian cells. Pgp may be a candidate target for new anthelmintics, as it plays critical roles in normal cell physiology, in removal of drugs from cells, and potentially in the development of drug resistance. Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, which affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Here, we express SMDR2, a Pgp homologue from Schistosoma mansoni (Platyhelminthes), in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and use fluorescence-based assays to examine the functional and pharmacological properties of this transporter. Membrane vesicles from stably transfected CHO cells expressing recombinant SMDR2 show significant increases in rhodamine transport and ATP hydrolysis compared with those from control cells or cells transfected with empty vector. SMDR2-mediated transport is inhibited by the Pgp modulators verapamil (IC(50)=12.1 muM) and nifedipine, and also by praziquantel, the current drug of choice against schisotosomiasis (IC(50)=17.4 muM). Efflux measurements of a fluorescent analog of praziquantel indicate that it is also a substrate for SMDR2. The interaction of praziquantel with SMDR2 may offer new strategies for potentiating the action of praziquantel and possibly overcoming drug resistance."

Accurate segregation of newly replicated plasmids or bacterial sister chromosomes is achieved by evolutionarily distinct stabilization systems (for review, see 1Sherratt D.J.

The mechanisms of stable maintenance of low copy number plasmids can be divided into those that function (i) by enhancing the resolution of oligomers into monomers, with the subsequent increase of the number of molecules to be segregated; (ii) by blocking proliferation of plasmid-free segregants; or (iii) by partitioning plasmid copies to daughter cells at cell division (4Alonso J.C.

The majority of the plasmid partition systems include two trans-acting homodimeric proteins (one binds a nucleotide cofactor and the other the centromere) and one or more cis-acting centromere-like sequences (for review, see 2Leonard T.A. Møller-Jensen J. Löwe J. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Thanbichler M. Shapiro L. Nat. Rev.

There are three types of nucleotide-binding proteins: type I or ParA ATPases, type II or ParM (actin-like) ATPases, and type III or TubZ (tubulin-like) GTPases. The mechanisms that underlie the accurate partitioning of plasmid DNA by the type I and type III motor proteins are still largely unknown (2Leonard T.A. Møller-Jensen J. Löwe J. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Thanbichler M. Shapiro L. Nat. Rev.

Centromere binding is performed by one of three well studied protein types. The large type Ia proteins recognize the cognate sequence via a helix-turn-helix domain and spread along the DNA up to several kilobases (7Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Kim S.K. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8557-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Rodionov O. Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. Science. 1999; 283: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The small type Ib and type II proteins recognize their cognate site via an antiparallel β-sheet of the ribbon-helix-helix fold and do not seem to spread from a cognate site into a nonspecific DNA sequence. The type Ib proteins (e.g. pSM19035-ω2) have an unstructured N-terminal domain required for activation of polymerization of ParA pSM19035-δ2 onto parS DNA (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas the type II proteins have an extended C-terminal region involved in interaction with ParM (e.g. pSK41-ParR) (6Schumacher M.A. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The presence of a centromere-binding protein and a centromere sequence in the type III partition system remains undetermined. To gain insight into the general mechanism that manages accurate ParAB-dependent partitioning of type Ib plasmids at cell division and to compare them with type II plasmids in bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum, the early stages of partitioning of the Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pSM19035 were dissected in vitro. pSM19035, which has extraordinarily long inverted repeat sequences that comprise about 80% of the genome, has 2 ± 1 copies/cell and is stably maintained (11Ceglowski P.

The par loci of pSM19035 encode two trans-acting proteins, found as homodimers in solution (δ2 (ParA type I) and ω2 (ParB type Ib)), and six cis-acting ω2 target sites (parS centromeres) (14de la Hoz A.B.

The parS centromeres overlap with the upstream region of the promoter (P) of δ (Pδ or parS1), ω (Pω or parS2) and copS (Pcop or parS3) genes and are present twice in the pSM19035 genome (14de la Hoz A.B.

Each parS centromere (parS1, parS1′, parS2, parS2′, parS3, and parS3′) consists of 9, 7, and 10 contiguous iterons, respectively, in direct ▶ or ◀ inverse orientation with sequence 5′-WATCACW-3′. The centromeric-binding protein ω2 binds one iteron or a non-parS control site with very low affinity (kD ∼ 1000 nm); however, it binds two iterons (kD ∼ 20 ± 2 nm) or full-length parS sites (kD ∼ 5 ± 1 nm) with high affinity and cooperatively. By binding to the centromeric sequences, ω2 acts as a specific transcription factor, required for the correction of downward fluctuations of plasmid copy number control; the expression of the ϵ and ζ proteins needed for blocking proliferation of plasmid-free segregants (16Meinhart A.

Protein ω2 forms a nucleoprotein complex at the centromere sites without apparent distortion (14) (Fig. 1B). In the presence of ATP·Mg2+, δ2 (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 is an ATPase with sequence-independent DNA binding activity (kD of ∼170 ± 20 nm) (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 does not appear to participate in regulating the par locus, leaving this function entirely to ω2 (14de la Hoz A.B. Ayora S. Sitkiewicz I. Fernandez S. Pankiewicz R. Alonso J.C. Ceglowski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The first 19 N-terminal residues of ω2 (ω2ΔN19) are dispensable, both in vivo and in vitro, for binding to parS DNA (18Welfle K. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Alonso J.C. Welfle H. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 881-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The structures of ω2ΔN19 alone or in complex with two iterons in direct (▶ ▶) or inverted (▶ ◀) orientations have been determined (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W.

Extrapolating from these structures, we predict that ω2 molecules assemble as a left-handed protein helix to wrap around the parS sites on B-form DNA (see Fig. 1B). To test the crystal structure model (Fig. 1B) and to gain insight into the architectural requirement, AFM 3The abbreviation used is: AFMatomic force microscopy. studies were performed. Here, we report the visualization of nucleoprotein complexes formed by ω2 on linear or circular parS DNA and its dynamic interaction with (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 to form the partition complex.

Proteins ω2, ω2ΔN19, ω2T29A, δ2, δ2K36A, and δ2D60A and plasmid-borne parS3 DNA (pUC57) were purified as described (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14de la Hoz A.B. Ayora S. Sitkiewicz I. Fernandez S. Pankiewicz R. Alonso J.C. Ceglowski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Wild-type or mutant variants of ω2, or δ2 were incubated with linear (EcoRI-cleaved) or supercoiled parS DNA (25 nm in DNA molecules) for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2,50 mm KCl) containing 1 mm ATP. When indicated, δ2 variants were incubated with preformed ω2 (variants)·parS DNA complexes. The solution was diluted in buffer A and spotted onto freshly cleaved mica treated with 10 mm spermidine for 20 min at room temperature. The mica was washed several times with Milli-Q water and dried with nitrogen. AFM was performed using a Nanoscope IIIa or IV microscope (Digital Instruments) in air using the tapping mode. The cantilever (OMCL-AC160TS-W2; Olympus) was 160 mm in length with a spring constant of 33–62 N/m. The scanning frequency was 1–2 Hz, and images were captured with the height mode in a 512 × 512-pixel format. The images obtained were plane-fitted and flattened by the computer program accompanying the imaging module. In the geometrical analyses of AFM images of DNA and protein, the “tip effect” was removed by using the apparent size of DNA as a reference (20Nettikadan S. Tokumasu F. Takeyasu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Hizume K. Yoshimura S.H. Takeyasu K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12978-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the apparent dimensions of the molecules obtained by AFM depend on the radius of the tip curvature and are apparently larger than the real dimensions. The relationship among the width of the globular molecule in the AFM image (W), the radius of the tip curvature (Rc), and the radius of the molecule (Rm) is given by W = 4(RcRm)1/2. When two different molecules with Rm1 and Rm2 radii are imaged with the same tip, the relationship between the measured widths (W1 and W2) can be given by W1 = W2(Rm1/Rm2)1/2. Because the diameter of a DNA molecule is known (2 nm), we used the established parameter in our AFM image calculations as W1. We could then calculate the radius of the particles (Rm2) from the apparent width of the DNA (W2). The image processing and analysis was carried out using Image SXM (22Barrett S.D. Image SXM. 2008; (version 1.89)Google Scholar). The length of the complexes was measured at half-maximal height to compensate for distortions introduced by the tip geometry (see 23Pietrasanta L.I. Thrower D. Hsieh W. Rao S. Stemmann O. Lechner J. Carbon J. Hansma H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3757-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The theoretical volume of the proteins was calculated assuming that they were globular (24Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and the volume measurements were done as described previously (25Margeat E. Le Grimellec C. Royer C.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2712-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Vesenka J. Guthold M. Tang C.L. Keller D. Delaine E. Bustamante C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To study the type of nucleoprotein complexes formed by wild-type ω2 with full-length parS site on linear or supercoiled DNA, AFM experiments were performed. The 70-bp parS DNA consists of 10 contiguous iterons (heptads) organized in three blocks of two 7-bp direct repeats and one 7-bp inverted repeat, plus one direct repeat (▶ ▶ ◀ ▶ ▶ ◀ ▶ ▶ ◀ ▶) (14de la Hoz A.B. Ayora S. Sitkiewicz I. Fernandez S. Pankiewicz R. Alonso J.C. Ceglowski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The measured length of the linear DNA agreed with the expected value (∼966 nm) for a 2927-bp DNA with a 0.33-nm rise/bp. The parS site was located 120 bp from one end. No end showed any apparent curvature. Increasing concentrations of ω2 incubated with a fixed concentration of linear parS (1–20 ω2 molecules/DNA molecule) gave rise to an increased number of similar protein·DNA complexes, with a concomitant decrease in the number of protein-free DNA molecules (data not shown). The optimal ratio for limiting ω2 concentrations and lower amount of protein-free DNA molecules was observed in the presence of ∼7 ω2 molecules/parS site (7.2 ω2/DNA molecule) (Fig. 2A). A visual inspection of the images revealed that DNA molecules with bound ω2 contained only one discrete straight complex at the parS site (Fig. 2, A and B). The distance between the ω2·parS complex and the nearest end had a mean value of 31.2 ± 5.0 nm (Fig. 2C). This was consistent with a length of 120 bp (theoretical value of 39.6 nm) if a minor ω2 spread (<15 bp toward the 5′ end of the repeats) was taken into consideration (see 15de la Hoz A.B. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Speck C. Weihofen W. Welfle K. Saenger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed at ∼20 ω2/DNA molecule (data not shown). The interaction of ω2 with supercoiled parS DNA was examined (Fig. 2D). Similar results were observed when ω2 was bound to supercoiled DNA or when the DNA was nicked prior to examination; the latter results, which simplified the interpretation, are shown. In the presence of 7.2 ω2/DNA molecule, one nucleoprotein complex/circular DNA molecule could be clearly identified (Fig. 2D). Inspection of the images revealed that the DNA molecule with bound protein contained one discrete ω2·parS complex without apparent distortion of parS (Fig. 2D). The size of the ω2·parS complex was analyzed by measuring the length and width of ω2 bound to linear or circular DNA (n = 70 and 100, respectively). The mean height of the DNA was 0.23 nm (data not shown), which deviated from the theoretical height for double-stranded DNA (2 nm), confirming that DNA is usually seen smaller than the sample itself in AFM images (25Margeat E. Le Grimellec C. Royer C.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2712-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Vesenka J. Guthold M. Tang C.L. Keller D. Delaine E. Bustamante C. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 42–44: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27Wyman C. Grotkopp E. Bustamante C. Nelson H.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apparent length (26.3 ± 3.3 nm on linear and 25.8 ± 3.4 nm on circular DNA) of the complexes observed in AFM images is consistent with the length of the parS centromere (70 bp) covered by ω2 (Fig. 3, A and B). To calculate the width of the complexes, the width of the DNA was plotted against the width of the protein·DNA complexes in the same image. On average, the analyzed complexes were 4.05 ± 0.83 nm and 4.89 ± 1.18 nm wide for linear and circular DNA, respectively (n = 39). The structure of ω2 bound to mini-parS DNA shows that the protein wraps around the DNA (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), forming a cylindrical structure with similar height and width. Therefore, the volume was also calculated assuming a cylindrical shape of the complex and using the width value obtained as described above. The volume of ω2·parS DNA complexes calculated in this way was 180–320 nm3 (n = 100), consistent to the expected (∼235 nm3 assuming that the theoretical volume of ω2 was 19.8 nm3 plus the DNA contribution). To validate the results of volume analysis further with a second methodology, Image SXM 169 software was used. The average height and area of a manually defined nucleoprotein complex and the adjacent region containing only DNA were subtracted to determine the volume of the complex. The volume obtained by this method was 212 ± 42 nm3 for the ω2·parS complex on linear and 235 ± 56 nm3 on circular parS DNA (n = 36). Hence, it is likely that ω2 binds to full parS DNA with a stoichiometry of ∼1 ± 0.2 ω2/iteron. This is consistent with stoichiometry experiments showing (i) minor ω2 spreading (<15 bp) toward the 5′ end of the contiguous iterons (see 15de la Hoz A.B. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Speck C. Weihofen W. Welfle K. Saenger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); (ii) 2.2, 3.1, and 4.5 ω2 molecules binding DNA segments containing two, three, and four heptads, respectively (15de la Hoz A.B. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Speck C. Weihofen W. Welfle K. Saenger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and (iii) the co-crystal structure of the ω2ΔN19·mini-parS complexes (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At a ratio of 100 ω2/DNA molecule, ω2 binds to parS regions on linear DNA and mediates site-specific pairing with very low efficiency (∼1% of the total molecules analyzed by electron microscopy in the presence of glutaraldehyde fixation) (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At 7.2 ω2/parS DNA molecule, ω2 bound to linear or circular parS DNA but failed to promote any site-specific plasmid pairing (Fig. 2). Protein (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 (at 7 δ2/DNA molecule) bound DNA in a sequence-independent manner (supplemental Fig. S1), but such protein·DNA complexes were not observed when ATP was omitted (data not shown). We failed to detect any site-specific intermolecular pairing (supplemental Fig. S1). At 7.2 ω2/DNA molecule, ω2 promoted relocalization of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 from any position on the supercoiled DNA toward the ω2·parS complex in more than 90% of the molecules with subsequent increase in the protein·DNA volume. A ternary complex ((δ·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS) was observed in ∼67% of the molecules with site-specific intermolecular pairing in the remaining fraction (Fig. 4A). When linear parS DNA was used, ω2 bound to parS promoted redistribution of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 to relocalize with ω2·parS to form the ternary complex. Similar results were observed when limiting protein concentrations were used (data not shown). In the presence of subsaturating amounts of ω2 and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 at 1:1 molar ratio, site-specific intermolecular pairing in a subfraction (∼22%, n = 160) of the molecules was observed (Fig. 4A). Similar results were reported previously in the presence of an ∼14-fold excess of both ω2 and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 (at 1:1 ratios) proteins per linear DNA molecule when analyzed by electron microscopy in the presence of glutaraldehyde fixation (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The parS DNA region on the pairing complex was not significantly distorted by ω2 binding or (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 interaction with ω2 (Fig. 4B). We could hypothesize that ω2-mediated centromere pairing but the pairing complex is unstable, and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 was required to “activate” ω2 to promote stable plasmid pairing. Because the presence of higher (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 concentrations (14 or 28 δ2/DNA molecule) under limiting ω2 concentrations led to the formation of high order superstructures, with three or more ω2·parS complexes paired by (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 (Fig. 4A), we do not favor this hypothesis. Indeed, at ω2:(δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 ratios of 1:3.9, ∼33% of 162 analyzed molecules had three or more plasmid paired molecules (Fig. 4A). The (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 variant, which binds but does not hydrolyze ATP, at 7 (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2/DNA molecule, binds DNA in a sequence-independent manner (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At a 1:1 ω2:(δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 molar ratio, ω2 recruited (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 toward the ω2·parS complex in ∼90% of molecules (Fig. 5), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is not required for (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 redistribution toward the ω2·parS complex. A ternary complex ((δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS) was observed in ∼64% of the molecules with site-specific intermolecular pairing in the remaining fraction (Fig. 5A). Site-specific intermolecular pairing of (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 bound to ω2·parS with a second ω2·parS was reduced ∼3-fold compared with wild-type (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2. Here, ∼26% of the analyzed molecules had three or more plasmid molecules paired (n = 157). At 1:2 ω2:(δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 molar ratio, the accumulation of ternary partition complexes ((δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS) was reduced (∼39% of the molecules), and pairing of three or more plasmids accounted for ∼62% of the analyzed particles (n = 169) (Fig. 5A). The data suggest that (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 was redistributed toward the ω2·parS complex and the dynamic assembly of plasmid pairing requires ATP binding, but, in the absence of its hydrolysis, disassembly of paired molecules is slowed down or abolished. On the other hand, when the (δK36A)2 mutant, which does not bind ATP or DNA, was used, neither ternary complex formation nor plasmid pairing was observed in the presence of nucleotide cofactor and metal ion (data not shown). The ω2ΔN19·parS complexes were indistinguishable from the ω2·parS complexes. However, in the presence of both ω2ΔN19 and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2, (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 relocalization and site-specific pairing of supercoiled DNA (<1% of the analyzed particles, n = 138) were not observed (supplemental Fig. S2A). This is consistent with data showing that ω2ΔN19, which lacks the first 19 residues, binds to parS DNA and represses promoter utilization with affinity similar to wild type (18Welfle K. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Alonso J.C. Welfle H. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 881-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but fails to interact with (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 and to promote pairing of linear DNA by electron microscopic examination upon glutaraldehyde fixation at saturating concentrations of the protein (100 ω2ΔN19/DNA molecule) (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ω2T29A mutant binds DNA with low affinity and without sequence specificity (18Welfle K. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Alonso J.C. Welfle H. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 881-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the presence of a 10-fold excess of ω2T29A/DNA molecule, ω2T29A formed discrete complexes on DNA. At 2.5:1 ω2T29A:δ2 molar ratios, ω2T29A promoted relocalization of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 from any position on the DNA toward the ω2T29A·DNA complex in ∼75% of the molecules, and pairing of multiple plasmid in only ∼8% (n = 136) of the analyzed particles was observed (supplemental Fig. S2B). Protein (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 seems to interact with all ω2T29A·DNA complexes, forming large protein·DNA complexes. To study the apparent stoichiometry of all three components of the partition complex, we compared the volumes of ω2·parS complex with the ternary (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS partition complex and the paired plasmid complexes. Because of the heterogeneous shape of the paired complex (Fig. 4B), Image SXM 169 software was used to measure the volumes and to compare them with the volumes obtained for the ω2·parS complex on circular DNA (see above). Based on the theoretical volume of (δ·ATPγS·Mg2+)2 (∼85 nm3) and considering that the stoichiometry of ω2 to parS remains unchanged by varying ω2 concentration (between 1 and 20 ω2 molecules/parS DNA), we can estimate the apparent number of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 molecules in the ternary and pairing complexes to be ∼4 in the partition complex. In the paired complex, the results show great variability, depending on the number of paired molecules. The number of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 molecules in two paired DNA plasmids was ∼20, whereas in higher order superstructures with five or more plasmid molecules paired, the mean value was ∼80. During pSM19035 proliferation, DNA synthesis and genome segregation are coordinated by ω2 to ensure its stable inheritance (see the Introduction). The overall structure of the ω2·parS complex, in linear or supercoiled DNA, revealed the formation of a discrete structure without significant spreading or compaction, shortening, or distortion of the DNA. This is consistent with (i) cooperative binding of ω2 to 7–10 contiguous iterons (parS sites) with a marginal spreading onto non-parS DNA, as shown in DNase I protection studies where ω2 spreads <15 bp, if at all; (ii) DNA titration of increasing numbers of heptads, indicating that ω2 binds with a ω2:heptad stoichiometry of 1:1 (15de la Hoz A.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); (iii) each iteron recruiting one ω2 molecule, implying that the fully bound parS site is cooperatively coated by ∼10 ω2 molecules (15de la Hoz A.B. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Speck C. Weihofen W. Welfle K. Saenger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); and (iv) the homotetrameric structure of ω2 binding to mini-parS, which forms a left-handed wrap around ideal B-form DNA (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The topography of ω2 (ParB Ib) bound to parS differs from P1-ParB or F-SopB (ParB Ia) bound to parS or sopC. Both P1-ParB and F-SopB bind and spread up to several kilobases of DNA in a centromere-dependent manner. In the case of P1, the DNA might wrap around a multimeric protein core (28Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas F-SopB wraps DNA in a right-handed manner (29Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that have evolved to segregate genomes of Firmicutes differ between plasmids that use the ParAB (e.g. pSM19035-ParAB) and the ParMR (pSK41-ParRM) partition systems. The centromeres of both systems (parS and parC) are in B-form DNA, and both proteins, ω2 and ParR, bind mini-parS and mini-parC, respectively, as homooligomers and form superhelical structures (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the architectures of these complexes differ markedly. Protein ω2 binds to parS and assembles as a left-handed matrix with DNA binding sites facing inward (Fig. 1B), and homooligomeric ω2 bound to parS fails to promote site-specific pairing of supercoiled DNA molecules (Fig. 2). Each ω2 molecule is displaced relative to its neighbor by 7 bp and left-handed rotated by 252° around the straight DNA helix (17Weihofen W.A. Cicek A. Pratto F. Alonso J.C. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, ParR assembles into a right-handed solenoid structure with the DNA binding sites facing outward. This assembly induces a pre-bent architecture on noncurved parC DNA (30Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Then parC wraps the ParR scaffold, and this spiral structure mediates pairing of DNA molecules (segrosome structure) in the absence of ParM (30Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Löwe J.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8550-8555Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). pSM19035 pairing requires the N terminus of ω2 and its ability to bind parS DNA, the binding of δ2 to ATP·Mg2+, and the interaction between ω2 and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2. First, ω2 binds parS to form a ω2·parS complex on straight DNA, and (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 interacts with DNA in a sequence-independent manner or might interact with ω2. However, such protein-protein interaction could be “unstable” because we failed to detect the accumulation of such intermediates. Second, (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 bound to DNA interacts with the unstructured N-terminal domain of ω2 bound to parS DNA. Indeed, ω2ΔN19 bound to parS DNA failed to interact with (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2. Third, the interaction of ω2 bound to parS with (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 promotes its relocalization from any DNA site to the ω2·parS complex. This is consistent with data showing that addition of ω2 to preformed (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2·DNA led only to the formation of discrete ternary complexes (parS·ω2(δ·ATP·Mg2+)2) in the majority of cases (∼67% of total molecules) (see Fig. 4A). Fourth, (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 mediates site-specific pairing, quaternary parS·ω2(δ·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS complexes, in ∼22% of the cases without apparent distortions in the DNA. However, when (δ·ATPγS·Mg2+)2 was used, the amount of quaternary complexes markedly increased to levels comparable with (parS·ω2·(δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS complexes (see below). Fifth, the formation of quaternary parS·ω2·(δ·ATP·Mg2+)2·ω2·parS complexes between the six different parS sites should condense the plasmid molecule. Like protein δ2 (ParA-like) in vitro, P1-ParA facilitates pairing (blocked supercoil diffusion) of P1-ParB bound to a parS site in two plasmid monomers in vivo (33Edgar R. Biek D. Yarmolinsky M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 was sufficient to induce pairing, although dislodging the paired molecules might require ATP hydrolysis (compare Figs. 4 and 5). The topography of the ternary complex differs markedly from the ParM·ParR·parC complex, where the oligomeric right-handed ParR ring, with parC wrapped around, acts through its C-terminal domain as an anchor on the ends of the elongating ParM filaments (31Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Jensen R.B. Lurz R. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2230-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The differences in the structures of ω2·parS (type Ib) and ParR·parC (type II) complexes might indicate how they interact with their partners (δ2 and ParM) and how they segregate plasmid molecules. Previous cytological, biochemical, and structural studies together with this work provide detailed sequential information about the mechanism of ParAB active plasmid partitioning (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15de la Hoz A.B. Pratto F. Misselwitz R. Speck C. Weihofen W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2, which shows a slow rate of ATP hydrolysis, binds DNA and interacts with ω2 bound to parS; however, neither δ2K36A, which does not bind ATP, nor (δ·ADP·Mg2+)2 interacts with DNA (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). parS-bound protein ω2 interacts with (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 bound to DNA and recruits it to the parS·ω2 complex. Limiting concentrations of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 promotes pairing of two supercoiled plasmid molecules in a subfraction of the molecules (Fig. 4). Once the plasmids are paired, the local intracellular concentration of ω2 increases, the ATPase activity of δ2 increases, and plasmid pairing is lost. On the other hand, when (δD60A·ATP·Mg2+)2 was used, multiple pairing molecules were observed, suggesting that in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, paired intermediates accumulate (Fig. 5). In the nanomolar range, both proteins are needed for plasmid pairing (Fig. 4), but in the millimolar range, both proteins are needed for (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 polymerization onto DNA (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mechanic role of δ2 in promoting plasmid segregation by polymerization and depolymerization from the DNA, prior to cell division segregation, is poorly understood. After Leonard and co-workers (2Leonard T.A. Møller-Jensen J. Löwe J. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we proposed that ω2 bound to parS assists treadmilling of δ2. The processive disassembly of δ2 filaments could contract the (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 spiral-like structure, observed both in vivo and in vitro, and move the cargo (individual ω2·parS) stepwise outward along the cell axis (10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that decreasing local intracellular concentration of ω2 leads to a decrease on ATP hydrolysis and a stimulation of polymerization of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 or δ2·ATP·ADP·Mg2+ onto plasmid DNA, thereby generating one (minus) end of the nucleoprotein filament (parS·(ω2)10·((δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 or δ2·ATP·ADP·Mg2+)n. From the initial assembly site (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 or δ2·ATP·ADP·Mg2+, polymerization leads to the formation of a nascent δ2 filament that depends on the presence of ATP, but is independent of ATP hydrolysis, because δ2 polymerization was observed in the presence of ATPγS·Mg2+ (see 10Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3676-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When the plus end of the filament reaches another ternary parS·ω2·(δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 complex (see Fig. 1B), the ω2:δ2 molar ratio decreases. This change in the ω2:δ2 ratio stimulates the ATPase activity of δ2. (δ·ADP·Mg2+)2 dissociates from the nucleoprotein complex, proximal to the ω2·parS region. Alternatively, (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2, by promoting intramolecular pairing of the six different ω2·parS complexes, condenses the plasmid DNA and plays an essential role in the early stages of plasmid segregation. Upon interaction with ω2·parS, (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 binds and polymerizes onto plasmid and/or chromosomal DNA. Protein (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 polymerized onto chromosomal DNA moves the (ω2·parS) cargo passively toward the cell poles by an ω2-δ2 interaction. The proposed models for how ω2 wrapped around parS promoters, δ2-mediated pairing and subsequent polymerization of (δ·ATP·Mg2+)2 or δ2·ATP·ADP·Mg2+ and depolymerization of (δ·ADP·Mg2+)2 differ markedly from the type II partition system. In the ParRM system, each pair of plasmids, anchored ParM at ParR·parC, drives apart the plasmid copies by ParM·ADP·Mg2+ polymerizing bidirectionally (31Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P.

The acidic C-terminal tail of gp2.5, bearing a C-terminal phenylalanine, physically and functionally interacts with the helicase and DNA polymerase.

Suppressors of the dominant lethal phenotype have led to the identification of mutations in gene 5 that encodes the T7 DNA polymerase. The altered residues in the polymerase are solvent-exposed and lie in regions that are adjacent to the bound DNA. gp2.5 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine has a lower affinity for gp5-thioredoxin relative to the wild-type gp2.5, and this affinity is partially restored by the suppressor mutations in DNA polymerase. gp2.5 enables T7 DNA polymerase to catalyze strand displacement DNA synthesis at a nick in DNA. The resulting 5′-single-stranded DNA tail provides a loading site for T7 DNA helicase. gp2.5 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine does not support this event with wild-type DNA polymerase but does to a limited extent with T7 DNA polymerase harboring the suppressor mutations.

The C-terminal tail of one monomer of gp2.5 binds in a trans mode to the ssDNA-binding cleft of the other subunit, thus stabilizing the dimer interface observed in the crystal structure (6Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The current model proposes that the positively charged DNA-binding cleft is shielded by the electrostatic charges of the C-terminal tail in the absence of ssDNA, thus facilitating oligomerization of gp2.5. Upon binding ssDNA, the dimer dissociates to allow the C-terminal tail to interact with other replication proteins (16Shokri L. Marintcheva B. Eldib M. Hanke A. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5668-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The tail modulates the affinity for ssDNA and protein-protein interactions by functioning as a two-way switch (6Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This mode of function is applicable to other prokaryotic ssDNA-binding proteins, namely Escherichia coli SSB protein and T4 gp32 (10Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Hosoda J. J. Biol.

The other three proteins are the T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase (gp5), its processivity factor, E. coli thioredoxin (trx), and the multifunctional gene 4 helicase-primase (gp4). gp5 and trx bind with high affinity (KD of 5 nm), and the two proteins are normally found in complex (gp5/trx) at a stoichiometry of one to one (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic C-terminal tail of gp2.5 is critical for the interactions of the protein with gp5/trx and gp4 (9Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail binds to a positively charged segment located in the thumb subdomain of the gp5 (25Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This fragment, designated the trx binding domain (TBD), is also the site of binding of the processivity factor, E. coli trx, and the C terminus of gp4. The multiple interactions of the C terminus of gp2.5 could thus function to coordinate the dynamic reactions occurring at the replication fork. gp2.5 is known to be critical for establishing coordination during leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis (26Lee J. Chastain 2nd., P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Hamdan S.M. Loparo J.J. Takahashi M. Richardson C.C. van Oijen A.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This C-terminal tail of gp2.5 is an acidic 26-amino acid segment with an aromatic phenylalanine as the C-terminal residue. The C-terminal tail is not seen in the crystal structure because gp2.5Δ26, lacking the tail, was used for crystallization; the wild-type protein did not yield crystals that diffracted (6Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). gp2.5ΔF designates a genetically modified gp2.5 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine. gp2.5ΔF does not support the growth of T7Δ2.5 phage lacking gene 2.5 (28Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, T7 gene 4 protein also has an acidic C-terminal tail with a C-terminal phenylalanine (29Lee S.J. Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25841-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Again, the phenylalanine is critical for the interaction of gp4 with gp5/trx (29Lee S.J. Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25841-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further evidence for overlapping binding sites of the C termini of these two proteins comes from studies with chimeric proteins (28Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Lee S.J. Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25841-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tails of gp2.5 and gp4 can be exchanged, and the chimeric proteins support the growth of T7 phage lacking the corresponding wild-type protein. We recently designed a screen for suppressors of dominant lethal mutations of gp2.5 (30Marintcheva B. Qimron U. Yu Y. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Richardson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The screen identified mutations in gene 5, the structural gene for T7 DNA polymerase (Fig. 1), which suppresses the lethal phenotype of gp2.5 mutant in which the C-terminal phenylalanine was moved to the penultimate position (gp2.5ΔF232InsF231). One of the altered suppressor genes (gp5, gp5-sup1) encodes a gp5 in which where glycine at position 371 is replaced by lysine (G371K). Whereas the other (gp5-sup2) encodes a protein in which threonine 258 and alanine 411 are replaced by methionine and threonine, respectively (T258M and A411T). The suppressor mutations in gp5 are necessary and sufficient to suppress the lethal phenotype of gp2.5ΔF232InsF231. The affected residues map in proximity to aromatic residues and to residues in close proximity to DNA as seen in the crystal structure of gp5/trx in complex with DNA (31Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Throughout this study, gp2.5ΔF232InsF231 mutant will be referred to as gp2.5-FD because it effectively switches the positions of the C-terminal phenylalanine and the adjacent aspartic acid. E. coli SSB protein also has a C-terminal phenylalanine, and recent studies have shown that this residue inserts into a hydrophobic region consisting of exonuclease I of E. coli (45Engler M.J. Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11165-11173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we have purified the two suppressor DNA polymerases and characterized them individually and in interaction with the other T7 replication proteins. Whereas wild-type gp5 binds with low affinity to gp2.5-FD, the DNA polymerases harboring the suppressor mutations bind with a higher affinity. An interesting finding is that whereas wild-type gp2.5 enables gp5/trx to catalyze strand displacement synthesis at a nick in DNA, gp2.5-FD does not support this reaction. Strand displacement synthesis is necessary for the initiation of leading strand DNA synthesis at a nick because it creates a 5′-single-stranded DNA tail for loading of the T7 helicase (32Lechner R.L. Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11174-11184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type gp5, gp5-sup1, and gp5-sup2 plasmids have been described previously in the study identifying gp5 suppressors of the dominant lethal gp2.5-FD (30Marintcheva B. Qimron U. Yu Y. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Richardson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Wild-type gp5, gp5-sup1, and gp5-sup2 were purified from E. coli HMS 174(DE3)/pLysS cells overexpressing their genes as described previously (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1:1 complex of polymerase and thioredoxin was purified to apparent homogeneity using three chromatographic steps as follows: phosphocellulose (Whatman), anion exchange Poros HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems), and ceramic hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) as described (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type gp2.5, gp2.5-FD, and gp2.5Δ26 were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS cells overexpressing their genes as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). gp4 was purified as described (24Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. Wild-type and genetically altered gp2.5 were immobilized (150 response units) on a carboxymethyl-5 chip using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. Immobilization was performed in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, except for gp2.5Δ26 protein, which was immobilized at pH 4.5 at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Binding studies were performed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 40 μl/min (25Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S.

As a control, a flow cell was activated and blocked in the absence of protein to account for changes in the bulk refractive index. Apparent binding constants were calculated under steady-state conditions, and the data were fitted using BIAEVAL 3.0.2 software (Biacore). DNA polymerase activity was measured using M13 ssDNA as a template as described previously (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 20 nm M13 mGP1–2 ssDNA annealed to a 24-nt oligonucleotide, with 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 nm gp5/trx in a total volume of 10 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 0.25 m EDTA (pH 7.5). The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was measured on DE81 filter disks as described (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′–5′-exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase was measured using uniformly labeled M13 [3H]dsDNA as described previously (34Kumar J.K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34905-34912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The M13 [3H]dsDNA was prepared by annealing the 24-nt oligonucleotide to M13 mGP1–2 DNA and then extending the primer by 200 nm T7 DNA polymerase in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then purified by passing through Biospin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove free nucleotides. M13 [3H]ssDNA was prepared by alkali denaturation of 3H-labeled M13 dsDNA (34Kumar J.K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34905-34912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). M13 [3H]dsDNA was treated by 50 mm NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min followed by neutralization with HCl. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 nmol (in terms of total nucleotides) of 3H-labeled M13 mGP1–2 dsDNA, and 0–20 nm gp5/trx. After incubation for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 125 mm. The hydrolysis of DNA was measured by spotting the reaction mixture on DE81 filters and by determining the amount of radioactivity remaining in DNA by scintillation counting. Leading strand DNA synthesis catalyzed by gp5/trx and gene 4 helicase was measured using circular M13 containing a preformed replication fork (35Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The replication fork (see Fig. 4A, inset) was constructed by annealing M13 mGP1–2 ssDNA to an oligonucleotide (5′-TAATTCGTAATCATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCT-3′). The oligoribonucleotide was then extended by gp5/trx to obtain double-stranded DNA. Strand displacement DNA synthesis was carried out in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 10 nm circular M13 DNA containing a preformed replication fork, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 500 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.05 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 10 nm gp4 (hexamer), and 2.5–20 nm of wild-type or variants of gp5/trx. gp5/trx and gp4 were incubated on ice for 15 min, and reactions were initiated by transferring to 37 °C. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 125 mm. Where indicated, gp2.5, gp2.5-FD, and gp2.5Δ26 protein were present at 4 μm unless otherwise specified. Leading strand synthesis on nicked DNA was carried out using a circular M13 double-stranded DNA containing a nick (see Fig. 4A, inset). The DNA was prepared by annealing a 24-nt oligonucleotide to M13 mGP1–2 ssDNA. The primer was extended to make a fully circular dsDNA in a reaction containing 10 nm gp5/trx, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, with 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min and stopped by heating at 75 °C for 5 min. The nicked DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then purified by passing through Biospin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove free nucleotides. The structure of the nicked DNA was confirmed by analysis on a denaturing agarose gel. Nicked DNA was also prepared by incubating supercoiled pBR322 DNA with Nb.Bsml nicking enzyme (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer. The enzyme was inactivated by heating the reaction to 80 °C for 20 min (as specified by New England Biolabs). The conversion of the supercoiled DNA to a relaxed form was confirmed by gel analysis. Leading strand synthesis reactions were the same as described above. To examine the role of gp2.5 proteins in this reaction, varying amounts of gp2.5, gp2.5-FD, and gp2.5Δ26 protein were added to the reaction. DNA synthesis was monitored by the amount of [α-32P]dAMP incorporated into DNA (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize the products of DNA synthesis, the DNA products were denatured and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.6% alkaline agarose gel. Coordinated DNA synthesis reactions were carried out using a mini-circle substrate as described previously (26Lee J. Chastain 2nd., P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the mini-circle DNA was modified slightly to more easily differentiate synthesis of the leading strand from that on the lagging strand using [α-32P]dTTP and [α-32P]dATP, respectively. The sequences used in constructing the mini-circle are as follows: 5′-CCA CCC CAA AAA CAC CAA CAA CCC AAC ACC ACA CAA CAC ACC ACA AAA CCA CAC GAC CAA AAC CAC CAC C-3′ for the 70-base circle and 5′-TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT T GGT GGT GGT TTT GGT CGT GTG GTT TTG TGG TGT GTT GTG TGG TGT TGG GTT GTT GGT GTT TTT GGG GTG G-3′ for the complementary strand to the mini-circle, which will result in a 5′ overhang. Preparation of the mini-circle is identical to that described previously (26Lee J. Chastain 2nd., P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Johnson D.E. Takahashi M. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5312-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The replication reaction is carried out for 5 min at 30 °C, with a mini-circle concentration of 32 nm, 28 nm gp5/trx, 4 nm gp4, 2 μm gp2.5, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, with 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The rolling-circle substrate is designed in a way that leading strand synthesis is monitored by incorporation [32P]dTMP and lagging strand synthesis by [32P]dAMP. Radioactive products were separated and visualized on a 0.8% alkaline agarose gel. Aside from removing secondary structures upon binding ssDNA, gp2.5 also coordinates protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at the replication fork (1Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev.

For example, gp2.5 physically interacts with both T7 DNA polymerase in complex with thioredoxin (gp5/trx) and the gene 4 helicase-primase (25Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The acidic C-terminal tails of gp2.5 and gp4 both bind to two basic loops in the TBD of gp5 (25Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the course of examining this electrostatic interaction, the important role of the C-terminal phenylalanine of gp2.5 emerged (28Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This aromatic residue, as well as the overall negative charge of the C terminus, is essential for its interaction with gp5/trx. gp2.5 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine cannot support the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5 (28Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This lethal phenotype is also seen with gp2.5-FD, in which the C-terminal phenylalanine (Phe-232) has been switched with the adjacent aspartic acid (Asp-231). This latter phenotype enabled the identification of suppressor mutations in gene 5 of bacteriophage T7 that resulted in changes in residues that may engage DNA in the DNA binding crevice of the polymerase (Fig. 1). These altered polymerases, designated gp5-sup1 and gp5-sup-2, both support the growth of T7Δ5 phage, lacking gene 5, and both can support the growth of T7Δ2.5 phage complemented with gp2.5-FD lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine (28Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both suppressor polymerases support the growth of T7Δ5 phage expressing wild-type gp2.5. We have purified these two suppressor DNA polymerases and examined their biochemical properties and interactions with other T7 replication proteins. gp5 expressed in wild-type E. coli exists in a one to one complex (gp5/trx) with its processivity factor trx (37Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In all the studies described here, the polymerases are in complex with trx and are designated as gp5/trx, gp5-sup1/trx, and gp5-sup2/trx. The polymerization of nucleotides catalyzed by gp5-sup1/trx and gp5-sup2/trx was compared with that catalyzed by wild-type gp5/trx (Fig. 2A). The initial rates of DNA synthesis with purified enzymes were measured following the incorporation of [3H]dTMP into DNA using primed M13 ssDNA. The rate of DNA synthesis of gp5-sup1/trx and gp5-sup2/trx is similar to that of wild-type gp5/trx. The steady-state rate constants for polymerization (kpol) for gp5/trx, gp5-sup1/trx, and gp5-sup2/trx are 71, 82, and 75 s−1, respectively. Taken together, we conclude that the replacement of Gly → Lys at position 371 in gp5-sup1 or the simultaneous substitution of Thr → Met and Ala → Thr at positions 258 and 411, respectively, in gp5-sup2 does not significantly affect their polymerization activity. T7 DNA polymerase, like other members of the polymerase I family of DNA polymerases, has an N-terminal exonuclease domain (31Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature."
https://openalex.org/W1992554735,"Kelch-related protein 1 (Krp1) is up-regulated in oncogene-transformed fibroblasts. The Kelch repeats interact directly with the actin-binding protein Lasp-1 in membrane ruffles at the tips of pseudopodia, where both proteins are necessary for pseudopodial elongation. Herein, we investigate the molecular basis for this interaction. Probing an array of overlapping decapeptides of Rattus norvegicus (Rat) Krp1 with recombinant Lasp-1 revealed two binding sites; one ((317)YDPMENECYLT(327)) precedes the first of five Kelch repeats, and the other ((563)TEVNDIWKYEDD(574)) is in the last of the five Kelch repeats. Mutational analysis established that both binding sites are necessary for Krp1-Lasp-1 interaction in vitro and function in vivo. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of rat Krp1 (amino acids 289-606) reveals that both binding sites are brought into close proximity by the formation of a novel six-bladed beta-propeller, where the first blade is not formed by a Kelch repeat."

Glutathione is synthesized from its three constituent amino acids by consecutive action of two cytosolic ATP-dependent enzymes: GCL and glutathione synthetase (17.Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73 (xii): 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). GCL catalyzes the conjugation of the γ-carboxyl group of l-glutamate to the amino group of l-cysteine (17.Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73 (xii): 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic mechanism proceeds via phosphorylation of the γ-carboxylate of l-glutamate by ATP (18.Strumeyer D.H. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: PC27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Yip B. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3563-3568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-amino group of l-cysteine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the γ-glutamyl phosphate intermediate to produce γ-glutamylcysteine. This dipeptide is then coupled in an analogous fashion to glycine by glutathione synthetase to generate glutathione. As the committed step of glutathione biosynthesis, GCL activity is regulated by l-cysteine availability (21.Tateishi N. Higashi T. Shinya S. Naruse A. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. 1974; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), feedback inhibition by glutathione (22.Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transcriptional and post-translational regulation (23.Lu S.C. Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30: 42-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, three distinct groups of GCL have been identified. Groups 1 and 3 are comprised of bacterial and plant orthologues (24.Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0025)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, x-ray crystal structures of Escherichia coli (Group 1) (25.Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Brassica juncea (Group 3) (26.Hothorn M. Wachter A. Gromes R. Stuwe T. Rausch T. Scheffzek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27557-27565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) GCL were described, providing the first structural insights into γ-glutamylcysteine synthesis. However, low sequence identity (<10%) between enzymes of different groups has precluded translation of these structural data into a detailed understanding of the molecular features of enzymes in Group 2, the class that encompasses yeast and mammalian GCL. One structurally unique feature of several Group 2 GCL is the potential for higher order regulation imposed by their existence in reversible heterodimeric complexes of a catalytic (GCLC) and a modulatory subunit (GCLM) (17.Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73 (xii): 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent the inherent challenges associated with structural studies of the complex, we selected the monomeric Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCL (ScGCL), a member of a unique subclass of Group 2 GCL, as a model system for higher eukaryotic GCL. Although ScGCL differs from human GCLC in its oligomeric state, the two enzymes share ∼45% sequence identity (24.Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0025)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we present the crystal structures of ScGCL in complex with glutamate and Mg2+, as well as in the presence of glutamate, Mg2+, and ADP. Examination of these structures provides considerable insights into catalysis and reveals a unique coordination at the α-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate. Based on the ScGCL structure, a homology model of human GCLC was generated to investigate the molecular details of several human patient mutations with reduced activity, and to aid in the design of novel modulators of GCL activity. A predicted open reading frame in the S. cerevisiae genome (KEGG Data Base Entry YJL101C) (27.Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28.Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2952) Google Scholar) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection) as a template. Designed primers contained SpeI (forward) and SalI (reverse) restrictions sites. The resultant 2-kb product was digested with the relevant enzymes and ligated into a complementarily digested pET-21a(+) expression vector (Novagen; NheI and SalI), thus incorporating a C-terminal histidine tag. The expression construct was sequenced at the Genomics Facility of University of Nebraska (Lincoln, NE) and confirmed to be identical to the YJL101C sequence. The ScGCL construct was used to transform Escherichia coli Rosetta™2(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in 2xYT medium containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol at 37 °C, and ScGCL production was induced by the addition of 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside once the cells reached an A600 of 0.6. After induction, cultures were grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 8000 × g, 4 °C) and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm protease inhibitor, 10 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. Following centrifugation to remove cellular debris (30 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap Chelating HP Column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed to baseline (A280), and the remaining bound proteins were eluted using a linear imidazole gradient (10–250 mm). Fractions containing ScGCL were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column (16 × 600 mm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Samples containing ScGCL were pooled and dialyzed against crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT). The enzyme was concentrated to 12 mg ml−1 using an Amicon ultrafiltration device (Stirred cell 8050, 10-kDa cutoff), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The enzyme concentration was determined by absorbance (280 nm) using a calculated extinction coefficient (29.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) of 105,200 m−1 cm−1. ScGCL was examined by analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT). Molecular weight determinations were made by comparison with the following standards: thyroglobulin, 699 kDa; ferritin, 416 kDa; catalase, 219 kDa; aldolase, 176 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 47 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 20 kDa; RNase A, 15 kDa (GE Healthcare). Enzymatic activity was measured in the presence of 20 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, and 50 mm MgCl2, using an indirect assay that couples ADP production to NADH oxidation (30.Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial crystallization screening was performed by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method using sparse matrix crystal screens (Qiagen). Crystals of ScGCL (7 mg/ml) were ultimately grown at 18 °C out of a solution of 12% (w/v) PEG 400, 100 mm MES, pH 6.8, and reached the dimensions 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm. Once suitable crystallization conditions were established, several complexes were co-crystallized as indicated below. An extensive search of potential heavy metal derivatives was conducted and a derivative suitable for phasing was identified. ScGCL was incubated with 1 mm trimethyl lead acetate, 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm ATP, and 20 mm MgCl2 and co-crystallized. Crystals were transferred into an appropriate stabilizing solution, containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.8, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm l-glutamate, 20 mm MgCl2, and 30% PEG 400 and vitrified in the cryostream (X-Stream cooling system; Rigaku) (31.Rodgers D.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1135-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected using radiation produced by a Rigaku MicroMax-007 x-ray generator fitted with confocal blue optics and an R-axis IV++ image plate system (λ = 1.54 Å; 100 K). Data were processed with the HKL2000 software package (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structure of ScGCL derivatized with trimethyl lead acetate was solved using experimental phases determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction utilizing the PHENIX software suite (33.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). A readily interpretable electron density map was obtained, and automated model building was employed. The initial model contained a single Pb2+ bound at the enzyme active site. Since the Pb2+ occupied one of the three Mg2+ binding sites, M2 (see below), this initial model was used only as a search probe for subsequent ScGCL complex structure determinations. To examine the structural basis of catalysis and substrate recognition, several ScGCL complexes were pursued. ScGCL was incubated with 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm AMP-PNP, 5 mm l-cysteine, and 20 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm ADP, 5 mm l-cysteine, and 20 mm MgCl2 and both complexes were crystallized. Crystals were transferred to a suitable cryosolution (30% PEG 400, 100 mm mes, pH 6.8, and the appropriate ligands) and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data (λ = 0.9 Å; 100 K) were collected on Beamline 14-BM-C of BioCARS at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source and were processed with the HKL2000 software package (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by molecular replacement within the PHENIX software suite (33.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar) using the initial ScGCL model as a probe. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (34.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 (35.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) respectively. As the protein models neared completion, water molecules obeying proper hydrogen-bonding constraints with electron density greater than 1.0 σ on a 2Fo–Fc map and 4.0 σ on an Fo–Fc map were also included in the final structure. Model geometry was monitored using MOLPROBITY (36.Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar), and figures were produced using Chimera (37.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26024) Google Scholar). To validate the location of the metal binding sites, ScGCL was crystallized in the presence of 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm ADP, 5 mm l-cysteine, and 20 mm MnCl2. Diffraction data were collected using radiation produced by a Rigaku MicroMax-007 x-ray generator fitted with confocal blue optics and an R-axis IV++ image plate system (λ = 1.54 Å; 100 K). Data were processed with the HKL2000 software package (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and an anomalous difference map was calculated. ScGCL was purified from E. coli with a specific activity of ∼10 μmoles/min/mg of protein, comparable to other glutamate cysteine ligases. Both analytical gel filtration chromatography as well as sedimentation velocity experiments indicated that ScGCL was likely a monomer in solution (data not shown). As discussed below, a single polypeptide chain is contained within the asymmetric unit of ScGCL crystals, and relatively modest interactions between crystallographically related molecules are observed, consistent with a monomeric enzyme. Although GCL is typically a heterodimer comprised of a catalytic subunit and a modifier subunit in higher eukaryotes (Group 2), phylogenetic analysis suggests that members of the hemiascomycete class of fungi do not have a modifier subunit and that ScGCL likely functions as a monomer in vivo. Phase information was obtained using single wavelength anomalous diffraction data collected from a crystal of ScGCL derivatized with trimethyl lead acetate (Table 1). The PHENIX software suite (33.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar) was used to identify the positions of one lead (coincident with the M2 binding site described below) and each of the ordered 22 sulfur atoms in the final model (8 of 9 cysteine residues; 14 of 15 methionine residues), and to calculate an initial experimentally phased map. ScGCL crystals have a calculated solvent content of ∼65% and density modification in PHENIX significantly improved the experimental phases (supplemental Fig. S1). Automated chain tracing resulted in a model that contained ∼90% of the ScGCL sequence. This initial model was used for subsequent structure determinations of the ScGCL complexes by molecular replacement. ScGCL was also crystallized in the presence of l-glutamate, AMP-PNP, cysteine, and Mg2+, or l-glutamate, ADP, cysteine, and Mg2+. Data sets were collected to 2.1 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively (Table 1). However, convincing electron density was not observed for either AMP-PNP or cysteine. Refinement statistics for the final ScGCL models, corresponding to residues 2 through 676, are provided in Table 1. The ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ and the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+/ADP complexes have 99.7 and 99.0% of residues, respectively, in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot as assessed by MOLPROBITY (36.Davis I.W.

The ScGCL fold (Fig. 1) shows strong structural similarity to other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily, and has a core β-sheet comprised of six anti-parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices. The N terminus of the protein defines a lip of the active site, which is situated in a central cavity of the protein. Despite low sequence identity (∼10%), the core fold of the ScGCL structure is similar to those of the previously determined E. coli (25.Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J.

The larger ScGCL structure (678 residues), relative to the bacterial (518 residues) and plant (514 residues) homologues, contains three additional short β-sheets formed by anti-parallel β-strands, as well as extended α-helical and loop regions. An intriguing feature of the structure is a cysteine residue, Cys-70, that appears to be oxidized to sulfenic acid (supplemental Fig. S2). As discussed below, there are several prominent cysteine residues in ScGCL, suggesting that cysteine oxidation and/or additional post-translational modifications may play an important regulatory role. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that H2O2 increases the enzymatic activity of GCL (38.Ochi T.

However, the mechanism of this activation was not demonstrated, and additional studies are needed to clarify the functional significance of Cys-70 oxidation. In the ScGCL structure, l-glutamate is bound in the extended conformation in the interior of the funnel-shaped active site cavity (Fig. 2A), with the side chains of Arg-313 and Tyr-362 positioning the α-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate. The α-amino group of glutamate is within hydrogen bond distance of the backbone carbonyl of Cys-264, the γ-carboxylate of Glu-52, and a bound water molecule, which is positioned by the carboxylate of Glu-96 and the backbone carbonyl of Met-262. The γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate occupies one of the coordination sites of an interesting Mg2+ cofactor (discussed below) and is in close proximity to the side chain of Arg-472. An additional feature of the glutamate-binding pocket is Cys-266, which is stacked 3.2 Å below the α-carboxylate carbon atom. Interestingly, despite the absence of ATP, electron density was also observed for an octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ at the enzyme active site. The bound Mg2+ is within 2.2 Å of two active site glutamate residues, Glu-52 and Glu-103, and near the γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate (Fig. 2B). A fourth glutamate, Glu-96, and an ordered water molecule, positioned by Glu-50, are also located adjacent to the bound magnesium ion (2.6 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively). A water molecule occupies the final coordination site (1.9 Å), but its corresponding electron density is poorly defined. As discussed below, binding of ADP is accompanied by the formation of two additional magnesium binding sites. Since convincing electron density was not observed for the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue in the active site of the initial ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ complex, a second data set was collected in which ADP replaced AMP-PNP (Table 1). In the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+/ADP complex, ADP is largely solvent-exposed, with its adenine ring on the outer edge of the active site pocket, and its β-phosphate positioned near the γ-carboxylate of the bound glutamate substrate. Relatively few hydrogen bonds anchor the adenosine portion of the molecule (Fig. 3A). The N6 atom of the adenine ring is within hydrogen bond distance of the side chain of Gln-272. The 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring interacts with the backbone carbonyl of Pro-106 via a bridging water molecule, and the 3′-hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bond distance of the backbone carbonyl of Asp-49. In addition, the 3′-hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with a structurally conserved water molecule that is held in place by hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Gly-48 and the side chains of Thr-270 and Glu-50. Lys-451, via bridging water molecules, appears to contribute to the orientation of the β-phosphate. However, the most striking interactions of this terminal phosphate are with two bound magnesium ions, M2 and M3 (Fig. 3). Three bound metal ions were identified in the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+/ADP complex. The first metal binding site, M1, is comparable to the Mg2+ site identified in the initial ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ complex. As before, the γ-carboxylates of Glu-52, Glu-103, and the glutamate substrate are within 2.2 Å of the metal. The side chain carboxylate of Glu-96 moves ∼0.4 Å closer to the M1 metal site, and is also positioned ∼2.2 Å from the bound Mg2+. The two bound water molecules seen in the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+ complex are absent in the ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+/ADP complex. The binding of ADP results in the formation of two additional Mg2+ sites. The second site, M2, is created by the side chain oxygen atoms of Gln-268, Glu-470, and Glu-50 as well as an oxygen atom from the β-phosphate of ADP. Similarly, the third Mg2+, M3, is coordinated by side chain oxygen atoms of Glu-103 and Glu-50 as well as an oxygen atom from the β-phosphate of ADP. The γ-phosphate of ATP would likely bind adjacent to the γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate, positioned optimally for catalysis by the three bound Mg2+ ions. To confirm the placement of the three Mg2+ in the final ScGCL/Glu/Mg2+/ADP complex model, a comparable data set in which the Mg2+ was replaced with Mn2+ during crystallization was collected (Table 1). Mn2+ has been shown to support catalysis by glutamate cysteine ligase (40.Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N. Pitcher L.A. Phillips M.A. Grishin N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42099-42107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and has a significant anomalous signal at a wavelength of 1.54 Å (K edge at 1.89 Å). An anomalous difference map was calculated and examined (Fig. 3B). Three major peaks (>8σ) were identified, presumably corresponding to each of the three bound Mn2+ ions, which superimpose well on the three bound Mg2+ in the final ScGCL/Mg2+/ADP/Glu complex model. The interatomic Mg2+ distances are 4.75 Å between M1 and M2, 4.06 Å between M2 and M3, and 3.36 Å between M1 and M3. There have been several published attempts to generate a homology model of hGCLC using either the functionally related T. thermophilus glutamyl-tRNA synthetase or E. coli YbdK (41.Hamilton D. Wu J.H.

The genomes of the virus species contain three double-stranded (dsRNA) segments, and the virus capsid itself is organized in multiple protein shells. The segmented dsRNA genome, the multi-layered arrangement of the capsid and the overall viral replication scheme make the Cystoviridae similar to the Reoviridae.We present structural studies of cystovirus phi12 obtained using cryo-electron microscopy and image processing techniques. We have collected images of isolated phi12 virions and generated reconstructions of both the entire particles and the polymerase complex (PC). We find that in the nucleocapsid (NC), the phi12 P8 protein is organized on an incomplete T = 13 icosahedral lattice where the symmetry axes of the T = 13 layer and the enclosed T = 1 layer of the PC superpose. This is the same general protein-component organization found in phi6 NC's but the detailed structure of the entire phi12 P8 layer is distinct from that found in the best classified cystovirus species phi6. In the reconstruction of the NC, the P8 layer includes protein density surrounding the hexamers of P4 that sit at the 5-fold vertices of the icosahedral lattice. We believe these novel features correspond to dimers of protein P7.In conclusion, we have determined that the phi12 NC surface is composed of an incomplete T = 13 P8 layer forming a net-like configuration. The significance of this finding in regard to cystovirus assembly is that vacancies in the lattice could have the potential to accommodate additional viral proteins that are required for RNA packaging and synthesis."

We have taken a mathematical approach to begin defining these rules by performing the first large-scale quantitative analysis of fibroblast effects on cancer cell proliferation across more than four hundred heterotypic cell line pairings. Systems-level modeling of this complex dataset using singular value decomposition revealed that normal tissue fibroblasts variably express at least two functionally distinct activities, one which reflects transcriptional programs associated with activated mesenchymal cells, that act either coordinately or at cross-purposes to modulate cancer cell proliferation. These findings suggest that quantitative approaches may prove useful for identifying organizational principles that govern complex heterotypic cell-cell interactions in cancer and other contexts."

The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a reporter protein that has been widely used because it can be easily detected in living organisms by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.In this study, we used gene targeting to generate transgenic P. berghei (Pb) parasites (designated as PfMSP1-19Pb) that express the MSP1-19 of P. falciparum (Pf) and the GFP reporter protein simultaneously. The replacement of the PbMSP1-19 locus by PfMSP1-19 was verified by PCR and Southern analysis. The expression of the chimeric PbfMSP-1 and the GFP was verified by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Moreover, GFP-expressing transgenic parasites in blood stages can be readily differentiated from other blood cells using flow cytometry. A comparison of growth rates between wild-type and the PfMSP1-19Pb transgenic parasite indicated that the replacement of the MSP1-19 region and the expression of the GFP protein were not deleterious to the transgenic parasites. We used this transgenic mouse parasite as a murine model to evaluate the protective efficacy in vivo of specific IgG elicited by a PfCP-2.9 malaria vaccine that contains the PfMSP1-19. The BALB/c mice passively transferred with purified rabbit IgG to the PfCP-2.9 survived a lethal challenge of the PfMSP1-19Pb transgenic murine parasites, but not the wild-type P. berghei whereas the control mice passively transferred with purified IgG obtained from adjuvant only-immunized rabbits were vulnerable to both transgenic and wild-type infections.We generated a transgenic P. berghei line that expresses PfMSP1-19 and the GFP reporter gene simultaneously. The availability of this parasite line provides a murine model to evaluate the protective efficacy in vivo of anti-MSP1-19 antibodies, including, potentially, those elicited by the PfCP-2.9 malaria vaccine in human volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2005876085,"Influenza causes annual epidemics and often results in extensive outbreaks in closed communities. To minimize transmission, a range of interventions have been suggested. For these to be effective, an accurate and timely diagnosis of influenza is required. This is confirmed by a positive laboratory test result in an individual whose symptoms are consistent with a predefined clinical case definition. However, the utility of these clinical case definitions and laboratory testing in mass gathering outbreaks remains unknown.An influenza outbreak was identified during World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. From the data collected on pilgrims presenting to a single clinic, a Markov model was developed and validated against the actual epidemic curve. Simulations were performed to examine the utility of different clinical case definitions and laboratory testing strategies for containment of influenza outbreaks. Clinical case definitions were found to have the greatest impact on averting further cases with no added benefit when combined with any laboratory test. Although nucleic acid testing (NAT) demonstrated higher utility than indirect immunofluorescence antigen or on-site point-of-care testing, this effect was lost when laboratory NAT turnaround times was included. The main benefit of laboratory confirmation was limited to identification of true influenza cases amenable to interventions such as antiviral therapy.Continuous re-evaluation of case definitions and laboratory testing strategies are essential for effective management of influenza outbreaks during mass gatherings."

Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The basic catalytic motif along with the overall protein fold shared by members of the HADSF seem to have evolved to facilitate phosphoryl transfer from a large number of quite diverse substrates. These enzymes, which occur in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, are responsible for a wide range of important biological functions, such as the biosynthesis of important metabolic molecules (2Lahiri S.D.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8579-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the majority of enzymes comprising this superfamily remain uncharacterized, as does our understanding of the relationship between enzyme structure, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency.Members of the HADSF contain a conserved mixed α/β Rossmann fold and a conserved nucleophilic aspartate that is essential for the chemistry (Fig. 1) (8Cho H. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on additional structural elements that are inserted in the Rossmann fold, HADSF enzymes are divided into three subfamilies. Members of C1 and C2 subfamilies are usually monomeric and contain a structural insertion termed the cap domain (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N.

Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The cap domain acts as a “lid” covering the substrate in the active site thereby ensuring catalytic efficiency (9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the C0 subfamily enzymes lack the cap domain and generally exhibit broad substrate specificity (9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol.

Interestingly, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphatase (KdsC, previously annotated as YrbI; EC 3.1.3.45), an archetypical HADSF enzyme from the C0 subfamily, displays a narrow substrate specificity (12Wu J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The origin of the highly efficient hydrolysis KdsC of its specific substrate, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (Kdo8P), is unknown.KdsC, the third enzyme in the Kdo biosynthetic pathway, hydrolyzes Kdo 8-phosphate (Kdo8P) to Kdo and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Kdo is the key carbohydrate linker in the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, any disruption in the Kdo biosynthetic pathway could reduce integrity of the lipopolysaccharide that is critical to bacterial survival, pathogenic potential (14Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar), and antigenic response (15Nguyen H.P. Seto N.O. MacKenzie C.R. Brade L. Kosma P. Brade H. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct.

Examples of these include YrbI from Haemophilus influenzae (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O.

Wang, unpublished data. which exhibit a tetrameric structure. The tetramer is stabilized by interactions of short β-hairpins, which are inserted in the core Rossmann fold. The active site of one monomer appears to be capped by an adjacent monomer (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Specific contacts with the substrate, Kdo8P, or the products, Kdo and Pi, could not be deduced because neither reported structure contained the substrate or the products. Capturing substrate or products in the active site of KdsC crystal is challenging due to the high catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (12Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the lack of known tightly binding substrate or product analogs. During our initial efforts to obtain a crystal structure of substrate (Kdo8P)- or product (Kdo)-bound E. coli KdsC, we observed an unusual binding of the C-terminal eight-residue region of one monomer into the active site of a neighboring monomer. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported for any other HADSF protein. Remarkably, the deletion of this C-terminal region of E. coli KdsC resulted in a slower enzymatic turnover without affecting substrate binding (a kcat effect rather than a Km effect). We were able to capture the catalytic products in the crystal structure of this deletion mutant (KdsCΔ8) and thereby deduce the role of tetramerization in specific substrate recognition. Overall, six crystal forms of E. coli full-length KdsC and KdsCΔ8 with different combinations of divalent metals and catalytic products were obtained. The different conformations of KdsC revealed in the crystal structures combined with kinetic studies suggest a mechanistic role of the C terminus of KdsC in catalysis.FIGURE 2Multiple sequence alignment of KdcC homologs.

The position of the divalent cation in the structures of E. coli KdsC reported here and in the earlier reported structure of a KdsC homolog (YrbI) from H. influenzae (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) indicates the general location of the phosphatase active site. However, the position of substrate Kdo8P in the active site has not been clear. Deleting the eight C-terminal residues of KdsC enabled us to capture both Kdo and Pi products in the active site, likely as a result of slow product release of this deletion mutant. This product-bound KdsCΔ8 structure reveals structural features that explain the role of tetramerization in defining substrate specificity. Substrate recognition in KdsC is achieved not only by the monomer containing the catalytic aspartate residue but also by its neighboring monomer. In contrast, the substrate specificity in other families of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily is ensured by large rigid body movements of the cap domain that seal off the substrate in the active site and provide specificity determinants located on the cap itself (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A tetrameric organization similar to that of KdsC was recently reported for a moderately homologous and functionally divergent HADSF phosphatase KDN-9-P (BT1713) from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1224-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The active site cleft of KdsC is lined with mostly polar and charged residues, which dictate the specificity of KdsC to its hydrophilic substrate Kdo8P. All accessible moieties of Kdo are engaged in specific interactions with residues in the active site pocket (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, two well conserved hydrophobic residues, Val-56 and Leu-90 of an adjacent monomer (Fig. 2), that are solvent-exposed in the unbound structures of KdsC form hydrophobic interactions with the C-8 and C-3 methylene groups of Kdo, respectively. Another interaction with the adjacent monomer that appears to define the substrate specificity is a salt bridge between the Kdo carboxyl and the guanidinium group of Arg-86. A mutation of the homologous Arg-64 to an alanine in BT1713, where it forms a structurally similar salt bridge with the carboxyl of N-acetylneuraminate, abolished the phosphatase activity of BT1713 (11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1224-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The comparison of the structures of KdsC tetramers, in all crystal forms, revealed concerted conformational changes of two regions of the protein: the C-terminal tail and loops I/II surrounding the active site. The flexible C-terminal tail undergoes a dramatic conformational change between a disordered state, in which the tail is not observed in the electron density, and a defined conformation bound in the active site (also occupied by an anion) of a neighboring monomer. Strictly speaking, this disordered state of the tail is an ensemble of states in which the tail adopts several or a continuum of conformations. Thus, in this paper, the term “open conformation” also implies this conformational ensemble. The tail docking and product binding appear to drive similar movements of loops I and II that contain several conserved residues involved in recognition of Kdo8P. One of these residues, Arg-78 located in loop I (Fig. 7), also provides affinity for the tail presumably to displace the Kdo product upon completion of catalysis.The crystal structure of KdsC soaked with Kdo8P in presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, structure e) revealed the positions of the Pi 4.4 Å away from the catalytic Mg2+. The similarity in the coordination of Pi and that of the sulfate in the H. influenzae KdsC (YrbI) structure (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) lends support to structural conservation of residues mediating the Pi and divalent metal coordination in the KdsC family. Indeed, Lys-102 is universally conserved, Thr-76 is highly conserved (with a few exceptions of a functionally similar Ser), and Gly-77 is replaced with a Ser or an Ala only in a few bacterial species (Fig. 2). These three conserved residues are all located in flexible loops I and II. In contrast, the Mg2+-coordinating triad of aspartate residues (Asp-32, -34, and -125) exhibit very little or no movement, thus preserving the geometry required for catalysis. The side chain of Asp-32, the conserved nucleophile in the HADSF, appears to alternate between two rotamers, as judged from the partial occupancy of the two rotamers in electron density in the product-bound KdsCΔ8 structure (data not shown). This may reflect destabilization of the catalytic center to allow product dissociation.Several structural and biochemical observations strongly indicate an unexpected regulatory role of the C-terminal region of KdsC, likely in Kdo product release. The products are almost fully excluded from solvent and hence from possible interactions with the tail due to the active site closure. Therefore, the tail is unlikely to play an essential role in the covalent bond breaking step of the mechanism. Our steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrates that the enzymatic turnover of the KdsCΔ8 is much slower than that of full-length KdsC, whereas Km is similar for these two proteins. These observations indicate the tail is unlikely to play a role in the substrate binding step either. Furthermore, Vmax of the full-length protein is dependent on salt concentration, whereas that of KdsCΔ8 is not. This observation strongly suggests that the tail is involved in the rate-limiting step of the turnover. This rate-limiting step in the enzymatic turnover (with rate constant kcatobs) must involve solvation/desolvation of the tail upon the tail's conformational change. One plausible and simple mechanistic interpretation of these data is that the desolvation of the tail occurs as the tail binds into the active site to release the Kdo product. During the initial stages of tail binding, the C-terminal carboxyl may compete with the Kdo carboxyl for forming the salt bridge with Arg-86, thereby weakening the association of the Kdo product with the active site. Once Kdo is displaced, the tail stays transiently bound in the active site, which is still occupied by Pi. The slow release of Pi in the presence of Ca2+ could explain the previously observed dramatic loss of catalytic efficiency when Ca2+ is used instead of Mg2+ (12Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The multiple crystal structures of the KdsC-ligand complexes (Fig. 3) mimic various conformational intermediates of the KdsC reaction pathway (Fig. 10). Together with biochemical observations, these structures strongly suggest a mechanistic model, in which the likely slow Kdo release, driven by the C-terminal tail, is followed by Pi release. Finally, the tail docking was observed to occur in a pairwise manner, where a diagonally opposed pair of active sites switches between the open and closed conformations in a concerted manner. Such pairwise occurrence of different states is seen in all crystal forms (Fig. 3) and therefore unlikely to be a crystal packing artifact. Moreover, in the KdsCΔ8-product structure (Fig. 3, structure d), both Kdo and Pi are bound in two diagonal sites, whereas only Pi is bound in the other two sites. Therefore, the mechanistic steps are likely to occur in a pairwise fashion (Fig. 10). The reason for this pairwise transition is not known at this time.FIGURE 10The proposed mechanism of the enzymatic turnover of KdsC.

Based on structures a and b in Fig. 3 that are obtained from the same crystal, we propose an equilibrium between the open and the closed (the tail-/Cl−-bound) states of the active site, depicted in the shaded rectangle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The combination of the structural and biochemical observations reported herein reveals the origin of substrate specificity and strongly suggests a series of conformational changes that drive the catalytic cycle of KdsC. The C-terminal tail of an adjacent monomer performs an important mechanistic function in ensuring the catalytic efficiency at the active site likely through facilitating the product release. Both substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of KdsC are ultimate consequences of the tetramerization of KdsC, which occurs through a short β-hairpin insertion found in place of the missing cap domain present in other HAD enzymes. The haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) 4The abbreviations used are: HADSFhaloacid dehalogenase superfamilyKdo8P3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate. 4The abbreviations used are: HADSFhaloacid dehalogenase superfamilyKdo8P3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate. is considered one of the largest and most ubiquitous superfamilies of enzymes reported to date (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The basic catalytic motif along with the overall protein fold shared by members of the HADSF seem to have evolved to facilitate phosphoryl transfer from a large number of quite diverse substrates. These enzymes, which occur in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, are responsible for a wide range of important biological functions, such as the biosynthesis of important metabolic molecules (2Lahiri S.D.

Members of the HADSF contain a conserved mixed α/β Rossmann fold and a conserved nucleophilic aspartate that is essential for the chemistry (Fig. 1) (8Cho H. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on additional structural elements that are inserted in the Rossmann fold, HADSF enzymes are divided into three subfamilies. Members of C1 and C2 subfamilies are usually monomeric and contain a structural insertion termed the cap domain (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N.

Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The cap domain acts as a “lid” covering the substrate in the active site thereby ensuring catalytic efficiency (9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the C0 subfamily enzymes lack the cap domain and generally exhibit broad substrate specificity (9Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dai J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol.

Interestingly, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphatase (KdsC, previously annotated as YrbI; EC 3.1.3.45), an archetypical HADSF enzyme from the C0 subfamily, displays a narrow substrate specificity (12Wu J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The origin of the highly efficient hydrolysis KdsC of its specific substrate, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (Kdo8P), is unknown. KdsC, the third enzyme in the Kdo biosynthetic pathway, hydrolyzes Kdo 8-phosphate (Kdo8P) to Kdo and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Kdo is the key carbohydrate linker in the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, any disruption in the Kdo biosynthetic pathway could reduce integrity of the lipopolysaccharide that is critical to bacterial survival, pathogenic potential (14Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar), and antigenic response (15Nguyen H.P. Seto N.O. MacKenzie C.R. Brade L. Kosma P. Brade H. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct.

Putative homologs of Escherichia coli KdsC phosphatase (Fig. 2) are present in all Gram-negative bacteria with the known genomic sequence. Examples of these include YrbI from Haemophilus influenzae (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O.

Wang, unpublished data. which exhibit a tetrameric structure. The tetramer is stabilized by interactions of short β-hairpins, which are inserted in the core Rossmann fold. The active site of one monomer appears to be capped by an adjacent monomer (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Specific contacts with the substrate, Kdo8P, or the products, Kdo and Pi, could not be deduced because neither reported structure contained the substrate or the products. Capturing substrate or products in the active site of KdsC crystal is challenging due to the high catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (12Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the lack of known tightly binding substrate or product analogs. During our initial efforts to obtain a crystal structure of substrate (Kdo8P)- or product (Kdo)-bound E. coli KdsC, we observed an unusual binding of the C-terminal eight-residue region of one monomer into the active site of a neighboring monomer. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported for any other HADSF protein. Remarkably, the deletion of this C-terminal region of E. coli KdsC resulted in a slower enzymatic turnover without affecting substrate binding (a kcat effect rather than a Km effect). We were able to capture the catalytic products in the crystal structure of this deletion mutant (KdsCΔ8) and thereby deduce the role of tetramerization in specific substrate recognition. Overall, six crystal forms of E. coli full-length KdsC and KdsCΔ8 with different combinations of divalent metals and catalytic products were obtained. The different conformations of KdsC revealed in the crystal structures combined with kinetic studies suggest a mechanistic role of the C terminus of KdsC in catalysis. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the enigmatic origins of substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of KdsC. The position of the divalent cation in the structures of E. coli KdsC reported here and in the earlier reported structure of a KdsC homolog (YrbI) from H. influenzae (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) indicates the general location of the phosphatase active site. However, the position of substrate Kdo8P in the active site has not been clear. Deleting the eight C-terminal residues of KdsC enabled us to capture both Kdo and Pi products in the active site, likely as a result of slow product release of this deletion mutant. This product-bound KdsCΔ8 structure reveals structural features that explain the role of tetramerization in defining substrate specificity. Substrate recognition in KdsC is achieved not only by the monomer containing the catalytic aspartate residue but also by its neighboring monomer. In contrast, the substrate specificity in other families of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily is ensured by large rigid body movements of the cap domain that seal off the substrate in the active site and provide specificity determinants located on the cap itself (1Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A tetrameric organization similar to that of KdsC was recently reported for a moderately homologous and functionally divergent HADSF phosphatase KDN-9-P (BT1713) from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1224-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The active site cleft of KdsC is lined with mostly polar and charged residues, which dictate the specificity of KdsC to its hydrophilic substrate Kdo8P. All accessible moieties of Kdo are engaged in specific interactions with residues in the active site pocket (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, two well conserved hydrophobic residues, Val-56 and Leu-90 of an adjacent monomer (Fig. 2), that are solvent-exposed in the unbound structures of KdsC form hydrophobic interactions with the C-8 and C-3 methylene groups of Kdo, respectively. Another interaction with the adjacent monomer that appears to define the substrate specificity is a salt bridge between the Kdo carboxyl and the guanidinium group of Arg-86. A mutation of the homologous Arg-64 to an alanine in BT1713, where it forms a structurally similar salt bridge with the carboxyl of N-acetylneuraminate, abolished the phosphatase activity of BT1713 (11Lu Z. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1224-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The comparison of the structures of KdsC tetramers, in all crystal forms, revealed concerted conformational changes of two regions of the protein: the C-terminal tail and loops I/II surrounding the active site. The flexible C-terminal tail undergoes a dramatic conformational change between a disordered state, in which the tail is not observed in the electron density, and a defined conformation bound in the active site (also occupied by an anion) of a neighboring monomer. Strictly speaking, this disordered state of the tail is an ensemble of states in which the tail adopts several or a continuum of conformations. Thus, in this paper, the term “open conformation” also implies this conformational ensemble. The tail docking and product binding appear to drive similar movements of loops I and II that contain several conserved residues involved in recognition of Kdo8P. One of these residues, Arg-78 located in loop I (Fig. 7), also provides affinity for the tail presumably to displace the Kdo product upon completion of catalysis.The crystal structure of KdsC soaked with Kdo8P in presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, structure e) revealed the positions of the Pi 4.4 Å away from the catalytic Mg2+. The similarity in the coordination of Pi and that of the sulfate in the H. influenzae KdsC (YrbI) structure (16Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) lends support to structural conservation of residues mediating the Pi and divalent metal coordination in the KdsC family. Indeed, Lys-102 is universally conserved, Thr-76 is highly conserved (with a few exceptions of a functionally similar Ser), and Gly-77 is replaced with a Ser or an Ala only in a few bacterial species (Fig. 2). These three conserved residues are all located in flexible loops I and II. In contrast, the Mg2+-coordinating triad of aspartate residues (Asp-32, -34, and -125) exhibit very little or no movement, thus preserving the geometry required for catalysis. The side chain of Asp-32, the conserved nucleophile in the HADSF, appears to alternate between two rotamers, as judged from the partial occupancy of the two rotamers in electron density in the product-bound KdsCΔ8 structure (data not shown). This may reflect destabilization of the catalytic center to allow product dissociation.Several structural and biochemical observations strongly indicate an unexpected regulatory role of the C-terminal region of KdsC, likely in Kdo product release. The products are almost fully excluded from solvent and hence from possible interactions with the tail due to the active site closure. Therefore, the tail is unlikely to play an essential role in the covalent bond breaking step of the mechanism. Our steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrates that the enzymatic turnover of the KdsCΔ8 is much slower than that of full-length KdsC, whereas Km is similar for these two proteins. These observations indicate the tail is unlikely to play a role in the substrate binding step either. Furthermore, Vmax of the full-length protein is dependent on salt concentration, whereas that of KdsCΔ8 is not. This observation strongly suggests that the tail is involved in the rate-limiting step of the turnover. This rate-limiting step in the enzymatic turnover (with rate constant kcatobs) must involve solvation/desolvation of the tail upon the tail's conformational change. One plausible and simple mechanistic interpretation of these data is that the desolvation of the tail occurs as the tail binds into the active site to release the Kdo product. During the initial stages of tail binding, the C-terminal carboxyl may compete with the Kdo carboxyl for forming the salt bridge with Arg-86, thereby weakening the association of the Kdo product with the active site. Once Kdo is displaced, the tail stays transiently bound in the active site, which is still occupied by Pi. The slow release of Pi in the presence of Ca2+ could explain the previously observed dramatic loss of catalytic efficiency when Ca2+ is used instead of Mg2+ (12Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The multiple crystal structures of the KdsC-ligand complexes (Fig. 3) mimic various conformational intermediates of the KdsC reaction pathway (Fig. 10). Together with biochemical observations, these structures strongly suggest a mechanistic model, in which the likely slow Kdo release, driven by the C-terminal tail, is followed by Pi release. Finally, the tail docking was observed to occur in a pairwise manner, where a diagonally opposed pair of active sites switches between the open and closed conformations in a concerted manner. Such pairwise occurrence of different states is seen in all crystal forms (Fig. 3) and therefore unlikely to be a crystal packing artifact. Moreover, in the KdsCΔ8-product structure (Fig. 3, structure d), both Kdo and Pi are bound in two diagonal sites, whereas only Pi is bound in the other two sites. Therefore, the mechanistic steps are likely to occur in a pairwise fashion (Fig. 10). The reason for this pairwise transition is not known at this time.The combination of the structural and biochemical observations reported herein reveals the origin of substrate specificity and strongly suggests a series of conformational changes that drive the catalytic cycle of KdsC.

https://openalex.org/W2049791640,"The multi-protein beta-catenin destruction complex tightly regulates beta-catenin protein levels by shuttling beta-catenin to the proteasome. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a key serine/threonine kinase in the destruction complex, is responsible for several phosphorylation events that mark beta-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Because modulation of both beta-catenin and GSK3beta activity may have important implications for treating disease, a complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the beta-catenin/GSK3beta interaction is warranted. We screened an arrayed lentivirus library expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting 5,201 human druggable genes for silencing events that activate a beta-catenin pathway reporter (BAR) in synergy with 6-bromoindirubin-3'oxime (BIO), a specific inhibitor of GSK3beta. Top screen hits included shRNAs targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the target of the anti-inflammatory compound methotrexate. Exposure of cells to BIO plus methotrexate resulted in potent synergistic activation of BAR activity, reduction of beta-catenin phosphorylation at GSK3-specific sites, and accumulation of nuclear beta-catenin. Furthermore, the observed synergy correlated with inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta and was neutralized upon inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Linking these observations to inflammation, we also observed synergistic inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-12), and increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to GSK3 inhibitors and methotrexate. Our data establish DHFR as a novel modulator of beta-catenin and GSK3 signaling and raise several implications for clinical use of combined methotrexate and GSK3 inhibitors as treatment for inflammatory disease."

https://openalex.org/W1976111071,"Background Chlamydia trachomatis is a common human pathogen that mediates disease processes capable of inflicting serious complications on reproduction. Aggressive inflammatory immune responses are thought to not only direct a person's level of immunity but also the potential for immunopathology. With human immunobiology being debated as a cause of prevailing epidemiological trends, we examined some fundamental issues regarding susceptibility to multiple chlamydial infections that could have implications for infection spread. We argue that, compared to less-frequent exposure, frequent exposure to chlamydia may well produce unique immunobiological characteristics that likely to have important clinical and epidemiological implications. Methods and Results As a novel tool for studying chlamydia, we applied principles of modeling within-host pathogen dynamics to enable an understanding of some fundamental characteristics of an individual's immunobiology during multiple chlamydial infections. While the models were able to reproduce shorter-term infection kinetics of primary and secondary infections previously observed in animal models, it was also observed that longer periods between initial and second infection may increase an individual's chlamydial load and lengthen their duration of infectiousness. The cessation of short-term repeated exposure did not allow for the formation of long-lasting immunity. However, frequent re-exposure non-intuitively linked the formation of protective immunity, persistent infection, and the potential for immunopathology. Conclusions Overall, these results provide interesting insights that should be verified with continued study. Nevertheless, these results appear to raise challenges for current evidence of the development of long-lasting immunity against chlamydia, and suggest the existence of a previously unidentified mechanism for the formation of persistent infection. The obvious next goal is to investigate the qualitative impact of these results on the spread of chlamydia."
https://openalex.org/W2070094302,"Sans-fille (SNF) is the Drosophila homologue of mammalian general splicing factors U1A and U2B'', and it is essential in Drosophila sex determination. We found that, besides its ability to bind U1 snRNA, SNF can also bind polyuridine RNA tracts flanking the male-specific exon of the master switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) pre-mRNA specifically, similar to Sex-lethal protein (SXL). The polyuridine RNA binding enables SNF directly inhibit Sxl exon 3 splicing, as the dominant negative mutant SNF(1621) binds U1 snRNA but not polyuridine RNA. Unlike U1A, both RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of SNF can recognize polyuridine RNA tracts independently, even though SNF and U1A share very high sequence identity and overall structure similarity. As SNF RRM1 tends to self-associate on the opposite side of the RNA binding surface, it is possible for SNF to bridge the formation of super-complexes between two introns flanking Sxl exon 3 or between a intron and U1 snRNP, which serves the molecular basis for SNF to directly regulate Sxl splicing. Taken together, a new functional model for SNF in Drosophila sex determination is proposed. The key of the new model is that SXL and SNF function similarly in promoting Sxl male-specific exon skipping with SNF being an auxiliary or backup to SXL, and it is the combined dose of SXL and SNF governs Drosophila sex determination."
https://openalex.org/W2060129054,"In prion disease, the peripheral expression of PrP(C) is necessary for the transfer of infectivity to the central nervous system. The spleen is involved in neuroinvasion and neural dissemination in prion diseases but the nature of this involvement is not known. The present study undertook the investigation of the spatial relationship between sites of PrP(Sc) accumulation, localisation of nerve fibres and PrP(C) expression in the tissue compartments of the spleen of scrapie-inoculated and control sheep.Laser microdissection and quantitative PCR were used to determine PrP mRNA levels and results were compared with immunohistochemical protocols to distinguish PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) in tissue compartments of the spleen. In sheep experimentally infected with scrapie, the major sites of accumulation of PrP(Sc) in the spleen, namely the lymphoid nodules and the marginal zone, expressed low levels of PrP mRNA. Double immunohistochemical labelling for PrP(Sc) and the pan-nerve fibre marker, PGP, was used to evaluate the density of innervation of splenic tissue compartments and the intimacy of association between PrP(Sc) and nerves. Some nerve fibres were observed to accompany blood vessels into the PrP(Sc)-laden germinal centres. However, the close association between nerves and PrP(Sc) was most apparent in the marginal zone. Other sites of close association were adjacent to the wall of the central artery of PALS and the outer rim of germinal centres.The findings suggest that the degree of PrP(Sc) accumulation does not depend on the expression level of PrP(C). Though several splenic compartments may contribute to neuroinvasion, the marginal zone may play a central role in being the compartment with most apparent association between nerves and PrP(Sc)."
https://openalex.org/W2090112747,"DNA polymerase α is essential for the onset of eukaryotic DNA replication. Its correct folding and assembly within the nuclear replication pre-initiation complex is crucial for normal cell cycle progression and genome maintenance. Due to a single point mutation in the largest DNA polymerase α subunit, p180, the temperature-sensitive mouse cell line tsFT20 exhibits heat-labile DNA polymerase α activity and S phase arrest at restrictive temperature. In this study, we show that an aberrant form of endogenous p180 in tsFT20 cells (p180tsFT20) is strictly localized in the cytoplasm while its wild-type counterpart enters the nucleus. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged or photoactivatable green fluorescent protein-tagged p180tsFT20 variants and inhibitor analysis revealed that the exclusion of aberrant p180tsFT20 from the nucleus is due to two distinct mechanisms: first, the inability of newly synthesized (cytoplasmic) p180tsFT20 to enter the nucleus and second, proteasome-dependent degradation of nuclear-localized protein. The nuclear import defect seems to result from an impaired association of aberrant de novo synthesized p180tsFT20 with the second subunit of DNA polymerase α, p68. In accordance, we show that RNA interference of p68 results in a decrease of the overall p180 protein level and in a specific increase of cytoplasmic localized p180 in NIH3T3 cells. Taken together, our data suggest two mechanisms that prevent the nuclear expression of aberrant DNA polymerase α. DNA polymerase α is essential for the onset of eukaryotic DNA replication.

Taken together, our data suggest two mechanisms that prevent the nuclear expression of aberrant DNA polymerase α. The highly conserved DNA polymerase α-primase complex is the only eukaryotic polymerase that can initiate DNA synthesis de novo. Thus, its recruitment is a crucial step in the tightly regulated stepwise assembly of the replication machinery in eukaryotic cells. This complex is required for the synthesis of RNA primers, an essential prerequisite for the initiation of replication, and for the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (1Hubscher U.

The DNA polymerase α-primase complex consists of four subunits, each of which is conserved in eukaryotes; in yeast, all four subunits are essential for viability (2Wang T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The largest subunit, 180 kDa (p180), harbors the catalytic polymerase α activity. The two smallest subunits, 54 kDa (p54) and 46 kDa (p46), provide primase activity. The p46 protein, which is coupled to p180 by p54, synthesizes RNA primers and is involved in regulating their length; it also functions in cell cycle checkpoints (12Arezi B. Kuchta R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 572-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The 68-kDa subunit (p68) plays a crucial regulatory role in the early stage of chromosomal replication in yeast and has been shown to be essential for the nuclear import of p180 in mouse cells (13Foiani M.

To avoid errors in DNA duplication that compromise genome integrity in vertebrate cells, the transition from G1 to S phase and the onset of DNA polymerase activity are highly regulated by at least two cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin A/cdk2 (15Ekholm-Reed S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In an SV40 in vitro system, phosphorylation of p68 inhibits replication initiation as well as primer synthesis and elongation (17Ott R.D. Rehfuess C. Podust V.N. Clark J.E. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5669-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the p180 subunit contains multiple regulatory phosphorylation sites (18Voitenleitner C. Rehfuess C. Hilmes M. O'Rear L.

In addition to regulation by phosphorylation, expression of the DNA polymerase α gene is controlled during the cell cycle by E2F, GABP, and Sp1 transcription factors (20Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P.

Thus, the activity of DNA polymerase α is tightly controlled at the transcriptional and post-translational levels, whereas less is known about its subcellular distribution, regulation, and behavior under various stress conditions.

However, at the restrictive temperature of 39.5 °C, they exhibit a phenotype closely resembling that conferred by arrest at the G1/S boundary. At the restrictive temperature, tsFT20 cells were further characterized as defective in DNA replication, with a highly decreased DNA synthesis rate, reduced frequencies of replicon initiation, and extensive chromosome aberrations. Purified DNA polymerase α from tsFT20 cells was found to be temperature-sensitive although composed of the same hetero-tetrameric complex as that of FM3A cells, and this defect was ascribed to a single point mutation that changes amino acid 1180 of the p180 subunit from serine to phenylalanine (28Izumi M. Miyazawa H. Harakawa S. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7639-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abnormal cessation of DNA replication in tsFT20 cells at the restrictive temperature results in cell death via the induction of DNA double strand breaks, suggesting that aberrant DNA polymerase α is cytotoxic and also that in general a specific quality control mechanism for the pool of aberrant DNA polymerase α in wild-type cells may be crucial to ensure genomic stability and accurate DNA replication. Recently, it was reported that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reduced levels of the replicative DNA polymerase α result in greatly elevated frequencies of chromosome translocations and chromosome loss (35Lemoine F.J. Degtyareva N.P. Lobachev K. Petes T.D. Cell. 2005; 120: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similarly, when Mcm10 or Ctf4 are depleted in mammalian cells, DNA polymerase α levels are markedly reduced, suggesting that DNA polymerase α levels are indeed crucially regulated by as yet unknown cellular mechanisms (36Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 37Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S.

Several mechanisms that ensure the removal of defective proteins have been described, the most prominent being ER 5The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLMBleptomycin BCHXcycloheximidePA-GFPphotoactivatable green fluorescent proteinmRFPmouse red fluorescent proteinCSKcytoskeleton bufferPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. -associated degradation, a process that governs the degradation of unfolded ER proteins in the cytoplasm (38Richly H.

Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Degradation systems that function in quality control have also been identified in the secretory pathway and in mitochondria (40Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). These processes are carried out by proteasomes, organelles consisting of several proteases that are located in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (41Bennett E.J. Bence N.F. Jayakumar R. Kopito R.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 42Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, most cystic fibrosis patients inherit at least one mutant allele of the ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, which has a temperature-sensitive folding defect causing its detection by the endoplasmic quality control system (44Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). In contrast, the degradation-dependent protein quality control mechanisms that act in the nucleus are still poorly understood. Recently, Gardner et al. (45Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) reported that San1-mediated degradation acts as a protein quality control system in S. cerevisiae nuclei. However, it is still unclear how aberrant nuclear proteins are recognized by ubiquitin E3 ligases and whether analogous systems exist in higher eukaryotes. endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein leptomycin B cycloheximide photoactivatable green fluorescent protein mouse red fluorescent protein cytoskeleton buffer 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid small interfering RNA. In this study, we observed the subcellular distribution and protein expression of an aberrant form of the endogenously expressed DNA polymerase α subunit p180 in tsFT20 cells (p180tsFT20) at the restricted temperature using a specific p180 antibody. Surprisingly, we found that endogenous p180tsFT20 was rapidly degraded in the nucleus at the restricted temperature, concomitantly with de novo synthesized protein accumulating in the cytoplasm. Based on these crucial findings on endogenous p180tsFT20, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged p180tsFT20 in NIH3T3 or COS-1 cells and made the very same observation that the aberrant p180 variant is excluded from the nucleus and accumulates in the cytoplasm at the restrictive temperature, whereas the wild-type counterpart normally localizes to the nucleus. Inhibitor studies combined with immunofluorescence analysis suggest two mechanisms that exclude aberrant p180tsFT20 from the nucleus: defective nuclear import of de novo synthesized protein and proteasome-dependent degradation of nuclear localized protein. Our data further suggests that a single point mutation in p180tsFT20 presumably causes conformational changes that alter the hydrophobic character of the protein surface, rendering p180tsFT20 unable to bind the p68 subunit, which leads in turn to its inability to enter the nucleus (cytoplasmic fraction) or its recognition by the proteasome-dependent degradation machinery (nuclear fraction). In accordance with this assumption, we find that the knockdown of p68 by RNA interference results in a decrease of the overall p180 protein level and a specific increase of cytoplasmically expressed p180. Our findings thus offer mechanistic insights into how the aberrant DNA polymerase α subunit p180 (and probably other malformed nuclear proteins) are cleared from the nucleus to avoid its inappropriate involvement in DNA replication. Expression plasmids encoding p180 or p68 were previously described (14Mizuno T. Ito N. Yokoi M. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using the primers tsFT20-s 5′-GTGATACGGTGTTCTATGTTATTTG-3′ and tsFT20-as 5′-CAAATAACATAGAACACCGTATCAC-3′, a specific point mutation that creates the S1180F alteration was inserted in plasmid vectors pSRa-p180, pSRα-p180-GFP, and pSRα-H-core (14Mizuno T.

To generate the expression plasmid pSRα-p180tsFT20PA-GFP encoding photoactivatable GFP-tagged p180tsFT20, four point mutations (L64F, T65S, V163A, and T204H in EGFP) were introduced (47Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). The p68-mRFP fusion expression plasmid was constructed by fusing mRFP1 cDNA to the C terminus of p68. The identity of each construct was confirmed by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3130 automatic DNA sequencer. NIH3T3 mouse cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and used for direct immunofluorescence analysis and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. For Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, COS-1 cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum instead of calf serum. Mouse FM3A cells and the tsFT20 strain were maintained at the permissive temperature (33 °C) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. NIH3T3 cells (1–3 × 104 cells/well) were kept at 37 °C for 16 h and transfected in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or transfectin (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche). If not otherwise mentioned, transfected cells were incubated in appropriate media for 48 h at 33 °C and then kept at 33 °C or shifted to 39.5 °C. The inhibitors leptomycin B (LMB) (2.5 nm, Sigma), MG132 (5 μm, Calbiochem), and cycloheximide (CHX) (0.1 mm, Aldrich) were added 1 h before the temperature shift, if not otherwise mentioned. Following transfection, COS-1 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from plates into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and frozen as pellets at −80 °C. After thawing, the cells were resuspended in cytoskeleton buffer (CSK) (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (S1 fraction) was collected and the insoluble chromatin fraction was further extracted with the same solution as above but supplemented with 0.3 m KCl, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and separated by centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Again, the supernatant was collected (S3 fraction) and the remaining insoluble material (pellet fraction) was dissolved in 70 μl of SDS sample buffer. The tsFT20 cells were incubated at permissive (33 °C) or restrictive (39.5 °C) temperatures for the indicated times, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. For Western blot analysis, the S1 or the pellet fraction was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were washed three times (5 min at room temperature) with TBSSM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl), blocked with 5% skim milk (30 min at room temperature), incubated with primary antibodies dissolved in TBSSM buffer (16 h at 4 °C), and washed three times with TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies dissolved in TBSSM buffer were applied to the membranes (1 h at room temperature), which were then washed again three times, incubated in 2 ml of SuperSignal reagent (Pierce), and observed using the LAS system (Fuji). To detect polyubiquitinated p180 in tsFT20 cells, 6% SDS-PAGE was used and Western blot analysis was carried out using a monoclonal anti-polyubiquitin antibody (FK2, Nippon Biotest Laboratory). To detect polyubiquitinated p180, 1 × 107 tsFT20 cells were harvested after incubation for 9 h at 39.5 °C in the presence of 2 mm MG132. Cells were extracted with CSK/Triton X-100 buffer for 20 min at 4 °C and the detergent-resistant fraction was separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min). The remaining pellet was mixed with CSK/Triton X-100 buffer and sonicated well by handy sonic UR-20P (TOMY SEIKO Inc. Japan). One mg of extract was mixed with 3 μl of anti-p180 antiserum for 16 h at 4 °C. Each sample was mixed with 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and the unbound fraction was separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 2 min). The remaining pellet was washed with CSK/Triton X-100 buffer, dissolved in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-p180 antibody and monoclonal anti-polyubiquitin antibody. Eight-well chamber slides were pre-treated with poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and 3 × 104 cells were seeded per well and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were transfected as described above and incubated for 48 h at 33 °C. Inhibitors were applied either separately or in combination as described above and the cultures were incubated for another 1 h at 33 °C. The cells were then either shifted to 39.5 °C or kept at 33 °C as a control. Cell fixing, staining with anti-p180, anti-p68, and anti-Mcm7 (Sigma) antibodies, and subsequent observation by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, AX70) were done as previously described (14Mizuno T. Ito N. Yokoi M. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46Mizuno T. Yamagishi K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7886-7896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To increase the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the endogenous p180 signal, monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Sigma) were used for staining. In three independent experiments, a total of 600 cells was counted and localization of overexpressed protein was classified as nuclear, nuclear and cytoplasmic, or cytoplasmic. The direct GFP signal and the signal detected with anti-GFP antibodies were visualized as green and red, respectively. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue). To detect endogenous p180 in tsFT20 cells, digital images were captured and processed with fluorescence microscopy and deconvolution analysis using a nearest neighbor method with HazeBuster software (VayTek, Inc.) (48Gorby G.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The stack images of 10 optical sections with a step size of 200 nm were then deconvolved in three dimensions. To visualize cytoplasm in FM3A cells, endogenous biotin in the mitochondria was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin (Invitrogen). To observe living cells, 2.0 × 105 NIH3T3 cells in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum were seeded in 35-mm dishes with a glass slide on the bottom and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with 2.4 μg of p180tsFT20GFP DNA, 1.6 μg of p68 DNA, 6 μl of transfectin, and 500 μl of serum-free media. After incubation for 48 h at 33 °C, the media was changed to CO2-independent media and the temperature was up-shifted and kept constant at 39.5 °C using a microscope stage heater (Olympus, MI-IBC-I). To monitor p180tsFT20GFP, cells were kept for 5 h at 39.5 °C, and the temperature was then reduced and maintained at 33 °C. The GFP signal was observed and pictures were taken every 6 or 10 min. For photoactivation experiments, cells expressing PA-GFP-tagged p180 or p180tsFT20 were photoactivated by a 10-s exposure to 420 nm light (filter BP400–440, Olympus) from a shuttered 100-watt mercury epi-illuminator with a ×40 UPlanApo objective. Cells were co-transfected with monomeric RFP1-p68 to identify those expressing p180tsFT20PA-GFP. Live cell images were acquired with a ×20 UPlanApo objective. Two rounds of siRNA oligonucleotide transfections were performed to reduce the expression level of p68. siRNA duplexes were transfected into NIH3T3 cells using siLentFect lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 pm duplex RNA was used for each transfection. The procedure was repeated on the second day, and cells were harvested on the fourth day. The following RNA oligonucleotides were used: control, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′; si68-1, 5′-CGGUAAAGCGAAAGGAUAATT-3′; si68-2, 5′-GAGAAGUUCUGACCAGUAATT-3′; si68-3, 5′-GAUUCAGCCGAGUCCUUAATT-3′; si68-4, 5′-CAGAGACAUUGUUUCUAUATT-3′. The temperature-sensitive mutant cell line tsFT20 is characterized by severe defects in cell cycle progression and DNA replication. These phenotypes were assigned to a single point mutation in the largest subunit of the mouse DNA polymerase α complex, p180. The properties of the respective protein (designated p180tsFT20) have been studied on a biochemical level, but its expression levels, localization pattern, turnover rate, and nuclear transport properties remained unknown. For the intriguing possibility to use this protein variant as a tool to study protein quality control mechanisms specifically in the nucleus, we decided to look at the endogenous p180tsFT20 expression levels in the original tsFT20 cell line. For that, FM3A wild-type cells and tsFT20 cells were incubated at 33 or 39.5 °C for 2–24 h, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in SDS sample buffer. The cellular level of DNA polymerase α was monitored with anti-p180 and anti-p68 antibodies. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous p180tsFT20 was rapidly degraded at the restrictive temperature, whereas the level of endogenous p180 in both FM3A wild-type cells at 39.5 °C and tsFT20 cells at 33 °C (permissive temperature) remained constant. Interestingly, the level of the second largest subunit, p68, also decreased similarly to that of p180, whereas the levels of Mcm7 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (used as controls) did not change. Therefore, we concluded that endogenous p180tsFT20 is rapidly degraded upon temperature up-shift in the tsFT20 cell line, concomitantly with the tightly associated p68 subunit. To define whether the disappearance of endogenous p180tsFT20 from the nucleus is dependent on nuclear export or the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway, tsFT20 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the nuclear export inhibitor LMB or the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and protein levels of p180tsFT20 were quantified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). LMB showed no significant effect on the reduction of p180tsFT20, whereas MG132 reduced the degradation of p180tsFT20. This suggests that first, the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway is not involved in the degradation of endogenous p180tsFT20 and second, that the degradation of endogenous p180tsFT20 is dependent on the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway and may be specifically in the nucleus. To verify ubiquitin-mediated degradation, proteasome function was inhibited by incubation with MG132 and samples were prepared for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). One mg of protein from MG132-treated tsFT20 cells at the restrictive temperature was incubated with anti-p180 antiserum and Western blot was performed with a monoclonal anti-polyubiquitin antibody as shown in Fig. 1C. Interestingly, polyubiquitinated p180 was only observed in the soluble fraction of tsFT20 cell extracts at the restrictive temperature, and in the presence of MG132. In sonication-dependent insoluble fractions, p180 is clearly detectable, however, not in its polyubiquitinated form. To further examine whether endogenous p180tsFT20 is degraded in the nucleus or cytoplasm at the restrictive temperature, tsFT20 cells were stained with anti-p180 antibodies. For visualizing the cytoplasm in tsFT20 cells, endogenous biotin in the mitochondria was stained with Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin and deconvolution imaging performed. We found that endogenous p180tsFT20 was exclusively localized in the nucleus at the permissive temperature, whereas surprisingly, p180tsFT20 accumulated in the cytoplasm at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the observ"
https://openalex.org/W2061379177,"Background The functional significance of proenkephalin systems in processing pain remains an open question and indeed is puzzling. For example, a noxious mechanical stimulus does not alter the release of Met-enkephalin-like material (MELM) from segments of the spinal cord related to the stimulated area of the body, but does increase its release from other segments. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that, in the rat, a noxious mechanical stimulus applied to either the right or the left hind paw elicits a marked increase of MELM release during perifusion of either the whole spinal cord or the cervico-trigeminal area. However, these stimulatory effects were not additive and indeed, disappeared completely when the right and left paws were stimulated simultaneously. Conclusion/Significance We have concluded that in addition to the concept of a diffuse control of the transmission of nociceptive signals through the dorsal horn, there is a diffuse control of the modulation of this transmission. The “freezing” of Met-enkephalinergic functions represents a potential source of central sensitization in the spinal cord, notably in clinical situations involving multiple painful foci, e.g. cancer with metastases, poly-traumatism or rheumatoid arthritis."
