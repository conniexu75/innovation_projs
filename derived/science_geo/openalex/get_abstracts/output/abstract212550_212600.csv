https://openalex.org/W1974281891,"Seeman and O'Brien1 have reported that the mean sodium, potassium-ATPase activity in the red cell ghost membranes of 6 schizophrenic patients (79.1 mµ;moles ATP split/h/mg dry weight) was significantly greater than in four normal subjects (35.2). Total ATPase was also greater among patients than controls, although the difference in the residual or magnesium-dependent fraction was said to be statistically insignificant. When enzyme activity is expressed in this way, small differences in ghost weight could result in large differences in activity. For this reason it would appear more valid to express sodium, potassium-ATPase as that percentage of the total ATPase activity which is activated by sodium + potassium. When the data for schizophrenic and normal subjects are calculated in this way (sodium, potassium-ATPase × 100/total ATPase), the result for the normals is 16 per cent and for the schizophrenics 24 per cent, a much smaller difference."

https://openalex.org/W1972112512,"THE oxidative metabolism of the ciliary body has been investigated with regard to the energy source for the secretion of aqueous humour. It has been shown previously that formation of aqueous humour is dependent on active secretion of Na+ (ref. 1) and there is some evidence that this process is effected by means of a sodium–potassium stimulated ATPase2–4, a finding in keeping with results on other secretory tissues5,6. The source of ATP or other high-energy intermediates utilized in Na+ secretion must be from glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as de Roetth7 has shown that the oxidized substrates of ciliary body are chiefly carbohydrate. Cole8 has shown that certain enzymes of the citric acid cycle are present in the epithelial cells and that succinic dehydrogenase is concentrated inthe non-pigmented layer."
https://openalex.org/W2083677512,"RECENT experiments have shown that adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) is actually utilized by working muscles during single contractions but is normally resynthesized during the contraction by the action of ATP–Cr transphosphorylase and ATP–AMP transphosphorylase (myokinase)1–4. A breakdown of phosphorylcreatine (PCr) at 0° C during single isotonic contractions has been observed directly in frog rectus abdominis muscles (Rana pipiens) treated with 2,4-dinitrophenol to reduce the high tissue content of this substance. There is a linear relationship between the amount of breakdown and the work performed, with very little PCr utilized in activation and shortening per se of these muscles. The experiments reported here show that rectus abdominis muscles cleave PCr during short isometric tetanic contractions in amounts proportional to the time and to the developed tension."

https://openalex.org/W2028610117,"THE distance of displacement has recently emerged as one, possibly very important, parameter in pigeon homing1–5. The accuracy of initial orientation, in particular, seems to be a functionof the distance from home3,4. In order to extend a previous series of experiments, which involved a more complex problem and distances below 100 km3,4, a new series was designed to investigate the relation between initial orientation and distance of displacement of up to 400 km."

With the exception of the amidase from Streptomyces lavendulaedescribed by Batchelor, Chain, Richards and Rolinson3, few details have been published about these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2989472502,"IN a recent article Bachmann and Muller1 discuss the crystal symmetry of actinomycin C3, and suggest that this molecule has trigonal or pseudotrigonal symmetry. This leads them to the conclusion that the peptide part of the molecule consists of two pentapeptides rather than of one decapeptide. However, there are certain difficulties in their argument, which arise partly from a misunderstanding of space group theory. They give R&3macr;m, R32, and R3m as the possible space groups for the rhombohedral form, and P21 or P21/m for the monoclinic form. The presence of one of the two enantiomorphs of an optically active compound, such as occurs in the peptide part of actinomycin, excludes space groups with reflexion planes or inversion centres, since they require each L-amino-acid to be matched by a corresponding D-amino-acid. Therefore the only permissible space groups of those listed are R32 and P21."

https://openalex.org/W1969467471,"ONLY a few reports on the biochemical action of poly-cyclic hydrocarbons have appeared. Gilleland and Bond1 observed an increase in the RNA/DNA ratio in Escherichia coli cells which were grown in the presence of certain polycyclic hydrocarbons. McCarter and Quastler2 have shown that 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) inhibits the incorporation of thymidine into DNA in the growing hair follicle. This communication describes the biochemical effects of DMBA and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) on the formation of aminoacyl–sRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1996386232,"A DIRECT histochemical method for the demonstration of sialic acid was recently published by Shear and Pearse1 which is based on a method described by Svennerholm2. The procedure as described by Shear and Pearse requires that the reaction be carried out on fresh-frozen cryostat sections (8µ), mounted on albumin-coated glass slides which have been exposed to formaldehyde vapour in a closed desiccator for at least 72 h and washed in running water for 2 min and allowed to dry. The reaction is then carried out by covering the sections with a few drops of resorcinol hydrochloride. After 2 min, excess reagent is removed and the sections treated with a few drops of 1 per cent sodium nitrite in concentrated hydrochloric acid. The red colour which develops is attributed to sialic acid sites and the intensity proportioned to the sialic acid concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1999373696,"6-THIOGUANINE (TG) has been reported to be an inhibitor of the growth of both human and rodent neoplasms. Investigations of some of the biochemical effects of this agent by LePage1,2 have led to the suggestion that incorporation of TG as a deoxyribonucleotide into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the mechanism by which this antimetabolite inhibits growth. Accordingly, it was of interest to demonstrate the enzymatic synthesis of the 2′-deoxyribonucleoside of TG (dTGR) and to determine whether this compound had any advantage over either TG or 6-thioguanosine (TGR). The chemical synthesis of dTGR has been reported recently3,4. Biochemical and biological studies carried out with the synthetic material indicated that dTGR is superior to TG as an inhibitor of the growth of transplanted rodent neoplasms, and greater quantities of dTGR were incorporated into the DNA of mammary adenocarcinomas of mice than of TGR (ref. 5)."
