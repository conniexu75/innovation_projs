https://openalex.org/W1600831053,"The effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on fibroblast collagenolytic activity were investigated to determine if modulation of matrix metalloendoproteinase activity could augment the stimulation of connective tissue formation by TGF-beta. Quiescent human fibroblast cultures were incubated in the continuous presence of 1.0 ng/ml (40 pM) TGF-beta in culture medium supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) serum and containing [35S]methionine. Aliquots of conditioned cell culture media, harvested daily for 4 days, were processed individually to separate procollagenase and a 72-kDa progelatinase from metalloendoproteinase inhibitor (TIMP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) using tandem minicolumns of heparin- and gelatin-Sepharose. The fractionated 54-kDa procollagenase was quantitated, after p-amino-phenylmercuric acetate activation, by functional assays using soluble [14C] glycine-labeled collagen as substrate. In cultures treated with TGF-beta, procollagenase expression was progressively decreased (approximately 50% on day 1, approximately 75% on day 2) to undetectable levels on days 3 and 4. This decrease occurred despite a 1.6-fold increase in the synthesis of total secreted protein. Contrasting the effect on procollagenase, TGF-beta increased the synthesis of a 72-kDa progelatinase (characterized as a matrix neutral metalloproteinase and likely to be MMP-2) up to 1.8-fold, as determined by quantitation of affinity-purified radiolabeled protein and by enzymography. TIMP biosynthesis was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and quantitated by functional assays for biologically active TIMP following fractionation of the conditioned media. During the first 24 h TGF-beta had little apparent effect on TIMP activity in the medium although the TIMP mRNA transcript was induced 1.3-1.4-fold. Subsequently, TIMP levels were increased 1.7-fold relative to control cells on day 4. This was accompanied by a 2.4-fold increase in TIMP mRNA, indicating that the regulation of TIMP mRNA and protein levels may be a secondary response to TGF-beta. In comparison, the synthesis of the Mr 48,000 PAI-1, analyzed by [35S] methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation, was elevated greater than 10-fold by TGF-beta at all time points with the highest levels occurring at day 2. Thus, the effects of TGF-beta on procollagenase, 72-kDa progelatinase, TIMP, and PAI-1 were selective and showed temporal differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2041014178,"The STE4 and STE18 genes are required for haploid yeast cell mating. Sequencing of the cloned genes revealed that the STE4 polypeptide shows extensive homology to the beta subunits of mammalian G proteins, while the STE18 polypeptide shows weak similarity to the gamma subunit of transducin. Null mutations in either gene can suppress the haploid-specific cell-cycle arrest caused by mutations in the SCG1 gene (previously shown to encode a protein with similarity to the alpha subunit of G proteins). We propose that the products of the STE4 and STE18 genes comprise the beta and gamma subunits of a G protein complex coupled to the mating pheromone receptors. The genetic data suggest pheromone-receptor binding leads to the dissociation of the alpha subunit from beta gamma (as shown for mammalian G proteins), and the free beta gamma element initiates the pheromone response."
https://openalex.org/W1515380434,"Abstract Cells whose proliferation is blocked by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) express three distinct surface glycoproteins of 53, 73, and 300 kDa that bind TGF-beta with high affinity, but whose function is unknown. We have isolated two classes of chemically-induced Mv1Lu epithelial cell mutants resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-beta. Class R mutants have selectively lost expression of the 53-kDa (type I) TGF-beta-binding protein. They have also lost the ability to respond to TGF-beta with elevated fibronectin expression and cell flattening. Class S mutants bind normally but do not respond to TGF-beta. TGF-beta-resistant mutants retain a contact inhibited, nontransformed phenotype. The properties of S mutants suggest that they are defective in the TGF-beta signal transduction mechanism, while the results with R mutants identify the type I TGF-beta-binding protein as the receptor involved in mediating TGF-beta actions on cell adhesion and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2078691152,"We take advantage of a cell-free system that reconstitutes essentially a single round of transport of the VSV-encoded G protein between Golgi cisternae to identify discrete stages in the maturation of carrier vesicles. Using GTP gamma S and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) as selective inhibitors to accumulate coated and uncoated vesicles, respectively, we find these to be successive and obligatory transport intermediates. We find that the coated and uncoated vesicles that accumulate when transport is blocked have already transferred from donor to acceptor stacks but not yet fused. Similar coated and uncoated vesicles accumulate in appropriately treated whole cells. Our studies imply that a coated bud (pit)-coated vesicle-uncoated vesicle system analogous to that responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis carries biosynthetic protein transport across the Golgi stack. However, ""Golgi""-coated buds do not contain clathrin and seem to act as bulk carriers, whereas endocytic clathrin-coated pits carry a highly selective cargo."
https://openalex.org/W1554850792,"Study of the proteins involved in DNA replication of a model system such as SV40 is a first step in understanding eukaryotic chromosomal replication. Using a cell-free system that is capable of replicating plasmid DNA molecules containing the SV40 origin of replication, we conducted a series of systematic fractionation-reconstitution experiments for the purpose of identifying and characterizing the cellular proteins involved in SV40 DNA replication. In addition to the one viral-encoded replication protein, T antigen, we have identified and begun to characterize at least six cellular components from a HeLa cytoplasmic extract that are absolutely required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro. These include: (i) two partially purified fractions, CF IC and CF IIA, and (ii) four proteins that have been purified to near homogeneity, replication protein-A, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, DNA polymerase α-primase complex, and topoisomerase (I and II). Replication protein-A is a multi-subunit protein that has single-stranded DNA binding activity and is required for a T antigen-dependent, origin-dependent unwinding reaction which may be an important early step in initiation of replication. Fraction CF IC can stimulate this unwinding reaction, suggesting that it also may function during initiation. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, DNA polymerase α-primase, and CF IIA all appear to be involved in elongation of nascent chains."
https://openalex.org/W1552234264,"Abstract The role of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) N-linked oligosaccharides in receptor binding and signal transduction was analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis and transfection studies. hCG derivatives with alterations at individual glycosylation sites were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Receptor binding studies showed that absence of any or all of the hCG N-linked oligosaccharides had only a minor effect on the receptor affinity of the derivatives. Similarly, absence of the N-linked oligosaccharides from the beta subunit or a single oligosaccharide from Asn-78 of alpha had no effect on the production of cAMP or on steroidogenesis. However, the absence of carbohydrate at Asn-52 of alpha decreases both the steroidogenic and cAMP responses. Furthermore, absence of this critical oligosaccharide unit on alpha unmasks differences in the two N-linked oligosaccharides on beta; the beta Asn-13 oligosaccharide but not the beta Asn-30 oligosaccharide plays a more important role in steroidogenesis. Dimers containing deglycosylated beta subunit and an alpha subunit lacking either the Asn-52 oligosaccharide or both oligosaccharides fail to stimulate cAMP or steroid formation. Moreover, these derivatives bind to receptor and behave as competitive antagonists. The use of site-directed mutagenesis was critical in uncovering site-specific functions of the hCG N-linked oligosaccharides in signal transduction and reveals the importance of the Asn-52 oligosaccharide in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1525012305,"Abstract Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is encoded by separate genes for two possible subunit chains (A-chain and B-chain) which can form three possible dimers (AA, AB, and BB). We have recently presented evidence that multiple forms of PDGF receptor exist which distinguish between these isoforms (Hart, C. H., Forstrom, J. W., Kelley, J. D., Smith, R. A., Ross, R., Murray, M. J., and Bowen-Pope, D. F. (1988) Science 240, 1529-1531). We used this specificity to determine the amount of PDGF from different sources which is able to bind to each class of receptor and found that each source had a characteristic isoform composition. Levels of total PDGF activity in sera from different species ranged more than 15-fold, from less than 1 ng/ml in dog, chicken, pig, and calf, to greater than 13 ng/ml in mouse and human. Despite these differences in PDGF content, the total mitogenic activities of the sera were comparable indicating that the relative importance of PDGF as a serum mitogen may vary considerably between species. Analysis of the total PDGF into the amounts of each isoform revealed great differences in composition. PDGF-BB constitutes only about 15% of the total binding activity in human PDGF purified by the method of Raines and Ross (Raines, E. W., and Ross, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5154-5160) but is the predominant isoform in whole blood serum from all other species. In contrast to serum, medium conditioned by cultured PDGF-secreting cell types contained no detectable PDGF-BB except in two cases: medium conditioned by vascular endothelial cells and by cells transformed by simian sarcoma virus. The existence of isoform-specific PDGF receptors and the large variation in PDGF isoform composition dependent upon source may provide an important mechanism through which the effects of PDGF can be targeted to different cell types and/or toward eliciting different cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2018050027,"Some yeast mitochondrial introns encode proteins that promote either splicing (maturases) or intron propagation via gene conversion (the fit1 endonuclease). We surveyed introns in the coxl gene for their ability to engage in gene conversion and found that the group I intron, al4 alpha, was efficiently transmitted to genes lacking it. An endonucleolytic cleavage is detectable in recipient DNA molecules near the site of intron insertion in vivo and in vitro. Conversion is dependent on an intact al4 alpha open reading frame. This intron product is a latent maturase, but these data show that it is also a potent endonuclease involved in recombination. Dual function proteins that cleave DNA and facilitate RNA splicing may have played a pivotal role in the propagation and tolerance of introns."
https://openalex.org/W2055703133,"Two introns of the mitochondrial genome 777-3A of S. cerevisiae, bl4 in cob and al4 in coxl genes, contain ORFs that can be translated into two homologous proteins. We changed the UGA, AUA, and CUN codons of these ORFs to the universal genetic code, in order to study the functions of their translated products in E. coli and in yeast, by retargeting the nuclear encoded protein into mitochondria. The p27bl4 protein has been shown to be required for the splicing of both introns bl4 and al4. The homologous p28al4 protein is highly toxic to E. coli. It can specifically cleave double-stranded DNA at a sequence representing the junction of the two fused flanking exons. We present evidence that this system is a good model for studying the role of mitochondrial intron-encoded proteins in the rearrangement of genetic information at both the RNA (RNA splicing-bl4 maturase) and DNA levels (intron transposition-al4 transposase)."
https://openalex.org/W1570937314,"Abstract Binding analyses using 125I-labeled platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and PDGF-BB were used to identify a clonal human glioma cell line (U-343 MGa 31L) which expresses the A type but not the B type receptor for PDGF. The glioma cells were devoid of a B type receptor transcript, and immunoprecipitation with an antiserum raised against a B type receptor peptide rendered no signal. Similar analyses using human foreskin fibroblasts, which express both A and B type PDGF receptors, revealed a B type PDGF receptor-specific 5.5-kilobase pair mRNA in a Northern blot experiment, and 160,000 and 180,000 molecular weight components upon immunoprecipitation. A second antiserum, raised against purified porcine PDGF receptor preparations, was reactive with Mr 140,000 and 170,000 components in the U-343 MGa 31L cells, as well as in human fibroblasts. In addition, this antiserum precipitated the Mr 160,000 and 180,000 components from the fibroblasts. Exposure of cells to PDGF-AA, as well as to PDGF-BB, induced an increased rate of degradation of the Mr 170,000 component in the clonal glioma cells and in fibroblasts. The Mr 180,000 component in fibroblasts was degraded only when cells were exposed to PDGF-BB. This allowed the identification of the Mr 170,000 component as the cell surface expressed form of the A type receptor for PDGF. A structural relatedness between the A and B type PDGF receptors was furthermore indicated by similarities in peptide patterns, after limited proteolytic digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1485767909,"The sugar chains of transferrin samples, purified from sera of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and of healthy individuals, were released quantitatively as radioactive oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis followed by N-acetylation and NaB3H4 reduction. Comparative study of their structure by serial lectin column chromatography, by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography, and by sequential exoglycosidase digestion revealed that prominently altered glycosylation is commonly found in the hepatoma transferrins, although they all contain two complex-type asparagine-linked sugar chains in one molecule like in the case of normal transferrins. The alteration is quite various, including the increase of highly branched sugar chains, of those with the Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc beta 1----and the Neu5Ac alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----groups in their outer chain moieties and of those with a fucosylated trimannosyl core. Many but not all of the hepatoma transferrin samples contained a small amount of a bisected biantennary sugar chain, which was not detected in the normal transferrin samples."
https://openalex.org/W2152331729,"We have shown that a strain-specific group I intron (intron 3) in the nuclear extrachromosomal rDNA of Physarum polycephalum is a mobile element. Shortly after mating of amoebae from intron-lacking and introncontaining strains, intron 3 transposes in a site-specific manner into all available recipient molecules. The transposition appears to occur by gene conversion, as evidenced by the co-conversion of adjacent sequences and by double strand breakage observed in some of the recipient rDNA molecules. We infer that the double strand break is induced by an endonuclease encoded by intron 3, since in vitro transcription and translation of the cloned intron leads to the synthesis of an enzymatically active, site-specific nuclease. This is the first demonstration of the transposition of a nuclear intron in an experimental setting, and provides a rare example of a protein encoded by an RNA polymerase I transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1923290408,"The dnaC protein of Escherichia coli, by forming a complex with the dnaB protein, facilitates the interactions with single-stranded DNA that enable dnaB to perform its ATPase, helicase, and priming functions. Within the dnaB-dnaC complex, dnaB appears to be inactive but becomes active upon the ATP-dependent release of dnaC from the complex. With adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate substituted for ATP, the dnaB-dnaC complex does not direct dnaB to its targeted actions. Excess dnaC inhibits dna beta actions and augments the ATP gamma S effects. In the dnaA protein-driven initiation of duplex chromosome replication, dnaB is introduced for its essential helicase role via the dnaB-dnaC complex. Similarly, when the dnaA protein interacts nonspecifically with single-stranded DNA, the dnaB-dnaC complex is essential to introduce dnaB for its role in primer formation by primase."
https://openalex.org/W1493292322,"Abstract The complex formed between the dnaB and dnaC replication proteins of Escherichia coli is stabilized by ATP binding to dnaC. The dnaB6-dnaC6-ATP6 complex can be maintained without ATP hydrolysis at a concentration as low as 5 x 10(-10) M. The complex is also formed with adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate but generates little or no dnaB activity, suggesting a requirement for ATP hydrolysis in the subsequent stage of binding of the complex to DNA. In this step, dnaC is released, leaving dnaB to function on the associated DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1493451172,"The periplasmic hydrogenase containing equivalent amounts of nickel and selenium plus non-heme iron [NiFeSe) hydrogenase) has been purified from cells of the sulfate reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio baculatus (DSM 1748) grown on a lactate/sulfate medium containing natural Se isotopes and the nuclear isotope, 77Se. Both the 77Se-enriched and unenriched hydrogenases were shown to be free of other hydrogenases and characterized with regard to their Se contents. EPR studies of the reduced nickel signal generated by redox titrations of the enriched and unenriched (NiFeSe) hydrogenases demonstrated that the gx = 2.23 and gy = 2.17 resonances are appreciably broadened by the spin of the 77Se nucleus (I = 1/2). This observation demonstrates unambiguously that the unpaired electron is shared by the Ni and Se atoms and that Se serves as a ligand to the nickel redox center of the (NiFeSe) hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1536082130,"Inverted membrane vesicles prepared from Escherichia coli spheroplasts were fractionated by means of sucrose gradient centrifugation, and a vesicle preparation exhibiting efficient and quantitative translocation of secretory proteins was obtained. The translocation of OmpA and an uncleavable model protein, uncleavable OmpF-Lpp, took place almost completely in 2-3 min, whereas that of OmpF-Lpp, a chimeric secretory protein, required 20 min for completion. The requirement of the proton motive force (delta muH+) for in vitro translocation was then examined with these three proteins. The translocation of all these proteins was significantly inhibited by the addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or when stripped membrane vesicles lacking F1-ATPase were used, suggesting that delta muH+ generally participates in the translocation reaction. The inhibition was complete with OmpF-Lpp, whereas significant amounts of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp and OmpA were translocated at a slower rate even with the stripped membrane vesicles in the presence of a high concentration of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. The delta muH+-independent translocation was inhibited by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. These results indicate that although translocation of OmpF-Lpp obligatory requires delta muH+, the latter two proteins can be translocated in not only a delta muH+-dependent manner but also a delta mu H+-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1563541350,"Abstract Using a mutant defective in choline kinase (Hosaka, K., and Yamashita, S. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 143, 176-181; Hosaka, K., and Yamashita, S. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 162, 7-13), the structural gene (CKI) for choline kinase of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was isolated by means of genetic complementation. Within its sequence there was an open reading frame capable of encoding 582 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 66,316. The primary translation product contained a segment closely related to the phosphotransferase consensus sequence (Brenner, S. (1987) Nature 329, 21). A yeast transformant carrying CKI in multiple copies exhibited very high choline kinase activity as well as ethanolamine kinase activity. In-frame insertion of the CKI coding frame into lacZ' on the pUC19 vector led to efficient expression of choline kinase in Escherichia coli cells in the presence of a lac inducer, isopropylthiogalactoside, proving that CKI is the structural gene for choline kinase. Concomitantly, ethanolamine kinase activity was also expressed. When the CKI locus in the wild-type yeast genome was inactivated by its replacement with the in vitro disrupted cki gene, the yeast cells lost virtually all of the choline kinase activity and most of the ethanolamine kinase activity. Thus, it is concluded that choline kinase is mono-cistronic and that the ethanolamine kinase activity is a second activity of choline kinase in the yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1529903761,"Abstract We have established an in vitro system, composed of highly purified bacteriophage lambda and Escherichia coli proteins, that specifically replicates supercoiled templates bearing the lambda replication origin (ori lambda). The complete system is composed of three groups of proteins: the virus-encoded initiator proteins (the lambda O and P proteins), the E. coli replication fork propagation machinery (single-stranded DNA-binding protein, dnaB helicase, dnaG primase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and DNA gyrase), and two bacterial heat shock proteins (dnaJ and dnaK proteins). DNA replication in this system is initiated at or near ori lambda and proceeds unidirectionally rightwards through theta-structure intermediates, ultimately yielding a pair of intertwined daughter circles as the final product. In striking contrast to the situation in vivo and in crude in vitro systems, initiation of lambda DNA replication in the purified protein system does not require transcriptional activation of the origin region by E. coli RNA polymerase. We conclude that E. coli primase generates the primers for all leading and lagging strand DNA chains synthesized in this reconstituted lambda replication system."
https://openalex.org/W1636822060,"We have reported previously that a phosphoprotein, ib, is present in adrenal cortex, corpus luteum, and Leydig cells stimulated with either tissue-specific peptide hormone or with cAMP. The accumulation of protein ib in each of these cell types has been found to parallel the stimulation of steroid synthesis with respect to both time course and stimulant dose response. Thus, protein ib is a potential mediator in the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis by peptide hormone or cyclic AMP. A second protein, pb, the unphosphorylated form of ib, is synthesized constitutively in unstimulated but not stimulated cells and is not converted post-translationally to ib upon stimulation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of subcellular fractions isolated from rat adrenal cortex cells labeled with [35S] methionine, we have determined the intracellular localization of proteins p and i. We demonstrate that proteins ib and pb are localized predominantly in the mitochondria and are tightly associated with that organelle. We also find that inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol affects neither the accumulation of these proteins nor the stimulation of steroidogenesis. Thus, protein pb and its phosphorylated counterpart, ib, are synthesized in the cytosol and transported to the mitochondria, the site of the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1577814978,"Insulin stimulates glucose transport into adipocytes, at least in part, via the translocation of intracellular transporters to the plasma membrane. The human HepG2-type transporter, which is not insulin-responsive in its native cell type, was expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by infection with recombinant retrovirus harboring the HepG2 transporter cDNA in order to determine whether glucose transporter translocation in adipocytes is restricted to a distinct insulin-sensitive transporter species. The distributions of the endogenous murine and the HepG2 transporters were estimated by quantitative immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions probed with either a monoclonal antibody that recognized only the human transporter or a polyclonal antibody that recognized both transporter species. In the basal state, the intracellular membrane fraction comprised approximately 50% of the total of each transporter type. Insulin decreased the content of both transporter species in the intracellular membranes by approximately 50% and increased the plasma membrane content of both species by approximately 1.5-2-fold. The similar insulin-mediated increase in the plasma membrane content of endogenous murine and HepG2 glucose transporters was verified by labeling of cell surface glycoproteins with [3H]NaBH4 followed by immunoprecipitation with glucose transporter antibodies. These data indicate that insulin-mediated translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is not restricted to a tissue-specific insulin-responsive glucose transporter species and suggest that other tissue-specific factors regulate the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W1585363411,"An artificial mitochondrial precursor protein (the presequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase) binds to isolated yeast mitochondrial outer membranes and to liposomes whose phospholipid composition resembles that of outer membranes. In both cases, binding is strongly inhibited by low temperature or methotrexate (which stabilizes the dihydrofolate reductase moiety) and partly inhibited by adriamycin (which binds to acidic phospholipids). Binding is accompanied by partial unfolding of the protein. Binding of the urea-denatured fusion protein to outer membranes or liposomes is insensitive to low temperature, methotrexate, or adriamycin. These results, and those reported in the accompanying paper (Eilers, M., Endo, T., and Schatz, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2945-2950) suggest that import of this fusion protein into isolated mitochondria involves at least partial unfolding by acidic phospholipids on the mitochondrial surface."
https://openalex.org/W1499069848,"The purified receptor for the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers from rabbit skeletal muscle contains protein components of 170,000 Da (alpha 1), 175,000 Da (alpha 2), 52,000 Da (beta), and 32,000 Da (gamma) when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies have now been prepared and used to characterize the association of the 32,000-Da polypeptide (gamma subunit) with other subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor. Immunoblot analysis of fractions collected during purification of the dihydropyridine receptor shows that the 32,000-Da polypeptide copurified with alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits at each step of the purification. In addition, monoclonal antibodies against the alpha 1 and beta subunits immunoprecipitate the digitonin-solubilized dihydropyridine receptor as a multisubunit complex which includes the 32,000-Da polypeptide. Polyclonal antibodies generated against both the nonreduced and reduced forms of the alpha 2 subunit and the gamma subunit have been used to show that the 32,000-Da polypeptide is not a proteolytic fragment of a larger component of the dihydropyridine receptor and not disulfide linked to the alpha 2 subunit. In addition, polyclonal antibodies against the rabbit skeletal muscle 32,000-Da polypeptide specifically react with similar proteins in skeletal muscle of other species including avian and amphibian species. Thus, our results demonstrate that the 32,000-Da polypeptide (gamma subunit) is an integral and distinct component of the dihydropyridine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1586532142,"Abstract HTC rat hepatoma cells were transfected with human insulin receptor cDNA to a level of 40,000 receptors/cell. In these cells, as well as in nontransfected cells, insulin stimulated the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the human insulin receptor alpha subunit, like insulin, stimulated amino acid uptake in transfected HTC cells, but not in nontransfected HTC cells. The antibodies, in contrast to insulin, failed to stimulate insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, both in intact transfected cells and in cell free extracts prepared from them. These data suggest, therefore, that activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase may not be an obligatory step in all of the transmembrane signaling mechanisms of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1547606755,"The 2',3'-dialdehyde of NADPH (NADPH dialdehyde) appears to act as an affinity label toward the respiratory burst oxidase of human neutrophils, inactivating the enzyme by attaching covalently to a residue at its NADPH-binding site. Although the oxidase in activated neutrophils is known to reside in the plasma membrane, our studies showed that in resting neutrophils the NADPH dialdehyde-sensitive component of the enzyme was located in the cytosol. These findings suggest that one of the steps in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase is the transfer of its NADPH-binding component from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1509189642,"Abstract Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has previously been shown to coexist with acetylcholine in spinal cord motoneurons and to stimulate adenylate cyclase in skeletal muscle cells. We now demonstrate that in cultured chick myotubes whose phosphoinositides have been labeled with [3H]inositol, CGRP enhanced the accumulation of [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates. Rat CGRP-I (rCGRP) (0.1 microM) elicited a transient increase in [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, as well as a more sustained elevation of [3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate levels. In the presence of Li+, rCGRP evoked an approximately 3-fold increase of [3H]inositol monophosphate levels, which persisted for up to 1 h. This effect of rCGRP was concentration-dependent, the half-maximal response being obtained at 1 nM. Since rCGRP also accelerated the rate of synthesis of [3H]inositol-containing lipids, it appears that the peptide acts by stimulating phosphoinositide turnover in chick myotubes. Agents that either mimic or elevate intracellular cyclic AMP also enhanced the synthesis of [3H]inositol-containing lipids, and the accumulation of inositol phosphates, suggesting that the effects of rCGRP are mediated, at least in part, via the activation of adenylate cyclase. This hypothesis was strengthened by the non-additivity of the inositol phosphate responses elicited by rCGRP and other cAMP-mobilizing agents, and by the sensitivity of these responses to various pharmacological treatments. The present results provide an example of positive interaction between cAMP and the phosphoinositide signaling system. They further suggest that a coexisting neuropeptide may exert pleiotropic actions upon its target cell by stimulating multiple signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1588983486,"A mitochondrial type II DNA topoisomerase (topoIImt) has been purified to near homogeneity from the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata. A rapid purification procedure has been developed based on the affinity of the enzyme for novobiocin, a competitive inhibitor of the ATP-binding moiety of type II topoisomerases. The purified enzyme is capable of ATP-dependent catenation and decatenation of kinetoplast DNA networks as well as catalyzing the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. topoIImt exists as a dimer of a 132-kDa polypeptide. Immunoblots of whole cell lysates show a single predominant band that comigrates with the 132-kDa polypeptide, indicating that the 264-kDa homodimer represents the intact form of the enzyme. Localization of the enzyme within the single mitochondrion of C. fasciculata (Melendy, T., Sheline, C., and Ray, D. S. (1988) Cell, in press) suggests an important role for topoIImt in kinetoplast DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1502900420,"Abstract The hormonal regulation of phosphoinositide levels in isolated hepatocytes was studied using chemical means. Extracted inositol phospholipids were adsorbed to neomycin-coated glass beads and then eluted and quantitated by charring after separation by thin layer chromatography on silica gel. The amounts (in nanograms/mg wet weight) of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were 20 +/- 1, 16 +/- 1, and 1790 +/- 140, respectively). Incubation of the cells with 100 nM vasopressin decreased the value for PIP2 to 10 +/- 0.2 at 15 s, 12 +/- 1.5 at 1 min, and 14 +/- 2.1 at 5 and 30 min. In contrast, the hormone increased 1,2-diacylglycerol plus phosphatidate by over 200 ng/mg wet weight at 5 min under similar conditions (Bocckino, S. B., Blackmore, P. F., Wilson, P. B., and Exton, J. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15309-15315). PIP2 was also significantly decreased at 15 s by angiotensin II (100 nM), ATP (100 microM), and epinephrine (1 microM). In contrast, PIP was not significantly changed, and PI was significantly decreased (by approximately 15%) at later times (15 and 30 min). The changes in phosphoinositide mass were well correlated with changes in labeled phosphoinositides in hepatocytes previously incubated with [3H]inositol for 90 min. The amounts of inositol phospholipids in liver plasma membranes (in micrograms/mg protein) were 2.1 +/- 0.2 for PIP2, 0.24 +/- 0.03 for PIP, and 23 +/- 4 for PI. Comparison of these values with those for whole cells suggests that PIP2 is enriched in the plasma membrane, whereas PIP is present elsewhere in the cell. The fatty acid composition of whole cell PIP2 showed significant differences from that of PI. The percentages of palmitic, stearic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids were, respectively, 14, 41, 10, and 25 for PIP2 and 10, 34, 7, and 37 for PI. Vasopressin treatment for 15 s did not alter the fatty acid composition of PIP2. The corresponding fatty acid percentages for liver plasma membranes were 13, 41, 11, and 21 for PIP2 and 8, 34, 0, and 40 for PI. The fatty acid composition of PIP in whole cells and plasma membranes resembled that of PIP2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1597560852,"The C-O stretching frequencies of fully reduced carbonmonoxy cytochrome ba3, a newly discovered terminal oxidase of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (Zimmermann, B.H., Nitsche, C.I., Fee, J.A., Rusnak, F., and Munck, E. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 85, 5779-5783), are studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Multiple C-O frequencies are observed in the Fourier transform infrared spectra, indicating the presence of discrete interconverting conformers of the enzyme. Upon photolysis, the CO is shown to migrate exclusively to CuB+. Above 200 K, the CO returns to the heme a3 by a thermal process which follows simple first-order kinetics. The rate of the reaction was studied from 205 to 230 K and at 300 K, yielding the activation parameters delta H = 14.9 kcal/mol and delta S = -5 cal/mol/K. These are compared with previously determined activation parameters for CO recombination in mitochondrial cytochrome aa3 preparations (Fiamingo, F.G., Altschuld, R.A., Moh, P.P., and Alben, J.O. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1639-1650). We report the novel finding that CO remains bound to CuB+ at room temperature during continuous photolysis of cytochrome ba3, and we conjecture on the possible interference of copper-bound CO in flow-flash and triple-trap studies of cytochrome c oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1529359637,"Nitrous oxide reductase from Wolinella succinogenes was purified very nearly to homogeneity. The enzyme was found to be dimeric, with Mr = 162,000 and subunit Mr = 88,000, and to contain three copper atoms and one iron atom (as cytochrome c) per subunit. The oxidized enzyme exhibited absorption bands at 410 and 528 nm, and the dithionite-reduced enzyme, at 416, 520, and 550 nm. The isoelectric point was 8.6; specific activity was at 25 degrees C and pH 7.1, 160 mumol x min-1 x mg-1; and Km was 7.5 microM N2O under the same conditions. alpha-Chymotrypsin cleaved the enzyme into cytochrome c-depleted dimers with an average Mr = 134,000 and cytochrome c-enriched fragments with an average Mr = 13,000. The enzyme was stable at 4 degrees C for at least 100 h under air and 3 h in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. It exhibited a dithionite-N2O oxidoreductase as well as a BV+-N2O oxidoreductase activity. During turnover with BV+ at 25 mM N2O, the enzyme was observed to undergo an initial activation and a subsequent inactivation. The kinetics of inactivation were approximately first-order in remaining activity, and the first-order rate constant was essentially independent of the initial enzyme concentration. These characteristics are consistent with the occurrence of turnover-dependent inactivation. Acetylene was a relatively weak inhibitor, but cyanide and azide were rather strong inhibitors. The nitrous oxide reductase of W. succinogenes is quite different from that of denitrifying bacteria. The amount of activity in cell extracts and the absence of O2-labile nitrous oxide reductase suggested that the cytochrome c containing enzyme may be the only one produced by W. succinogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1604591607,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis of a synthetic gene for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I to prepare three analogs in which specific residues in the A region are replaced with the corresponding residues in the A chain of insulin. The analogs are [Ile41, Glu45, Gln46, Thr49, Ser50, Ile51, Ser53, Tyr55, Gln56]IGF I (A chain mutant), in which residue 41 is changed from threonine to isoleucine and residues 42 to 56 of the A region are replaced, [Thr49, Ser50, Ile51]IGF I, and [Tyr55, Gln56]IGF I. These analogs are all equipotent to IGF I at the type 1 IGF receptor in human placental membranes, and in stimulating the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA in the rat vascular smooth muscle cell line A10. However, the A chain mutant and [Thr49, Ser50, Ile51]IGF I have greater than 20-fold lower relative affinity for the type 2 IGF receptor of rat liver membranes, respectively. In contrast, [Tyr55, Gln56]IGF I has 7-fold higher affinity than IGF I for the type 2 IGF receptor. Residues 49, 50, and 51 in IGF I are Phe-Arg-Ser and are strictly conserved in IGF II. Residues 55 and 56 of IGF I and the corresponding residues in IGF II are Arg-Arg and Ala-Leu, respectively. Thus, the presence of the charged residues at these positions in IGF I appears to be responsible, in part, for the lower affinity of IGF I for the type 2 IGF receptor. In addition to the alterations in affinity for the type 2 IGF receptor, the A chain mutant has a 7-fold increase in affinity for insulin receptors, and [Thr49, Ser50, Ile51]IGF I has a 4-fold lower affinity for acid-stable human serum binding protein. These data strongly suggest that specific determinants in the A region of IGF I are important for maintaining binding to the type 2 IGF receptor, and that these determinants are different from those required for maintaining high affinity for the type 1 IGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1927159013,"Abstract The importance of the various regions of the apocytochrome c molecule and the effect of covalent coupling of the heme group to the protein for the translocation across a model-membrane was studied by using chemically and enzymatically prepared fragments of horse heart apo- and holocytochrome c and model-membranes composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. Binding experiments showed that fragments of apocytochrome c with the highest net positive charge have the highest affinity for negatively charged large unilamellar phosphatidylserine vesicles. Monolayer experiments demonstrated that the amino-terminal fragments were only able to penetrate into a phosphatidylserine monolayer whereas the carboxyl-terminal fragments, in addition, penetrated into a phosphatidylcholine monolayer although with a lower efficiency. The covalent coupling of the heme group to both a small amino-terminal fragment residue numbers 1-38 and to the entire precursor protein resulted in a marked decrease in the ability to penetrate into a phosphatidylserine monolayer. Translocation experiments with trypsin enclosed in vesicles, showed that only the amino-terminal fragments of the precursor protein and not carboxyl-terminal peptides or the heme-containing fragments of the mature protein were able to cross the bilayer and become digestible by trypsin at the opposite side of the bilayer. Circular dichroism measurements with the various peptides both in an aqueous and lipidic environment were performed to investigate the conformation of apocytochrome c after interaction with model-membranes. Implications of these data for the import of apocytochrome c into mitochondria will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1544132735,"Abstract The effect of trypsin digestion on the (i) fragmentation pattern, (ii) activity, (iii) [3H]ryanodine binding, and (iv) sedimentation behavior of the skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex has been examined. Mild tryptic digestion of heavy, junctional-derived SR vesicles resulted in the rapid disappearance of the high molecular weight (Mr approximately 400,000) Ca2+ release channel protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and appearance of bands of lower Mr upon immunoblot analysis, without an appreciable effect on [3H]ryanodine binding or the apparent S value (30 S) of the 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (Chaps)-solubilized channel complex. Further degradation to bands of Mr greater than 70,000 on immunoblots correlated with a reduction of channel size from 30 S to 10-15 S and loss of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to the trypsinized receptor, while low affinity [3H]ryanodine binding and [3H]ryanodine bound prior to digestion were retained. Parallel 45Ca2+ efflux measurements also indicated retention of the Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP regulatory sites, although Ca2+-induced 45Ca2+ release rates were changed. In planar lipid bilayer-single channel measurements, addition of trypsin to the cytoplasmic side of the high conductance (100 pS in 50 mM Ca2+), Ca2+-activated SR Ca2+ channel initially increased the fraction of channel open time and was followed by a complete and irreversible loss of channel activity. Trypsin did not change the unitary conductance, and was without effect on single channel activity when added to the lumenal side of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1544191076,"Abstract The effects of thrombin and histamine on protein phosphorylation in intact cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) prelabeled with 32PO4 were investigated. Incubation of HUVEC with either thrombin or histamine, agonists known to induce rapid transient increases in intracellular calcium levels in HUVEC, caused a rapid reversible increase in the phosphorylation of a protein with a Mr = 100,000 independent of the presence of extracellular calcium. Immunological and biochemical studies demonstrated that this Mr = 100,000 protein is elongation factor 2 (EF-2), a substrate previously shown to be phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III (Nairn, A. C., and Palfrey, H. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17299-17303). EF-2 is crucial for protein synthesis because it catalyzes the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the EF-2 immunoprecipitated from HUVEC revealed that all of the thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation occurred on threonine. EF-2 was also phosphorylated when HUVEC were treated with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Phosphorylation of EF-2 was not increased by treatment with D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone thrombin, phorbol dibutyrate, forskolin, or 8-bromo-cGMP. The transient nature of the phosphorylation of EF-2 is consistent with it having a role in mediating some of the transient effects of thrombin and histamine on endothelial cell protein synthesis and functional capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W1559192320,"Abstract The rates of individual steps in the reaction cycle of dog kidney Na,K-ATPase labeled with iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF) were measured using the fluorescence stopped-flow technique. The maximal rate of the fluorescence quenching accompanying ATP hydrolysis at 20 degrees C in the presence of K+ is 66.3 s-1, while the turnover rate in the same conditions is 15.5 s-1. The rate without K+ is slightly lower. Unexpectedly, at very high ionic strength, K+ accelerates the rate 2-fold. The fluorescence change appears to be associated with the E1P----E2P transition. The results are consistent with the classical Albers-Post scheme but do not support recent criticisms that E1P is kinetically incompetent in the presence of Na+ plus K+. As expected, in the absence of ATP the rate of E2(K)----E1Na was very slow (0.2 s-1) but was greatly accelerated by ATP (maximal rate 15.9 s-1) with low affinity (K0.5 = 196 microM). It was concluded that E2(K)----E1 is the slowest step of the cycle, even at nonlimiting ATP concentrations. The rate of E1K----E2(K) for both IAF- and fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate-labeled enzyme was stimulated by K+ acting with low affinity, but not at all by ATP at 5 microM. Whereas the maximal rate with IAF-enzyme (271 s-1) was similar to previous work, the K+ affinity was significantly higher. Fluorescence signals accompanying hydrolysis of acetyl phosphate with both IAF- and fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate-labeled enzyme have similar rates, 5.25 s-1 and 4.06 s-1, respectively. A species difference was observed between dog and pig kidney Na,K-ATPase in that both enzymes are labeled with IAF but only in dog enzyme were conformational transitions associated with fluorescence changes. Therefore, the IAF-labeled dog kidney enzyme is the preparation of choice for measuring fluorescence changes accompanying ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1579040474,"The tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, causes a rapid, partial redistribution of 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol kinase from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of quiescent, starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. We utilized exogenous dioleoylglycerol as substrate for the kinase. The inactive alpha form of the phorbol ester does not cause any change in diacylglycerol kinase localization, and depletion of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) by chronic administration of phorbol ester blocks the redistribution. Phorbol ester has no direct effect on Swiss 3T3 membrane-bound diacylglycerol kinase nor does it directly effect cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase. When phorbol ester is added to Swiss 3T3 membranes in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and calcium, there is no activation of membrane-bound kinase, indicating that phorbol ester does not activate membrane-bound kinase through phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Reconstitution studies show that the soluble rat brain diacylglycerol kinase binds to diacylglycerol-enriched membranes, produced by treatment of red cell ghosts with phospholipase C or calcium, suggesting that cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase may be capable of translocation to the membrane in response to elevated substrate concentration in the intact cell. Stimulation of the cells with phorbol ester increases the total mass of diacylglycerol. In protein kinase C-depleted cells, addition of a cell-permeable synthetic diacylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol, results in a partial redistribution of cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase to the membrane, by 5 min, also suggesting that the translocation of diacylglycerol kinase activity is regulated primarily by substrate concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1602363216,"Abstract In studying the regulation of insulin secretion by phorbol esters, we examined their effects on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), using the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 in the rat insulin-secreting beta-cell line RINm5F. [Ca2+]i was measured in parallel with the rate of insulin release. 50 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which may act via protein kinase C, stimulated insulin release and caused an increase in [Ca2+]i. Ca2+-free conditions eliminated the increase in [Ca2+]i and resulted in a reduced stimulation of insulin release by TPA. The Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine (300 nM) inhibited both the increase in [Ca2+]i and the increased rate of insulin secretion. Another phorbol ester, 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which activates protein kinase C, also induced an increase in [Ca2+]i and in the rate of insulin release, while 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which fails to stimulate protein kinase C, was without effect. Further studies with bis-oxonol as an indicator of membrane potential showed that TPA depolarized the beta-cell plasma membrane. From these results, it is concluded that TPA depolarizes the plasma membrane, induces the opening of Ca2+ channels in the RINm5F beta-cell plasma membrane, increases [Ca2+]i, and results in insulin secretion. The action of TPA was next compared with that of a depolarizing concentration of KC1 (25 mM), which stimulates insulin secretion simply by opening Ca2+ channels. TPA consistently elicited less depolarization, a smaller rise of [Ca2+]i, but a greater release of insulin than KC1. Therefore an additional action of TPA is suggested, which potentiates the action of the elevated [Ca2+]i on insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1553302491,"Abstract Cells of monocytic differentiation can promote proteolytic activation of factor X following binding to the adhesive receptor Mac-1. We now show that the product, factor Xa, binds to a second receptor on these cells in a Ca2+-dependent reaction. Functionally, this results in the capacity to convert prothrombin to thrombin. The factor Xa receptor was identified by monoclonal antibody (7G12) reactive with plasma factor V/Va, but selected for reactivity with THP-1 cells. It reacted with 71.2 +/- 10.1% of monocytes, bound 153,600 +/- 33,500 sites/THP-1 cell, blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa, inhibited formation of thrombin, and immunoprecipitated 125I-factor Xa chemically cross-linked to its receptor on THP-1 cells. Following surface iodination or intrinsic labeling of THP-1 cells, antibody 7G12 immunoprecipitated a 74-kDa molecular species, similar to plasma factor Va light chain. Thus, monocytes and monocyte-like cells synthesize and express a factor V/Va-like receptor for factor Xa and organize a functional prothrombinase complex. The simultaneous membrane coexpression of a factor X receptor (Mac-1) and a factor Xa receptor as demonstrated by two-color flow cytofluorometric analysis of monocytes or THP-1 cells is consistent with a sequential receptor cascade for coordinated molecular assembly of coagulation proteins on specialized cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570947004,"Hydrophobic folate-binding proteins (FBPs), which are only 5-10 kDa larger than 40-kDa hydrophilic FBPs, bind significant quantities of Triton X-100 micelles and elute as apparent 160-kDa species on Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration in Triton X-100. Detergent-solubilized placental membranes release a major (greater than 95%) 40-kDa hydrophilic FBP species as well as a minor apparent 160-kDa folate binding species when similarly analyzed. We tested the hypothesis that this recovery of predominantly hydrophilic FBPs was mediated by a putative hydrophobic FBP-specific placental protease. When placenta was solubilized in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDTA, there was a progressive increase in apparent 160-kDa folate binding moieties concomitant with a decrease in 40-kDa FBPs. At 20 mM EDTA, a single apparent 160-kDa folate binding species was recovered and the 40-kDa FBPs could not be detected by radioligand binding or specific radioimmunoassay. The apparent 160-kDa species specifically bound radiolabeled folates and were specifically immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-40-kDa FBP antiserum. On 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with anti-40-kDa FBP antiserum, the apparent 160-kDa FBPs electrophoresed as 45-kDa species. Detergent binding studies indicated that apparent 160-kDa FBPs were hydrophobic, thus accounting for the molecular weight discrepancy in gel filtration in Triton X-100 versus sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The EDTA-mediated inhibition of conversion of hydrophobic FBPs to hydrophilic FBPs by protease was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by Mg2+. If this protease is physiologically relevant, it could play an important regulatory role in folate transport by influencing the net number of hydrophobic FBPs on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1523417301,"Human rhinoviruses attach to specific receptors located on the surfaces of host cells as a first step in viral infection. A 90-kDa cell surface protein was previously shown to be involved in the attachment of human rhinoviruses to susceptible cells (Tomassini, J. E., and Colonno, R.J. (1986) J. Virol. 58, 290-295). Digestion of purified receptor protein with various glycosidases revealed that 30% of its molecular mass was comprised of complex-type oligosaccharides, one-third being contributed by sialic acid. The presence of sialic acid was confirmed by demonstrating that wheat germ lectin can inhibit the attachment of rhinoviruses to host cell membranes, while lectins of other sugar specificities had no effect. The oligosaccharides were shown to be N-linked by tunicamycin treatment of host cells and by N-glycanase digestion. Seven N-linked glycosylation sites were detected by partial digestion of the receptor oligosaccharides with N-glycanase. Native receptor protein had an isoelectric focusing point of 4.2, compared to 5.3 for the deglycosylated protein. Studies of virus and antibody binding to neuraminidase-treated host cell membranes suggested that although carbohydrates may be involved in host-virus interaction, the receptor carbohydrate is not the predominant component of the cellular receptor site."
https://openalex.org/W1589518573,"Abstract Transverse tubule (TT) membrane vesicles have been isolated from the skeletal muscle of normal and malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) pigs. MHS and normal TT did not differ in the distribution of the major proteins, cholesterol, or phospholipid content, (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity, [3H]ouabain binding, Ca2+-ATPase activity, Mg2+-ATPase activity, or [3H]saxitoxin binding. Furthermore, in the presence of micromolar Ca2+, MHS and normal TT did not differ significantly in the KD values for either [3H]nitrendipine binding (2.7 +/- 0.6 and 3.3 +/- 0.5 nM, respectively) or (-)-[3H]desmethoxyverapamil ([3H]D888) binding (7.2 +/- 0.9 and 6.4 +/- 0.6 nM, respectively). However, in contrast to normal TT, MHS TT exhibited a significantly decreased Bmax for both [3H]nitrendipine binding (26.4 +/- 5.4 for MHS versus 40.6 +/- 3.7 pmol/mg protein for normal TT) and [3H]D888 binding (17.8 +/- 7.0 for MHS versus 37.4 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg protein for normal TT). At calcium concentrations greater than 0.1 mM, there was a greater inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding to normal than to MHS TT such that binding was now similar for both preparations. As with purified TT, [3H]nitrendipine binding to MHS muscle homogenates was significantly less than to normal muscle homogenates (109 +/- 20 versus 211 +/- 19 fmol/mg protein, for MHS and normal TT, respectively); this difference was not apparent when 100 mM CaCl2 was included in the binding medium. We conclude that the altered MHS TT dihydropyridine receptor properties may reflect an adaptation of the TT voltage sensing mechanism to the abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel regulation in MHS muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1484408269,"Abstract Long-chain fatty acid esters of CoA activate (Na+ + K+)-ATPase (the sodium pump) when ATP is suboptimal. To explore the nature of the interactions of these CoA derivatives with the pump, reversible effects of palmitoyl-CoA on the purified membrane-bound kidney enzyme were studied under conditions where interference from the irreversible membrane-damaging effect of the compound was ruled out. With 50 microM ATP, while saturating palmitoyl-CoA increased (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity, it caused partial inhibition of Na+-ATPase activity without affecting the steady-state level of the phosphoenzyme. Palmitoyl-CoA did not change the K0.5 of ATP for Na+-ATPase, but it altered the complex Na+ activation curve to suggest the antagonism of the low-affinity, but not the high-affinity, Na+ sites. At a low ATP concentration (0.5 microM), K+ inhibited Na+-ATPase as expected. In the presence of palmitoyl-CoA and 0.5 microM ATP, however, K+ became an activator, as it is at high ATP concentrations. The activating effect of palmitoyl-CoA on (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was reduced with increasing pH (6.5-8.5), but its inhibitory effect on Na+-ATPase was not altered in this pH range. The data show two distinct actions of palmitoyl-CoA: 1) blockade of the extracellular allosteric Na+ sites whose exact role in the control of the pump is yet to be determined, and 2) activation of the pump through increased rate of K+ deocclusion. Since in their latter action the fatty acid esters of CoA are far more effective than ATP at a low-affinity regulatory site, we suggest that these CoA derivatives may be the physiological ligands of this regulatory site of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W1567136668,"Calmodulin derivatives, specifically biotinylated in domains I and III, were synthesized to address the structures of calmodulin necessary for binding to its target enzymes in active conformations. By binding avidin to these biotinylated calmodulins, the role of specific sequences of the calmodulin molecule in target enzyme interactions could then be evaluated. The role of domain I in these interactions was assessed by biotinylation of Cys-27 of wheat germ calmodulin with N-ethylmaleimidobiotin. This modification did not affect the ability of this calmodulin to activate 3'-5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) or human erythrocyte Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase. The addition of avidin to form a stable calmodulin-avidin complex also did not affect activation. Bovine testes calmodulin was biotinylated on Lys-94 by calcium-dependent reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimido ester-biotin at pH 6.0. This derivative was used to probe the Ca+2 binding region of domain III. The incorporation of biotin at Lys-94 of bovine calmodulin did not affect calmodulin activation of PDE. However, compared to unmodified calmodulin, a 4-fold higher concentration of this derivative was required to fully activate the ATPase. The addition of excess avidin to this derivative abolished all activation for both PDE and the ATPase. Sites of modification were determined by sequence analysis of labeled peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1576835444,"Abstract Electrochemical and EPR spectroscopic experiments demonstrate that the isolated iron-molybdenum cofactor from the molybdenum-iron protein of nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii exists in multiple forms in both its oxidized and semi-reduced states. The particular forms found in either oxidation state appear to be a function of the acid/base status of the solvent, N-methylformamide. In alkaline N-methylformamide, a single, detectable form of iron-molybdenum cofactor is observed for both oxidized and semi-reduced states. The semi-reduced form, termed R(s-r), is the one previously recognized with an S = 3/2 EPR spectrum with apparent g values of 4.6, 3.4, 2.0. Its oxidized counterpart, termed B(ox), is characterized electrochemically by a differential pulse voltammetric reduction peak at -0.37 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode. In acidic solvent, two distinct, previously unrecognized redox pairs of iron-molybdenum cofactor forms exist. The two semi-reduced forms, N(s-r) and W(s-r), are characterized by EPR spectra with g = 4.5, 3.6, 2.0 and g = 4.9, 3.1, 1.9, respectively. Their oxidized counterparts, A(ox) and C(ox), have differential pulse voltammetric reduction peaks at -0.32 and -0.43 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode, respectively. Manipulations of either the isolation protocol or the sample conditions affects both the type and distribution of forms present. Each form likely corresponds to a biologically significant state of the cofactor cluster within the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1594047414,"Abstract The three stereoisomers of P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)-1,4-dithiotetraphosphate have been synthesized and their 31P NMR spectra investigated. The effect of temperature on the circular dichroic spectrum of the (Sp,Sp)-stereoisomer shows that unstacking of the molecule occurs as the temperature is raised. Treatment of the (Sp,Sp)-stereoisomer with cyanogen bromide in [18O]water leads to substitution of sulfur by 18O with predominant retention of configuration at P1 and P4. (Sp,Sp)-P1,P4-Bis(5'-adenosyl)-1[thio-18O2],4[thio-18O2]tetraphosphate was synthesized and on treatment with cyanogen bromide in [17O]water gave (Rp,Rp)-P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)-1[17O,18O2],4[17O,18O2]tetraphosphate. Hydrolysis by unsymmetrical Ap4A phosphodiesterase from lupin seeds gave (Rp)-5'-[16O,17O,18O]AMP. The reaction therefore proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, indicating that the enzyme-catalyzed displacement by water occurs by a direct in-line mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1660661459,"Abstract The enhancer-binding factor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 was purified from human B cells by sequence-specific duplex oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Gel retardation assay and footprint analysis showed that the purified factor bound specifically to the HIV-1 enhancer sequence, and protected both direct repeats in the HIV-1 enhancer. The purified factor consisted of four main polypeptides of the molecular weight of 36,000-42,000. At least three of them had enhancer-binding activity after elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and renaturation. UV cross-linking analysis also showed that at least two of the polypeptides in purified fraction had a binding activity specific for the HIV-1 enhancer. The purified factor activated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro, confirming that it was indeed a transcription factor for HIV-1. The purified factor also recognized sequences in the immunoglobulin kappa gene enhancer and the major histocompatibility complex class I gene enhancer with almost the same affinity as the HIV-1 enhancer. These results suggested the existence of multiple proteins which recognize the kappa B-related sequences. This regulatory factor should help in the study of the biochemical pathway underlying HIV production from latently infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569320272,"Abstract Products of the gastrin-releasing peptide gene were isolated from culture medium supernatant of a small cell lung cancer line, NCI-H345, by several (high performance liquid chromatography) HPLC steps. The column eluates were monitored by immunoassay and absorbance profiles. Gastrin-releasing peptide was identified in HPLC eluates by a specific radioimmunoassay. Two carboxyl-terminal gastrin-releasing peptide gene-associated peptides were identified by a radioimmunoassay specific for their predicted carboxyl terminus. The amino termini of these two peptides were determined by microsequence analysis. The shorter peptide was revealed to be a fragment of the larger peptide. Expression of an alternate mRNA was shown by isolation and characterization of a novel tetradecapeptide. Amino acid analysis, microsequence analysis, and mass spectral analysis confirmed that the structure was Ser-Leu-Leu-Gln-Val-Leu-Asn-Val-Lys-Glu-Gly-Thr-Pro-Ser. This peptide represents the carboxyl terminus of a peptide resulting from alternate processing of gastrin releasing peptide mRNA. This mRNA contains a 19-base deletion, creating a frame shift. A radioiodinated synthetic analog of this peptide (Tyr-Leu-Val-Asp-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gln-Val-Leu-Asn-Val-Lys-Glu-Gly-Thr-Pro-Ser ) bound specifically to a small cell cancer line with high affinity, suggesting possible biological activity of the isolated peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1488213408,"Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Previous work has indicated that the most stable conformation for amiloride is a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic structure. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs. These analogs contained structural modifications which could be expected to allow or impede formation of a cyclized conformation. Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation."

The proton channel then appears to be opened by an interaction of F1 subunits, especially the alpha subunit, with the nonleaky Fo (Brusilow, W. S. A. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 4984-4990; Solomon, K. A., and Brusilow, W. S. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5402-5407). To study the role of the alpha and gamma subunits in proton conduction, we constructed an inducible alpha plasmid. In an alpha-gamma- background, the induction of alpha synthesis caused lethal proton leakiness, as assayed by the loss of respiration-dependent acridine orange fluorescence quenching of E. coli membranes. The presence of a gamma subunit counteracted the lethal effects as if gamma were blocking the opened channel."

Six genes that encode cysteine-containing mutants of ubiquitin were constructed, expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins purified. Single cysteine-containing mutants and a 4/14 disulfide were active in degradation of a substrate protein in vitro, while the 4/66 disulfide, which cross-links the NH2- and COOH-terminal strands of the protein, was only 20-30% active. The solution structure of the 4/66 mutant was solved: the disulfide is left-handed with no perturbations in the backbone from that of wild type ubiquitin. The results suggest that conformational mobility is required for the activity of ubiquitin in signaling proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1559733817,"Human prealbumin, a homotetrameric protein with an Mr of approximately 55,000 has been characterised by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The pH dependences of the chemical shifts of the 4 histidine residues/subunit are unremarkable; variable temperature studies show that the protein tertiary and quaternary structure is stable to at least 80 degrees C. Assignment of a number of residues was aided by the development of a computer program, PARSNIP (Programme to Analyse Ring current Shifts and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) In Proteins), which employs high resolution x-ray crystal structure atomic co-ordinates (Blake, C.F., and Oatley, S.J. (1977) Nature 268, 115-120, in the case of prealbumin) and several different predictive formalisms to calculate structure-dependent ring current-induced shifts of aromatic and methyl group protons. The program combines these with distance measurements to give plots of expected NOE difference profiles resulting from irradiation at a discrete frequency. The routine should prove applicable to many proteins whose structures have been determined but which are too large for the application of sequential residue assignment techniques. Three well resolved high field shifted methyl groups resonating at 0.18, 0.28, and 0.34 ppm are assigned to Ala-120, Leu-111, and Val-122, respectively. NOEs between these signals and the aromatics, interaromatic effects, and effects involving some of the considerable number of downfield shifted alpha-protons, have been used to identify substituents on several other residues."
