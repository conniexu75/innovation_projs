https://openalex.org/W2087487150,"Brain tumors are horrific diseases with almost universally fatal outcomes; new therapeutics are desperately needed and will come from improved understandings of glioma biology. Exosomes are endosomally derived 30-100 nm membranous vesicles released from many cell types into the extracellular milieu; surprisingly, exosomes are virtually unstudied in neuro-oncology. These microvesicles were used as vaccines in other tumor settings, but their immunological significance is unevaluated in brain tumors. Our purpose here is to report the initial biochemical, proteomic, and immunological studies on murine brain tumor exosomes, following known procedures to isolate exosomes. Our findings show that these vesicles have biophysical characteristics and proteomic profiles similar to exosomes from other cell types but that brain tumor exosomes have unique features (e.g., very basic isoelectric points, expressing the mutated tumor antigen EGFRvIII and the putatively immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta). Administration of such exosomes into syngeneic animals produced both humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized hosts capable of rejecting subsequent tumor challenges but failed to prolong survival in established orthotopic models. Control animals received saline or cell lysate vaccines and showed no antitumor responses. Exosomes and microvesicles isolated from sera of patients with brain tumors also possess EGFR, EGFRvIII, and TGF-beta. We conclude that exosomes released from brain tumor cells are biochemically/biophysically like other exosomes and have immune-modulating properties. They can escape the blood-brain barrier, with potential systemic and distal signaling and immune consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1987178054,"Background SIR2 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase [1]–[3] implicated in the regulation of lifespan in species as diverse as yeast [4], worms [5], and flies [6]. We previously reported that the level of SIRT1, the mammalian homologue of SIR2 [7], [8], is coupled to the level of mitotic activity in cells both in vitro and in vivo [9]. Cells from long-lived mice maintained SIRT1 levels of young mice in tissues that undergo continuous cell replacement by proliferating stem cells. Changes in SIRT1 protein level were not associated with changes in mRNA level, suggesting that SIRT1 could be regulated post-transcriptionally. However, other than a recent report on sumoylation [10] and identification of SIRT1 as a nuclear phospho-protein by mass spectrometry [11], post-translational modifications of this important protein have not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified 13 residues in SIRT1 that are phosphorylated in vivo using mass spectrometry. Dephosphorylation by phosphatases in vitro resulted in decreased NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity. We identified cyclinB/Cdk1 as a cell cycle-dependent kinase that forms a complex with and phosphorylates SIRT1. Mutation of two residues phosphorylated by Cyclin B/Cdk1 (threonine 530 and serine 540) disturbs normal cell cycle progression and fails to rescue proliferation defects in SIRT1-deficient cells [12], [13]. Conclusions/Significance Pharmacological manipulation of SIRT1 activity is currently being tested as a means of extending lifespan in mammals. Treatment of obese mice with resveratrol, a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, modestly but significantly improved longevity and, perhaps more importantly, offered some protection against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [14]–[16]. Understanding the endogenous mechanisms that regulate the level and activity of SIRT1, therefore, has obvious relevance to human health and disease. Our results identify phosphorylation by cell cycle dependent kinases as a major mechanism controlling the level and function of this sirtuin and complement recent reports of factors that inhibit [17], [18] and activate [19] SIRT1 by protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2155205708,"How do I know the person I see in the mirror is really me? Is it because I know the person simply looks like me, or is it because the mirror reflection moves when I move, and I see it being touched when I feel touch myself? Studies of face-recognition suggest that visual recognition of stored visual features inform self-face recognition. In contrast, body-recognition studies conclude that multisensory integration is the main cue to selfhood. The present study investigates for the first time the specific contribution of current multisensory input for self-face recognition. Participants were stroked on their face while they were looking at a morphed face being touched in synchrony or asynchrony. Before and after the visuo-tactile stimulation participants performed a self-recognition task. The results show that multisensory signals have a significant effect on self-face recognition. Synchronous tactile stimulation while watching another person's face being similarly touched produced a bias in recognizing one's own face, in the direction of the other person included in the representation of one's own face. Multisensory integration can update cognitive representations of one's body, such as the sense of ownership. The present study extends this converging evidence by showing that the correlation of synchronous multisensory signals also updates the representation of one's face. The face is a key feature of our identity, but at the same time is a source of rich multisensory experiences used to maintain or update self-representations."
https://openalex.org/W2142471892,"Background MiR-221 and miR-222 are two highly homologous microRNAs whose upregulation has been recently described in several types of human tumors, for some of which their oncogenic role was explained by the discovery of their target p27, a key cell cycle regulator. We previously showed this regulatory relationship in prostate carcinoma cell lines in vitro, underlying the role of miR-221/222 as inducers of proliferation and tumorigenicity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a number of in vivo approaches confirming our previous data. The ectopic overexpression of miR-221 is able, per se, to confer a high growth advantage to LNCaP-derived tumors in SCID mice. Consistently, the anti-miR-221/222 antagomir treatment of established subcutaneous tumors derived from the highly aggressive PC3 cell line, naturally expressing high levels of miR-221/222, reduces tumor growth by increasing intratumoral p27 amount; this effect is long lasting, as it is detectable as long as 25 days after the treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence in favour of a clinical relevance of the role of miR-221/222 in prostate carcinoma, by showing their general upregulation in patient-derived primary cell lines, where we find a significant inverse correlation with p27 expression. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that modulating miR-221/222 levels may have a therapeutic potential in prostate carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2010155516,"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a central role in development and is also involved in a diverse array of diseases. Binding of Wnts to the coreceptors Frizzled and LRP6/5 leads to phosphorylation of PPPSPxS motifs in the LRP6/5 intracellular region and the inhibition of GSK3beta bound to the scaffold protein Axin. However, it remains unknown how GSK3beta is specifically inhibited upon Wnt stimulation. Here, we show that overexpression of the intracellular region of LRP6 containing a Ser/Thr rich cluster and a PPPSPxS motif impairs the activity of GSK3beta in cells. Synthetic peptides containing the PPPSPxS motif strongly inhibit GSK3beta in vitro only when they are phosphorylated. Microinjection of these peptides into Xenopus embryos confirms that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif potentiates Wnt-induced second body axis formation. In addition, we show that the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6 plays an important role in LRP6 binding to GSK3beta. These observations demonstrate that phosphorylated LRP6/5 both recruits and directly inhibits GSK3beta using two distinct portions of its cytoplasmic sequence, and suggest a novel mechanism of activation in this signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2157084423,"Despite a long history of investigation, considerable debate revolves around whether Neanderthals became extinct because of climate change or competition with anatomically modern humans (AMH).We apply a new methodology integrating archaeological and chronological data with high-resolution paleoclimatic simulations to define eco-cultural niches associated with Neanderthal and AMH adaptive systems during alternating cold and mild phases of Marine Isotope Stage 3. Our results indicate that Neanderthals and AMH exploited similar niches, and may have continued to do so in the absence of contact.The southerly contraction of Neanderthal range in southwestern Europe during Greenland Interstadial 8 was not due to climate change or a change in adaptation, but rather concurrent AMH geographic expansion appears to have produced competition that led to Neanderthal extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2077283045,"Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is a highly phosphorylated protein required for viral replication, but whether its phosphorylation and the related kinases are involved in the viral life cycle is unknown. We found the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV N protein to be an appropriate system to address this issue. Using high resolution PAGE analysis, this protein could be separated into phosphorylated and unphosphorylated isoforms. Mass spectrometric analysis and deletion mapping showed that the major phosphorylation sites were located at the central serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif that contains several glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 substrate consensus sequences. GSK-3-specific inhibitor treatment dephosphorylated the N protein, and this could be recovered by the constitutively active GSK-3 kinase. Immunoprecipitation brought down both N and GSK-3 proteins in the same complex, and the N protein could be phosphorylated directly at its SR-rich motif by GSK-3 using an in vitro kinase assay. Mutation of the two priming sites critical for GSK-3 phosphorylation in the SR-rich motif abolished N protein phosphorylation. Finally, GSK-3 inhibitor was found to reduce N phosphorylation in the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-infected VeroE6 cells and decrease the viral titer and cytopathic effects. The effect of GSK-3 inhibitor was reproduced in another coronavirus, the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Our results indicate that GSK-3 is critical for CoV N protein phosphorylation and suggest that it plays a role in regulating the viral life cycle. This study, thus, provides new avenues to further investigate the specific role of N protein phosphorylation in CoV replication."

https://openalex.org/W2153751284,"Follistatin is a transcriptional target and a modulator of activin action. Through an autocrine/paracrine loop, activin controls follistatin levels and thus regulates its own bioavailability. In gonadotropic αT3-1 cells, activin induces follistatin transcription primarily through the action of Smad3 at an intronic Smad-binding element (SBE1). Using a proteomics approach, we searched for endogenous αT3-1 proteins that participate in SBE1-mediated transcription. We identified FoxL2, a member of the forkhead family, as a candidate modulator of SBE1 function. Mutations of FoxL2 are associated with the blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome characterized with craniofacial defects and premature ovarian failure. FoxL2 localizes to α-glycoprotein subunit- and follicle-stimulating hormone β-positive cells of the adult mouse pituitary and is present in αT3-1 and LβT2 cells, but its pituitary actions remain largely unknown. We have determined that FoxL2 binds to a forkhead-binding element (FKHB) located just downstream of the SBE1 site of the follistatin gene and functions as a Smad3 partner to drive SBE1-mediated transcription in αT3-1 cells treated with activin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirm that endogenous FoxL2 and Smad3 are recruited to the intronic enhancer of the follistatin gene where the SBE1 and FKHB sites are located. Exogenous FoxL2 enhances SBE1-mediated transcription, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous FoxL2 protein compromises this effect in αT3-1 cells. FoxL2 directly associates with Smad3 but not Smad2 or Smad4. This association between Smad3 and FoxL2 is mediated by the MH2 domain of Smad3 and is dependent on an intact forkhead domain in FoxL2. Altogether, these observations highlight a novel role for FoxL2 and suggest that it may function as a transcriptional regulator and a coordinator of Smad3 targets.

Activin A and B comprising homodimers of the structurally related inhibin βA and βB subunits, respectively, are members of the TGF-β family (1Vale W. Hsueh A. Rivier C. Yu J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1990; 95: 211-248Crossref Google Scholar). As such, they are present in most tissues, and both forms of activin are known to participate in the local control of a variety of essential developmental and homeostatic processes, including those involved in the control of reproduction (1Vale W.

The varied actions of activins are in turn fine-tuned by cell-specific and context-dependent mechanisms of inactivation via binding proteins such as follistatin and FSTL3 (5Phillips D.J. deKretser D.M.

Follistatin is a single chain glycoprotein that binds activin with high affinity at a 2:1 molar ratio and interferes with its access to cell-surface receptors (10Shimonaka M. Inouye S. Shimasaki S.

Follistatin also binds and modulates the actions of several other members of the TGF-β family such as myostatin and certain bone morphogenetic proteins (13Sidis Y. Mukherjee A. Keutmann H. Delbaere A. Sadatsuki M. Schneyer A. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3586-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). First characterized as a product of the gonads with feedback FSH inhibitory actions on the pituitary, many studies have since demonstrated that follistatin is expressed and secreted locally by pituitary cells, as it is by many other tissues and organs (14Esch F.S.

Genetic inactivation of the Fst in mice is associated with extensive defects and death soon after birth, reflecting the broad physiological importance of follistatin and its ability to target multiple TGF-β family ligands at relevant sites (20Matzuk M.M. Lu N. Vogel H. Sellheyer K. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 374: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The global overexpression of follistatin, on the other hand, is associated with reduced FSH levels, gonadal defects, and abnormalities of the skin and hair (21Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Woodruff T. Hadsell L.A. DeMayo F.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The highly conserved human and rodent follistatin genes comprising six introns and exons produce two mRNA transcripts and the corresponding C-terminally extended FS315 or truncated FS288 proteins that are presumed to serve distinct physiological functions (22Shimasaki S.

Activin and follistatin have emerged as key players of the autocrine/paracrine milieu of the anterior pituitary involved in the control of the reproductive axis in rodents and primates (24Bilezikjian L.M. Blount A. Leal A.M.O. Donaldson C. Fischer W. Vale W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 225: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Activin B and follistatin expressed and secreted by pituitary gonadotropes exert local control on FSHβ and LHβ subunit expression in these cells and, working in conjunction with GnRH, inhibin, and steroid hormones, promote the cyclic variations of FSH/LH ratios required for normal reproduction (25Burger L.L. Haisenleder D.J. Dalkin A.C. Marshall J.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Intra-pituitary activin B exerts positive effects on FSH secretion from gonadotropes, and this local action of activin B is in turn controlled by the local “buffering” capacity of follistatin (26Corrigan A.Z. Bilezikjian L.M. Carroll R.S. Bald L.N. Schmelzer C.H. Fendly B.M. Mason A.J. Chin W.W. Schwall R.H. Vale W.W.

Despite the established importance of this interplay between follistatin and activin, activin-dependent mechanisms that control follistatin expression in the pituitary or other tissues remain largely unknown. Activin signals are transmitted by type II (ActRII or ActRIIB) and type I (ALK4) serine/threonine kinase receptors and the ALK4-dependent phosphorylation of the downstream Smad2 and/or Smad3 transcriptional effectors (2Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 40Lebrun J.-J. Chen Y. Vale W.W. Aono T. Inhibin, Activin and Follistatin, Recent Advances and Future Views. Springer-Verlag, Tokushima, Japan1997: 1-20Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Smad2/3 at their C-terminal SSXS motifs enables them to form partnerships with Smad4/DPC4 and other cofactors and mediate transcriptional effects by binding to specific promoter elements on target genes and assembling co-activators and co-repressors (2Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 8Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

The interactions of Smads with co-factors are fundamental to their function, and the differential partnerships between P-Smad2 or P-Smad3 and cell-specific factors allows activin to generate a diverse set of transcriptional programs in many different cell types under different physiological conditions (2Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 9Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). We previously reported that Smad-mediated transcription of the rat Fst in activin-treated αT3-1 cells is dependent on a conserved Smad-binding element (SBE1) that localizes to an activin-responsive region of intron 1 (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This SBE1 element preferentially binds Smad3 and mediates downstream effects of activin A. Luciferase reporter constructs that incorporate up to 2.86 kb of the upstream promoter of the rat Fst, but lack the intronic SBE1 enhancer, are unresponsive to activin signaling in either αT3-1 or LβT2 cells (29Bilezikjian L.M.

By contrast, the same reporters display both basal and Smad-dependent inducible activity when transfected into HepG2 or HEK293T cells, indicating that the function of SBE1 is dispensable in these cell types. Similarly, the upstream promoter region of the human FST is sufficient for Smad-dependent activation in HepG2 cells treated with either activin or TGF-β (42Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S.

These observations raised the possibility that the differential modes of Smad-dependent regulation of follistatin expression are dictated through partnerships between Smads and other factors that are differentially expressed in a cell type-dependent fashion. We evaluated this hypothesis by searching for factors that cooperate with Smad3 at the intronic SBE1 site of the rat follistatin gene and mediate activin effects in αT3-1 cells. Using an oligonucleotide pulldown approach, we enriched endogenous αT3-1 proteins that assemble at or near the intronic SBE1 site and analyzed them by mass spectrometry. One of the proteins enriched by this strategy was FoxL2, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. In this study, we identify FoxL2 as a key Smad3 partner and evaluate its role in facilitating activin-dependent transcription of the follistatin gene in gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cells. Cell Lines-The mouse gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 (43Horn F. Bilezikjian L.M. Perrin M.H. Bosma M.M. Windle J.J. Hille B. Vale W.W. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Plasmids and Reagents-The N-terminally Myc-tagged human (h) Smad2, -3, and -4 were subcloned into the pCS2+ expression vector as described previously (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hSmad2 and -3 cDNAs were provided by Dr. Rik Derynck, University of California, San Francisco, and the hSmad4/DPC4 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Scott Kern, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore. The myc-hSmad3-MH1 domain corresponding to amino acids 1–145 of hSmad3 was generated by PCR amplification using the myc-hSmad3 plasmid as a template (forward T7 primer, 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGG; reverse primer, 5′-ACGTTCTAGATTACGTGTGGCGTGGCAC). The full-length myc-hSmad3 was also used as a template to generate myc-hSmad3-MH2 encompassing amino acids 220–425 of hSmad3 (forward primer incorporating the Myc tag, 5′-ACGTGGATCCACCATGGGAGAACAGAAACTGATCTCTGAAGAAGACCTGATGGACCTGCAGCCAGTTACC; reverse SP6 primer, 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATA). Both fragments were digested and directionally subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pCS2+ and verified by sequence analysis. The human FoxL2 cDNA clone was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL), and the entire coding region (AscI/SphI fragment) was subcloned into the pCS2+ expression vector at the StuI site. To obtain the mouse FoxL2, total RNA extracted from αT3-1 was reverse-transcribed, and a cDNA encoding mFoxL2 was amplified and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCS2+ (forward primer, 5′-GGATCCACCATGATGGCCAGCTACCCCGAGCCC; reverse primer, 5′-GAATTCTCAGAGATCCAGACGCGAGTG). An N-terminal FLAG tag was then added by using an upstream primer that incorporates the corresponding nucleotides (forward primer, 5′-GGATCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGACGACGACAAAATGATGGCCAGCTACCCCGAGCCC).

Open table in a new tab The luciferase reporter plasmids that incorporate fragments of the rat Fst just upstream of the coding region of luciferase in the pGL2 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) have been characterized previously (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rFS(2.9)-luc and the rFS(0.3)-luc reporter plasmids incorporate the –2864/+136 and –312/+136 fragments of rat follistatin, respectively. In the rFS(2.9i)-luc or the rFS(0.3i)-luc plasmid, the entire first intron (+227/+2097) of the rat Fst is ligated to the 3′ end of either the –2864/+136 or the –312/+136 fragment via an engineered SpeI site. The rFS(0.3ex45)-luc reporter retains only the +1784/+1912 fragment of intron 1 of the rat follistatin gene just downstream of the –312/+136 fragment in rFS(0.3)-luc. The SBE1 mutant form of the rFS(0.3ex45)-luc reporter was generated by using a PCR approach (wild type, 5′...TTGT... 3′; SBE1 mutant, 5′... TTGTaatTGGGTCA... 3), as described previously (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutations of the forkhead-binding site (FKHB) were also generated by a similar PCR approach to introduce those substitutions shown in Fig. 9. Recombinant human activin A was purified from the conditioned medium of stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays-For transient transfection experiments, the αT3-1 cells were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of complete medium (DMEM, 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine). The αT3-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 6 h using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cells were subsequently treated with vehicle or activin A in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 2 mm glutamine. Luciferase reporter activity was measured 15 h later, as described (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Where indicated, varying amounts of expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Smads, FLAG-tagged mFoxL2, or empty pCS2+ vector were co-transfected along with the reporter plasmids. Luciferase reporter activity of cell lysates was measured using d-luciferin luciferase substrate (Biosynth, Naperville, IL) with a Lumimark microplate luminometer (Bio-Rad) and internally normalized to the activity of the co-transfected cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid, as described (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reported data correspond to luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios of each plasmid relative to the activity of the pGL2 basic vector. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected by plating 105 cells/well on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates in complete DMEM 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected overnight with 200 ng of the appropriate reporter plasmid, 10 ng of β-galactosidase, and other plasmids, as indicated, using polyethyleneimine as the transfection reagent. The cells were washed 16–18 h later and treated for 18 h with either vehicle or activin A in complete DMEM. Luciferase reporter activity was measured as described above. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test. Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assays-The oligonucleotide precipitation experiments were essentially as described previously (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, αT3-1 cells (5 × 107/15-cm dish) were treated for 30 min with 1 nm activin A or vehicle in freshly supplemented growth medium. Samples were prepared by brief sonication in lysis buffer followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained from the equivalent of 5 × 107 cells (∼4 mg) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides, pre-coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce), in the presence of 30 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). The agarose beads were washed three times by centrifugation, and endogenous αT3-1 proteins enriched by this method were recovered and subjected to Western analysis or processed for analysis by mass spectrometry. For Western analyses, the samples were resolved under reducing conditions by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (4–12% SDS-NuPAGE gels, Invitrogen) with MOPS as the running buffer and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Endogenous proteins corresponding to Smad2/3 or FoxL2 were detected using rabbit anti-hSmad2/3, as described previously (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a commercially available goat anti-m/hFoxL2 (Imgenex, San Diego), respectively, and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat; Pierce). Immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). The double-stranded biotinylated wild type or the equivalent mutant probe harboring a mutated SBE1 site corresponds to the SBE1-containing region of intron 1 of the rat Fst (35Blount A. Vaughan J. Vale W. Bilezikjian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7016-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Identification of SBE1-associated Proteins by Mass Spectrometry-Proteins enriched by the oligonucleotide precipitation assays described above were processed and analyzed by two approaches. In one strategy, bound proteins were recovered off the biotinylated probes pre-coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads by boiling with sample loading buffer under reducing conditions. Proteins that co-purified with the wild type or mutant SBE1 oligonucleotides were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie Blue. Mass-specific bands were excised from the stained gel. Gel slices were de-stained by treatment with 40% n-propyl alcohol and 50% acetonitrile and digested over 16 h at 37 °C with 100 ng of trypsin added in 10 μl of ammonium bicarbonate solution (20 mm). Peptides were extracted and dried down completely and then re-dissolved in 0.1% formic acid for ESI-MS/MS analysis on a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000 Plus mass spectrometer (Billerica, MA). MS analysis data were analyzed using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK) on a local Mascot server (version 2.1.0) and searched against the latest NCBI nr protein data base. Peptides were required to be fully tryptic with one missed cleavage allowed. Results were filtered, combined, sorted, and displayed using Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) to validate protein identifications derived from MS/MS sequencing results. Scaffold can verify peptide identifications assigned by Mascot using the X!Tandem data base searching program (44Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2070289358,"Background Contagious prion diseases – scrapie of sheep and chronic wasting disease of several species in the deer family – give rise to epidemics that seem capable of compromising host population viability. Despite this prospect, the ecological consequences of prion disease epidemics in natural populations have received little consideration. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a cohort study design, we found that prion infection dramatically lowered survival of free-ranging adult (>2-year-old) mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus): estimated average life expectancy was 5.2 additional years for uninfected deer but only 1.6 additional years for infected deer. Prion infection also increased nearly fourfold the rate of mountain lions (Puma concolor) preying on deer, suggesting that epidemics may alter predator–prey dynamics by facilitating hunting success. Despite selective predation, about one fourth of the adult deer we sampled were infected. High prevalence and low survival of infected deer provided a plausible explanation for the marked decline in this deer population since the 1980s. Conclusion Remarkably high infection rates sustained in the face of intense predation show that even seemingly complete ecosystems may offer little resistance to the spread and persistence of contagious prion diseases. Moreover, the depression of infected populations may lead to local imbalances in food webs and nutrient cycling in ecosystems in which deer are important herbivores."
https://openalex.org/W1988730245,"There is little direct evidence on the role of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation in ejecting hearts. In studies reported here we determined the effects of regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation on in situ cardiac systolic mechanics and in vitro myofibrillar mechanics. We compared data obtained from control nontransgenic mice (NTG) with a transgenic mouse model expressing a cardiac specific nonphosphorylatable RLC (TG-RLC(P-). We also determined whether the depression in RLC phosphorylation affected phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins. TG-RLC(P-) demonstrated decreases in base-line load-independent measures of contractility and power and an increase in ejection duration together with a depression in phosphorylation of myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C) and troponin I (TnI). Although TG-RLC(P-) displayed a significantly reduced response to beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation, MyBP-C and TnI were phosphorylated to a similar level in TG-RLC(P-) and NTG, suggesting cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling to these proteins was not disrupted. A major finding was that NTG controls were significantly phosphorylated at RLC serine 15 following beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation, a mechanism prevented in TG-RLC(P-), thus providing a biochemical difference in beta(1)-adrenergic responsiveness at the level of the sarcomere. Our measurements of Ca(2+) tension and Ca(2+)-ATPase rate relations in detergent-extracted fiber bundles from LV trabeculae demonstrated a relative decrease in maximum Ca(2+)-activated tension and tension cost in TG-RLC(P-) fibers, with no change in Ca(2+) sensitivity. Our data indicate that RLC phosphorylation is critical for normal ejection and response to beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation. Our data also indicate that the lack of RLC phosphorylation promotes compensatory changes in MyBP-C and TnI phosphorylation, which when normalized do not restore function."
https://openalex.org/W1968475818,"Schistosomiasis japonica remains a major public health problem in China. Its pathogen, Schistosoma japonicum has a complex life cycle and a unique repertoire of genes expressed at different life cycle stages. Exploring schistosome gene regulation will yield the best prospects for new drug targets and vaccine candidates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of noncoding RNA that control many biological processes by sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression. Although a large number of miRNAs have been identified from plants to mammals, it remains no experimental proof whether schistosome exist miRNAs.We have identified novel miRNAs from Schistosoma japonicum by cloning and sequencing a small (18-26 nt) RNA cDNA library from the adult worms. Five novel miRNAs were identified from 227 cloned RNA sequences and verified by Northern blot. Alignments of the miRNAs with corresponding family members indicated that four of them belong to a metazoan miRNA family: let-7, miR-71, bantam and miR-125. The fifth potentially new (non conserved) miRNA appears to belong to a previously undescribed family in the genus Schistosome. The novel miRNAs were designated as sja-let-7, sja-miR-71, sja-bantam, sja-miR-125 and sja-miR-new1, respectively. Expression of sja-let-7, sja-miR-71 and sja-bantam were analyzed in six stages of the life cycle, i.e. egg, miracidium, sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomulum, and adult worm, by a modified stem-loop reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method developed in our laboratory. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were highly stage-specific. In particular, sja-miR-71 and sja-bantam expression reach their peaks in the cercaria stage and then drop quickly to the nadirs in the schistosomulum stage, following penetration of cercaria into a mammalian host.Authentic miRNAs were identified for the first time in S. japonicum, including a new schistosome family member. The different expression patterns of the novel miRNAs over the life stages of S. japonicum suggest that they may mediate important roles in Schistosome growth and development."

Fibrillin-1 mutations are believed to promote abnormal Smad2/3 signaling by impairing the sequestration of latent TGF-β complexes into the extracellular matrix. Here we report that promiscuous Smad2/3 signaling is the cell-autonomous phenotype of primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) explanted from the thoracic aortas of Fbn1 mutant mice with either neonatal onset or progressively severe aortic aneurysm. This cellular phenotype was characterized in VSMC isolated from Fbn1-null (mgN/mgN) mice, which recapitulate the most severe form of Marfan syndrome. We found that loss of fibrillin-1 deposition promotes the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and abnormal accumulation of phosphorylated TGF-β-activated kinase 1 and p38 MAPK, in addition to increasing the levels of endogenous phospho-Smad2. We showed that improper Smad2/3 signaling in Fbn1-null VSMC is in part stimulated by phospho-p38 MAPK, which is in turn activated in response to signals other than those mediated by the kinase activity of the ALK5 receptor. Consistent with these cell culture data, in vivo analyses documented that phospho-p38 MAPK accumulates earlier than phospho-Smad2 in the aortic wall of mgN/mgN mice and that systemic inhibition of phospho-p38 MAPK activity lowers the levels of phospho-Smad2 in this tissue. Collectively, these findings indicate that improper activation of p38 MAPK is a precursor of constitutive Smad2/3 signaling in the aortic wall of a mouse model of neonatal lethal Marfan syndrome.

Contrary to the earlier suggestion that MFS pathogenesis is solely accounted for by the loss of connective tissue integrity, mouse models of MFS have revealed that mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (Fbn1) also promote promiscuous activation of latent TGF-β with adverse consequences to cellular activities (1Ramirez F.

Relevant to aortic aneurysm, abnormal Smad2/3 signaling has been associated with disease progression in mice lacking or underexpressing fibrillin-1, which die at postnatal days 10–14 (P10–P14) (mgN/mgN mice) and at 2–6 months of age (mgR/mgR mice), respectively, and in mice heterozygous for a missense mutation in fibrillin-1, which display vascular abnormalities that do not reach a clinical end point (C1039G/+ mice) (5Pereira L.

Once activated, TGF-β signals through serine/threonine kinase receptors (TGFBRII and ALK5) and intracellular Smad2/3, Smad4 protein complexes that translocate into the nucleus and bind specific DNA elements in cooperation with other transcription factors (21Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2004; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4737) Google Scholar). TGF-β can also signal through MAPK-dependent pathways, and molecules that transduce MAPK signals can directly or indirectly influence Smad2/3 activity (22Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar).The present study was designed to identify other molecular determinants of aneurysm progression in MFS by examining primary vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) cultures explanted from the thoracic aortas of MFS-like mice. Our results demonstrate that Smad2/3 signaling is constitutively active in VSMC cultures from mgN/mgN, mgR/mgR, and C1039/+ mice. We also present in vitro and in vivo evidence indicating that p38 MAPK is an early contributor to promiscuous Smad2/3 signaling during aneurysm progression in Fbn1-null mice. These findings extend our understanding of the molecular events associated with aneurysm progression in MFS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary VSMC Cultures—Primary VSMC strains were established after isolating the cells from the thoracic aortas of 10-day-old mgN/mgN mice, 5-month-old mgR/mgR mice, 9-month-old C1039G/+ mice, and the respective wild-type littermates (23Travo P.

Aneurysm progression in mgR/mgR and C1039G/+ mice was monitored by echocardiography prior to the isolation of VSMC (8Habashi J.P. Judge D.P. Holm T.M. Cohn R.D. Loeys B.L. Cooper T.K. Myers L.

Primary VSMC were expanded on 100-mm Primaria Plates dishes (BD Biosciences) in 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and fungizone; cell aliquots were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent use. VSMC purity (evaluated by immunostaining with anti-α-SMA antibody) was estimated to range between 70 and 80% in mgN/mgN and mgR/mgR cultures and between 50 and 60% in C1039G/+ cultures. Cells between passages 3 and 8 were employed in the experiments described in the present study.Cell Transfections—Primary VSMC were seeded the day before transfection at a density of 7500 cells/cm2 and then cultured in 2% FBS. Cells were transiently co-transfected with 400 ng of the TGF-β-responsive plasmid p3TP-Lux or (CAGA)12MLP-Luc (kind gifts of Drs. Joan Massagué and Peter ten Dijke, respectively) (25Wrana J.L.

Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In some experiments, p3TP-Lux was transiently co-transfected with a plasmid that expresses a dominant negative version of Smad3 (DN-Smad3) lacking the MH2 domain (27Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In other transfection experiments, VSMC cultures were treated with 5 μm SB203580, 5 μm SP600125, 10 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), or 1 μm SB431542 (Sigma); control samples were treated with an equal volume of DMSO (vehicle). Luciferase assays were performed 24 h after cell transfection, and the results were evaluated as previously described (27Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the RNA interference experiments, mutant VSMC were retrotransfected with 50 μm small interfering RNA specific for p38α MAPK (MAPK14) or nontargeting small interfering RNA (J-040125 and D-001810–01, respectively; Dharmacon-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, retrotransfected cells were cultured for an additional 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Protein extracts were analyzed as described below. Statistical analyses were performed for all of the experiments using Student's t test, assuming a p value of ≤0.05 as significant.Detection of ROS—Levels of intracellular ROS were assessed using a modification of the published protocols (28Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent VSMC cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C and incubated for 10 min in the dark in a phosphate-buffered saline-based buffer containing 10 μm 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 5.5 mm glucose. This was followed by an additional 10-min incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and viewing with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., Peabody, MA) at λ = 488 nm. The intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured in several randomly chosen fields (each containing a minimum of 30 cells) with the aid of the MetaMorph version 6.3 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and it was expressed as the average combined value of all fields. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, assuming a p value of ≤0.05 as significant.Immunoblots, Immunohistochemistry, and in Vitro Kinase Assay—VSMC were cultured for 4 days in 10% FBS and for 2 additional days in 2% FBS. In some experiments, the culture medium included MAPK or ALK5 inhibitors at the aforementioned concentrations or 1 μm diphenylene iodonium (Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences). Cell layers were scraped into ice-cold Tris-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell and tissue extracts were prepared and assayed for total protein content using the BCA kit (Pierce) (7Carta L. Pereira L. Arteaga-Solis E. Lee-Arteaga S.Y. Lenart B. Starcher B. Merkel C.A.

Protein extracts (10–25 μg/lane) were fractioned by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated first with antibodies against phosphorylated TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (phospho-TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase 1)), phospho-Smad2, phospho-p38 MAPK, or phospho-ATF2 (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and subsequently with biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:25,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Streptavidin (Millipore). Immunoreactive products were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences), and their relative intensity was evaluated with the aid of Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). To assay p38 MAPK activity in vitro, cell lysates from wild-type and mutant VSMC cultures were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with an immobilized anti-phospho-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibody (Thr-180/Tyr-182; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 1 μg of recombinant ATF2 and 200 μm ATP as per the manufacturer's protocol. Products of the reaction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against phospho-ATF2 (Thr-71). Positive bands were visualized and quantified as described above. Statistical analyses in all of these experiments were performed using the Student's t test, assuming a p value of ≤0.05 as significant. Tissue samples for immunohistochemistry were isolated from the thoracic aortas of wild-type and mgN/mgN mice, processed as previously described (7Carta L. Pereira L. Arteaga-Solis E. Lee-Arteaga S.Y.

Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Ono K. Okada M. Iwasaki A. Miyamoto T. Nakano A. Sasayama S. Artherioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 166-172Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An equivalent number of control mice was only treated with vehicle. Mice were sacrificed at P10 by carbon dioxide inhalation, and the thoracic aorta was transected, placed immediately in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4), cleaned-up, and then flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen to be subsequently processed for protein analyses as described above. In parallel experiments, thoracic aortas from untreated wild-type and mgN/mgN mice sacrificed at P4 and P10 were similarly processed for protein analyses. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.RESULTSSmad2/3 Signaling Is Constitutively Active in Fbn1 Mutant VSMC Cultures—Previous studies have associated the emergence of TGF-β-driven unproductive remodeling of the aortic wall with the progression of vascular disease in mice that harbor different Fbn1 mutations and display discrete phenotypic outcomes (5Pereira L.

Here we evaluated TGF-β signaling (as evidenced by the accumulation of endogenous phospho-Smad2 and the transcription of TGF-β-responsive plasmids) in primary VSMC explanted from the thoracic aortas of these same mutant animals (mgN/mgN, mgR/mgR, and C1039G/+ mice) that were sacrificed at comparable stages of aneurysm progression (10 days, 5 months, and 9 months of age, respectively) (5Pereira L. Lee S.Y. Gayraud B. Andrikopoulos K. Shapiro S.D. Bunton T. Biery N.J. Dietz H.C. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results demonstrated that all Fbn1 mutant VSMC display higher levels of endogenous phospho-Smad2 and greater activity of transfected p3TP-Lux plasmid compared with the wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1, A and B). The latter observation was further validated by showing a significant reduction of p3TP-Lux activity in cells overexpressing DN-Smad3, a dominant-negative Smad3 protein that lacks the MH2 domain (Fig. 1B) (27Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained using the TGF-β-responsive plasmid (CAGA)12MLP-Luc, (data not shown). Quantitative differences in Smad2/3 signaling between VSMC of different mutant genotypes and between individual cell strains of the same mutant genotype are likely to reflect variances in disease progression and penetrance (Fig. 1A). This last point notwithstanding, we concluded that primary VSMC cultures represent a suitable in vitro system to investigate abnormal signaling events associated with the deposition of a microfibril-deficient matrix.Several Signaling Molecules Are Abnormally Activated in Fbn1-null VSMC—Cross-talk between TGF-β and MAPK-dependent pathways modulates cellular responses to specific stimuli (22Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In order to verify whether MAPK-transduced signals contribute to elevated Smad2/3 activity in Fbn1-null VSMC, we compared luciferase expression of TGF-β-responsive plasmids transfected into wild-type or mutant cells that were cultured with or without the addition of chemical inhibitors of ERK (PD98095), p38 MAPK (SB203580), or JNK (SP600125). The choice of Fbn1-null cells was based on the assumption that the extremely rapid physical collapse of the aortic wall in mgN/mgN mice might eliminate the confounding effects of secondary cellular events that characterize late onset vascular disease in the other two mouse models of MFS (5Pereira L. Lee S.Y. Gayraud B. Andrikopoulos K. Shapiro S.D. Bunton T. Biery N.J. Dietz H.C. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results revealed that inhibition of either p38 MAPK or JNK activity negatively affects the expression of the p3TP-Lux and (CAGA)12MLP-Luc reporter plasmids (Fig. 2A) (data not shown).FIGURE 2Multiple signaling molecules are activated in Fbn1-null VSMC.

In order to maximize our read-outs, the analyses were performed using the Fbn1-null VSMC isolate with the highest levels of Smad2/3 signaling (strain 1106C). p38 MAPK has been implicated in transducing stress response signals as well as specific TGF-β stimuli that are mediated through the noncanonical TAK1 pathway (31Winter-Vann A.M.

Similarly, TGF-β and stress response signals have been reported to promote ROS production, and ROS-elicited signals have been shown to stimulate TGF-β and phospho-p38 MAPK activity (29Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 34Koli K. Myllarniemi M. Keski-Oja J. Kinnula V.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In line with these considerations, we found that 1106C cultures display increased nuclear localization of phospho-Smad2 as well as abnormally high levels of ROS, phospho-TAK1, and phospho-p38 MAPK (Fig. 2, B–D). Heightened p38 MAPK activity in Fbn1-null VSMC was independently confirmed by an in vitro assay that measured phosphorylation of the downstream effector ATF2 (Fig. 2E) (35Morton S. Davis R.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 13: 177-183Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These observations therefore demonstrated that multiple signaling molecules are abnormally activated in primary VSMC cultures lacking fibrillin-1 microfibrils.p38 MAPK Stimulates Smad2/3 Signaling in Fbn1-null VSMC—Next, chemical inhibitors"
https://openalex.org/W1994823586,"Nucleostemin is a nucleolar protein widely expressed in proliferating cells. Nucleostemin is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, and both depletion and overexpression of nucleostemin induce cell cycle arrest through the p53 signaling pathway. Although the presence of p53-independent functions of nucleostemin has been previously suggested, the identities of these additional functions remained to be investigated. Here, we show that nucleostemin has a novel role as an integrated component of ribosome biogenesis, particularly pre-rRNA processing. Nucleostemin forms a large protein complex (>700 kDa) that co-fractionates with the pre-60 S ribosomal subunit in a sucrose gradient. This complex contains proteins related to pre-rRNA processing, such as Pes1, DDX21, and EBP2, in addition to several ribosomal proteins. We show that the nucleolar retention of DDX21 and EBP2 is dependent on the presence of nucleostemin in the nucleolus. Furthermore, the knockdown of nucleostemin delays the processing of 32 S pre-rRNA into 28 S rRNA. This is accompanied by a substantial decrease of protein synthesis as well as the levels of rRNAs and some mRNAs. In addition, overexpressed nucleostemin significantly promotes the processing of 32 S pre-rRNA. Collectively, these biochemical and functional studies demonstrate a novel role of nucleostemin in ribosome biogenesis.

This is a key aspect of the role of nucleostemin in regulating cell proliferation. Nucleostemin (NS) 2The abbreviations used are: NS, nucleostemin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FBS, fetal bovine serum; I, immunofluorescence staining; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; W, Western blotting; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, short interfering RNA. is a nucleolar protein preferentially expressed in actively proliferating cells. The structure of NS is characterized by two GTP-binding domains, which are involved in the regulation of its dynamic shuttling between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (1Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). NS was originally identified as a nucleolar protein prominently expressed in rat neural stem cells and down-regulated during differentiation of these cells in vitro (2Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2991-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The same authors also found that NS is widely expressed in neural precursor cells in early mouse embryos as well as in a variety of cancer cells and stem cells, including embryonic stem cells and a hematopoietic stem cell-enriched fraction. NS is generally down-regulated in the early stage of differentiation before exit from the cell cycle. In addition, knockdown of NS significantly inhibits proliferation of cortical stem cells and cancer cells. These initial observations led to suggestions that NS is involved in multipotency in stem cells as well as in the regulation of cancer and stem cell proliferation (2Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2991-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that NS is in fact widely expressed in many types of normal proliferating cells at levels similar to those in malignant cells. For instance, NS is expressed in normal kidney cells and renal carcinoma cells at comparable levels as detected in histological sections (3Fan Y. Liu Z. Zhao S. Lou F. Nilsson S. Ekman P. Xu D. Fang X. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The expression of NS is significantly up-regulated when normal T lymphocytes are activated by concanavalin A (3Fan Y. Liu Z. Zhao S. Lou F. Nilsson S. Ekman P. Xu D. Fang X. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and when bone marrow stem cells are stimulated by fibroblast growth factor 2 (4Kafienah W. Mistry S. Williams C. Hollander A.P. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells in NS-null mouse embryos fail to enter the S phase, resulting in embryonic death at the blastocyst stage (5Zhu Q. Yasumoto H. Tsai R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9279-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Beekman C. Nichane M. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Floss T. Wurst W. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9291-9301Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In early Xenopus embryos NS is also expressed in the sites of active cell proliferation and local depletion of NS results in a decrease in proliferating neural progenitor cells (6Beekman C. Nichane M. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Floss T. Wurst W. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9291-9301Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was proposed that expression of NS is more closely linked with cell proliferation than with the malignant state or differentiation status of a cell. Several studies have provided evidence that the p53 signaling pathway is involved in the G1 arrest of the cell cycle induced by the down-regulation of NS. Physical interaction between NS and p53 was initially reported by Tsai and McKay (2Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2991-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that the G1 arrest requires the presence of p53 (7Ma H. Pederson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the most recent study Dai et al. (8Dai M.S. Sun X.X. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4365-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that knockdown of NS enhances the interaction between the p53-binding protein MDM2 and the ribosomal protein L5 or L11, preventing MDM2 from inducing ubiquitylation-based p53 degradation. However, other studies have also suggested that NS may have a p53-independent role in the regulation of cell proliferation. For instance, the depletion of p53 from NS-null blastocysts did not rescue them from the embryonic lethality (6Beekman C. Nichane M. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Floss T. Wurst W. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9291-9301Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, NS partial loss-of-function in mouse fibroblasts did not result in any change in the p53 level (5Zhu Q. Yasumoto H. Tsai R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9279-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knockdown of L5 and L11 only partially rescued the G1 arrest in NS knockdown cells (8Dai M.S. Sun X.X. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4365-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Finally, the fact that NS is primarily localized in the nucleolus, whereas the p53-mediated mechanism occurs in the nucleoplasm, suggests that NS might have an additional role more directly relevant to nucleolar functions. To identify novel functions of NS, we purified an endogenous NS complex from HeLa cell extract and investigated whether NS interacts with other proteins not described previously. Identification of the components of this complex and the alterations of the expression level of NS in HeLa cells led us to uncover a novel role of NS in the processing of rRNA. Our findings not only provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that NS has a p53-independent function but also demonstrate that NS is critical for ribosome biogenesis, one of the most fundamental processes common for all cell types. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Isolation of the NS Complex from HeLa Cell Extract—Cytoplasmic extract and nuclear extract were sequentially prepared from a 10-liter suspension culture of HeLa S3 cells (National Cell Culture Center) and mixed to prepare whole cell extract as described previously (9Gonda K. Wudel J. Nelson D. Katoku-Kikyo N. Reed P. Tamada H. Kikyo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of the chromatographic columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. The extract was applied to an SP Sepharose cation exchange column, followed by elution of bound proteins with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (NaCl) from 75 mm to 1 m in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.003% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A). Western blotting showed that NS was eluted in the fractions containing 570–870 mm NaCl. These fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1 m before application to a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic column. Bound proteins were eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1 to 0 m in Buffer A. The NS-positive fractions, eluted by 600–300 mm ammonium sulfate, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A with 75 mm NaCl as preparation for application to a HiTrap Heparin column. Protein elution from the Heparin column was carried out using a linear gradient of NaCl from 75 mm to 1 m in Buffer A. NS was eluted in fractions containing 680–850 mm NaCl. These fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A with 75 mm NaCl and applied to a Mono Q 5/5 anion exchange column. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient from 75 mm to 1 m NaCl in Buffer A. NS was eluted from this column by 450–550 mm NaCl. The NS-positive fractions were applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column for size estimation of the NS complex. NS-positive Mono Q fractions were also analyzed by mass spectrometry. For this purpose, the proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Deep Purple (GE Healthcare). Prominent protein bands were excised from the gel and applied to a ThermoFinnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The obtained data were searched using the software Sequest (ThermoFinnigan) and X! Tandem for protein identification. Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate tandem mass spectrometry-based peptide and protein identification. Fractionation of HeLa Cell Nuclear Extract by a Sucrose Gradient—Two hundred μl of HeLa S3 cell nuclear extract (equivalent to 1 × 107 cells) were layered on top of a sucrose gradient solution (10–40% sucrose in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 10 units/ml RNasin purchased from Promega) and centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C using an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The resulting gradient solution was fractionated, and each fraction was divided into half for separate isolation of proteins and RNA. Total protein was precipitated in each fraction by adding 3 volumes of ethanol, 20 μg of glycogen, and sodium acetate (pH 6.0) to a final concentration of 0.1 m and analyzed by Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated from each fraction with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and rRNA was detected with a SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The following PCR primers were used: 28 S rRNA, 5′-GTTCACCCACTAATAGGGAACG-3′ and 5′-GGATTCTGACTTAGAGGGCGTT-3′ (10Gilles C. Polette M. Coraux C. Tournier J.M. Meneguzzi G. Munaut C. Volders L. Rousselle P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 18 S rRNA, 5′-TTGTTGGTTTTCGGAACTGAGG-3′ and 5′-ATTGCTCAATCTCGGGTGGCTG-3′ (11Curtis N.E.

Antibodies—The sources of the antibodies and the dilutions used in this study are as follows (W indicates Western blotting, and I indicates immunofluorescence staining): NS (Millipore; 1:2000 for W and 1:1200 for I), NS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200 for W and 1:100 for I), DDX21 (Aviva Systems Biology; 1:1000 for W and 1:400 for I), Pes1 (provided by Dr. Elisabeth Kremmer; 1:1000 for W and 1:400 for I) (12Holzel M. Rohrmoser M. Schlee M. Grimm T. Harasim T. Malamoussi A. Gruber-Eber A. Kremmer E. Hiddemann W. Bornkamm G.W. Eick D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), EBP2 (gift from Dr. Lori Frappier; 1:1000 for W and 1:500 for I) (13Wu H. Ceccarelli D.F. Frappier L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), nucleolin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50 for I), β-tubulin (Sigma, 1:1000 for W), TATA-binding protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 for W), B23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 for W), His6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300 for I), and rabbit normal IgG for immunoprecipitation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunofluorescence staining, the following secondary antibodies were used: Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG and anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen; 1:400), and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:300). For Western blotting horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG of appropriate species (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:1000) were used. Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were grown on cover glasses and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and washed three times with a washing solution containing 10% FBS and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS before application of primary antibodies. Double immunostaining was carried out sequentially. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C, washed with the washing solution, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. Finally, the cells were washed with the washing solution, and the nuclei were stained with Topro 3 (Invitrogen) for 15 min. The mounting solution for the cover glasses contained 50 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) and 50% glycerol in PBS. The fluorescence images were captured with a Radiance 2000 confocal system attached to an Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (both Carl Zeiss). A 488-nm argon laser and a 543-nm green helium-neon laser were used with a 63× oil Plan Apochromat objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). All of the images were processed with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems). Western Blotting—Whole cell extract was prepared from 2 × 105 cells unless stated otherwise. Extracted proteins were resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) for immunodetection. The membrane was blocked in a blocking solution containing 5% skim milk and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h. Incubation time with primary and secondary antibodies was 1 h each. Signal was detected by using SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce) as a substrate for peroxidase. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cell nuclear extract prepared from 1 × 107 cells as described previously (9Gonda K. Wudel J. Nelson D. Katoku-Kikyo N. Reed P. Tamada H. Kikyo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used for each immunoprecipitation. The extract was precleared by incubation with 2.5 μg of normal rabbit IgG and 60 μl of the Gamma-Bind G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The precleared extract was incubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-NS antibody or rabbit normal IgG for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently with 20 μl of the GammaBind G Sepharose for additional 1 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) by incubation for 5 min at 98 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. The antibodies against DDX21, EBP2, and Pes1 did not precipitate the target proteins under the abovementioned condition, potentially because of epitope masking. To overcome this problem, a combination of a denaturing buffer and the protein cross-linker dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] was used (15Zhang L. Rayner S. Katoku-Kikyo N. Romanova L. Kikyo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were treated with 2 mm dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (Pierce) in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C, and cross-linking was terminated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. The cells were resuspended in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl to prepare whole cell extract. The rest of the procedure was the same as what was described above. Preparation of Nucleolar, Nucleoplasmic, and Cytoplasmic Fractions from Knockdown Cells—These three fractions were prepared from HeLa cells as previously detailed (9Gonda K. Wudel J. Nelson D. Katoku-Kikyo N. Reed P. Tamada H. Kikyo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) after transfection of NS and control siRNA. First, 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in Buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A). The plasma membrane was then disrupted with a tissue grinder before centrifugation at 230 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer 2 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) and overlaid onto Buffer 3 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 350 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) for centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer 3 and sonicated to release nucleoli. After confirmation that microscopically intact nucleoli were isolated, the nucleolar suspension was overlaid onto Buffer 4 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 880 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) and centrifuged at 2,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and pellet were collected as the nucleoplasmic and the nucleolar fractions, respectively, for use in Western blotting. Knockdown of NS by siRNA—HeLa cells were cultured in 12-well plates until they reached 80–90% confluency. Transfection was carried out with 2.6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 60 nm siRNA/well. The following siRNA sequences were used: 5′-GAACUAAAACAGCAGCAGAdTdT-3′ for NS (2Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2991-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), 5′-GAAAGGCUUCUCUGAUAAAdTdT-3′ for EBP2 and the scrambled sequence 5′-AGUACUGCUUACGAUACGGdTdT-3′ (Ambion) as a negative control. The cells were again transfected with the same siRNA 72 h after the first transfection. The cells were then cultured for an additional 24 h and analyzed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, or metabolic labeling experiments. The following primers were used for quantitative RT-PCR of mRNAs after NS knockdown: β actin, 5′-TGGGTCAGAAGGATTCCTATGTG-3′ and 5′-TCGTCCCAGTTGGTGACGAT-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ and 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′. Transfection with Expression Plasmids—NS cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) with a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus of NS. The resulting construct pcDNA3.1-NS-His6 and the control plasmid pEGFP-C1 (enhanced green fluorescence protein; Clontech) were introduced into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Transfection was carried out in 12-well plates with 1.7 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 1.4 μg of plasmid DNA/well. After 48 h the cells were analyzed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, or metabolic labeling experiments. Metabolic Labeling of Nascent Pre-rRNA with 32P in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with 32P after transfection with siRNA or plasmid as described above. The culture medium was first replaced with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, and the cells were cultured for 1 h. [32P]Orthophosphate was then added to a final concentration of 20 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 1.5 h. The culture medium was replaced with nonradioactive standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and the cells were further incubated for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h before harvest. Total RNA was isolated from these cells using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Two μg of total RNA from each sample were resolved in a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. The gel was dried, and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. The developed films were scanned with an image scanner, and the intensity of each band was monitored using the software ImageJ. The ratios of the band intensities were calculated with the software Excel 2002 (Microsoft). Metabolic Labeling of Protein with [35S]Methionine—HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met after transfection with siRNA or plasmid as described above. The cells were first washed and cultured in Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed FBS for 1 h. After the addition of [35S]Met to a final concentration of 15 μCi/ml, the cells were incubated for an additional 3–6 h. Whole cell extracts prepared from these cells were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 2 × 105 cells equivalent/well. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Total radioactivity in each lane was measured with a scintillation counter LS 6500 (Beckman Coultier). Flow Cytometry—After transfection with siRNA HeLa cells were harvested, washed in PBS, resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol, and fixed for at least 30 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stained in a solution containing 1% FBS, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer, and the data were analyzed using the CellQuest Pro software (both BD Biosciences). Purification of Polysomes—Cytoplasmic extract was prepared as described previously (9Gonda K. Wudel J. Nelson D. Katoku-Kikyo N. Reed P. Tamada H. Kikyo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from 1 × 107 HeLa cells transfected with control or NS siRNA. Polysomes were purified by sedimentation at 260,000 × g for 2.5 h through a sucrose cushion (1 m sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 units/ml RNasin) essentially as described previously (16Bommer U.A. Burkhardt N. Junemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 271-301Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2, and polysome concentration was evaluated by UV absorbance at 260 nm, which is a commonly used method to quantify ribosome concentration (16Bommer U.A. Burkhardt N. Junemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 271-301Google Scholar). In addition, the amounts of 18 and 28 S rRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR using a HotStart-IT SYBR Green One-Step quantitative RT-PCR kit (USB) and the primer pairs described above. Nuclear Run-on Assay for rRNA Synthesis—HeLa cells transfected with control and NS siRNA were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The lysed cells, called nuclei hereafter, were precipitated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 200 μl of cold storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol). The nuclei were then mixed with 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 0.1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction solution was supplemented with 600 μl of DNase solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 unit/μl RNase-free DNase) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. This step was followed by addition of 200 μl of proteinase K solution (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% SDS, 0.125 mm EDTA, and 0.1 μg/μl proteinase K) and incubation at 42 °C for 30 min. RNA was isolated from the reaction mixture using TRI reagent LS (Molecular Research Center) and hybridized to the 5′ half of the rDNA sequence provided by Dr. J. E. Sylvester (17Sylvester J.E. Whiteman D.A. Podolsky R. Pozsgay J.M. Respess J. Schmickel R.D. Hum. Genet. 1986; 73: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the control plasmid pcDNA3.1 with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). Hybridization signal was detected by autoradiography, and the radioactivity of each band was quantified by Cherenkov counting. Identification of NS-binding Proteins—To begin our investigation into the function of NS, we examined whether or not NS existed as a protein complex within cells by estimating the molecular mass of the possible NS-containing entity. For this purpose we applied whole cell extract prepared from HeLa S3 cells to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column and analyzed the elution pattern of NS by Western blotting. NS (62 kDa) was eluted in the fractions typical for proteins with molecular masses ranging from 200 kDa to over 2 MDa, with a major peak appearing between 700 kDa and 2 MDa (Fig. 1A, upper panel). This result suggested that NS potentially forms heterogeneous multi-protein complexes. To identify the binding partners of NS, we purified the NS complexes using the four steps of column chromatography outlined in Fig. 1B. Western blotting was performed after each step to detect fractions containing NS. When the NS-positive fractions obtained from the last column, Mono Q, were analyzed by gel filtration, the elution pattern of NS was similar to that observed for HeLa cell extract described above (Fig. 1A, lower panel). This observation indicated that our purification of NS had not resulted in significant disassembly of the NS complexes. SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the Mono Q fractions revealed more than 20 protein bands (Fig. 1C), and this number did not substantially decrease after additional steps of column chromatography (data not shown). Therefore, further purification of the NS complexes was not pursued, and prominent protein bands observed with the Mono Q fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins included five ribosomal subunits (RPS6, RPS8, RPS24, RPL13, and RPL14), a translation initiation factor (eIF2B1α), and three nucleolar proteins (DDX21, Pes1, and EBP2) in addition to NS itself (Fig. 1C). DDX21, Pes1, and EBP2 are involved in the late steps of pre-rRNA processing (see Fig. 4D). The RNA helicase DDX21 (also called RHII/Guα) is necessary for the processing of 20 S pre-rRNA into 18 S rRNA as well as for the stability of 28 S rRNA in Xenopus (18Yang H. Zhou J. Ochs R.L. Henning D. Jin R. Valdez B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38847-38859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human DDX21 has also been shown to be critical for the production of 28 and 18 S rRNA (19Henning D. So R.B. Jin R. Lau L.F. Valdez B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52307-52314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mammalian Pes1 is important for multiple steps of processing, including processing of 36, 32, and 12 S pre-rRNA (20Lapik Y.R. Fernandes C.J. Lau L.F. Pestov D.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A yeast orthologue of human EBP2 is involved in the processing of 27SA3 into 27SB pre-rRNA (corresponding to human 36 S into 32 S pre-rRNA) (21Huber M.D. Dworet J.H. Shire K. Frappier L. McAlear M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28764-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, the co-fractionation of DDX21, Pes1, and EBP2 with NS suggested a potential role for NS in pre-rRNA processing. We examined physical interactions between NS and the three proteins mentioned above by immunoprecipitation with antibody against NS. As shown by Western blotting, Pes1, DDX21, and EBP2 were all co-precipitated with anti-NS antibo"

Therefore, nutritional signals must inform the reproductive tissues, and cells that the organism has reached a nutritional status suitable for triggering reproductive processes. One of the possible pathways involved in anautogeny is the “target of rapamycin” (TOR) pathway, which has been described as connecting the nutritional status with growth, proliferation, and cancer. The German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is an anautogenous species whose vitellogenesis is governed by juvenile hormone. In the present report, we describe the cloning of TOR cDNA from B. germanica (BgTOR). Expression studies showed that BgTOR is expressed in adult female corpora allata and fat body. BgTOR knockdown using systemic RNAi in vivo produced a severe inhibition of juvenile hormone synthesis in adult female corpora allata, together with a reduction of mRNA levels corresponding to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase-1, HMG-CoA synthase-2, and HMG-CoA reductase. In addition, there was a reduction of vitellogenin mRNA in the fat body, and ovaries did not grow. Analysis of TOR expression in corpora allata of fed and starved females suggested that TOR is not regulated at the transcriptional level. Nevertheless, there was a reduction in HMG-CoA synthases and reductase mRNA in corpora allata (but not in the fat body) of starved females, together with a dramatic reduction of juvenile hormone production and ovary development. Taken together, our results indicate that TOR knockdown mimics starvation in terms of corpora allata activity, and suggest that nutritional signals that activate juvenile hormone biosynthesis and vitellogenin production are mediated by the TOR pathway.

How is food transformed into eggs? The answer is not easy, because it involves a myriad of factors, not only metabolic but also hormonal, connected to each other in a complex regulatory network. Good models to illuminate this subject might be anautogenous insects, first because insects are especially suitable for experimental manipulation, then because anautogenous species do not trigger reproductive processes until the female has taken a meal, which also facilitates experiments. In these species, there must be factors informing cells in tissues and organs related to reproduction that the animal has already fed, and these factors must belong to signaling pathways involved in sensing the nutritional status and in activating physiological processes, such as growth, cell proliferation, reproduction, and cancer. In this frame, a classical factor related to nutritional signaling is “target of rapamycin” (TOR). 4The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; JH, juvenile hormone; CA, corpora allata; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.4The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; JH, juvenile hormone; CA, corpora allata; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The present report describes our studies on the role of TOR in the transduction of nutritional signals into endocrine and reproductive output in the anautogenous insect Blattella germanica, whose reproductive processes are mainly governed by juvenile hormone (JH).The adult female of B. germanica, the German cockroach, undergoes marked reproductive cycles regulated by JH, a sesquiterpenoid hormone produced by the retrocerebral glands known as corpora allata (CA). In the fat body, JH induces the synthesis of vitellogenin (1Bellés X. Raikhel A.S. Reproductive Biology of Invertebrates. Science Publishers, Inc.2005: 157-197Google Scholar), which is the main precursor of egg yolk, which is released to the hemolymph and then incorporated to the growing oocytes. In adult females of B. germanica, JH biosynthesis shows a cyclic pattern, with a rapid increase shortly after the adult moult and a sudden decrease at oviposition time, remaining at low levels during the period of ootheca transport, after which a new gonadotrophic cycle is initiated (1Bellés X. Raikhel A.S. Reproductive Biology of Invertebrates. Science Publishers, Inc.2005: 157-197Google Scholar). B. germanica is a typical anautogenous species, and the female reproductive cycle starts only after feeding (2Osorio S. Piulachs M.D. Belles X. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 31-38Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Studies on the biosynthesis of JH have shown that the first steps of its biosynthetic pathway are common with those of the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol production. In this frame, the enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase and HMG-CoA reductase are key in the mevalonate pathway and in the synthesis of JH, and both have been cloned in B. germanica (3Belles X. Martin D. Piulachs M.D. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2005; 50: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).TOR is a S/T kinase reported in a variety of eukaryotic systems (4Baker K.D. Thummel C.S. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), which is activated in the presence of amino acids and has an essential role in regulating cell growth and size by modulating gene transcription, mRNA translation, and ribosomal biogenesis, among other cell processes (5Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Oldham S. Hafen E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The activation of the TOR pathway in Drosophila melanogaster produces an increase in cell size, whereas its repression leads to an inhibition of growth and cell proliferation (6Oldham S. Hafen E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Similarly, TOR is related to sensing amino acid levels, and its activation is required, for example, to synthesize vitellogenin in the mosquito Aedes aegypti (5Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Roy S.G. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20565-20572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exceptionally, the endocrinology of reproduction in D. melanogaster and A. aegypti, as in other dipterans, is governed by 20-hydroxyecdysone, whereas in most insects, including cockroaches, the gonadotrophic hormone is JH.As a first step to study the link between nutrition and reproduction, and to clarify how nutritional signals may led to JH production and activation of reproductive processes, we have analyzed TOR expression and function in adult females of B. germanica.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInsects—Specimens of B. germanica (L.) were from a colony reared on dog chow and water, at 30 ± 1 °C and 60–70% rh. Dissections of CA and abdominal fat body were carried out on carbon dioxide-anesthetized specimens. Fat body tissue adhered to the abdominal sternites was dissected out, except in the case of incubations in vitro, where fat body together with the abdominal sternites and epidermis was used. For starvation experiments, animals received only water after the adult moult. Fed controls in these experiments and animals from all other treatments were fed ad libitum with dog chow and water.Cloning of BgTOR cDNA—Degenerate primers based on conserved regions of insect and vertebrate TOR sequences were used to obtain a B. germanica homologue cDNA fragment by RT-PCR. The first PCR amplification was carried out using cDNA generated by reverse transcription from RNA from UM-BGE-1 cells (derived from early embryos of B. germanica) as template, as described (8Maestro O. Cruz J. Pascual N. Martin D. Belles X. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2005; 238: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. We amplified a 176-bp fragment, which was subcloned into the pSTBlue-1 vector (Novagen) and sequenced. This was followed by 3′-RACE and several 5′-RACEs (5′- and 3′-RACE System Version 2.0; Invitrogen) using different specific primers to complete the sequence. As templates, we used again cDNA from UM-BGE-1 cells. PCR products were subcloned into the pSTBlue-1 vector and sequenced in both directions.Phylogenetic Analyses—We used the following sequences: from the insects D. melanogaster (GenBank™ Accession Number: NP524891), D. pseudoobscura (XP001355903), A. aegypti (AAR97336), Anopheles gambiae (XP317619), Tribolium castaneum (XP971819), Nasonia vitripennis (XP001602345), Apis mellifera (XP625130), and B. germanica (EU926975); the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Q95Q95); the vertebrates Danio rerio (NP001070679), Gallus gallus (XP417614), Homo sapiens (NP004949), Mus musculus (NP064393), and Rattus norvegicus (NP063971); and the protein TOR1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP012600). The tree was rooted using the Arabidopsis thaliana sequence (NP175425) as outgroup. Protein sequences were aligned using ClustlX (9Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar). Poorly aligned positions and divergent regions were eliminated using Gblocks 0.91b (10Castresana J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (7112) Google Scholar), which resulted in 2022 final positions. The obtained alignment was analyzed by the PHYML program (11Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14047) Google Scholar), based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Four substitution rate categories optimizing the gamma shape parameter were used. The data sets were bootstrapped for 100 replicates.RT-PCR/Southern Blot Analyses—RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting was used to determine mRNA expression patterns. cDNA was synthesized from RNA as previously described (12Maestro J.L. Belles X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2006; 62: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription in the case of fat body, whereas in the case of CA, the whole RNA from one or two glands was used. To estimate mRNA levels semi-quantitatively, a non-saturating number of cycles in the PCR system were used. Primer sequences to amplify BgTOR, vitellogenin, HMG-CoA synthase-1, and HMG-CoA synthase-2, HMG-CoA reductase, and Actin 5C (used as a reference) are available upon request. cDNA probes for Southern blot analyses were generated by PCR with the same primer pairs and labeled with fluorescein, using the Gene Images random prime-labeling module (Amersham Biosciences) (13Mane-Padros D. Cruz J. Vilaplana L. Pascual N. Belles X. Martin D. Dev. Biol. 2008; 315: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting of total RNA without reverse transcription did not result in amplification, indicating that there was no genomic contamination.RNA Interference—Systemic RNAi in vivo in females of B. germanica was performed as previously described (12Maestro J.L. Belles X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2006; 62: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two different fragments, a 506-bp dsRNA fragment (dsTOR) and a 547-bp fragment (dsTOR II), spanning positions 4257 to 4762 and 2071 to 2617, respectively, of the BgTOR cDNA, were used to generate two different dsRNA. As a control, a non-coding sequence of 92 bp from the pSTBlue-1 vector (dsControl) was used. A dose of 2 μg of dsRNA diluted in sterile saline was injected into the abdomen of females that had just moulted into fifth nymphal instar, and again when they moulted into sixth (last) instar. Dissections were carried out 5 days after the adult moult. In another set of RNAi experiments, and following an approach designed by O. Maestro and D. Martín, 5Unpublished data. adult females in the first day of ootheca transport were treated with a single 2-μg dsRNA dose. Twelve days later, the ootheca was removed, which induced the onset of the second gonadotrophic cycle, and dissections were made 5 days later. BgTOR, vitellogenin, and Actin 5C mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR using appropriate primers (sequences available upon request).Real-time PCR analyses—The CA and fat body expression levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 and -2, HMG-CoA reductase, BgTOR, and Actin 5C from the RNAi and starvation experiments were analyzed using real-time PCR. cDNA was obtained as described above. cDNA levels in the different samples were quantified by using iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) in an iQ cycler and iQ single color detection system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences to amplify HMG-CoA synthase-1 and -2, HMG-CoA reductase, BgTOR, and Actin 5C (used as a reference), are available upon request. Total reaction volume was 20 μl. All reactions were run in duplicate or triplicate. The program used to amplify the reaction was as follows: (i) 95 °C for 3 min; (ii) 95 °C for 10 s; (iii) 60 °C for 1 min (fluorescence recorded); and (iv) repeat to step ii for 50 cycles. Real-time data were collected by iQ5 optical system software v. 2.0 (Bio-Rad).Quantification of JH Synthesis and Cell Number in the CA—JH III synthesis by CA incubated in vitro was quantified according to the method previously reported (14Piulachs M.D. Couillaud F. J. Insect Physiol. 1992; 38: 555-560Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Essentially, individual pairs of CA were incubated in 100 μl of TC 199 medium (Flow) containing l-methionine (0.1 nm), Hank's salts, Hepes buffer (20 mm) plus Ficoll (20 mg/ml), to which l-[3H-methyl]-methionine (Amersham Biosciences) had been added, to achieve a final specific activity of 7.4 GBq/mmol. CA were incubated for 2 h, after which JH III was quantified in the medium plus homogenized glands. Total cell number of a single corpus allatum was determined by hemocytometric sampling, as previously described (15Chiang A.-S. Tsai W.-H. Holbrook G.L. Schal C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 299-313Crossref Google Scholar).Incubation of Fat Body in Vitro—Fat body tissue adhered to abdominal tergites and epidermis was dissected from freshly emerged adult females. Fat body tissue was then incubated in 1 ml of Grace's medium, with l-glutamine and without insect hemolymph (Sigma) at 30 °C in the dark, as previously described (16Cruz J. Mane-Padros D. Belles X. Martin D. Dev. Biol. 2006; 297: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was incubated for 4 h with 500 nm rapamycin or the same volume of DMSO (the rapamycin solvent), and then transferred to a medium containing, in addition to the previous treatment, 800 nm JH III or the same volume of acetone (the JH solvent) and incubated for another 4-h period. After the incubation, tissue was frozen in liquid N2 and stored until RT/PCR Southern blot analysis.RESULTSCloning of BgTOR, Sequence Comparison, and Phylogenetic Analysis—Using degenerate primers and cDNA from UM-BGE 1 cells as template, a 176-bp fragment of a presumed TOR homologue of B. germanica (BgTOR) was obtained. To complete the cDNA sequence, we followed 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE methods, and we obtained a sequence of 7921 bp (GenBank™ accession number EU926975), which encoded a protein of 2470 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 280.6 kDa. The putative start codon was preceded by an in-frame stop codon and the final stop codon was followed by a poly(A) sequence, suggesting that it was a full-length ORF. BLAST data base search indicated that the protein was the B. germanica homologue of TOR. The amino acid sequence is remarkably conserved, showing high percentages of identity with respect to other TOR proteins, like that of Apis mellifera (80% identity), Tribolium castaneum (67%), D. melanogaster (59%), or H. sapiens (61%). BgTOR shows the typical organization of TOR proteins, containing N-terminal HEAT repeats, followed by a FAT domain, a rapamycin-FKBP12-binding domain, a kinase domain, and a C terminus FATC region (17Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar).Maximum-likelihood analysis including the BgTOR sequence and other representative TOR sequences available in databases, gave the tree shown in Fig. 1. Using A. thaliana TOR as outgroup, the topology of the tree closely matches the current phylogeny of the included species, and indicates that the B. germanica sequence corresponds to a TOR protein, being the first TOR sequence obtained from a hemimetabolous insect. The long branch length corresponding to C. elegans TOR suggests a rapid rate of divergence with respect to other Metazoa. The tree also shows that vertebrates cluster in a node separated from insects, and that vertebrate branches are remarkably short, thus indicating the great conservation of these sequences, whereas insect branches show intermediate lengths.Expression Patterns of BgTOR and Other mRNAs Related to Reproductive Processes—mRNA levels of BgTOR and other transcripts related to reproductive processes were studied in CA and fat body of adult females throughout the first gonadotrophic cycle. We used semi-quantitative RT/PCR followed by Southern blot, and results showed that BgTOR mRNA levels in the CA were practically constant throughout the gonadotrophic cycle (Fig. 2). As expected, mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 and HMG-CoA reductase, two key enzymes in the JH biosynthetic pathway, showed a pattern resembling that of JH production (1Bellés X. Raikhel A.S. Reproductive Biology of Invertebrates. Science Publishers, Inc.2005: 157-197Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The pattern of HMG-CoA synthase-2 was similar to that of HMG-CoA synthase-1 (results not shown). As in the CA, levels of BgTOR mRNA in the fat body showed a practically constant pattern. In the fat body, expression of vitellogenin was activated 1 day after the adult moult, and reached full mRNA levels at mid vitellogenesis (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Expression patterns of BgTOR mRNA compared with other transcripts in the CA and the fat body of B. germanica adult females. mRNA levels of BgTOR, HMG-CoA synthase-1, HMG-CoA reductase, and vitellogenin were analyzed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR/Southern-blot in CA and fat body during the 7 days of the first gonadotrophic cycle. Actin 5C levels were used as a reference. Blots shown are representative of 3–5 replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of BgTOR RNAi—To study the function of BgTOR, its expression was lowered using systemic RNAi. A dose of 2 μgof a 506-bp dsRNA fragment encompassing part of the FAT domain (dsTOR, Fig. 3A) was injected into the abdomen of freshly emerged fifth (penultimate) instar female nymphs, and the treatment was repeated after the next moult (BgTOR RNAi group). Specimens treated equivalently with a nonspecific dsRNA were used as negative controls (control group). RNAi-mediated BgTOR knockdown females moulted normally into the sixth nymphal instar and later into adults. Differences between both treatments were examined 5 days after the adult moult.FIGURE 3Effect of BgTOR RNAi in the CA, fat body, and ovaries of B. germanica. dsRNA targeting BgTOR (dsTOR) or a nonspecific dsRNA (dsControl) were administered in freshly emerged penultimate instar nymphs and again when they moulted into last instar. Dissections were carried out 5 days after the adult moult. mRNA levels were studied using semi-quantitative RT-PCR/Southern-blot. Actin 5C levels were used as a reference.

Importantly, JH synthesis by the CA from BgTOR knockdown females was dramatically reduced with respect to that measured in controls (Fig. 3C). Given that TOR has been related to growth and developmental processes, we considered the possibility that low JH production in the females treated with dsTOR might be due to disfunctions related to cell proliferation in the CA. However, cell quantification in 5-day-old females showed that the CA from the BgTOR RNAi group had practically the same number of cells than CA from the control group (Fig. 3D).Interestingly, total RNA extracted from the abdominal fat body was significantly lower in the BgTOR RNAi group than in the control group (2.23 ± 0.51 μg, n = 5, versus 6.74 ± 0.89 μg, n = 5; p = 0.0023, Student's t test). Conversely, total protein levels were higher in the BgTOR RNAi group than in controls (576.1 ± 110.0 μg, n = 4, versus 257.7 ± 24.3 μg, n = 6; p = 0.0086, Student's t test). As observed in the CA, fat body tissues from BgTOR knockdown animals had lower levels of BgTOR mRNA than in controls (Fig. 3E). Moreover, a clear reduction in vitellogenin mRNA was observed in the knockdown group with respect to the control group (Fig. 3E). Consequently, whereas ovaries from the control group grew and developed normally, those from the BgTOR RNAi group did not grow at all and the basal oocytes were as small as those of freshly emerged adult females (Fig. 3F).Effects of BgTOR RNAi on HMG-CoA Synthase and HMG-CoA Reductase—HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase are considered key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway and for JH synthesis (3Belles X. Martin D. Piulachs M.D. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2005; 50: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Given that BgTOR RNAi treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction of JH production, we studied the knockdown effects on the expression of HMG-CoA synthase-1 and -2 (18Buesa C. Martinez-Gonzalez J.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in CA and fat body. In this case, we were interested not only in the mere modification of mRNA levels, but also in the relative contribution of each of these enzymes in both tissues. Consequently, we quantified the mRNA levels with real-time quantitative PCR. We used CA and fat body tissues from 5-day-old control and BgTOR RNAi groups, and data were normalized by measuring mRNA levels of Actin 5C.CA from the BgTOR RNAi group showed a significant decrease (77%) of BgTOR mRNA levels, concomitant with a marked decrease of mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 (80%), -2 (73%), and HMG-CoA reductase (59%) (Fig. 4, upper panel). In the fat body, mRNA levels of BgTOR were also significantly reduced (89%), in parallel with those of HMG-CoA synthase-2 (62%) and HMG-CoA reductase (42%); mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 in the BgTOR knockdown animals did not differ significantly from controls (Fig. 4, lower panel). Results also indicated that in CA from controls, the mRNA for the three enzymes showed similar levels, whereas in the fat body, mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-2 were twice of those of HMG-CoA synthase-1 and HMG-CoA reductase. Moreover, relative mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1, -2, and HMG-CoA reductase are around 30-fold higher in the CA than in the fat body (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Effect of BgTOR RNAi on mRNA levels of enzymes of the mevalonate pathway and BgTOR in CA and fat body of B. germanica. dsRNA targeting BgTOR (dsTOR) or a nonspecific dsRNA (dsControl) were administered in freshly emerged penultimate instar nymphs and again when they moulted into the last instar. Dissections were made 5 days after the adult moult. Results show mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1, -2, HMG-CoA reductase, and BgTOR in CA (upper panel) and fat body (lower panel) quantified by real-time PCR analysis. White and solid bars indicate dsControl and dsTOR treatments, respectively. Y-axis indicates copies per copy of Actin 5C. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n = 4–5).

For example, the basal oocyte did not grow in dsTOR II-treated females, with length values significantly lower than in controls at day 5 of adult life (control group: 1.37 ± 0.11 mm, n = 13; dsTOR II-treated group: 0.43 ± 0.01 mm, (n = 12); t test p < 0.0001). BgTOR mRNA levels in the CA from dsTOR II-treated females were quantified with real-time quantitative PCR, and results indicated that they were significantly lower (77%) than in controls. Moreover, the effects of dsTOR II treatment were studied in the CA in terms of expression of the enzymes regulating JH synthesis. Results indicated that dsTOR II-treated females showed a significant decrease of mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 (82%), -2 (80%), and HMG-CoA reductase (78%) (n = 3 in all cases).BgTOR RNAi in Adult Females—The treatment with dsTOR in last instar nymphs inhibited JH synthesis in the adult CA, but did not reduce the cell number in these glands. However, the possibility that reduced TOR levels had affected some process of CA development linked to the transition from nymph to adult, still remained. Thus, to see whether the effects of TOR knockdown upon the synthesis of JH are specific and independent of the metamorphic moult, we carried out RNAi experiments in the adult. Thus, a dose of 2 μg of dsTOR was injected in adult females at the first day of ootheca transport, whereas specimens treated equivalently with the nonspecific dsRNA served as negative controls. Then a second gonadotrophic cycle was induced by removing the ootheca 12 days later. At day 5 of this second cycle, BgTOR mRNA levels in the RNAi group were clearly lower than in controls (Fig. 5A), and production of JH in the TOR interfered animals was dramatically reduced (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the results were similar to those obtained with the specimens treated as nymphs and analyzed in the first gonadotrophic cycle (Fig. 3).FIGURE 5Effect of BgTOR RNAi on adult females of B. germanica. dsRNA targeting BgTOR (dsTOR) or a nonspecific dsRNA (dsControl) were administered in adult females at the first day of ootheca transport.

Here we report additional crystal structures of as-isolated, functional xanthine oxidase in the course of reaction with the pterin substrate lumazine at 2.2 Å resolution and of the nonfunctional desulfo form of the enzyme in complex with xanthine at 2.6 Å resolution. In both cases the orientation of substrate is such that the pyrimidine subnucleus is oriented opposite to that seen with the slow substrate 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine. The mechanistic implications as to how the ensemble of active site functional groups in the active site work to accelerate reaction rate are discussed.

Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) 3The abbreviations used are: XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; HMP, 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine. is a molybdenum-containing enzyme that is the prototypical member of the molybdenum hydroxylase family of proteins (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 2Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It is one of four molybdenum-containing enzymes encoded by the human genome and catalyzes the sequential hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Under normal physiological circumstances the enzyme is thought to be present as a dehydrogenase (XDH) but can be readily converted to an oxidase (XO) by the oxidation of sulfhydryl residues or by limited proteolysis (3Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). XDH shows a preference for NAD+ as the oxidizing substrate (although it is also able to react with O2), whereas XO cannot react with NAD+ and can only use O2; both forms generate significant amounts of both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide when reacting with O2 (3Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Conversion of XDH to XO is thought to play a role in ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with heart attack and stroke (4Nishino T. Okamoto K. Kawaguchi Y. Hori H. Matsumura T. Eger B.T. Pai E.F.

Rev. 2006; 58: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 7Berry C.E. Hare J.M. J. Physiol. 2004; 3: 589-606Crossref Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Bovine xanthine oxidase is a 290-kDa homodimer, with each independently acting monomer possessing a molybdenum center at which the oxidative hydroxylation of substrates takes place. Hydroxylation of substrate results in the two-electron reduction of the molybdenum center from Mo(VI) to Mo(IV). Following the initial reduction of the Mo, electrons are passed via two [2Fe-2S] clusters to an FAD cofactor, at which reducing equivalents pass out of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the bovine enzyme has been determined previously (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), showing that the four redox-active centers of each monomer are found in separate domains of the polypeptide. The molybdenum center possesses a square-pyramidal coordination geometry with an apical Mo=O group and as shown in Fig. 1 can be formulated as LMoVIOS(OH), with L being a bidentate enedithiolate ligand contributed by a unique pyranopterin cofactor that is common to all molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes (with the exception of nitrogenase) (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). The now generally accepted mechanism of XOR begins with proton abstraction from the Mo-OH group by an active site glutamate that is universally conserved in the molybdenum hydroxylase family of enzymes (9Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This is followed by nucleophilic attack of the resulting Mo-O- unit on the carbon center to be hydroxylated with concomitant hydride transfer to the Mo=S of the molybdenum center (Fig. 1). The reaction yields an intermediate that can be represented as LMoIV(SH)(OR), with OR being the now hydroxylated product coordinated to the molybdenum via the newly introduced hydroxyl group. Catalysis is completed by displacement of the bound product from the molybdenum coordination sphere by hydroxide from solvent water, electron transfer out of the molybdenum center to the flavin site, and deprotonation of the MoIV-SH to give the original oxidized LMoVIOS(OH) form of the molybdenum center. The relative rates of product displacement on the one hand and electron transfer from the molybdenum center to the other redox-active centers on the other is dependent on the particular substrate being hydroxylated and also the pH. When electron transfer takes place prior to product dissociation, a transient LMoVS(OR) species is generated that gives rise to the well characterized “very rapid” EPR signal (10Bray R.C. Vänngard T. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Bray R.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 21: 299-329Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition to the glutamate residue that is thought to function as a general base, the active sites of all xanthine-utilizing enzymes (but not those otherwise related enzymes that act on aldehyde substrates) have a conserved arginine residue, Arg-310 in the numbering for XDH from Rhodobacter capsulatus, Arg-880 in the bovine enzyme (12Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkühler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This distal residue is positioned some 10 Å from the molybdenum center, on the opposite side of bound substrate to the molybdenum center, and presumably too far to participate directly in catalysis. In the structure of the R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase with the mechanism-based inhibitor alloxanthine, Arg-310 is hydrogen-bonded to the pyrimidine subnucleus of the heterocycle via the C-6 carbonyl group of the inhibitor (equivalent to the C-2 of xanthine and other purines, given the different numbering system in the two classes of heterocycles), as shown in Fig. 2. In previous work we have shown that the distal Arg-310 of the R. capsulatus enzyme contributes at least 4.5 kcal/mol toward transition state stabilization; its mutation to methionine results in a 2 × 104-fold decrease in reaction rate with xanthine as substrate (13Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A comparable effect is seen with the human enzyme (14Yamaguchi Y. Matsumura T. Ichida K. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have suggested that this distal arginine lowers the activation energy for the reaction by stabilizing the negative charge that accumulates on the heterocycle in the course of nucleophilic attack via an electrostatic interaction with the C-6 carbonyl oxygen of substrate. We have also examined the reaction of wild-type and R310M mutants of the R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase with a homologous series of purine substrates (13Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Those that are effective substrates of the wild-type enzyme were strongly affected by mutation of Arg-310 to methionine, whereas those that react slowly with wild-type enzyme were much less affected by the mutation. Noting that all the good substrates possessed a carbonyl or thio group at C-6, whereas poor substrates did not, we concluded that poor substrates bound in an inverted orientation relative to that of xanthine and other good substrates and were unable to utilize Arg-310 for transition state stabilization. We suggested that this inverted orientation accounted for both the low intrinsic reactivity of the poor substrates with wild-type enzyme and also their relative insensitivity to loss of the arginine (13Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have recently reported the crystal structure of bovine xanthine oxidase in the course of the reaction with the poor substrate 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine (HMP) (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 3B9J), in which the bound HMP molecule is clearly oriented with the C-2 rather than the C-6 position oriented toward Arg-880 (in an orientation analogous to that seen with the inhibitor alloxanthine). This work also showed strong electron density (in one of the two active sites in the asymmetric unit) between the planar Mo-O and the C-8 position of the HMP; thus this structure showed the orientation of a true catalytic intermediate. To further test our hypothesis regarding substrate orientation and to gain further insight into the function of the catalytic machinery of xanthine oxidase, we have here determined the x-ray crystal structures of functional bovine xanthine oxidase with the pteridine substrate lumazine, as well as the inactive desulfo form of the enzyme in complex with xanthine. In both cases, the orientation of substrate is such that the pyrimidine subnucleus is oriented opposite to that seen with the poor substrate HMP and the inhibitor alloxanthine (bound to reduced enzyme), consistent the proposed role of Arg-880 in catalysis. The implications regarding the function of the catalytic machinery of the enzyme are discussed. Materials-Magnetic bases for use with the automated express crystallography system at SGX-CAT were obtained from Rayonix (Evanston, IL). Mounted cryoloops, magnetic cryovials, and crystal growth materials were obtained from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA). All of the chemicals and reagents were obtained at the highest quality/purity available from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher and were used without further purification. Isolation of Xanthine Oxidase-Xanthine oxidase was isolated from fresh, unpasteurized bovine milk (Waterman Farm, The Ohio State University or Scott Brothers Dairy, Chino, CA) according to published methods (16Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The milk was obtained from a single animal, so as to minimize any heterogeneity in the qualities and characteristics of the isolated protein. Isolated enzyme was stored in N2(l) and passed down a Sephadex G-25 column to remove salicylate prior to use. Crystallization, Data Acquisition, and Structure Determination-For the structure of xanthine oxidase with lumazine, crystals were grown via the batch method according to previously published methods using microbridges to hold the batch solutions in the sealed wells of a 24-well tray (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The batch solutions contained 20 μl of a 10 mg/ml (34.5 μm) enzyme solution mixed with 10 μl of the precipitant solution (see further below). To obtain the structure of xanthine oxidase with xanthine, the enzyme had to first be inactivated by replacing the planar Mo=S with a second Mo=O by reaction with cyanide, as shown in Fig. 1 (17Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, enzyme stocks were incubated on ice for 1 h with 0.1 m KCN. The concentrated enzyme was then passed down a Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess cyanide. After initial attempts to obtain the structure using synchrotron radiation indicated dissociation of the dimer into separate monomers, we decided to treat the cyanolyzed enzyme with 10 mm oxidized glutathione. After removal of excess reagent by G-25 chromatography, the enzyme was used for crystal growth according to previous methods (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The batch solutions contained 10 μl of the enzyme solution and 5 μl of the precipitant solution. The final conditions for optimal crystal growth with both lumazine and xanthine were a precipitant solution of 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m potassium phosphate at initial pH 6.5, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The enzyme solution contained 10 mg/ml XO in 40 mm Tris-HCl, initial pH 7.8, 20 mm pyrophosphate, initial pH 8.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The enzyme solution was allowed to sit on ice for 1 h following the addition of dithiothreitol, prior to beginning the construction of the well solutions. The final pH of the well solutions was 7.2 ± 0.1. The crystals grew after 2-3 days at 25 °C in darkness. XO crystals grew in the form of rectangular plates, which ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in their longest dimension. A 42% polyethylene glycol 200 solution at pH 8.0 for lumazine or 8.3-8.4 for xanthine containing all proportions of the enzyme and precipitant solutions was used as the cryoprotectant solution. This was introduced by buffer exchanges of 2 μl using a micropipette. Following an exchange of volume greater than the original batch volume, the substrate (xanthine at 33.3 mm and lumazine at 10 mm in the same cryoprotectant solution) was introduced from stock solutions to give either a 10 mm concentration of xanthine or a 1 mm concentration of lumazine in the new well solution. The crystals were mounted and frozen after 1-5 min. Final diffraction data were collected at Argonne National Laboratory on the SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. beamline using a wavelength of 0.9793 Å and a MARCCD 165 detector. Data sets were collected at 2.2 Å resolution for the XO-lumazine complex and 2.6 Å for the desulfo-XO-xanthine complex. The data were processed using the MOSFLM package of the CCP4 program suite (18Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 19Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The structure of the enzyme was determined by molecular replacement using the MOLREP package of CCP4, with Protein Data Bank code 1FIQ as the search model (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Following rigid body refinement in REFMAC of the CCP4 suite, the structure was refined using the restrained refinement protocol in REFMAC (20Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. The Refinement of Protein Structures. Proceedings of Daresbury Study Weekend, Daresbury, UK1996Google Scholar, 21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). The weighting term for geometric restraints was adjusted in REFMAC to minimize Rcryst while at the same time minimizing the difference between Rcryst and Rfree. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints (set on “tight” in REFMAC) were used between the monomers of each respective homodimer in refining the structure of the desulfo enzyme, because this also minimized the divergence between Rcryst and Rfree. The lumazine and xanthine molecules were constructed using the PRODRG2 server (25Schuettelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar), and the respective Protein Data Bank codes were built into the corresponding 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc omit electron density maps observed in the XO active sites using COOT (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Following the merging of the substrates with the respectively refined XO structures, the resulting structures were refined again using restrained refinement in REFMAC. Water molecules were subsequently added to the XO-lumazine electron density maps prior to the addition of the lumazine molecules. All of the images were rendered using PyMol (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Overall Structure of Xanthine Oxidase with Lumazine-The overall structure seen in the present XO-lumazine complex was very similar to that seen previously for the oxidized enzyme (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and the complex with HMP (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, the space group was again P21, and the unit cell dimensions and structure factors were comparable with our previous structure (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As before, the asymmetric unit contained one dimer, and the unit cell was monoclinic. The overall dimensions of the unit cell were a = 133.2 Å, b = 73.5 Å, and c = 146.5 Å with angles of 90, 98.7, and 90 degrees. As in the case of our previous crystal form with bound HMP (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), in one subunit of the asymmetric unit, electron density for residues 1316-1328 (disordered in the search model used for molecular replacement) became apparent in the electron density map of our final structure. As also seen previously (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this electron density was rather poorer in quality than throughout the remainder of the map. In addition, after refinement three of the 13 residues in this region were found to assume Ramachandran “disallowed” configurations. As discussed previously (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), given that this additional electron density was manifestly evident in the map, we felt obligated to model it to the best of our ability, and such residues were included in the statistical analysis (below). Still, we emphasize that our confidence in this (very limited) region is somewhat lower than throughout the model at large.TABLE 1Statistics for data collection and refinementStatisticsXO with lumazineDesulfo-XO with xanthineXO with bound HMP (15Pauff J.M.

All of the cofactors in the two subunits of the asymmetric unit were accounted for by both the refined electron density maps and those following omission of the cofactors. The root mean square displacements for the α-carbons of each monomer in the final refined structure of the present complex with lumazine relative to that of oxidized enzyme (Protein Data Bank accession number 1FIQ) were 0.366 and 0.338 Å, respectively (as compared with 0.345 and 0.340 Å for our structure with bound HMP). The relative orientations and distances between the redox-active centers was essentially identical to those reported previously (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The final R factors for the XO-lumazine structure were an Rcryst of 19.7% and an Rfree of 26.7% (Table 1), comparable with our previous results with the complex of xanthine oxidase with HMP (Rcryst, 19.4%; Rfree, 26.3%; Table 1). The mean B factor for the structure was 29.5 Å2, as compared with 22.7 Å2 seen with the HMP complex (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran statistics and structure factors of the structure with lumazine were also very similar to our previous structure of the enzyme complexed with HMP (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Again, disallowed residues were largely scattered at random throughout the >2500-residue dimer, although in all of the cases the residues were located on the surface of the protein in regions of weaker electron density. Also, as with our structure with HMP (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the limazine structure described above, the model for the additional residues 1316-1328 in the one monomer resulted in several disallowed orientations. Again, these residues were included in the statistical analysis, given the clear positive density that was present in the electron density map. Still, including the residues in this small, poorly defined region, only 0.7% of all amino acid residues fell in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. A MolProbity report on the structure yielded a score of 2.69 with a Clashscore of 17.59 following the addition of hydrogens (28Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar). These metrics compare favorably with those for our previous structure with HMP (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which had a MolProbity report of 2.66 and Clashscore of 17.58. These values, particularly the MolProbity scores, must be understood in the context of the particularly large size of the dimer in the asymmetric unit (290 kDa) as compared with the mean size of the cohort of structures at comparable resolution and are taken to reflect an acceptable quality of the model here for the structure with lumazine. Overall Structure of Desulfo Xanthine Oxidase with Xanthine-The structure of the desulfo enzyme with xanthine proved considerably more difficult to obtain. The initial data sets were of low resolution and completeness, and the molecular replacement solution showed that the dimer had dissociated into monomers having little other than crystallographic contacts. However, treatment of the cyanolyzed enzyme with oxidized glutathione resulted in triclinic crystals of space group P1 that had two dimers in the asymmetric unit. An asymmetric unit containing two enzyme molecules has precedent in previous structures of XOR (12Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkühler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and thus we proceeded to process the data set from 33.7 to 2.6 Å despite a rather low completeness of 73% over that resolution range. The unit cell dimensions for the desulfo structure were a = 73.30 Å, b = 133.18 Å, and c = 142.63 Å with angles of 96.9, 93.1, and 90.0 degrees (Table 1). As was the case for our structures of enzyme in complex with HMP and lumazine, one monomer of each dimer displayed positive density for previously disordered residues. These were residues 1316-1324 and 1316-1326, of the two dimers. Again, all cofactors in the two dimers of the asymmetric unit were accounted for by both the refined electron density maps and those following omission of the cofactors, and again the overall protein fold was essentially identical to that seen previously. The α-carbon root mean square xyz displacements of the four monomers in our asymmetric unit as compared with the 1FIQ search model were 0.314, 0.299, 0.291, and 0.300 Å, somewhat better than our structures with bound lumazine or HMP. The final R factors for the desulfo-XO-xanthine structure were Rcryst of 21.4% and an Rfree of 26.5%, comparable with the values seen with the HMP- and lumazine-bound structures (Table 1). Ramachandran statistics and structure factors were comparable with our previous structures, with 0.6% of all residues lying in Ramachandran-disallowed geometries, three of these again in the rather poorly defined region 1316-1326 (15Pauff J.M. Zhang J. Bell C.E. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The MolProbity report for our structure of the desulfo enzyme/xanthine complex gave a score of 2.57 and a Clashscore of 15.81. These metrics placed our structure of the xanthine complex in the 78th and 88th percentiles, respectively, of all structures at comparable resolution. The mean B factor for this structure was very low at 13.9 Å2, an apparent manifestation of the incompleteness of the data set; there was no manipulation of TLS parameters in the refinement process, for example, that might lowered the B factor. We note that the average B factor as determined from a Wilson plot, was a more reasonable 27.3 Å2. Lumazine and Xanthine Bound in the Active Site of Xanthine Oxidase-Fig. 3 shows the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc omit density maps for the structure of the lumazine complex, contoured at 1.0 and 3.0 σ, respectively, in both active sites of the asymmetric unit. It is clearly evident that the C-4 carbonyl (i.e. the proximal carbonyl, equivalent to C-6 in xanthine given the changed numbering pattern for pteridines relative to purines) is oriented toward Arg-880, with the distal C-2 carbonyl (equivalent to C-2 in purines) directed away from this residue. This orientation of the pyrimidine subnucleus is opposit"
https://openalex.org/W2052606946,"Background Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder. In order to dissect the genetic background several linkage and genetic association studies have been performed. Yet very little is known about specific genes involved in this complex skin disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Methodology/Findings We used human DNA microarrays to identify a molecular picture of the programmed responses of the human genome to AE. The transcriptional program was analyzed in skin biopsy samples from lesional and patch-tested skin from AE patients sensitized to Malassezia sympodialis (M. sympodialis), and corresponding biopsies from healthy individuals. The most notable feature of the global gene-expression pattern observed in AE skin was a reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. The overall transcriptional response in M. sympodialis patch-tested AE skin was similar to the gene-expression signature identified in lesional AE skin. In the constellation of genes differentially expressed in AE skin compared to healthy control skin, we have identified several potential susceptibility genes that may play a critical role in the pathological condition of AE. Many of these genes, including genes with a role in immune responses, lipid homeostasis, and epidermal differentiation, are localized on chromosomal regions previously linked to AE. Conclusions/Significance Through genome-wide expression profiling, we were able to discover a distinct reciprocal expression pattern of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes in skin from AE patients.

https://openalex.org/W2158419503,"Background Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, is increased in response to inflammation and some infections, but the in vivo role of hepcidin, particularly in children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is unclear. We investigated the relationships between hepcidin, cytokines and iron status in a pediatric population with a high prevalence of both anemia and co-morbid infections. Methodology/Principal Findings African refugee children <16 years were consecutively recruited at the initial post-resettlement health check with 181 children meeting inclusion criteria. Data on hematological parameters, cytokine levels and co-morbid infections (Helicobacter pylori, helminth and malaria) were obtained and urinary hepcidin assays performed. The primary outcome measure was urinary hepcidin levels in children with and without iron deficiency (ID) and/or ID anaemia (IDA). The secondary outcome measures included were the relationship between co-morbid infections and (i) ID and IDA, (ii) urinary hepcidin levels and (iii) cytokine levels. IDA was present in 25/181 (13.8%). Children with IDA had significantly lower hepcidin levels (IDA median hepcidin 0.14 nmol/mmol Cr (interquartile range 0.05–0.061) versus non-IDA 2.96 nmol/mmol Cr, (IQR 0.95–6.72), p<0.001). Hemoglobin, log-ferritin, iron, mean cell volume (MCV) and transferrin saturation were positively associated with log-hepcidin levels (log-ferritin beta coefficient (β): 1.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.57) and transferrin was inversely associated (β: −0.12, 95% CI −0.15 to −0.08). Cytokine levels (including IL-6) and co-morbid infections were not associated with IDA or hepcidin levels. Conclusions/Significance This is the largest pediatric study of the in vivo associations between hepcidin, iron status and cytokines. Gastro-intestinal infections (H. pylori and helminths) did not elevate urinary hepcidin or IL-6 levels in refugee children, nor were they associated with IDA. Longitudinal and mechanistic studies of IDA will further elucidate the role of hepcidin in paediatric iron regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2111927824,"The central resource processed by the sensorimotor system of an organism is information. We propose an information-based quantity that allows one to characterize the efficiency of the perception-action loop of an abstract organism model. It measures the potential of the organism to imprint information on the environment via its actuators in a way that can be recaptured by its sensors, essentially quantifying the options available and visible to the organism. Various scenarios suggest that such a quantity could identify the preferred direction of evolution or adaptation of the sensorimotor loop of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2076924960,"Rab2 requires glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and atypical protein kinase Ciota (aPKCiota) for retrograde vesicle formation from vesicular tubular clusters that sort secretory cargo from recycling proteins returned to the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the precise role of GAPDH and aPKCiota in the early secretory pathway is unclear. GAPDH was the first glycolytic enzyme reported to co-purify with microtubules (MTs). Similarly, aPKC associates directly with MTs. To learn whether Rab2 also binds directly to MTs, a MT binding assay was performed. Purified Rab2 was found in a MT-enriched pellet only when both GAPDH and aPKCiota were present, and Rab2-MT binding could be prevented by a recombinant fragment made to the Rab2 amino terminus (residues 2-70), which directly interacts with GAPDH and aPKCiota. Because GAPDH binds to the carboxyl terminus of alpha-tubulin, we characterized the distribution of tyrosinated/detyrosinated alpha-tubulin that is recruited by Rab2 in a quantitative membrane binding assay. Rab2-treated membranes contained predominantly tyrosinated alpha-tubulin; however, aPKCiota was the limiting and essential factor. Tyrosination/detyrosination influences MT motor protein binding; therefore, we determined whether Rab2 stimulated kinesin or dynein membrane binding. Although kinesin was not detected on membranes incubated with Rab2, dynein was recruited in a dose-dependent manner, and binding was aPKCiota-dependent. These combined results suggest a mechanism by which Rab2 controls MT and motor recruitment to vesicular tubular clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2103571104,"Among the varied adaptations for avian flight, the morphological traits allowing large-bodied albatrosses to capitalize on wind and wave energy for efficient long-distance flight are unparalleled. Consequently, the biogeographic distribution of most albatrosses is limited to the windiest oceanic regions on earth; however, exceptions exist. Species breeding in the North and Central Pacific Ocean (Phoebastria spp.) inhabit regions of lower wind speed and wave height than southern hemisphere genera, and have large intrageneric variation in body size and aerodynamic performance. Here, we test the hypothesis that regional wind and wave regimes explain observed differences in Phoebastria albatross morphology and we compare their aerodynamic performance to representatives from the other three genera of this globally distributed avian family. In the North and Central Pacific, two species (short-tailed P. albatrus and waved P. irrorata) are markedly larger, yet have the smallest breeding ranges near highly productive coastal upwelling systems. Short-tailed albatrosses, however, have 60% higher wing loading (weight per area of lift) compared to waved albatrosses. Indeed, calculated aerodynamic performance of waved albatrosses, the only tropical albatross species, is more similar to those of their smaller congeners (black-footed P. nigripes and Laysan P. immutabilis), which have relatively low wing loading and much larger foraging ranges that include central oceanic gyres of relatively low productivity. Globally, the aerodynamic performance of short-tailed and waved albatrosses are most anomalous for their body sizes, yet consistent with wind regimes within their breeding season foraging ranges. Our results are the first to integrate global wind and wave patterns with albatross aerodynamics, thereby identifying morphological specialization that may explain limited breeding ranges of two endangered albatross species. These results are further relevant to understanding past and potentially predicting future distributional limits of albatrosses globally, particularly with respect to climate change effects on basin-scale and regional wind fields."
https://openalex.org/W2059781866,"Background Under appropriate culture conditions, undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells can undergo multiple self-renewal cycles without loss of pluripotency suggesting they must be equipped with specific defense mechanisms to ensure sufficient genetic stability during self-renewal expansion. The ATP binding cassette transporter ABCG2 is expressed in a wide variety of somatic and embryonic stem cells. However, whether it plays an important role in stem cell maintenance remains to be defined. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we provide evidence to show that an increase in the level of ABCG2 was observed accompanied by ES colony expansion and then were followed by decreases in the level of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) indicating that ABCG2 plays a role in maintaining porphyrin homoeostasis. RNA-interference mediated inhibition of ABCG2 as well as functional blockage of ABCG2 transporter with fumitremorgin C (FTC), a specific and potent inhibitor of ABCG2, not only elevated the cellular level of PPIX, but also arrest the cell cycle and reduced expression of the pluripotent gene Nanog. Overexpression of ABCG2 in ES cells was able to counteract the increase of endogenous PPIX induced by treatment with 5-Aminolevulinic acid suggesting ABCG2 played a direct role in removal of PPIX from ES cells. We also found that excess PPIX in ES cells led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species which in turn triggered DNA damage signals as indicated by increased levels of γH2AX and phosphorylated p53. The increased level of p53 reduced Nanog expression because RNA- interference mediated inhibition of p53 was able to prevent the downregulation of Nanog induced by FTC treatment. Conclusions/Significance The present work demonstrated that ABCG2 protects ES cells from PPIX accumulation during colony expansion, and that p53 and γH2AX acts as a downstream checkpoint of ABCG2-dependent defense machinery in order to maintain the self-renewal of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973175104,"Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) regulates both vascular quiescence and angiogenesis through the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. We and another group have recently shown that Ang1 and Tie2 form distinct signaling complexes at cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts and further demonstrated that the former selectively induces expression of Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor involved in vascular quiescence. Here, we investigated the mechanism of how Ang1/Tie2 signal induces KLF2 expression to clarify the role of KLF2 in Ang1/Tie2 signal-mediated vascular quiescence. Ang1 stimulated KLF2 promoter-driven reporter gene expression in endothelial cells, whereas it failed when a myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-binding site of KLF2 promoter was mutated. Depletion of MEF2 by siRNAs abolished Ang1-induced KLF2 expression, indicating the requirement of MEF2 in KLF2 induction by Ang1. Constitutive active phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT increased the MEF2-dependent reporter gene expression by enhancing its transcriptional activity and stimulated the KLF2 promoter activity cooperatively with MEF2. Consistently, inhibition of either PI3K or AKT and depletion of AKT abrogated Ang1-induced KLF2 expression. In addition, we confirmed the dispensability of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) for Ang1-induced KLF2 expression. Furthermore, depletion of KLF2 resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effect of Ang1 on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells and VEGF-mediated monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) have recently clarified that the distinct localization of Tie2 in the presence or absence of cell-cell contact determines the specificity of downstream signaling of Tie2. Ang1 induces trans-association of Tie2 at endothelial cell-cell contacts, whereas Tie2 is anchored to extracellular matrix by Ang1 in the absence of cell-cell contacts. Trans-associated Tie2 bridged by Ang1 and extracellular matrix-anchored Tie2 by Ang1 induce distinct signaling pathways preferable for vascular quiescence and angiogenesis via AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, respectively. By performing DNA microarray analysis, we also revealed that a distinct set of genes is regulated by Ang1 in the presence or absence of cell-cell contacts. Among them, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) was selectively induced by Ang1 in the presence of cell-cell contacts (10Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N.

The MEF2 family of transcription factors is composed of four members (MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D) and is known as a regulator of vascular functions (21Hayashi M. Kim S.W. Imanaka-Yoshida K.

Plasmids and Adenoviruses—A luciferase reporter plasmid containing the proximal 221-bp region of KLF2 promoter (KLF2wt-Luc) was kindly provided by M. K. Jain (Case Western Reserve University). The MEF2-binding site of the KLF2wt-Luc plasmid was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the KLF2wt-Luc vector as a template. Expression plasmids encoding MEF2C and constitutive active mutants of AKT (pCEFL-myrAKT) and PI3K-γ (pcDNA3-PI3Kγ-CAAX) and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a single MEF2-binding site (pGL3-MEF2) have already been described (36Marinissen M.J.

A cDNA encoding full-length MEF2C amplified by PCR using pCEFL-GST-MEF2C as a template was inserted into p3xFLAG CMV10 vector (Sigma-Aldrich) or cloned into pCMV-DBD vector (Stratagene) to construct the plasmid expressing a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD)-MEF2C fusion protein (Gal4/MEF2C). Plasmids encoding Gal4/MEF2C mutant proteins (Thr-293, Thr-300, Ser-387 (phosphorylation sites by ERK5 and p38), and Thr-404 (potential phosphorylation site by AKT) were replaced with Ala, and 6 Lys residues (Lys-116, Lys-119, Lys-234, Lys-239, Lys-252, Lys-264; acetylation sites by p300) replaced with Arg were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. An expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged HDAC5 was generously obtained from C. Grozinger (Harvard University). Other vectors are purchased as follows: pRL-SV40 and pRL-TK from Promega Corp.; pEGFP-C1 from Clontech; and pFR from Stratagene. Recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding GFP and constitutively active form of AKT were kindly provided by H. Kurose (Kyushu University) and Y. Fujio (Osaka University), respectively. Cell Culture, Transfection, siRNA-mediated Protein Knockdown, and Adenovirus Infection—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured as described previously (10Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and used for experiments before passage 7. HUVECs were placed on collagen-coated plates at a density of 2,000 cells/cm2 and 40,000 cells/cm2 and cultured overnight to obtain sparse and confluent cell cultures, respectively. U937 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HUVECs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For siRNA-mediated gene silencing, HUVECs were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) and used for the experiments 48–72 h after transfection. HUVECs were infected with adenovirus vectors at the appropriate multiplicity of infection. Forty-eight h after infection, the cells were used for experiments. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Sparse and confluent HUVECs placed on collagen-coated plates were starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 6 h and stimulated with COMP-Ang1 as described in the figure legends. The cells were stimulated in the presence of 30 μm wortmannin or 8 μm AKT inhibitor IV. To examine the effect of COMP-Ang1 on VEGF-induced VCAM-1 expression, HUVECs starved in medium 199 containing 0.5% BSA for 5 h were prestimulated with or without COMP-Ang1 for 1 h and subsequently challenged with VEGF for 3 h. After the stimulation, total RNA was purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as described before (10Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 100 ng of total RNA was transcribed for 10 min at 50 °C followed by a denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. Fluorescence data were collected and analyzed using Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf). The primers used for amplification were as follows: for human KLF2, 5′-CTACACCAAGAGTTCGCATCTG-3′ and 5′-CCGTGTGCTTTCGGTAGTG-3′; for human VCAM1, 5′-CAAATCCTTGATACTGCTCATC-3′ and 5′-TTGACTTCTTGCTCACAGC-3′; forglyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA-3′. For normalization, expression of human GAPDH was determined in parallel as an endogenous control. Detection of KLF2 Protein Expression—To examine the KLF2 protein expression induced by COMP-Ang1, confluent HUVECs plated on a collagen-coated dish were starved in Humedia-EB2 medium (Kurabo) containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 12 h and stimulated with 400 ng/ml COMP-Ang1 for the periods as indicated in the figure legends. After the stimulation, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were then lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (39Fukuhara S. Sakurai A. Sano H. Yamagishi A. Somekawa S. Takakura N. Saito Y. Kangawa K. Mochizuki N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Detection of ERK5, AKT, and ERK1/2 Activities—Confluent and sparse HUVECs plated on collagen-coated dish were starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 6 h and stimulated with 400 ng/ml COMP-Ang1 for 15 min. The cells were then lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. To measure the ERK5 activity, in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (40Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, endogenous ERK5 was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of cell lysate with anti-ERK5 antibody at 4 °C for 3 h, and the immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium vanadate, once with washing buffer containing 100 mm Tris at pH 7.5 and 0.5 m LiCl and once with kinase reaction buffer containing 12.5 mm MOPS at pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.5 mm sodium fluoride. Samples were then resuspended in 15 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 3 μg of GST-MEF2C, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm cold ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. 32P-labeled substrates were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. To evaluate the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, aliquots of cell lysate were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-AKT and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies, respectively. The total contents of ERK5, AKT, and ERK1/2 in each cell lysate were also assayed in a parallel run using corresponding antibodies. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase reporter assay was carried out as described before (36Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 40Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVECs plated on a collagen-coated 12-well plate were transfected with different expression vectors, together with reporter plasmids as described in the figure legends. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with empty vector. To examine the effect of COMP-Ang1, the cells were starved and stimulated as described in the figure legends. The cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities in cell extract were determined using a Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Detection of Subcellular Localization of FLAG-tagged HDAC5—Confluent HUVECs plated on a collagen-coated glass base dish were transfected with the plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5. Twenty-four h after the transfection, the cells were starved in medium 199 containing 0.5% BSA for 6 h and subsequently stimulated with vehicle, COMP-Ang1, or VEGF for 3 h. After the stimulation, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG antibody as described before (10Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Protein reacting with antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Alexa Fluor 488 and phase contrast images were recorded with an Olympus IX-81 inverted fluorescence microscope. The number of cells expressing FLAG-tagged HDAC5 in the cytoplasm among FLAG-tagged HADC5-expressing cells was counted. Nuclear export of HDAC5 was determined by the HDAC5 in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. At least 100 cells were scored for each experiment. Monocyte Adhesion Assay—HUVECs transfected with control or KLF2 siRNA were placed on collagen-coated 24-well plates at the density of 40,000 cells/cm2, cultured overnight, and starved in medium 199 containing 1% BSA for 2 h. The cells were prestimulated with 400 ng/ml COMP-Ang1 for 1 h and challenged with vehicle or 50 ng/ml VEGF in the presence or absence of COMP-Ang1 for 4 h. U937 cells labeled with green fluorescent dye PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the confluent HUVEC monolayers (8 × 105 cells/well) and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 90 min. The cells were then washed three times with prewarmed Hank's buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) and fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Phase contrast and PKH67 fluorescent images were recorded with an Olympus IX-81 inverted fluorescence microscope. The adherent U937 cells were quantified by measuring fluorescent intensity at five randomly selected fields in each well using MetaMorph 6.1 software (Molecular Devices Corp.). Statistical Analysis—The values are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, or unpaired t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ang1 Induces KLF2 Expression in Confluent but Not Sparse Cultures of HUVECs—To first examine the KLF2 expression downstream of trans-associated Tie2 at cell-cell contacts and cell-substratum contact-anchored Tie2 in response to Ang1, HUVECs were stimulated with COMP-Ang1, a potent Ang1 variant, under either confluent or sparse culture condition. COMP-Ang1 concentration-dependently induced KLF2 mRNA expression in confluent HUVECs but not in the sparse cells (Fig. 1A). Consistently, KLF2 protein expression was up-regulated upon stimulation with COMP-Ang1 (Fig. 1C). KLF2 mRNA and protein expression by COMP-Ang1 peaked at 1 h aft"
https://openalex.org/W2007179260,"Fast moving animals depend on cues derived from the optic flow on their retina. Optic flow from translational locomotion includes information about the three-dimensional composition of the environment, while optic flow experienced during a rotational self motion does not. Thus, a saccadic gaze strategy that segregates rotations from translational movements during locomotion will facilitate extraction of spatial information from the visual input. We analysed whether birds use such a strategy by highspeed video recording zebra finches from two directions during an obstacle avoidance task. Each frame of the recording was examined to derive position and orientation of the beak in three-dimensional space. The data show that in all flights the head orientation was shifted in a saccadic fashion and was kept straight between saccades. Therefore, birds use a gaze strategy that actively stabilizes their gaze during translation to simplify optic flow based navigation. This is the first evidence of birds actively optimizing optic flow during flight."
https://openalex.org/W2028459159,"Acetylation of multiple lysine residues in the p53 plays critical roles in the protein stability and transcriptional activity of p53. To better understand how p53 acetylation is regulated, we generated a number of p53 mutants and examined acetylation of each mutant in transfected cells. We found that p53 mutants that are defective in tetramer formation are also defective in C-terminal lysine residue acetylation. Consistently, we found that several cancer-derived p53 mutants that bear mutations in the tetramerization domain cannot form oligomers and are defective in C-terminal lysine acetylation, and these mutants are inactive in p21 transactivation. We demonstrated that the acetyltransferase p300 interacts with and promotes acetylation of wild-type p53 but not with any of the artificially generated or human cancer-derived p53 mutants that are defective in oligomerization. These results, combined with a computer-aided crystal structure analysis, suggest a model in which p53 oligomerization precedes its acetylation by providing docking sites for acetyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2031911979,"GATA transcription factors are important regulators of tissue-specific gene expression during development. GATA2 and GATA3 have been implicated in the regulation of trophoblast-specific genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms of GATA2 expression in trophoblast cells are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Gata2 is transcriptionally induced during trophoblast giant cell-specific differentiation. Transcriptional induction is associated with displacement of GATA3-dependent nucleoprotein complexes by GATA2-dependent nucleoprotein complexes at two regulatory regions, the –3.9- and +9.5-kb regions, of the mouse Gata2 locus. Analyses with reporter genes showed that, in trophoblast cells, –3.9- and +9.5-kb regions function as transcriptional enhancers in GATA motif independent and dependent fashions, respectively. We also found that knockdown of GATA3 by RNA interference induces GATA2 in undifferentiated trophoblast cells. Interestingly, three other known GATA motif-dependent Gata2 regulatory elements, the –1.8-, –2.8-, and –77-kb regions, which are important to regulate Gata2 in hematopoietic cells are not occupied by GATA factors in trophoblast cells. These elements do not show any enhancer activity and also possess inaccessible chromatin structure in trophoblast cells indicating a context-dependent function. Our results indicate that GATA3 directly represses Gata2 in undifferentiated trophoblast cells, and a switch in chromatin occupancy between GATA3 and GATA2 (GATA3/GATA2 switch) induces transcription during trophoblast differentiation. We predict that this GATA3/GATA2 switch is an important mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of other trophoblast-specific genes.

Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). During development, TS cells give rise to distinct highly differentiated trophoblast subtypes, which build the functional units of the organ, the placenta (2Simmons D.G. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Trophoblast cells are important for the anchorage of the embryo to the mother, for establishing a vascular connection for nutrient and gas transport to the embryo, and expression of hormones that are required for the successful progression of pregnancy (3Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In rodents, multiple differentiated cell types can be derived from TS cells: trophoblast giant cells, spongiotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, glycogen trophoblast cells, and invasive trophoblasts (2Simmons D.G. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Ain R. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 176-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Trophoblast giant cells are characterized by endoreduplication and expression of members of the prolactin gene family. During pregnancy, these cells invade into the uterus and promote local and systemic adaptations in the mother that are necessary for embryonic growth and survival (2Simmons D.G. Cross J.C. Dev.

Differentiation of trophoblast giant cells occurs in a spatially and temporally highly organized manner and multiple transcription factors, including GATA2 and GATA3, have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of trophoblast giant cell-specific gene expression (5Cross J.C.

The GATA family of transcription factors, GATA1–GATA6, controls multiple developmental processes by regulating tissue-specific gene expression by binding to W(A/T)GAT-AR(A/G) motifs (GATA motifs) of regulatory elements (9Bresnick E.H.

GATA family members have been subdivided into two subfamilies based on their expression and functional analysis. GATA1, GATA2, and GATA3 regulate the development of different hematopoietic lineages: erythroid, hematopoietic progenitor, and T-lymphoid, respectively (11Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H.

Similarly, GATA4, GATA5, and GATA6 have been shown to be involved in cardiac, genitourinary, and multiple endodermal developmental events (14Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 15Molkentin J.D. Tymitz K.M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

GATA2 was initially cloned from chicken reticulocyte as a GATA motif-binding factor and was shown to be present in all developmental stages of erythroid cells (17Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of Gata2 resulted in embryonic lethality at embryonic day 10.5–11.5 due to ablation of blood cell development (12Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W.

Germ line deletion of Gata3 results in embryonic lethality due to a multitude of phenotypic abnormalities, including growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis (13Pandolfi P.P.

Interestingly, expression analysis during early mouse development showed that GATA3 is most abundantly expressed in trophoblast cells prior to embryonic day 10.5 (25George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K.H. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Development. 1994; 120: 2673-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although GATA2 and GATA3 are expressed in trophoblast cells, very little is known about GATA factor function and their regulation in this context. Studies in a choriocarcinoma-derived rat trophoblast stem cell line (Rcho-1 trophoblast cells) showed that both GATA2 and GATA3 regulate trophoblast-specific expression of placental lactogen I (PL-I; also known as Prl3d1) gene (7Ng Y.K. George K.M. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I. Development. 1994; 120: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with knock-out mice showed that placentas develop in Gata2 and Gata3-null embryos (8Ma G.T. Roth M.E. Groskopf J.C. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I. Development. 1997; 124: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, placentas lacking Gata2 or Gata3 exhibited reduced PL-I and proliferin (also known as Prl2c2) gene expression, with Gata2-null placentas having greater reductions in proliferin (8Ma G.T. Roth M.E. Groskopf J.C. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I. Development. 1997; 124: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, placentation sites lacking GATA2 have significantly less neovascularization compared with wild-type placentas in the same uterus (8Ma G.T. Roth M.E. Groskopf J.C. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that during erythroid differentiation GATA1 and GATA2 directly regulate Gata2 transcription in a reciprocal fashion (26Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Pal S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mouse Gata2 locus in erythroid progenitors showed that in the transcriptionally active state, GATA2 occupies four conserved upstream elements (–77, –3.9, –2.8, and –1.8 kb) along with an intronic (+9.5 kb) conserved element (26Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Pal S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 28Martowicz M.L. Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Guend H.

Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GATA1-mediated repression of Gata2 transcription was tightly coupled with displacement of GATA2 by GATA1 (GATA2/GATA1 switch) from those regulatory elements. Studies with GATA factor cofactor friend of GATA1 (FOG1)-null cells showed that FOG1 plays an unique role in this regulatory mechanism, in which it facilitates the chromatin occupancy of GATA1 displacing GATA2 from the Gata2 locus (27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T.B. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These findings support a model in which GATA2 positively autoregulates transcription by binding to its own locus. In erythroid progenitors, this autoregulation is abrogated by a FOG1-dependent GATA2/GATA1 switch that triggers formation of regulatory complexes leading to repression of transcription. To begin to understand the role of GATA factors in trophoblast function, we studied Gata2 transcriptonal regulation in Rcho-1 trophoblast stem cells (30Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Sahgal N. Canham L.N. Canham B. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 159-178PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse TS cells (32Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), and during their differentiation to the trophoblast giant cell lineage. Herein, we demonstrate that in trophoblast stem cells GATA3 directly represses Gata2 by occupying the –3.9- and +9.5-kb regulatory elements at the Gata2 locus. During trophoblast differentiation, GATA2 displaces GATA3 thereby forming a transcriptionally favorable nucleoprotein complex at the Gata2 locus. This GATA2-mediated displacement of GATA3 (GATA3/GATA2 switch) is associated with displacement of cofactor FOG1 and recruitment of cofactor Mediator1/TRAP220 (MED1/TRAP220) at the Gata2 locus. These studies define an important mechanism of Gata2 regulation in trophoblast cells and implicate a GATA3/GATA2 switch as an important molecular determinant for gene regulation during trophoblast differentiation. Cell Culture and Reagents—Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were cultured as mentioned earlier (31Sahgal N. Canham L.N. Canham B. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 159-178PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in a proliferative state by culturing under subconfluent conditions with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Differentiation was induced by replacing the culture medium with NCTC 135 culture medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% horse serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.3 μg/ml HEPES, 2.2 μg/ml sodium bicarbonate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Differentiation was continued for a period of 8 days at which point most of the cells appeared to be giant cells. Mouse TS cells were initially cultured on a feeder layer of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in the presence of 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4; Sigma) and heparin (1 μg/ml) in TS cell medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2-mercaptoethanol (100 μm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). For experiments, mouse TS cells were expanded in a proliferative state without MEF feeders by culturing in the presence of 70% MEF-conditioned medium, 30% TS cell medium containing, 20% fetal bovine serum, 25 ng/ml FGF4 (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). MEF-conditioned medium was produced by addition of 10.5 ml of TS cell medium to 100-mm culture plates containing 2 × 106 mitomycin-C (10 μg/ml; Sigma)-treated MEFs. Differentiation of TS cells was induced by culturing them in medium devoid of FGF4, heparin, and MEF-conditioned medium. Human embryonic kidney-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from different cell samples with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 5:1 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers heated at 68 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (50 units) (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm dithiothreitol, RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. Reactions were diluted to a final volume of 100 μl and heat inactivated at 97 °C for 5 min. A 20-μl PCR contained 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and corresponding primer sets. Control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase (RT) yielded very low signals. Relative expression levels were determined from a standard curve of serial dilutions of the proliferative Rcho-1 trophoblast cell and undifferentiated TS cell cDNA samples and were normalized to the expression of 18 S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for quantitative RT-PCR were (5′-3′): mouse Gata2, GCAGAGAAGCAAGGCTCGC and CAGTTGACACACTCCCGGC; mouse Gata3, CGGGTTCGGATGTAAGTCGA and GTAGAGGTTGCCCCGCAGT; rat Gata2, TAAGCAGCGAAGCAAGGCTC and AGCTTCAGATTCATTTTCAGAGCA; rat Gata3, CGGGTTCGGATGTAAGTCGA and CCCGCAGTTCACACACTCC; rat Gata1, TCTCATCCGGCCCAAGAAG and AGTTAGTGCATTGGGTGCCTG; rat Gata4, GCCAACCCTGCGAGACAC and CTCTGCCTTCTGAGAAGTCATCAA; rat Gata5, CCTCCCTGGCCGCAG and CAGGGAACTCCTCCAAGAAGT; rat Gata6, CTCCCGGTGCCACGAG and TCTCCGACAGGTCCTCCAAC; rat Fog1, ATAGAGGAGCCCCCAAGTCC and GTGCCGACACTGTAGGTAGGC; rat Fog2, GCCATGGCTTCTATTTTGCCT and AAATGCCACAGGACTTGCAAG; rat caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2), AGCTCAGCCGTCCCTAGGA and CCCGGTATTTGTCTTTCGTCC; rat transcription factor EB (Tfeb), GATGCCTAACACGCTACCCCTGT and TCTCAGCATCTGTTAGCTCTCGCT; rat trophoblast-specific protein α (Tpbpa), GCAAGAGCAGAAGGGTAAAGAAGG and TTTCTATGTCGAGCTCCTCCTCCT; rat connexin 31 (Cx 31), TGTGAACCAGTACTCCACCGCATT and GCTGCCTGGTGTTACAGTCAAAGT; rat PRL-like protein-N (PLP-N, also known as Prl7b1), AACAATGCCTCTGGCCACTGC and AGGCCATTGATGTGCTGAGACAGT; rat PL-I, TCGCGCCTCTGGTATGCAAC and TGGACACAATGGCAGTTGGTTTGG; rat placental lactogen II (PL-II; also known as Prl3b1), ACCATGCTTCTCTGGGACACT and AGGCTTCCAGTGGACATTCGGTAA; and 18S rRNA, GCAATTATTCCCCATGAACG, and GGCCTCACTAAACCATCCAA. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated and day 8 differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells using TRIzol reagent. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was resolved in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Keene, NH), and cross-linked. Blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNAs (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for Gata2, NM_033442 (GenBank); and PL-II, NM_012535 (GenBank). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) cDNA was used to evaluate the integrity and equal loading of RNA samples. Probes were generated using Prime-it II random primer labeling kits (Stratagene). Probes were incubated with the blots at 42 °C overnight and washed twice with 2× SSPE, 0.1× SDS at 42 °C for 25 min and 1× SSPE, 0.1× SDS at 50 °C for 35 min. Blots were then exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. At least three different samples from three different experiments were analyzed with each probe. Protein Analysis—For Western blot analysis, protein lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and resolved by 8 or 10% PAGE. Monoclonal anti-GATA3 (Hg3–31) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Anti-β-actin was obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Polyclonal rabbit anti-GATA2 and anti-FOG1 antibodies used for our study were described earlier (27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T.B. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as secondary antibodies. To detect FOG1, Rcho-1 trophoblast cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitated with preimmune rabbit serum or rabbit anti-FOG1 polyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose, and resolved on 8% PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare). RNA Interference—Lentiviral vectors containing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting rat Gata3 mRNA were cloned in pLKO1 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Lentiviral supernatants were produced in human embryonic kidney-293T cells by transfection with calcium phosphate as described earlier (33Dutta D. Ray S. Vivian J.L. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lentiviral supernatants were collected after 24 and 48 h of incubation. Undifferentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells grown to 70% confluence were incubated with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) containing medium for 30 min followed by infection with lentiviral supernatants. Infected Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were selected by addition of 3 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) after 48 h of infection. After 3 days samples were prepared for mRNA and protein analysis. The Gata3 target sequence 5′-GCCTGCGGACTCTACCATAAA-3′ successfully knocked down expression of the target gene. For control experiments cells were infected either with empty viral vector or vectors expressing shRNAs against the Gata3 target sequence 5′-CGGATGTAAGTCGAGGCCCAA-3′, which did not knock-down GATA3 expression. Quantitative ChIP Assay—Real-time PCR-based quantitative ChIP analysis was performed according to an earlier described protocol (34Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Boyer M.E. Wu J. Bresnick E.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 129-146PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated and differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast and mouse TS cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and protein-DNA cross-linking was conducted by treating cells with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Glycine (0.125 m) was added to quench the reaction. Antibodies against GATA2, GATA3, FOG1, MED1/TRAP220 (M-255; Santa Cruz), CBP/P300 (A-22; Santa Cruz), diacetylated histone 3 (acH3; Millipore, Billerica, MA), tetra-acetylated histone 4 (acH4; Millipore), and RNA polymerase II (Pol II; N20, Santa Cruz) were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA cross-linked fragments. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (ABI 7500, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). Primers were designed to amplify 60- to 100-bp amplicons and were based on sequences in the Ensembl data base for mouse and rat Gata2 loci. Samples from three or more immunoprecipitations were analyzed. Products were measured by SYBR Green fluorescence in 25-μl reactions. The amount of product was determined relative to a standard curve of input chromatin. Dissociation curves showed that PCRs yielded single products. Primer sequences are available on request. Transient Transfection Assay—Plasmid constructs (in pGL3 basic vector; Promega) containing a luciferase reporter gene fused to hematopoietic cell-specific (1S) promoter (35Minegishi N. Ohta J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3625-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) of mouse Gata2 gene alone or in combination with Gata2 regulatory elements have been described earlier (28Martowicz M.L.

Bresnick (University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI). For transient transfection analysis, undifferentiated or day 4 differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were transfected with an equal amount of each plasmid (3 μg). Plasmids were added to 150 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) reduced serum medium, incubated with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. After 3 h of incubation the transfection mixture was replaced with culture medium. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h post-transfection and luciferase activity was measured in a Veritas Microplate Luminometer using the luciferase assay buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of the lysate. At least three independent preparations of each plasmid were analyzed. DNase I Hypersensitive Site Mapping—DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) were mapped according to the procedure described by Follows et al. (36Follows G.A. Janes M.E. Vallier L. Green A.R. Gottgens B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, to generate whole genome DHS libraries from undifferentiated and day 8 differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells, nuclei were generated by lysing cells (3 × 106 cells for each condition) in cell lysis buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were gently resuspended in reaction buffer containing different units of DNase I (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) and left to incubate at 4 °C. After 1 h, 700 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS) and 50 μg of proteinase K were added to each set and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with 10 μg of RNase A. Digested DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform, blunt ended with T4 polymerase (New England Biolab), and ligated with an asymmetric double-stranded linker (LP21; GAATTCAGATCTCCCGGGTCA-LP25; GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC linker). The precipitated ligated DNA was amplified using Vent exo-polymerase (New England Biolab) and a biotinylated LP25 primer. Following amplification, products were extracted using DynaI-streptavidin beads (Dynabeads M-270, Dynal Biotech) and suspended in TE buffer. From the library, DHSs at the Gata2 locus were determined by measuring relative enrichment of DNase I-treated samples versus DNase I-untreated samples by real-time PCR using region-specific primers. We used the same primers that were used for ChIP analysis. Quantification of samples was done using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) where standard curves were generated with known amounts of genomic DNA. Induction of Gata2 Expression during Trophoblast Giant Cell-specific Differentiation—To determine whether GATA2 expression is dynamically regulated during trophoblast differentiation, we used Rcho-1 trophoblast cells as a model system. Rcho-1 trophoblast cells represent a faithful model for studying rat trophoblast cells in undifferentiated and differentiated states (31Sahgal N. Canham L.N. Canham B. Soares M.J. Methods Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2115137384,"Secretory IgA (SIgA) is the most prevalent human antibody and is central to mucosal immunity. It exists as two subclasses, SIgA1 and SIgA2, where SIgA2 has a shorter hinge joining the Fab and Fc regions. Both forms of SIgA are predominantly dimeric and contain an additional protein called the secretory component (SC) that is attached during the secretory process and is believed to protect SIgA in harsh mucosal conditions. Here we locate the five SC domains relative to dimeric IgA2 within SIgA2 using constrained scattering modeling. The x-ray and sedimentation parameters showed that SIgA2 has an extended solution structure. The constrained modeling of SIgA2 was initiated using two IgA2 monomers that were positioned according to our best fit solution structure for dimeric IgA1. SC was best located along the convex edge of the Fc-Fc region. The best fit models showed that SIgA2 is significantly nonplanar in its structure, in distinction to our previous near planar SIgA1 structure. Both the shorter IgA2 hinges and the presence of SC appear to displace the four Fab regions out of the Fc plane in SIgA2. This may explain the noncovalent binding of SC in some SIgA2 molecules. This nonplanar structure is predicted to result in specific immune properties for SIgA2 and SIgA1. It may explain differences observed between the SIgA1 and SIgA2 subclasses in terms of their interactions with antigens, susceptibility to proteases, effects on receptors, and distribution in different tissues. The different structures account for the prevalence of both forms in mucosal secretions. Secretory IgA (SIgA) is the most prevalent human antibody and is central to mucosal immunity.

The different structures account for the prevalence of both forms in mucosal secretions. The human mucosal surfaces have an estimated surface area of 400 m2 and constitute the largest surface area in contact with the external environment when compared with the 1.8 m2 area of the external skin (1Mestecky J.

Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) 2The abbreviations used are: SIgA2, secretory immunoglobulin A2; dIgA, dimeric immunoglobulin A; SC, secretory component.2The abbreviations used are: SIgA2, secretory immunoglobulin A2; dIgA, dimeric immunoglobulin A; SC, secretory component. acts as the first line of mucosal defense against pathogenic bacteria, their toxic products, and other antigens (4Nagler-Anderson C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). SIgA binds and neutralizes these pathogens by a passive blocking mechanism but may also trigger specific cellular responses and complement-mediated effector functions. More IgA is produced daily than all the other antibody classes combined (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In terms of its involvement with immunity, IgA is unique. It is the only human antibody that exists in multiple oligomeric states; different forms are predominant in different mucosal environments (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mucosal SIgA is mostly dimeric (with some trimeric and tetrameric forms). It is present as two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, the latter being found in at least two allotypic forms, IgA2m(1) and IgA2m(2). Slightly more SIgA1 is generally present than SIgA2, except in the colon where there is more SIgA2 (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Childers N.K. Bruce M.G. McGhee J.R. Annu. Rev.

The major interest in IgA2 is that this is more similar to the IgA that is present in most other mammalian species including rodents, rabbits having up to 13 IgA2-like subclasses (5Sumiyama K. Saitou N. Ueda S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IgA1 homologues have only been found in higher apes (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar).All of the IgA monomers contain two heavy and two light chains that possess 12 domains, two heavy chain C-terminal tailpieces, and N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn263 and Asn459 (Fig. 1) (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The IgA2 allotypes contain two extra N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn166 and Asn337 in the CH1 and CH2 domains, respectively (Fig. 1). In the most common IgA2 allotype, IgA2m (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the light chains are covalently linked by their C-terminal Cys214 residues rather than to the heavy chains (Fig. 1) (7Grey H.M. Abel C.A. Yount W.J. Kinkel H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IgA1 and IgA2 differ the most in the hinge between the Fab and Fc regions (Fig. 1). The IgA1 hinge is 13 residues longer than the IgA2 hinge and is O-glycosylated (8Torano A. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Putnam F.W. Liu Y.-S.V. Low T.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2865-2874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IgA1 hinge is uniquely sensitive to a specific group of microbial proteases that do not cleave IgA2. A dimer of two 12-domain IgA monomers is bound covalently through a glycosylated joining (J) chain at the base of the Fc regions (Fig. 1). This IgA dimer (dIgA) is transcytosed by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor across the epithelium to the luminal membrane, at which the receptor is cleaved to release five extracellular domains that are now called secretory component (SC). The dimeric IgA-SC complex comprises SIgA (Fig. 1). SC is covalently bound to a CH2 domain in one IgA1 monomer in SIgA1, yet it has been observed that this covalent bond can be absent in SIgA2 (10Fallgreen-Gebauer E. Gebauer W. Bastian A. Kratzin H.D.

Svehag S.E. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 133: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the structural assembly of SIgA remained unclear. Electron microscopy could not locate SC within SIgA. Many cartoons suggested that the SC domains were wrapped around the Fc-Fc dimer to protect this (1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed.

A new method of constrained scattering modeling successively resulted in solution structures for monomeric IgA1 and IgA2m(1), dimeric IgA1, and SC (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J.

Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this, the two IgA1 monomers form a near planar, end-to-end conformation with a slight bend in the Fc-Fc region, with SC located along the convex edge of the Fc-Fc region. Given its importance in mucosal immunity, the corresponding structure for human SIgA2 is also of great interest. The shorter hinge increases the rigidity of IgA2 compared with IgA1, with little independent Fab movement relative to the Fc region (17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Roux K.H. Strelets L. Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4083-4090PubMed Google Scholar). By again combining x-ray, neutron, and ultracentrifugation data, the first structural view of the assembly of SIgA2 shows that this is markedly different from that for SIgA1 in being nonplanar. These differences are discussed in reference to the function of SIgA in mucosal immunity, particularly its interactions with antigens and receptors and the efficient protection of mucosal surfaces.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification and Composition of Human Colostrum SIgA2—Native SIgA2 was isolated from colostrum provided by consenting healthy volunteers. A thiophilic resin column was used to bind immunoglobulins, SIgA1 was removed from this pool by jacalin-agarose affinity chromatography, and a Sephyacryl S-300 size exclusion column separated dimeric SIgA2 as a well resolved peak from secretory IgM, higher polymers of SIgA2, and free SC (20Bonner A. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After concentration, SIgA2 was checked by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE and in Western blots using anti-SIgA2 α-chain, anti-SIgA2 κ and λ light chain, and anti-SC antibodies. Reducing SDS-PAGE showed only the three bands expected for the light chain and J-chain (25 kDa), the heavy chain (60 kDa), and SC (80 kDa) (11Almogren A. Senior B.W. Kerr M.A. Immunology. 2007; 120: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For scattering and ultracentrifugation work, the buffer was as described previously (19Bonner A. Furtado P.B. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SIgA2 was assumed to comprise the IgA2m(1Mestecky J. Moro I. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Mucosal Immunology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2005: 153-181Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and IgA2m(2) allotypes with both λ and κ class light chains. Its composition was approximated as IgA2m(1), plus J chain and SC (17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

SIgA2 with four κ light chains has a molecular mass of 424 kDa, an unhydrated volume of 537 nm3, a hydrated volume of 711 nm3, an absorption coefficient (1%, 1 cm path length) of 12.2, and a v̄ of 0.721 ml/g. The κ light chains in SIgA2 are 7 kDa larger than the λ light chains.Scattering and Ultracentrifugation Data—X-ray scattering data were obtained in two different sessions on Beamline ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using the synchrotron source in single-bunch mode to reduce the incident x-ray flux on the sample to minimize potential radiation effects (storage ring currents of 11–18 mA). The sample to detector distance was 3.0 m. SIgA2 samples at concentrations of 0.32–1.94 mg/ml were contained in water-cooled Perspex cells at 15 °C, with a path thickness of 1 mm and mica windows of thickness 25 μm. The samples were measured in sets of 10 consecutive time frames, each of 0.1, 1, or 2 s, to confirm the absence of radiation damage effects by comparing these. Neutron scattering data were obtained on Instrument LOQ at the ISIS pulsed neutron source (Didcot, UK). The proton beam current used to generate neutrons was ∼180 μA. Neutron data acquisition at 15 °C lasted 4–12 h at 1.94 mg/ml. To compute the distance distribution function P(r) that is a histogram of interatomic distances, the x-ray I(Q) curve contained 488 data points between Q values of 0.09 and 2.00 nm-1 and was fitted with Dmax set as 25 nm. The neutron I(Q) curve contained 71 data points between Q values of 0.13 and 2.3 nm-1 and was fitted with Dmax set as 24 nm to give the P(r) curve. Full details are described previously (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

SIgA2 concentrations were 0.90, 0.60, and 0.32 mg/ml, using rotor speeds of 7,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 14,000 r.p.m. The molecular weights were determined from the curves at equilibrium by single species fits using Origin, version 4.1 (Microcal). Sedimentation velocity data were acquired at 0.93, 0.57, and 0.40 mg/ml at rotor speeds of 10,000, 15,000 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 r.p.m The velocity data analyses utilized DCDT+ and SEDFIT, version 9.4 software. The continuous c(s) size distribution model of SEDFIT was used to identify the species present in the sample, and this model used a resolution of 150 and fixed the cell meniscus and bottom, the frictional ratio of 1.53, and the partial specific volume v̄, buffer density, and viscosity. The base line was allowed to float. Full details are described elsewhere (17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

Immunol. 2008; 180: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Constrained Modeling—The constrained modeling of SIgA2 to fit the experimental scattering curve required molecular models to initiate this procedure. This was derived from the recent dIgA1 structure (Protein Data Bank code 2qtj) (19Bonner A. Furtado P.B. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two IgA2m(1) monomers (Protein Data Bank code 1r70) (17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were superimposed on the two Fc regions in dIgA1 to create a starting model for dimeric IgA2m(1). Next, this dimer structure was combined with a library of 5,000 randomized conformations in SC that was created from the unrestrained linker search modeling described previously for SC (18Bonner A. Perrier C. Corthésy B. Perkins S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16969-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Holding the dimeric IgA2 structure fixed, a Cycle 1 of modeling fits was performed using the same 10 SC searches used for SIgA1 (20Bonner A. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In each search, one SC domain was held fixed in position adjacent to the dIgA2m(1) structure, and the resulting 5,000 SIgA2 models were evaluated for their fits to the scattering curve. The subsequent Cycle 2 randomized the Fab-Fc hinge in the best fit SIgA2 model obtained from Cycle 1. This hinge between the CH1 and CH2 domains is 220CPVPPPPPCCHP244 (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M.

J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For Cycle 2, six linker libraries with 5000 hinge conformations in each were generated using molecular dynamics for 12-residue hinge lengths set between 2.50 and 3.75 nm in six 0.25-nm steps. From the resulting 30,000 conformations, 3,000 were randomly selected to create full SIgA2 coordinate models with four identical hinge structures. In Cycles 1 and 2, each atomic model was converted into Debye spheres to calculate the scattering curve (17Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M.

A cube side of 0.531 nm and a four-atom cut-off reproduced the unhydrated SIgA2 volume, giving 3589 spheres for neutron fits, which visualizes a largely unhydrated structure. The addition of the hydration volume corresponded to 4747 spheres and was used for x-ray fits. To reduce computing times, the 5,000 SC models were first reduced to 1500 using a generous 7% volume filter to remove significantly sterically overlapped models. After calculation of the modeled x-ray scattering curve of Fig. 6A, a flat background correction of 0.2% of I(0) was subtracted from the modeled curve as an empirical correction of different sample buffer transmissions observed at large scattering angles No flat background correction was required for the neutron fits. Sedimentation coefficients s20,wo were calculated using HYDROPRO, version 7c. Full details are given elsewhere (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

Okemefuna A.I. Fernando A.N. Bonner A. Gilbert H.E. Furtado P.B. Method. Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 375-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Comparison of the x-ray scattering I(Q) data as a function of scattering angle Q (Q = 4 π sin θ/λ;2θ = scattering angle; λ = wavelength) from a single time frame and the average of 10 consecutive frames showed no radiation damage effects. The averaged time frames showed improved signal-noise ratios; thus these were subsequently used for analyses. At the lowest Q values, Guinier analyses resulted in linear plots, from which the RG value (a monitor of macromolecular elongation) was obtained within satisfactory Q·RG limits (Fig. 2A). The mean x-ray RG value for SIgA2 was 8.13 ± 0.1 nm (five values) (Fig. 2A), which is slightly less than that of 8.29 ± 0.20 nm for SIgA1 (20Bonner A. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The SIgA2 anisotropy ratio RG/RO (where RO is the RG value of the sphere with the same volume as the glycoprotein) was 1.90, which is slightly less than that of 1.93 for SIgA1. The similarities between the two SIgA isoforms suggest that they both have a similar extended subunit arrangement (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Guinier analyses and distance distribution functions P(r). A–D, the Guinier plots are arbitrarily displaced on the intensity axis for reason of clarity. The Q·RG and Q·RXS ranges used to determine the RG, RXS-1, and RXS-2 values are represented by filled circles between the data points marked with arrows. The x-ray fits correspond to concentrations of 0.90 mg/ml (top), 0.60 mg/ml (middle), and 0.32 mg/ml (bottom). The neutron fit corresponds to a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. A and B, the x-ray and neutron Q ranges used for the RG values were 0.10–0.17 and 0.10–0.18 nm-1, respectively. C and D, the x-ray Q ranges used for the RXS-1 and RXS-2 values were 0.20–0.28 and 0.72–1.04 nm-1, respectively. E and F, the two most frequently occurring distances in the P(r) curve are denoted by the maxima M1 and M2 at 7.3 and 10.0 nm, respectively (x-ray), and 7.2 and 9.6 nm, respectively (neutron). The maximum length L of SIgA2 is 25 nm (x-ray) and 24 nm (neutron) when P(r) reaches 0. The error bars are shown for the neutron P(r) curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The shorter axes of SIgA2 were monitored using the RXS-1 and RXS-2 parameters from x-ray cross-sectional Guinier analyses. The ln(I(Q)·Q) plots revealed two linear regions in Q ranges of 0.20–0.28 and 0.72–1.04 nm-1 that were similar to those for SIgA1 and dIgA1 (19Bonner A. Furtado P.B. Almogren A.

The mean RXS-1 and RXS-2 value were 4.22 ± 0.09 nm (5 values) and 1.93 ± 0.03 nm (four values), respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). These values were slightly larger than the corresponding values of 3.90–3.94 and 1.27–1.43 nm for SIgA1 and dIgA1 (Table 1). The increase is attributed to an alteration in the relative arrangement of the Fab and Fc regions within the structure when compared with SIgA1 and dIgA1.TABLE 1Comparison of x-ray and neutron parameters for human IgA and secretory component All of the proteins are from human sources except for SC, which is recombinant, and IgA2m(1), which is a recombinant human-mouse chimaera.

The SIgA2 neutron RG value in a 2H2O buffer was 7.57 nm (Fig. 2B), which is 0.56 nm lower than the x-ray value, and attributed to a largely invisible hydration shell observed by neutrons (24Perkins S.J.

No neutron RXS-1 and RXS-2 values were available for reason of an insufficient signal-noise ratio. The Guinier I(0)/c value leads to the protein molecular mass M (where M = I(0)/c × 9.105) (6Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1990565865,"Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first irreversible step in the transsulfuration pathway and commits homocysteine to the synthesis of cysteine. Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. A yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with CBS had previously identified several components of the sumoylation pathway and resulted in the demonstration that CBS is a substrate for sumoylation. In this study, we demonstrate that sumoylation of CBS is enhanced in the presence of human polycomb group protein 2 (hPc2), an interacting partner that was identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. When the substrates for CBS, homocysteine and serine for cystathionine generation and homocysteine and cysteine for H(2)S generation, are added to the sumoylation mixture, they inhibit the sumoylation reaction, but only in the absence of hPc2. Similarly, the product of the CBS reaction, cystathionine, inhibits sumoylation in the absence of hPc2. Sumoylation in turn decreases CBS activity by approximately 28% in the absence of hPc2 and by 70% in its presence. Based on these results, we conclude that hPc2 serves as a SUMO E3 ligase for CBS, increasing the efficiency of sumoylation. We also demonstrate that gamma-cystathionase, the second enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway is a substrate for sumoylation under in vitro conditions. We speculate that the role of this modification may be for nuclear localization of the cysteine-generating pathway under conditions where nuclear glutathione demand is high."
https://openalex.org/W2054316018,"Some mammals, including laboratory mice, enter torpor in response to food deprivation, and leptin can attenuate these bouts of torpor. We previously showed that dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), do not reduce circulating leptin upon fasting nor do they enter torpor. To test whether the onset of torpor in mice during a fast requires a NE-mediated reduction in circulating leptin, double mutant mice deficient in both leptin (ob/ob) and DBH (DBL MUT) were generated. Upon fasting, control and ob/ob mice entered torpor as assessed by telemetric core T(b) acquisition. While fasting failed to induce torpor in Dbh -/- mice, leptin deficiency bypassed the requirement for NE, as DBL MUT mice readily entered torpor upon fasting. These data indicate that sympathetic activation of white fat and suppression of leptin is required for the onset of torpor in the mouse. Emergence from torpor was severely retarded in DBL MUT mice, revealing a novel, leptin-independent role for NE in torpor recovery. This phenotype was mimicked by administration of a beta(3) adrenergic receptor antagonist to control mice during a torpor bout. Hence, NE signaling via beta(3) adrenergic receptors presumably in brown fat is the first neurotransmitter-receptor system identified that is required for normal recovery from torpor."

Two essential components for this enzyme are telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA component (encoded by the TERC gene). These telomerase subunit genes are known to be mainly expressed by specificity protein 1 (Sp1). MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1), also known as ATFa-associated modulator (AM) and activating transcription factor 7-interacting protein (ATF7IP), mediates gene regulation, although the precise function of MCAF1 remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that MCAF1 is involved in Sp1-dependent maintenance of telomerase activity in cancer cells. Two evolutionarily conserved domains of MCAF1 directly interact with Sp1 and the general transcriptional apparatus. Selective depletion of MCAF1 or Sp1 down-regulates TERT and TERC genes in cultured cells, which results in decreased telomerase activity. The transcriptionally active form of RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factor ERCC3 decreased in the TERT promoter under the loss of MCAF1 or Sp1. Consistently, MCAF1 is found to be frequently overexpressed in naturally occurring cancers that originate in different tissues. Our data suggest that transcriptional function of MCAF1 facilitates telomerase expression by Sp1, which may be a common mechanism in proliferative cancer cells.

Our data suggest that transcriptional function of MCAF1 facilitates telomerase expression by Sp1, which may be a common mechanism in proliferative cancer cells. Telomerase is a multiple subunit complex that contains RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that adds telomeric hexamer repeats to the ends of chromosomes (1Colgin L.M. Reddel R.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This enzymatic activity is normally absent in most somatic cells, which results in a gradual loss of telomeres through cell division. In contrast, more than 85% of cancerous cells and in vitro immortalized cells gain telomerase activity, which is required for unlimited proliferation (3Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

TR is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, whereas TERT is expressed only in telomerase-positive cells (8Yi X. Tesmer V.M. Savre-Train I. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell.

Lingner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because the telomerase subunit genes must be appropriately regulated in vivo, abnormal expression of TERT and TERC genes induces cell deregulation. The specificity protein 1 (Sp1) plays a crucial role in transcriptional control of the TERT gene (13Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). There are five GC boxes that are consecutive binding sites of Sp1 in the TERT core promoter (14Takakura M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Hirano H. Takeda J. Yutsudo M. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 is known to cooperate with c-Myc to transactivate the TERT gene in a cell type-specific manner (15Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although Sp1 is a ubiquitous protein that targets both core promoter and enhancers, it is interesting that this protein is highly expressed in various cancers of the stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, and thyroid (16Safe S. Abdelrahim M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2438-2448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1-dependent expression of the TERT gene may provide a frequent pathway toward cancer development. However, the precise mechanism of Sp1-dependent control of telomerase expression remains to be elucidated. We initially found that methylated DNA-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1) interacts with MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1) (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), also known as ATFa-associated modulator (AM) and activating transcription factor 7-interacting protein (ATF7IP) (18De Graeve F. Bahr A. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1807-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MCAF1 binds the transcriptional repression domain of MBD1 and further recruits SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) for gene silencing in methylated DNA regions (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). AM/MCAF1 facilitates conversion of dimethyl to trimethyl histone H3 at lysine residue 9 (H3K9) by ets-related gene-associated protein with SET domain, a murine homologue of human SETDB1 (20Wang H.

Thus, MCAF1 is involved in MBD1-dependent transcriptional repression via heterochromatin assembly. Previous observations have suggested that MCAF1 and Sp1 are functionally related (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N.

Biochem. 2000; 210: 131-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for instance, MCAF1 enhances Sp1-mediated transcription by Rta protein of Epstein-Barr virus (22Chang L.K. Chung J.Y. Hong Y.R. Ichimura T. Nakao M. Liu S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6528-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 is known to interact with basal transcriptional factors including TFIIB, TFIIE, TBP/TFIID, and further with the transcriptional mediators such as the cofactor required for Sp1 (23Wierstra I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The transcriptional mediators transduce regulatory information between Sp1 and the basal transcription machinery including the core RNA polymerase II (24Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to investigate the transcriptional role of MCAF1 and Sp1 in the telomerase subunit genes. During our investigations, we have found that MCAF1 is highly expressed in human cancers that originated in many different tissues, suggesting that MCAF1 has an important role in tumorigenesis. Consistently, our data demonstrate that MCAF1 is required for Sp1-dependent maintenance of telomerase activity in cancer cells. Specific knockdown of MCAF1 or Sp1 reduced both TERT and TERC expression, which resulted in a decrease of telomerase activity. The active form of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factor were released from the TERT promoter by the loss of MCAF1 or Sp1. Two evolutionarily conserved domains of MCAF1 were responsible for direct interaction with Sp1 and the general transcriptional apparatus. These data shed light on the transcriptional mediator-like function of MCAF1 that facilitates Sp1-dependent expression of the telomerase subunit genes, which may be a common mechanism in oncogenesis. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Antibodies—Anti-MCAF1 antibodies were as described previously (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The antibodies utilized were anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-tubulin (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience), anti-GST (DAKO), anti-RNA polymerase II CTD4H8 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-His (Qiagen), anti-ERCC3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERCC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TFIIEα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-TFIIEβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were carried out as described elsewhere (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—Bacterially expressed GST and GST fusion proteins (1 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (60 μg) or His-tagged proteins (1 μg) in buffer that contained 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The input indicated 10% of the proteins in the reaction mixture. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) was diluted 10 times with buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol), and mixed with anti-MCAF1 antibodies, anti-Sp1 antibodies, or control IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h after adding 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, the bound proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Sp1, MCAF1, and TERT—HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs with Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and harvested at 60 h after transfection. Twenty-one nucleotide siRNA duplexes were designed to target mRNAs that encoded human Sp1, MCAF1, or TERT. The selected siRNA target sequences were submitted to human genome and EST databases to ensure the target specificities. These sequences are described in supplemental Table S1. The siRNAs for GL3 were as described previously (19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Quantitative PCR—HeLa cells (1 × 106) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Crude cell lysates were sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. ChIP was performed with anti-Sp1 or anti-MCAF1 antibodies, or control IgG, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Upstate Biotechnology). PCR amplification of the TERT gene promoter was carried out for 20 (the first PCR) and 26 cycles (the second PCR) under conditions of 20 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Amplification of the TERC gene promoter was performed for 35 cycles under conditions of 20 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Amplification of the ∼8 kb upstream of the TERT gene was performed for 30 cycles under conditions of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Quantitative PCR was performed on the products of ChIP in triplicate by the SYBR Green method using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and ABI 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of input DNA (10.0, 2.0, 0.4, and 0.08%). The Ct of each reaction was quantified against the standard curve. The primer sets are listed in supplemental Table S2. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using Isogen (Nippon Gene). For cDNA synthesis, 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative PCR of the target cDNAs was performed by the SYBR Green method using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each experiment was carried out at least three times. The fold relative enrichment was quantified, together with normalization by the β-actin level. The primer sets are listed in supplemental Table S2. Measurement of Telomerase Activity—Telomerase activity was measured using the quantitative telomeric repeat amplification protocol (Q-TRAP) assay (25Wege H. Chui M.S. Le H.T. Tran J.M. Zern M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: E3-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, aliquots of the supernatant were rapidly frozen and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration of lysates was determined with GeneQuant Pro (Bio-Rad). To prepare a control lysate, telomerase was inactivated by incubating at 85 °C for 10 min. The SYBR Green Q-TRAP assay was conducted with cell lysates (1.0, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 μg), 0.1 μg of telomerase primer TS, and 0.1 μg of anchored return primer ACX, in 25 μl with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2. Using the ABI PRISM 7300 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems), samples were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and amplified in 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 90 s at 60 °C. Samples, inactivated samples, and lysis buffer were used on all PCR plates. Each sample was analyzed at least in duplicate. Telomerase activity is shown relative to that in control cells. Bisulfite Genomic DNA Sequencing—Genomic DNAs were purified and treated with sodium bisulfite using the BisulFast DNA Modification Kit (Toyobo) (26Aoto T. Saitoh N. Ichimura T. Niwa H. Nakao M. Dev. Biol. 2006; 298: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), followed by PCR amplification with each of the specific primers, which contained no CpG sequences, using LA Taq polymerase (Takara). The amplified region corresponded to nucleotides 3791–4105 of the unmodified human TERT gene sequences (GenBank™ AF097365). PCR was carried out for 32 cycles under conditions of 30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (at least 15 individual clones). Primers used are shown in supplemental Table S2. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed with human Tumor Tissue Arrays including stomach, breast, and lung tumors, and various normal tissues (BioChain Institute, Inc. and ISU Abxis Co., Ltd.). The array slides were deparaffinized and then incubated in methanol with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to block the endogeneous peroxidase activity. Thereafter, tissue sections were immersed in 1.0% Block-Ace (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, covered with anti-MCAF1 antibodies, and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Visualization of the immunoreaction was performed using Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (Nichirei Bioscience) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dako). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Malinol (Muto Pure Chemicals). Statistical Analysis—Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MCAF1 Complexes with Sp1 via the Evolutionally Conserved Domains—The MCAF/AM family of proteins is characterized by two functional domains, Domain 1 and Domain 2, which are evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to humans (Fig. 1A) (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13928-13935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There is no DNA binding motif found in MCAF1. On the other hand, Sp1 has two transcriptional activation domains and a region that is mainly composed of three zinc finger motifs (27Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Previous observations have suggested that MCAF1 and Sp1 are functionally related (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ichimura T. Watanabe S. Sakamoto Y. Aoto T. Fujita N. Nakao M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6528-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the direct interaction between MCAF1 and Sp1 at the domain levels, we prepared bacterially expressed deletion mutants of MCAF1 and Sp1, which were fused to GST or His-tagged. The representatives included MCAF1 (Δ10, Δ18, and Δ8) (17Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Sp1 (Δ5, Δ6, and Δ7). GST and GST-fused portions of MCAF1 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1B, left). Sp1 bound both Domain 1 (Δ18) and Domain 2 (Δ8), but not the amino-terminal region (Δ10) of MCAF1. To further determine the region of Sp1 responsible for interacting with MCAF1, we used GST-fused portions of Sp1 and His-tagged MCAF1 (Fig. 1B, right). GST and GST-fused portions of Sp1 on glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with His-tagged MCAF1 (Δ18 or Δ8). Domain 1 (Δ18) of MCAF1 bound Δ5 and Δ6, whereas Domain 2 (Δ8) bound Δ6 and Δ7 of Sp1. The amino-terminal region of Sp1 that contained activation domains did not bind MCAF1, and the regions of MCAF1 except Domains 1 and 2 did not bind Sp1 (data not shown). To confirm whether MCAF1 formed a complex with Sp1, immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-MCAF1 and anti-Sp1 antibodies were performed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). MCAF1 was found in the immunoprecipitates with Sp1. Conversely, Sp1 was present in the MCAF1 immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that the conserved domains of MCAF1 directly bind the carboxyl-terminal region of Sp1, resulting in the formation of an MCAF1-Sp1 complex. Formation of MCAF1-Sp1 Complex in Telomerase Subunit Gene Promoters—To investigate the involvement of the MCAF1-Sp1 complex in endogenous gene regulation, ChIP analysis was carried out on HeLa cells. Telomerase-associated TERT and TERC genes are reported to be transactivated by Sp1, through five and four binding sites within the core promoter regions, respectively (Fig. 2A) (28Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhao J.Q. Hoare S.F. McFarlane R. Muir S. Parkinson E.K. Black D.M. Keith W.N. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After formaldehyde-based cross-linking of protein and DNA, chromatin fragmented by sonication was immunoprecipitated with anti-MCAF1 or anti-Sp1 antibodies, followed by PCR amplification using specific primers for the promoter sequences (Fig. 2B). MCAF1 and Sp1 were found in the TERT and TERC promoter regions. In addition, the ∼8 kb upstream site of the TERT gene was not bound by these proteins. Species-matched IgG was used for immunoprecipitation as a control. In addition, both proteins were also found in the distinct Sp1-dependent BRCA1 gene promoter (supplemental Fig. S1). These data show that MCAF1 and Sp1 coexist in the TERT and TERC gene promoters, which suggests a role for MCAF1 in the Sp1-dependent telomerase expression. To address the functional relationship of MCAF1 and Sp1, we knocked down MCAF1 or Sp1 by using more than two siRNAs specific for each protein. HeLa cells were transfected with these siRNAs and then grown for 60 h. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that MCAF1 and Sp1 were depleted at both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2, C and D). Sp1 knockdown did not affect the levels of MCAF1, and vice versa. There was no significant effect of control siRNAs. Because the effect of each siRNA was basically similar, we later presented the data with MCAF1–2 and Sp1–2 siRNAs. Under knockdown conditions, we examined the amount of MCAF1 and Sp1 in the TERT promoter, using quantitative ChIP analysis (Fig. 2E). MCAF1 knockdown reduced the known protein, but not Sp1, bound to the gene promoter (gray bars, p < 0.01). In contrast, the loss of Sp1 markedly decreased MCAF1 as well as Sp1 in the TERT promoter (open bars, p < 0.01), compared with the controls. This suggests that MCAF1 is localized to the TERT gene promoter in an Sp1-dependent manner, via complex formation of these proteins. MCAF1 and Sp1 Are Required for Maintaining Telomerase Activity—To clarify the role of MCAF1 and Sp1 in transcriptional control of telomerase components, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR for TERT and TERC mRNAs (Fig. 3A). The transcripts of TERT and TERC genes were significantly down-regulated by the knockdown of MCAF1 or Sp1 in HeLa cells (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). The data suggest that MCAF1 cooperates with Sp1 to activate transcription from the TERT and TERC genes. We had difficulty detecting the TERT protein, probably because of recognition inefficiency of anti-TERT antibodies; therefore, we assessed the effect of MCAF1 and Sp1 on endogenous telomerase activity, using a Q-TRAP assay (25Wege H. Chui M.S. Le H.T. Tran J.M. Zern M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: E3-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells under the knockdown of MCAF1 or Sp1, and were serially diluted for the TRAP assay, followed by quantitative PCR using specific primers for telomeric repeats (Fig. 3B). Compared with the controls, telomerase activity markedly decreased in the MCAF1 or Sp1 knockdown cells (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). These results suggest that the MCAF1-Sp1 complex maintains telomerase activity by inducing TERT and TERC expression. To further evaluate the effect of the MCAF1-Sp1 complex on cellular proliferation, we counted the cell numbers under knockdown of MCAF1 or Sp1 (Fig. 3C). MCAF1- or Sp1-depleted cells showed lower proliferative activity in comparison to the controls. These data were very analogous to the TERT knockdown by using two specific siRNAs (Fig. 3D). As expected, the knockdown of TERT diminished the known mRNAs and the resulting telomerase activity (supplemental Fig. 3). Collectively, these data suggest that the MCAF1-Sp1 complex is required for maintaining telomerase activity and proliferation in the cancer cells examined. MCAF1-Sp1 Complex Is Involved in Maintaining the Localization of Phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II and General Transcription Factor in the TERT Promoter—To examine transcriptional control by the MCAF1-Sp1 complex, we analyzed the status of modified histones in the TERT promoter, by a quantitative ChIP analysis using specific antibodies (supplemental Fig. S4). Among the transcriptionally active marks tested, H3 acetylation alone was diminished in the Sp1 knockdown cells, whereas MCAF1 or Sp1 depletion showed no significant changes in H3K4 methylation and H4 acetylation. These results may have been caused by the originally low levels of these modified histones in the TERT promoter. Because MCAF1 and Sp1 are associated with RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors (18De Graeve F. Bahr A. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1807-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Wierstra I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we then tested for the presence of the transcriptionally active form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II (Ser 5-P)) and the excision-repair, complementing defective, in Chinese hamster 3/xeroderma pigmentosum B (ERCC3/XPB), an essential component of TFIIH, in the TERT promoter (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockdown of MCAF1 or Sp1 resulted in significant reduction of both Pol II (Ser 5-P) and ERCC3 in the gene promoter (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). Thus, the MCAF1-Sp1 complex maintains the localization of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and ERCC3 in the TERT core promoter. To confirm the fundamental role of MCAF1, we characterized the ability of the protein to bind the general transcription apparatus. MCAF1 in the HeLa nuclear extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-MCAF1 antibodies, and cellular ERCC3 and Pol II were found in the MCAF1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C, left). The MCAF1 immunoprecipitates also contained TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, and ERCC2/XPD (data not shown). We next immunoprecipitated ERCC3, Pol II, TFIIE-α, and TFIIE-β from the nuclear extract with appropriate antibodies, and the presence of MCAF1 was detected in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C, right). Because TFIID is known to interact with Sp1, we examined whether the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), an essential component of TFIID, interacts with MCAF1 (supplemental Fig. S5). Sp1, but not MCAF1, was found in the TBP immunoprecipitates, suggesting that TBP preferentially coexists with Sp1. To further determine the region of MCAF1 that interacted with general transcription factor"
https://openalex.org/W2062057087,"PEP-19 is a small calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein that greatly increases the rates of association and dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of CaM, an effect that is mediated by an acidic/IQ sequence in PEP-19. We show here using NMR that PEP-19 is an intrinsically disordered protein, but with residual structure localized to its acidic/IQ motif. We also show that the kon and koff rates for binding PEP-19 to apo-CaM are at least 50-fold slower than for binding to Ca2+-CaM. These data indicate that intrinsic disorder confers plasticity that allows PEP-19 to bind to either apo- or Ca2+-CaM via different structural modes, and that complex formation may be facilitated by conformational selection of residual structure in the acidic/IQ sequence.

They are present at high concentrations (up to 40–50 μm), but have no known activity other than binding to CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+. We showed that PEP-19 and RC3 have unique effects on Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM. Specifically, PEP-19 greatly increases the Ca2+ binding kon and koff rates, but does not alter Ca2+ binding affinity (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas RC3 increases koff but has a lesser effect on the kon thereby decreasing the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM (6Gaertner T.R. Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9374-9382Google Scholar). These data point to PEP-19 and RC3 as modulators or regulators of CaM signaling that act at the level of Ca2+ binding to CaM. PEP-19 is of particular interest because its expression is not restricted to the central nervous system, and its pattern of expression suggests a link to Ca2+ metabolism. For example, the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus shows PEP-19 is expressed in neuroendocrine organs such as prostate, uterus, and kidney, which require high Ca2+ for secretory and transport functions. PEP-19 is induced in lactating breast (7Rudolph M.C. McManaman J.L. Phang T. Russell T. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 28: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and during osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (8Xiao J. Wu Y. Chen R. Lin Y. Wu L. Tian W. Liu L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 309: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which also have a need for high Ca2+ levels. A protective role for PEP-19 against high Ca2+ levels is suggested by overexpression of PEP-19, which inhibits apoptosis in PC-12 cells (9Erhardt J.A. Legos J.J. Johanson R.A. Slemmon J.R. Wang X. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3719-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and protects HEK293T cells against death due to Ca2+ overload (10Kanazawa Y. Makino M. Morishima Y. Yamada K. Nabeshima T. Shirakaki Y. Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, a general protective role for PEP-19 was put forth previously based on the fact that purkinje cells of the cerebellum and granule-cell neurons in the dentate gyrus, which have high levels of PEP-19, are largely spared from the effects of Alzheimer disease, whereas PEP-19 negative cells are severely affected (11Slemmon J.R. Feng B. Erhardt J.A. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 22: 99-113Crossref Google Scholar). Conversely, cell types that are most affected by Huntington disease exhibit a significant loss of expression of PEP-19 (11Slemmon J.R. Feng B. Erhardt J.A. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 22: 99-113Crossref Google Scholar). A protective role for PEP-19 against the high Ca2+ in normal or pathogenic conditions emphasizes the importance of characterizing its biophysical properties and its interaction with CaM. We show here that PEP-19 is intrinsically disordered, but with residual structure localized to the acidic/IQ region that regulates Ca2+ binding to CaM. Moreover, this region remains partially structured even when bound to CaM. These data point to structural disorder as a dominant feature of PEP-19 that compliments the conformational plasticity of CaM to allow binding in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and facile transition of the CaM·PEP-19 complex from apo to Ca2+-bound states. Recombinant Proteins and Peptides-Recombinant CaM and PEP19 were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol.

PEP-19 with a C-terminal Gly-Cys extension was labeled with DDPM as described previously (15Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.A. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy-CD measurements were performed on an Aviv 62ADS spectropolarimeter. Free protein, or protein mixtures at 1:1 molar ratio, were scanned at a concentration of 20 μm in a buffer containing 10 mm MES, 100 mm KCl, at pH 6.3 in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2 in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Wavelength scans were performed at 25 °C, except experiments involving PEP-19 were performed at 25, 50, and 70 °C. Recording time was 10 s in 1-nm steps in the range of 190–260 nm with the data averaged over 3 experiments. The Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm (16Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (14962) Google Scholar) was applied to the curve derived from the averaged data. NMR Methodology-Backbone assignment of [13C,15N]PEP-19 was carried out using a Varian Inova 800 MHz and Bruker DRX 800 MHz spectrometers using three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO experiments at 298 K. For experiments requiring decalcified proteins, proteins and buffers were passed over a calcium sponge (Molecular Probes). The decalcified proteins was lyophilized and resuspended to 0.5 mm in decalcified buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.3, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 5% D2O. For Ca2+ samples, 1 mm EGTA was replaced by 5 mm CaCl2 in the buffer. Experiments involving CaM or CaM·PEP-19 complex were performed on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TXI CryoProbe at 298 K. The data were processed using FELIX 2004 software. Resonance assignments for apo-CaM were made by comparison with literature reports (17Ikura M. Krinks M. Tochia D.A. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and confirmed by three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, CBCAHN, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and 15N-edited NOESY experiments (18Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Titration of [15N]apo-CaM with PEP-19 was made using a 10 mm stock solution of PEP-19 and a 0.5 mm sample of apo-CaM. PEP-19 was added in 1/8 molar eq to the NMR sample. Correction in protein concentration was taken into effect during data analysis. The average amide chemical shift change was calculated using the following formula, Δδavg=(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/5)22 where ΔδH = change in 1H chemical shift; and Δδn = change in 15N chemical shift. Equilibrium Binding of PEP-19 to CaM-A FRET-based assay to measure equilibrium binding of PEP-19 to CaM was described previously (15Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.A. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 0.5 μm IAEDANS-labeled CaM(T110C) was prepared in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.1 mm EGTA. Concentrated stock solutions of DDPM-labeled PEP-19 in the same solution were then used to titrate CaM. The final increase in volume was less than 10%. We assessed potential nonspecific FRET effects using DDPM coupled to free Cys, and found a linear 5% decrease in fluorescence from donor-labeled CaM per increment of 25 μm Cys-DDPM. The FRET effect between donor-labeled CaM and acceptor-labeled PEP-19 was corrected for this nonspecific effect, and the upper concentration of DDPM-labeled PEP-19 was limited to 50 μm. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived by fitting titration curves to the following equation, S=Si+(Sf-Si)(L+Ct+Kd)-(L+Ct+Kd)2-4CtL2Ct where S = fluorescence signal at a given titration point; Si = initial signal in the absence of ligand; Sf = final signal in the presence of excess ligand; L = total ligand added at a given titration point; Ct = total CaM concentration; and Kd = dissociation constant. The equation was used to fit plots of S versus L with Si, Sf, and Kd as fitted variables. Stopped-flow Measurements-Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed at 23 °C using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SX.18 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a 150 watt Xe/Hg lamp, and a dead time of 1.7 ms. All solutions contained a base buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl. The concentrations of other reagents in stopped-flow mixing solutions A and B are defined in the figure legends. The final concentration of these reagents in the optical chamber was one-half of these values, because the mixing ratio was 1:1. Computational Model-A model for cooperative Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM was reported previously (15Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.A. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This was used to determine microscopic Ca2+ binding constants in the presence of PEP-19 for use in a model that predicts the effect of PEP-19 on the rate of association of the C-domain of CaM with a high affinity CaM target protein in response to an increase in free Ca2+. Details of the model are provided under supplemental materials. Circular Dichroism and NMR Show PEP-19 Is an Intrinsically Unstructured Protein-CD spectroscopy was used to characterize the secondary structure in PEP-19 as a function of CaCl2, temperature, and trifluoroethanol (TFE). Fig. 1A shows that the far UV spectrum of PEP-19 is characteristic of a random-coil with a large negative ellipticity at 200 nm in the absence or presence of CaCl2. The mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm indicates that 3% of the residues are helical (19Pelton J.T. McLean L.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Increasing the temperature to 70 °C did not change the random coil nature of the protein (data not shown). CD spectrum collected in the presence of the helix-promoting solvent TFE indicates substantial α-helix content from the negative bands at 208 and 222 nm. A maximal helical content of about 50% was estimated from CD spectra collected in 40% TFE. Thus, the CD data shows that PEP-19 is highly disordered and unstructured but has the potential to form regions of α-helix. Fig. 1B shows the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled PEP-19. All protein backbone amides are clearly visible, but chemical shifts are restricted to a window of 0.8 ppm in the 1H dimension, and the resonances show very narrow line widths. Both of these observations are hallmarks of proteins that lack stable long-range interactions, and indicate that PEP-19 is composed of unstructured or highly flexible regions. This is similar to that seen for RC3 (20Ran X. Miao H.H. Sheu F.S. Yang D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5142-5150Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the 6 Gly resonances in PEP-19 (circled in the spectrum) have chemical shifts that are characteristic of proteins denatured in 8 m urea (21Logan T.M. Theriault Y. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which also supports the conclusion that PEP-19 is disordered. Primary Sequence Analysis Indicates PEP-19 Has Residual Helical Content-We used a combination of structure prediction algorithms to identify potential variations in order/disorder along the primary sequence of PEP-19 (22Obradovic Z. Peng K. Vucetic S. Radivojac P. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2005; 61: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 23Yang Z.R. Thomson R. McNeil P. Esnouf R.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that both PONDR VLS1 (open circles) and RONN (closed circles) predict PEP-19 to be disordered, but its C-terminal half is disordered to a lesser extent than the N-terminal half. The sequence of PEP-19 was next analyzed using AGADIR (24Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 25Munoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) to predict localized regions of residual helical structure as shown in Fig. 2B. AGADIR predicts that PEP-19 has an overall helical content of less than 1% under conditions used in the NMR experiments, which is punctuated by two distinct regions of residual helicity. One region spans residues 38 to 54, including part of the IQ motif. The second region shows lower helicity and is upstream between residues 20 to 30. Fig. 2C shows that TFE has the greatest effect on amides for those residues predicted in Fig. 2B to have residual helical structure. We next used a variety of NMR experiments to identify regions of residual structure in PEP-19 under native conditions. Secondary shifts, which are deviations of 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts from random coil values, can be used as indicators of secondary structure due to their dependence on backbone dihedral angles. Relative to random coils values, 13Cα resonances are typically shifted downfield ∼3.1 ppm for residues in stable α-helices, and shifted upfield (∼1.5 ppm) in stable β-sheets (26Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 28Wishart D.S. Case D.A. Method Enzymol. 2001; 338: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The 13Cβ resonances are less sensitive to helical environments, but are shifted downfield by about 2.5 ppm in β sheets. Residues in less ordered regions of proteins will have smaller deviations from random coil values as a result of rapid conformational averaging. Positive 13Cα secondary shifts, and weaker negative 13Cβ secondary shifts for Glu38 to Lys52 in Fig. 3, A and B, indicate residual helical structures in this region of PEP-19. As indicated by the shaded regions, these residues coincide with the region predicated by AGADIR to have the greatest extent of residual helix. Based on an empirical relationship between fractional helicity and 13Cα chemical shifts (26Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), PEP-19 is calculated to have an overall helicity of 2.2%, whereas residues 38 to 52 have a fractional helicity of about 18%. Another indicator of potential residual structure is the intensity of the water peak derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Residues in PEP-19 that populate residual secondary structures would be predicted to have greater protection from solvent, and lower exchange rates. Indeed, Fig. 3C shows that the region spanning Val25 to Ser61 has weaker exchange peaks (small dNH,H2O exchange peaks) relative to residues Arg3 to Lys24, indicating potential residual secondary structure in the C-terminal half of PEP-19. The AGADIR program predicts that the helical content of the C-terminal region of PEP-19 will decrease as the ionic strength increases. Indeed, Fig. 3D shows addition of KCl causes small but detectable changes in backbone amides in the C-terminal portion of the protein. These small chemical shift changes correlate well with the presence of the residual α-helical structure in the C-region of PEP-19 determined by 13Cα chemical shifts in Fig. 3A. Together, data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 provide computational and experimental evidence that PEP-19 is an intrinsically unstructured protein, but with regions of predicted residual helical structure localized to the C-terminal portion of the protein. Effect of Complex Formation on CD Spectra-Fig. 4 compares the CD spectra of CaM·PEP-19 complexes to summed spectra of free proteins in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The difference between the measured data and the summation spectra allow an estimation of secondary structure induced by binding PEP-19 to CaM. We found that the CD spectra for the CaM·PEP-19 complex was similar in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (closed and open triangles), with a difference in calculated helical content of only 1.4%. However, there is a decrease in molar ellipticity at 222 nm for the complexes relative to the summed spectra of the free proteins, and this difference is especially pronounced in the absence of Ca2+. This suggests an increase in overall α-helical content upon complex formation, possibly due to changes in the secondary structure of PEP-19 or rearrangement of α-helices in apo-CaM. Effect of CaM on PEP-19 Amide Chemical Shifts-We used backbone amide chemical shifts to identify residues in PEP-19 that are affected by binding CaM. Similar results were obtained using either apo- or Ca2+-CaM. Fig. 5A shows a portion of the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC of 15N-labeled PEP-19 collected in the absence (gray), or presence of apo-CaM (black). Upon binding CaM, PEP-19 residues were unaffected (e.g. Lys24), slightly shifted (e.g. Val26), or severely broadened (e.g. Asp31, Glu40, Gln47, Lys57, and Lys55). Fig. 5B summarizes these effects relative to the primary sequence of PEP-19. A striking observation is that only the C-terminal region of PEP-19 appears to participate in binding CaM. Residues 24–61 and 26–61 in PEP-19 are affected upon binding apo-CaM and Ca2+-CaM, respectively. The majority of these residues, including those associated with the core IQ motif, are broadened beyond detection. Severe broadening of resonances at substoichiometric levels of ligand is characteristic of chemical exchange that is intermediate on the NMR time scale, but resonances for PEP-19 do not refocus in the presence of excess CaM. This suggests that exchange broadening is not driven simply by rate constants of the binary interaction between CaM and PEP-19. One possibility is that PEP-19 is not fully ordered when bound to CaM, but rather exists in relatively slow exchange between multiple states, possibly helical and disordered states. If true, then addition of TFE may stabilize the structure of PEP-19 when bound to CaM and allow detection of amide resonances. Fig. 5C compares a region of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra for free PEP-19 (light gray), with spectra collected after sequential additions of 15% TFE (dark gray) and Ca2+-CaM (black). TFE induces a general upfield shift in amides of free PEP-19, which is characteristic of helix formation, and is consistent with the effect of TFE on the CD spectra of PEP-19 shown in Fig. 1. Addition of Ca2+-CaM in the presence of TFE allows observation of amides for all residues in PEP-19, with the greatest change seen for residues in the C-terminal, as shown for Thr16 and Thr10 versus Ala45 and Ala58. Interestingly, some residues in the C-terminal region of PEP-19, such as Ala45 and Ala58 in Fig. 5C, show chemical shift changes upon addition of Ca2+-CaM that are a linear extension of the initial shift caused by TFE. This most likely indicates that Ca2+-CaM causes a further increase of the percent helical content of this region. In contrast, residues such as Ile46 of the IQ dipeptide, show a distinct bidirectional change in chemical shift upon sequential addition of TFE and Ca2+-CaM, which likely indicates a direct interaction of these residues with CaM. Effect of PEP-19 on CaM Amide Chemical Shifts-We previously reported that PEP-19 bound primarily to the C-domain of Ca2+-CaM and that amide chemical shifts showed characteristics of fast exchange on the NMR time scale (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rate of dissociation of PEP-19 from Ca2+-CaM was as least 154 s–1 based on the largest 1H change. Similar to Ca2+-CaM, amide chemical shifts for residues in the N-domain of apo-CaM, such as Asp58 in Fig. 6A, are unaffected by PEP-19, but show an average decrease in intensity of about 30% due to the increased mass of the CaM·PEP-19 complex. In contrast to Ca2+-CaM, amide chemical shifts in the central linker of apo-CaM show characteristics of slow exchange upon binding to PEP-19. For example, Fig. 6, B and C, shows that two resonances are observed for Thr79 in the presence of 0.5 eq of PEP-19, but a single resonance corresponding to the bound form is observed at 1 eq. A rate of dissociation of PEP-19 from apo-CaM of about 5 s–1 can be estimated from line broadening associated with this slow exchange phenomenon. Residues in the C-domain of apo-CaM are severely broadened upon binding PEP-19. Fig. 6, A–C, shows line broadening of Met109 and Met145 upon addition of 0.5 eq of PEP-19, and broadening beyond detection at 1 eq. Resonances that account for the majority of the C-domain residues are observed at higher concentrations of PEP-19 as shown by the boxed cross-peaks in Fig. 6D. These amides could not be assigned by titration due to the slow exchange limit, and they showed weak intensity, suggesting broadening due to a chemical exchange process. The selective effect of PEP-19 on the central and C-region of apo-CaM is emphasized by Fig. 6E, which shows the ratio of amide resonance intensity for each amino acid in the presence and absence of 0.5 eq of PEP-19 (I/Io). It is clear from this analysis that the relative intensities of amides in the C-domain are decreased to a much greater extent than those in the N-domain, and that this is a global effect on the C-domain. Thus, PEP-19 binds preferentially to the C-domain of both apo and Ca2+-CaM. Binding of PEP-19 to Apo-CaM Exhibits Slow kon and koff Rates-The data in Fig. 6 show that CaM amide chemical shifts exhibit slow to intermediate exchange in the absence of Ca2+. This could be explained if PEP-19 bound with higher affinity to apo-CaM relative to Ca2+-CaM, however, PEP-19 was shown to bind to CaM-Sepharose with comparable affinity in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (29Slemmon J.R.

To further explore this phenomenon, we designed a binding assay based on FRET between donor-labeled CaM (CaMD) and acceptor-labeled PEP-19 (PEP-19A) (15Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.A. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows that PEP-19A binds to CaMD with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 20 and 13 μm in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. We next determined the effect of Ca2+ on the rates of dissociation (koff) and association (kon) of PEP-19 with CaM. In the presence of Ca2+ both koff and kon were too great to measure using a stopped-flow fluorimeter with a dead time of 1.7 ms. This means the koff is at least 400 s–1, and that the kon is at least 20 μm–1 s–1, given a Kd of 20 μm for binding PEP-19 to Ca2+-CaM. In striking contrast, Fig. 7B shows a slow rate of dissociation of PEP-19A from apo-CaMD of 5.9 s–1, and Fig. 7C shows that a pseudo first-order kon of 1.0 μm–1 s–1 was easily measured for the association of PEP-19A with apo-CaMD. PEP-19 Is Intrinsically Disordered but with Residual Structure-Our previous studies focused on the effects of PEP-19 on the Ca2+ binding properties of calmodulin (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q.

In this report we investigate the biophysical properties of isolated PEP-19, and its interaction with apo- and Ca2+-CaM. Sequence analysis, CD, and NMR data all demonstrate that PEP-19 is a member of the large family of intrinsically disordered proteins, many of which have regulatory roles (30Dunker A.K. Cortese M.S. Romero P. Iakoucheva L.M. Uversky V.N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5129-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 31Uversky V.N. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 215-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). It is thought that disorder allows regulatory proteins to bind specifically, but with low affinity, to multiple partners. This structural design is ideal for PEP-19 because it must bind to apo- and Ca2+-CaM, but with low affinity such that it does not competitively inhibit activation of other Ca2+-CaM-dependent proteins. Intrinsic disorder also raises the possibility that PEP-19 binds to other EF-hand regulatory proteins that are particularly abundant in neuronal tissue. From a general perspective, intrinsic disorder appears to be an integral aspect of CaM signaling. Disorder in a CaM target was first demonstrated for melittin, which transitions from a random coil to a helix when bound to Ca2+-CaM (32Seeholzer S.H. Cohn M. Putkey J.A. Means A.R. Crespi H.L. Proc.

https://openalex.org/W1975954876,"Although advanced age is linked with an increased incidence of lung carcinomas, elderly patients develop fewer metastatic tumors than their younger counterparts. Since extracellular matrix controls carcinogenesis, we studied the effect of aged fibrillar collagen (rat tail) on the invasiveness of lung carcinoma cells (H322, H358). Two- and three-dimensional invasion assays revealed a reduced migration of lung cancer cells through a matrix of collagen from old (24 mo) compared with young (2 mo) or adult (12 mo) rats. This was most strongly observed for H322 cells, which had a better migration behavior than H358 cells. Since old collagen was increasingly modified by advanced glycation end products (AGEs; fluorescing AGEs, nonfluorescing carboxymethyllysine), we generated different AGE-collagens by treating collagen with ribose or alpha-dicarbonyls. Similarly to old collagen, AGE-collagen reduced the invasive migration of H322 cells. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that old and AGE-collagens impair distinct mechanisms contributing to cell migration, i.e., efficient cell adhesion and proteolytic degradation of collagen by membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP; MT-MMP3 in H322 cells). Our data indicate that age-related alterations of the extracellular matrix contribute to a less invasive behavior of lung carcinoma cells, in which AGE modifications of aged collagen seem to play an important role."
https://openalex.org/W2007950734,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor activation inhibits N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked currents in hippocampal and cortical neurons via the activation of phospholipase Cgamma, PKC, the release of intracellular calcium, and a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In the hippocampus, the majority of NMDA receptors are heteromeric; most are composed of 2 NR1 subunits and 2 NR2A or 2 NR2B subunits. Using NR2B- and NR2A-specific antagonists, we demonstrate that PDGF-BB treatment preferentially inhibits NR2B-containing NMDA receptor currents in CA1 hippocampal neurons and enhances long-term depression in an NR2B subunit-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment of hippocampal slices or cultures with PDGF-BB decreases the surface localization of NR2B but not of NR2A subunits. PDGFbeta receptors colocalize to a higher degree with NR2B subunits than with NR2A subunits. After neuronal injury, PDGFbeta receptors and PDGF-BB are up-regulated and PDGFbeta receptor activation is neuroprotective against glutamate-induced neuronal damage in cultured neurons. We demonstrate that the neuroprotective effects of PDGF-BB are occluded by the NR2B antagonist, Ro25-6981, and that PDGF-BB promotes NMDA signaling to CREB and ERK1/2. We conclude that PDGFbetaR signaling, by preferentially targeting NR2B receptors, provides an important mechanism for neuroprotection by growth factors in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2071648245,"Mini-proteins, defined as polypeptides containing no more than 100 amino acids, are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They play significant roles in various biological processes, and their regulatory functions gradually attract the attentions of scientists. However, the functions of the majority of mini-proteins are still largely unknown due to the constraints of experimental methods and bioinformatic analysis.In this article, we extracted a total of 180,879 mini-proteins from the annotations of 532 sequenced genomes, including 491 strains of Bacteria and 41 strains of Archaea. The average proportion of mini-proteins among all genomic proteins is approximately 10.99%, but different strains exhibit remarkable fluctuations. These mini-proteins display two notable characteristics. First, the majority are species-specific proteins with an average proportion of 58.79% among six representative phyla. Second, an even larger proportion (70.03% among all strains) is hypothetical proteins. However, a fraction of highly conserved hypothetical proteins potentially play crucial roles in organisms. Among mini-proteins with known functions, it seems that regulatory and metabolic proteins are more abundant than essential structural proteins. Furthermore, domains in mini-proteins seem to have greater distributions in Bacteria than Eukarya. Analysis of the evolutionary progression of these domains reveals that they have diverged to new patterns from a single ancestor.Mini-proteins are ubiquitous in bacterial and archaeal species and play significant roles in various functions. The number of mini-proteins in each genome displays remarkable fluctuation, likely resulting from the differential selective pressures that reflect the respective life-styles of the organisms. The answers to many questions surrounding mini-proteins remain elusive and need to be resolved experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2020724746,"We found that several major chromosomal fragile sites in human lymphomas, including the bcl-2 major breakpoint region, bcl-1 major translocation cluster, and c-Myc exon 1-intron 1 boundary, contain distinctive sequences of consecutive cytosines exhibiting a high degree of reactivity with the structure-specific chemical probe bisulfite. To assess the inherent structural variability of duplex DNA in these regions and to determine the range of structures reactive to bisulfite, we have performed bisulfite probing on genomic DNA in vitro and in situ; on duplex DNA in supercoiled and linearized plasmids; and on oligonucleotide DNA/DNA and DNA/2′-O-methyl RNA duplexes. Bisulfite is significantly more reactive at the frayed ends of DNA duplexes, which is expected given that bisulfite is an established probe of single-stranded DNA. We observed that bisulfite also distinguishes between more subtle sequence/structural differences in duplex DNA. Supercoiled plasmids are more reactive than linear DNA; and sequences containing consecutive cytosines, namely GGGCCC, are more reactive than those with alternating guanine and cytosine, namely GCGCGC. Circular dichroism and x-ray crystallography show that the GGGCCC sequence forms an intermediate B/A structure. Molecular dynamics simulations also predict an intermediate B/A structure for this sequence, and probe calculations suggest greater bisulfite accessibility of cytosine bases in the intermediate B/A structure over canonical B- or A-form DNA. Electrostatic calculations reveal that consecutive cytosine bases create electropositive patches in the major groove, predicting enhanced localization of the bisulfite anion at homo-C tracts over alternating G/C sequences. These characteristics of homo-C tracts in duplex DNA may be associated with DNA-protein interactions in vivo that predispose certain genomic regions to chromosomal fragility.

The sequence-specific structural variations of the dsDNA 5The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; MBR, major breakpoint region; MTC, major translocation cluster; oligo, oligonucleotide; nt, nucleotide; MD, molecular dynamics. helix are well documented (1Saenger W.

For example, DNA sequences with consecutive A (or T) bases can adopt a variation of the B-form helix with a narrower minor groove, whereas sequences with consecutive G (or C) bases are more prone to adopt the A-form helix under dehydrating conditions (5Hud N.V. Plavec J. Biopolymers. 2003; 69: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The A-form helix observed in RNA and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes is present during transcription and replication and sometimes when DNA is bound to proteins (6Wahl M.C. Sundaralingam M.

Most reported DNA crystal structures exhibit either the B-form or A-form helical structure, with a small fraction exhibiting an intermediate structure. A strong correlation exists between the propensity of a given DNA sequence to adopt a non-B-form structure and the interaction of solvent (water and ions) with the major and minor grooves (5Hud N.V. Plavec J. Biopolymers. 2003; 69: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but neither the natural range of DNA conformations under physiologic solution-phase conditions nor how subtle variations in DNA structure may influence the activity of DNA binding proteins is well understood.The structure of a particular sequence of dsDNA is often inferred from its pattern of reactivity with structure-specific chemical or enzymatic probes. After treatment with such a probe, the DNA is typically cleaved at reactive sites, and the positions of these cleaved sites are calculated from the fragment lengths observed using gel-based detection methods such as direct labeling, primer extension, and ligation-mediated PCR.Unlike cleavage-based methods, bisulfite converts single-stranded, unmethylated cytosines into uracils, which, in the context of DNA, can be cloned and sequenced (11Gough G.W. Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R.

This method is extremely sensitive, highly reproducible, technically simpler to perform, ensures specificity to the sequence of interest, and allows one to examine specific clones and thereby resolve multiple structures. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of bisulfite in analyzing conceptually simple, stable structures such as R-loops and cruciforms (11Gough G.W. Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). For these structures, the reasons for the observed pattern of bisulfite reactivity are very clear; they contain completely unpaired cytosines, and those cytosines are the primary ones to react.However, in genomic regions without demonstrated R-looping or cruciforming ability, the reasons for bisulfite reactivity are less clear, as at the bcl-1 major translocation cluster (MTC) and possibly the bcl-2 major breakpoint region (MBR) (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Reactivity is largely symmetrical between the two strands, increases with supercoiling, and does not depend on the source of the DNA. Because the structural basis for reactivity in these presumably double-stranded regions is unclear, we performed bisulfite probing on oligonucleotides containing sequences previously characterized by other groups using other methods (16Ng H.L. Kopka M.L. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Dornberger U. Leijon M. Fritzsche H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6957-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Integration of the genomic in situ and in vitro studies with additional methods as done here (circular dichroism) and elsewhere (x-ray crystallography and NMR) have permitted us to formulate a coherent molecular dynamic view of how regions with consecutive cytosine induce a conformation that is intermediate between B-form and A-form DNA. The presence of this conformation in zones of chromosomal fragility may be relevant to understanding why they are fragile.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBisulfite Analysis of Duplex Oligonucleotides-As required for bisulfite probing, we lengthened the ends to improve stability at 37 °C and lengthened one strand to provide space for PCR primers. As a result, each substrate is composed of a long strand (68-70 nt) and a short strand (29-31 nt), but only the long strand can be PCR-amplified and sequenced, and thus only long strand C to U conversions can be detected. The single-stranded arms contain no cytosines to prevent any PCR bias toward less-reacted molecules, and this arrangement also allows us to see reactivity at the ends of the double-stranded portion.DNA oligos were ordered from Operon Biotechnologies, and oligos containing 2′-O-methyl RNA were ordered from IDT. All oligonucleotides were purified using denaturing PAGE. 650 pmol of gel-purified long strand oligo was mixed with 1,300 pmol of gel-purified short strand oligo in 65 μl of TE with 100 mm NaCl in a screw-cap tube and annealed by boiling the tube in 1 liter of water for 5 min and then allowing to cool at room temperature overnight. Bisulfite mixture was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of NaHSO3 (Sigma S-8890) with 0.525 ml of double distilled H2O and 0.2626 ml of 2 m NaOH and then mixing 457.5 μl of the resulting solution with 12.5 μl of 20 mm hydroquinone. 15 μl of annealed oligo was mixed with 235 μl of bisulfite mixture and put into an air incubator at 37 °C for 16 h. After treatment, oligos were serially precipitated with ethanol until the pellet could be dissolved in 20 μl of TE, and 5 μl was run on 5% native mini-PAGE along with small amounts of component single-stranded oligos and untreated substrate more than one lane away. The gel was stained with 0.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide in deionized water for 20 min with light shaking, transferred to a UV transilluminator overlain with clean plastic wrap, and the double-stranded form cut out with a clean razor blade. The gel slice was treated four times with 0.3 m NaOH for 5 min at room temperature, washed four times with TE for 5 min at room temperature, and then crushed and soaked in 200 μl of PAGE diffusion buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 37 °C, 250 rpm for >8 h. The supernatant was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of TE. 0.5 μl was used for a 10-μl PCR with primers AT131 and AT27 using TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, 55 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s, with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Primers are designed to amplify only the long strand and do not anneal to any cytosines on the long strand, preventing bisulfite conversion PCR bias. PCR products were checked by running on 5% native PAGE and topo TA-cloned (Invitrogen), and individual molecules were sequenced on a Li-Cor IR2 DNA analyzer using M13 forward primer according to the manufacturers’ directions. Molecules with bisulfite conversions at every or all but one cytosine were interpreted as having become single-stranded either before or during bisulfite treatment and were not used for analysis. 16 molecules of data were obtained for each PCR, and two PCRs were done for each bisulfite treatment, and two bisulfite treatments were done for each substrate, giving 64 molecules of data per substrate. Substrates are listed long strand-short strand as follows: GGGCCC, AT160-AT161; GGCGCC, AT162-AT163; GGCC, AT164-AT165; GCGC, AT166-AT167; CGCG, AT168-AT169; GCGCGC, AT183-AT184; 2′-O-methyl-GGGCCC, AT183-AT259; 2′-O-methylGCGCGC, AT160-AT264.

Each duplex was solvated in a periodic box containing TIP3P water molecules, with the box extending 12 Å from the extremes of the solute, giving about 6000 water molecules. The duplexes were neutralized by addition of 26 sodium ions. Following preliminary minimization, the simulations were run with a time step of 0.002 ps, a residue-based cutoff of 8 Å, the particle-mesh Ewald method for electrostatic interactions, and application of SHAKE to all hydrogen atoms (18Darden T.A. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20210) Google Scholar). Equilibration of the solvent was performed in an initial simulation of 100 ps with position restraint of the DNA and with a linear temperature increase from 0 to 298 K over the first 50 ps. The restraint on the solute atoms was removed, and a further 100 ps of equilibration was performed at 298 K. This was followed by a 10-ns simulation for data collection, during which structures were collected every 0.2 ps, giving 50,000 structures over the trajectory.To model bisulfite reactivity, theoretical bisulfite probes (SO3 with a tetrahedral geometry) were docked against the computed structures at variable distances (2.0 to 3.0 Å, step 0.2 Å) from S (bisulfite) to C-5 of each cytosine, angles (30-150°, step 10°) S-C-5-C-2, and torsions S-C-5-C-2-N-3 (0-350°, step 10°). The bisulfite location was considered acceptable if no probe atom was within 2 Å of any DNA atom. The bisulfite accessibility was calculated as the number of different allowed angle and torsion combinations and, essentially, the number of different allowed pathways of approach of the bisulfite to cytosine C-5 to a distance of 3 Å or less.Calculation of Electrostatic Potentials-Coordinates for (d(CATGGGCCCATG))2 and (d(CATGCGCGCATG))2 in the canonical B-form helix were generated using NUCGEN in the AMBER8 suite of programs (19Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross I.T.E. Cheatham S. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). These coordinates were converted to PQR format with AMBER charges using PDB2PQR (20Dolinsky T.J. Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Baker N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W665-W667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2461) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential of these structures was calculated using the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation as implemented in APBS (21Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5750) Google Scholar). The bisulfite concentration and temperature were those used in the bisulfite probing experiments. The sodium ion was assigned a radius of 2 Å, whereas the bisulfite and sulfite ion radii were assigned 4 Å. Electrostatic potentials were converted into bisulfite concentration maps using the relationship C(x,y,z) = Cbe(-(Z*Φ(x,y,z))), where Cb is the bulk ion concentration, Z is the ion valence, and Φ(x,y,z) is the electrostatic potential (22Lamm G. Lipkowitz K.B. Larter R. Cundari T.R. Reviews in Computational Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Berlin2003: 147-365Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These maps were visualized using the VMD software package using a spherical probe of radius 4 Å (23Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 27-38Crossref Scopus (36896) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism Spectra-DNA and RNA oligonucleotides from IDT (Coralville, IA) were used as received. Circular dichroism was performed on 10 μm total oligonucleotide concentration (all sequences are palindromic) in a 1:1 mixture of disodium phosphate and monosodium phosphate in 5-mm rectangular cells on a Jasco J-810 at 5 °C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBisulfite Reactivity at the bcl-1 MTC and bcl-2 MBR-Bisulfite catalyzes the deamination of single-stranded, unmethylated cytosines to uracils (11Gough G.W. Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, the bisulfite anion adds to the 5-6 double bond of cytosine, breaking aromaticity and resulting in cytosine sulfonate (24Shapiro R. DiFate V. Welcher M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Sono M. Wataya Y. Hayatsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 4745-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When protonated, this modified cytosine can undergo a rate-limiting hydrolytic deamination to uracil sulfonate. Later, mild base and dilution can eliminate the sulfonate group, yielding uracil. Stacking within duplex DNA is thought to protect cytosines from bisulfite attack, providing the basis for structural specificity (i.e. sensitivity of single-stranded regions) (11Gough G.W. Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R.

Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Additionally, the presence of two polyanionic backbones makes the close approach of the bisulfite anion electrostatically unfavorable.Several chromosomal fragile sites are in close proximity to bisulfite-reactive regions rich in stretches of consecutive cytosines (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An abnormally high proportion of breakpoints from t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations occur in a region termed the bcl-2 MBR, and bisulfite reactivity at the MBR was previously reported by us (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The sum of reactivity on the top and bottom strands is plotted in Fig. 1A, top graph. One can see the correlation with consecutive Cs (C-string length) in the second plot, and this correlation is better than with any other sequence composition (lower two plots).Because breakpoints also occur frequently in the bcl-1 MTC from t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocations, we decided to probe this region for bisulfite as well (26Bertoni F. Zucca E. Cotter F.E. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 124: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bisulfite reactivity occurs primarily at the downstream edge of the bcl-1 MTC (Fig. 1B, top plot, and supplemental Fig. S1, all plots). Two peaks of reactivity are observed. The first and smaller peak occurs at the semi-palindromic sequence cgaggggaagcccctcc. The second, broader, and larger peak occurs at the sequence ccctctaagccccctctccccgtcacatccccccgaccctgcc. Note the stretches of consecutive Cs within both sequences.The pattern of reactivity is very similar between the different substrates, extracted genomic DNA, supercoiled plasmid, or linearized plasmid. However, the overall level of bisulfite reactivity is higher on supercoiled plasmid than on linearized plasmid or genomic DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). Supercoiling destabilizes the duplex, accelerating DNA breathing and allowing it to more easily form non-B-DNA structures.Because the top and bottom strands of the original bisulfite-probed DNA molecule are separated during PCR and separately cloned, each sequence obtained gives information for deamination events on only one of the two original strands. When the reactivity is rescaled to balance the top and bottom strand representation, it is roughly symmetrical between the two strands (Fig. 1B, top plot; compare with supplemental Fig. S1, which displays top strand in black and bottom strand in red).To rule out our primers biasing against binding to converted regions, we used a second set of outer primers to confirm that few conversions occur at the binding sites of the first set. Another strategy, designing two sets of primers with one set insensitive to top strand conversions and the other insensitive to those on the bottom, was also performed. These show no differences in pattern (data not shown).The pattern does not change if bisulfite treatment is done on intact Reh cells embedded in 1% low melt agarose or intact Escherichia coli embedded in agarose after transformation with plasmid containing the bcl-1 sequence. Any proteins that might bind to the DNA are likely denatured by the high salt concentration of the bisulfite solution. The pattern also does not change if the bisulfite solution is adjusted to pH 6, although overall reactivity is decreased about 3-fold, consistent with the 3-fold lower efficiency of the bisulfite-catalyzed deamination reaction itself at pH 6 compared with pH 5.2 (25Sono M. Wataya Y. Hayatsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 4745-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactivity increases proportionately if DNA is treated for 24 h rather than the usual 16 h, but again the pattern of reactivity is still the same. Neither does it change if the two peaks are separated and cloned into different plasmids, nor if the plasmid or genomic DNA are pretreated with RNase H, nor if plasmid is extracted from E. coli by a nondenaturing method rather than alkaline lysis (data not shown). Therefore, the specific pattern of bisulfite reactivity appears dependent primarily upon the DNA sequence.Analysis of Defined DNA Duplexes Using Bisulfite-To determine the basis for the full range of reactivity of bisulfite with DNA, we probed several well characterized and structurally divergent oligonucleotide duplexes with bisulfite as follows: d(...catGGGCCCatg...)2, d(...catGGCGCCatg...)2, and d(...catGCGCGCatg...)2 (Fig. 2 and tabulated in Table 1, top 3 rows). Consistent with its single strand specificity, bisulfite virtually always detected the frayed edges of the duplex. At internal portions of the duplex, typically none or only one of the three central Cs in any given molecule reacted with bisulfite (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, we found that the GGGCCC duplex was 5-fold more reactive than GCGCGC, with GGCGCC exhibiting intermediate reactivity. A similar but less dramatic effect was observed for GGCC over GCGC or CGCG (Fig. 3 and Table 1, middle rows).FIGURE 2Bisulfite reactivity on double-stranded DNA containing GGGCCC, GGCGCC, and GCGCGC sequences.

Circular dichroism showed the series d(catGCGCGCatg)2 (B-form DNA), d(catGGCGCCatg)2, d(catGGGCCCatg)2, and r(cauGCGCGCaug)2 (A-form RNA) exhibits increasing A-form character (Fig. 4). This effect was present at two markedly different salt concentrations (supplemental Fig. S3). Consistent with these data, a B/A-intermediate structure of d(catGGGCCCatg)2 (PDB code 1DC0) was previously observed by x-ray crystallography (16Ng H.L. Kopka M.L. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The bisulfite reactivity of a corresponding A-form DNA/2′-O-methyl RNA heteroduplex was lower than that for B-form DNA (Fig. 5 and Table 1, bottom rows), suggesting a correlation between structure and reactivity of B/A > B-DNA > A-DNA.FIGURE 4Circular dichroism of nucleic acids containing GGGCCC, GCGCGO, and GGCGCC sequences.

The structures generated in this simulation were subjected to theoretical bisulfite probing using a dedicated in-house algorithm. Details of the simulations and the probing algorithm are given under the “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental material.Helical parameters of the central d(GGGCCC)2 region, averaged over the simulation, indicate that this sequence adopts a B/A-intermediate conformation between that of the 1DC0 x-ray structure and canonical B-form DNA (Table 2 and Fig. 6) (27Lavery R. Sklenar J. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1988; 6: 63-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Theoretical bisulfite probing of the d(GGGCCC)2 region in four different conformations showed that the C-5 atoms of cytosines in the average MD structure are more accessible to bisulfite than those in the 1DC0 x-ray structure and canonical B- and A-DNA (supplemental Table S1). This may be due to the similarity of the shift in the MD structure to that of B-DNA (Table 2), which indicates that the cytosine bases are less buried in the major groove (Fig. 6), in conjunction with a positive roll similar to that of A-DNA, which may orient the C-5 atoms more favorably for approach of the bisulfite anion from the 3′ face of cytosine (supplemental Fig. S4). The positive roll angle in the MD structure is"
https://openalex.org/W2021389477,"Rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is an (alphabeta)(2) heterotetrameric cytoplasmic enzyme that resembles eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases in respect to both amino acid sequence and structural fold. To obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor binding at the active site, we solved crystal structures of R. capsulatus XDH in the presence of its substrates hypoxanthine, xanthine, and the inhibitor pterin-6-aldehyde using either the inactive desulfo form of the enzyme or an active site mutant (E(B)232Q) to prevent substrate turnover. The hypoxanthine- and xanthine-bound structures reveal the orientation of both substrates at the active site and show the importance of residue Glu(B)-232 for substrate positioning. The oxygen atom at the C-6 position of both substrates is oriented toward Arg(B)-310 in the active site. Thus the substrates bind in an orientation opposite to the one seen in the structure of the reduced enzyme with the inhibitor oxypurinol. The tightness of the substrates in the active site suggests that the intermediate products must exit the binding pocket to allow first the attack of the C-2, followed by oxidation of the C-8 atom to form the final product uric acid. Structural studies of pterin-6-aldehyde, a potent inhibitor of R. capsulatus XDH, contribute further to the understanding of the relative positioning of inhibitors and substrates in the binding pocket. Steady state kinetics reveal a competitive inhibition pattern with a K(i) of 103.57 +/- 18.96 nm for pterin-6-aldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W2152019071,"The 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) has been reported to influence T-cell responses in two ways: as a ligand of toll-like receptor 2 signalling and as an antigen. Here we describe a new mechanism of T-cell immuno-regulation focused on HSP60: HSP60 is up-regulated and presented by activated T cells (HSP60 is an ergotope) to regulatory (anti-ergotypic) T cells. Presentation of HSP60 by activated T cells was found to be MHC-restricted and dependent on accessory molecules - CD28, CD80 and CD86. Anti-ergotypic T cells responded to T-cell HSP60 by proliferation and secreted IFNγ and TGFβ1. In vitro, the anti-ergotypic T cells inhibited IFNγ production by their activated T-cell targets. In vivo, adoptive transfer of an anti-ergotypic HSP60-specific T-cell line led to decreased secretion of IFNγ by arthritogenic T cells and ameliorated adjuvant arthritis (AA). Thus, the presentation of HSP60 by activated T cells turns them into targets for anti-ergotypic regulatory T cells specific for HSP60. However, the direct interaction between the anti-ergotypic T regulators (anti-HSP60) and the activated T cells also down-regulated the regulators. Thus, by functioning as an ergotope, HSP60 can control both the effector T cells and the regulatory HSP60-specific T cells that control them."

Previous studies showed that the mechanism of action of disaccharide 1 involves three steps: (i) deacetylation by carboxyesterases, (ii) action as a biosynthetic intermediate for downstream enzymes involved in sLeX assembly, and (iii) generation of several glycans related to sLeX. In this report, we show that GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol binds to the acceptor site of human β1–4-galactosyltransferase much like the acceptor trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1–2Manβ1–6Man, which is present on N-linked glycans. The 4′-deoxy analog, in which the acceptor hydroxyl group was replaced by -H, did not act as a substrate but instead acted as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The acetylated form of this compound inhibited sLeX formation in U937 monocytic leukemia cells, suggesting that it had inhibitory activity in vivo as well. A series of synthetic acetylated analogs of 1 containing -H, -F, -N3, -NH2, or -OCH3 instead of the hydroxyl groups at C-3′- and C-4′-positions of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue also blocked sLeX formation in cells.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and references therein). Expression of sLeX endows tumor cells with the capacity to bind to platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature via P- and E-selectins, thus facilitating hematogenous metastasis possibly through protection against innate immune cells and by adhesion to the blood vessel wall. Strategies for blocking selectin-carbohydrate interactions include (i) competition by soluble recombinant forms of selectins, glycoprotein ligands, and glycolipids, (ii) peptides based on the primary sequence of the carbohydrate binding site, (iii) anti-selectin antibodies, (iv) oligosaccharides related to LewisX, (v) inositol polyanions and sulfated sugars, (vi) heparin, and (vii) molecular mimics of sLeX, including oligonucleotides (reviewed in Refs. 2Chhabra S.R.

Although many of these analogs are effective in vitro, they generally do not exhibit inhibitory activity in cells due to poor membrane permeability. The large number of polar hydroxyl groups and the lack of membrane transporters for oligosaccharides in most cells presumably prevent their uptake (6Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc.

These compounds are taken up by cells by passive diffusion and acted on by cytoplasmic or membrane-associated carboxyesterases, which remove the acetyl groups. The compounds gain access to the biosynthetic enzymes located in the Golgi complex, where they serve as substrates, priming oligosaccharide synthesis and generating products related to O-GalNAc-linked mucin oligosaccharides. Priming in this manner diverts the assembly of the O-linked chains from endogenous glycoproteins, resulting in inhibition of expression of terminal Lewis antigens that are recognized by selectins. Inhibition occurs at a much lower dose than for monosaccharide-based agents, such as GalNAcβ-O-benzyl (∼25 μm versus 1–2 mm, respectively) (10Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Huang J. Byrd J.C. Yoon W.H. Kim Y.S. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the disaccharides appear to selectively affect sLeX formation, since sLea expression was unaffected (12Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Wang L. Esko J.D.

In this study, we have examined acetylated disaccharide analogs that have been modified so that after deacetylation their activity as substrates would be altered. Characterization of the 4′-deoxy derivative using β1–4-galactosyltransferase 1 as a model showed that it acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme. Interestingly, the peracetylated form of this analog maintains the capacity to inhibit sLeX expression in U937 lymphoma cells and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and block tumor formation in vivo. Thus, the deoxy analog presumably inhibits one or more galactosyltransferases in vivo, thereby blocking sLeX formation and experimental tumor cell metastasis without generation of oligosaccharide products.

The crystals of the protein-acceptor complex were grown by the hanging droplet method. An equal volume of the mutant protein solution (10–20 mg/ml protein) was mixed with 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm UDP-hexanolamine (Sigma), and 0.1 mm deacetylated disaccharide 1 (GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ-O-NM). The precipitant contained MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0), 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 3% dioxane. Crystals grew in 1–2 weeks and diffracted up to 2.2 Å resolution. The three-dimensional x-ray diffraction data were collected on a single crystal at 100 K on an in-house x-ray rotating anode generator with a Mar345 detector (Macromolecular Crystallographic Laboratory, NCI, National Institutes of Health). The frames were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (15Ramasamy V. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Ratner D.M. Seeberger P.H. Qasba P.K. J. Mol.

Since the crystal was isomorphous with the earlier solved crystal structure of the same protein in the presence of various acceptor substrates, its protein coordinates (Protein Data Bank entry 2AEC) were used to solve the present crystal structure (15Ramasamy V.

Cell Lines, Radiolabeling, and HPLC Analysis of Oligosaccharides—U937 cells (CRL 1593.2) and murine LLC cells (LLC1, CRL-1642) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), glutamine (0.3 g/liter), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged every 4 days using ATV™ trypsin solution (Invitrogen). The various disaccharides were dissolved in Me2SO and added to growth medium to achieve the indicated concentrations. The final concentration of Me2SO was adjusted to 0.5% (v/v) in all samples. Cells were added to the supplemented medium at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. [6-3H]Fucose (85.2 Ci/mmol) and [6-3H]galactose (29.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cells were radiolabeled in growth medium containing 1 mm glucose. Samples of radiolabeled oligosaccharide products were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described (9Brown J.R. Fuster M. Whisenant T.

Nonradioactive samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ classic mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Samples in water (10 μl) were introduced into the electrospray ionization ion trap using an autosampler connected to a TSP P400 quaternary pump using 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Galactosyltransferase Assays—To measure the presence of sLeX and P-selectin ligand, cells were grown to confluence for 3–4 days in 6-well plates with and without 1–9. Binding of monoclonal antibody CSLEX-1 and P-selectin Ig chimera to cells fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (9Brown J.R. Fuster M.

The standard galactosyltransferase reaction (25 μl) contained 10 milliunits of purified bovine milk β1–4-galactosyltransferase (Sigma), 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.3 μCi of UDP-[1-3H]galactose, 250 μm UDP-galactose, 15 mm MnCl2, 50 mm KCl, and varying amounts of deacetylated 1 as acceptor. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 (100 mg; Waters). After washing with 5 ml of water, the products were eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. Ovalbumin was tested as substrate at 10 mg/ml as described (19Esko J.D.

The inhibitory activities of deacetylated 1 and 2 were tested at the indicated concentrations. Experimental Metastasis—LLC cells were grown for 4–5 days in the presence or absence of 50 μm 1 or 2.

After 10 days, lung metastases were detected by visible nodules on the surface of the lungs and quantitated under a dissecting microscope. Representative photographs were taken. GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ-O-NM Binds to β1–4-Galactosyltransferase 1—We have shown previously that disaccharide 1 (peracetylated GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ-O-NM) acts as an inhibitor of sLeX biosynthesis when provided to cultured tumor cells (Fig. 1) (6Sarkar A.K.

In order for 1 to be active, it first undergoes carboxyesterase-catalyzed esterolysis, which results in removal of the acetate groups required for making the compound membrane-permeable (6Sarkar A.K.

Deacetylated 1 then serves as a substrate for galactosylation catalyzed by one or more galactosyltransferases expressed by cells (23Hennet T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the galactosylated trisaccharide product (presumably Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ-O-NM) can then undergo sialylation, fucosylation, or the addition of another N-acetylglucosamine residue (9Brown J.R.

Although deacetylated 1 could act as a substrate for several galactosyltransferases, in this study, we chose β1–4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4Gal-T1) as a model to examine the properties of analogs of 1. β4Gal-T1 forms Galβ1–4GlcNAc units in various glycoconjugates and has been shown to participate in the formation of sLeX and selectin ligands (24Asano M.

https://openalex.org/W2093773476,"FIP200 (focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa) has been shown to interact with other proteins to regulate several intracellular signaling pathways. To study a potential role of FIP200 in tumorigenesis and possibly other disease processes in vivo, we created and analyzed murine mammary tumor virus-Cre-mediated FIP200 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice. We found that deletion of FIP200 in mammary epithelial cells did not result in spontaneous development of breast cancer. Moreover, deletion of FIP200 did not further accelerate or inhibit lymphomagenesis induced by inactivation of p53 in mice. Interestingly, however, FIP200 and p53 double conditional knock-out (dCKO) mice exhibited significant hyperplasia of epidermis (acanthosis), thickening of the cornified layer (hyperkeratosis), and increased vascularity in the dermis. FIP200 CKO mice also showed similar, although less severe, skin defects as dCKO mice. Analyses of primary keratinocytes isolated from dCKO mice did not detect increased proliferation of these cells in vitro, suggesting that epidermis hyperproliferation is not epidermal cell-autonomous but may be a consequence of increased inflammation triggered by immune cells in vivo. Consistent with this possibility, we found infiltration of leukocytes including T cells, macrophages, and granulocytes into the dermis and epidermis, associated with activation of NF-kappaB and increased expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in skin of the dCKO mice. We further found that cultured FIP200 KO keratinocytes showed reduced NF-kappaB phosphorylation in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation, suggesting a paracrine regulation of aberrant NF-kappaB activation in the skin microenviroment of dCKO and FIP200 CKO mice. Together, these results demonstrate that ablation of FIP200, although not promoting tumorigenesis, can lead to skin inflammatory disorders, suggesting a novel function of FIP200 in the maintenance of normal skin homeostasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1986803303,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) promotes both self-renewal and differentiation of early multipotential progenitors and is involved in inducible hematopoiesis in response to infections. Here we report new insights into these processes with the identification of a new isoform (SP2) of IL-3 receptor α (IL-3Rα), present in mouse and human hematopoietic cells, which lacks domain 1 of the full-length receptor (SP1). Binding assays with βIL-3 mutants showed that mouse SP2 uses a different high affinity binding mode to SP1, although both mouse and human SP2 and SP1 can stimulate IL-3-dependent growth. In IL-3-dependent differentiation models, human SP2 and SP1 gave differential effects on lineage commitment or self-renewal dependent on the cellular context, suggesting that different modes of ectodomain binding may modulate intracellular signaling. In a multipotential factor dependent cell-Paterson mix, the transcription factors C/EBPα and PU.1 and microRNAs miRNA-15a, -223, and -181a were up-regulated in cells undergoing SP2-supported differentiation compared with SP1-supported self-renewal. Similarly in M1 cells, SP2 promoted differentiation compared with SP1 and gave up-regulation of PU.1 and miRNA-155 and -223. These findings suggest that IL-3-promoted lineage commitment uses similar mechanisms to those of steady-state hematopoiesis. Both the SP1 and SP2 isoforms activated the Jak2/STAT5, Akt, and Erk1/2 signaling pathways in M1 cells, although the activation was more prolonged for the SP2 isoform.

Med. 1993; 177: 1523-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In mice, there is a shared βc (mβc) receptor but also an IL-3-specific β receptor (βIL-3) (15Itoh N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Yahara I. Arai K. Miyajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Both β receptors require the mouse IL-3Rα (mIL-3α) for activation (16Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Upon receptor activation, the cytoplasmic portions of the β receptors, which lack any intrinsic kinase activity, initiate a number of signaling pathways, including the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (17Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Previous studies of IL-3 signaling have mainly concentrated on growth and reversal of apoptosis, whereas the mechanisms regulating differentiation and self-renewal remain poorly understood. It remains controversial whether cytokine receptors in general can play an instructive role in lineage specification in hematopoiesis, and steady-state blood cell formation appears to largely involve stochastic processes (18Robb L. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) can play an instructive role in the differentiation of multipotential cells (19Heyworth C.M. Hampson J. Dexter T.M. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Kan O. Cook N. Vallance S.J. Whetton A.D. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The IL-3R is a member of the cytokine class I receptor family (20Murphy J.M. Young I.G. Vitam. Horm. 2006; 74: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One of the best studied members of this family is the growth hormone receptor, which illustrates the basic principles of receptor activation. Ligand binding with the growth hormone receptor occurs at the elbow region formed between the two domains of the cytokine receptor homology module, and activation involves homodimerization. In contrast, we have shown the ectodomain of the hβc receptor to be a novel intertwined homodimer (21Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); an unexpected departure from other structures of the family. However, the hβc receptor has a ligand-binding elbow region analogous to that of the growth hormone receptor, although it is composed of domains 1 and 4 of the two different protein chains (22Murphy J.M.

Chaiken I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13398-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The homologous mouse βIL-3 receptor is also a homodimer, and its elbow region forms the direct IL-3 binding site (22Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Olsen J.E. Gustin S.E. Jeffrey P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26500-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, high affinity IL-3 binding by the βIL-3-IL-3Rα complex does not involve the residues of the direct IL-3 binding site (22Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Olsen J.E. Gustin S.E. Jeffrey P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26500-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The βIL-3 receptor therefore represents an interesting departure from the canonical activation mechanisms established for receptors like the growth hormone and erythropoietin receptors.In the present work we have identified a new ectodomain isoform of IL-3Rα, designated SP2, which is present in mouse and human hematopoietic cells. Unlike the previously characterized (SP1) isoform, mIL-3Rα SP2 utilizes the direct IL-3 binding region of βIL-3 for high affinity binding and signaling showing that the βIL-3 receptor has two alternative modes of receptor activation via the SP1 and SP2 isoforms. Thus the IL-3 receptor is similar to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, in that it utilizes ectodomain isoforms which modulate receptor function (25Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Sher I. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Herein, we show that IL-3 receptor activation via the mouse and human SP1 or SP2 IL-3Rα isoforms gives growth signaling in the presence of the appropriate β receptor. However, the two isoforms show differential effects on self-renewal and lineage commitment dependent on the cellular context. This suggests that the mode of ectodomain engagement can modulate intracellular signaling by identical cytoplasmic receptor chains as has been suggested recently for the activation of IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 heterodimers by IL-4 or IL-13 (26LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The elevation in expression of particular transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) in cells undergoing IL-3Rα SP2-supported differentiation, compared with cells undergoing SP1-supported growth/self-renewal, indicates that the mechanisms involved are similar to those found in steady-state blood cell formation. The demonstration of the existence and activity of the SP2 isoform reveals additional complexity in IL-3R signaling and provides valuable insights into how an individual growth factor can initiate many distinct cellular outcomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell Culture—Unless otherwise stated the cytokines used for cell culture were produced in Hi5 insect cells grown in serum-free medium. For differentiation assays with cells expressing the hIL-3R, hIL-3 was used at 220 units/ml and, where added, mIL-3 at 0.4 units/ml. For cells expressing the hGM-CSFR, hGM-CSF was used at 290 units/ml. For differentiation of parental FDCP-mix cells, mGM-CSF was included at 0.1% v/v.

Transfection details are given in the supplemental materials. As many as possible stable transfectants were recovered, yielding polyclonal populations of cells.miRNA Preparation and Quantification of miRNAs and Transcription Factors—miRNA was prepared from M1 and FDCP-mix cells expressing human IL-3Rα SP1 or SP2 plus hβc and grown under conditions permitting differentiation using an miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The detection and quantification of miRNAs was carried out by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with the miScript system (Qiagen) and 7500 Real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was also used to detect and quantify mRNA-encoding transcription factors from the same miRNA preparation in M1 and FDCP-mix cells (see supplemental materials).RT-PCR, Deglycosylation, and Western Blot Analysis—Detection of mouse and human IL-3Rα SP1 and SP2 in mouse or human cells was conducted by RT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Deglycosylation of mouse IL-3Rα SP1 and SP2 was performed by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F. Western blot analysis was also performed to examine the expression of transcription factors in M1 cells.

For CTLL-2 cells, proliferation was measured after 2 days of incubation and for M1 and FDCP-mix after 4-5 days. Growth assays for WEHI 3B D+ cells were conducted by counting the viable cell number with trypan blue exclusion under the light microscope.Flow Cytometry—M1 and WEHI 3B D+ cells expressing the appropriate human receptors were incubated with or without hIL-3 (220 units/ml) or hGM-CSF (290 units/ml) for 4 days in growth medium. Similarly, FDCP-mix cells were incubated with hIL-3 (220 units/ml) with or without low mIL-3 (0.4 unit/ml), or incubated with low mIL-3 or 0.1% v/v mouse GM-CSF for 6 days. The expression of surface markers and IL-3R subunits was examined by flow cytometry (see supplemental materials).Binding Assays—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with mouse IL-3Rα SP1 or SP2 with wild-type or mutant mouse βIL-3 constructs. Two days after transfection, the COS7 cells were harvested and binding assays were done as described previously (22Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Olsen J.E. Gustin S.E. Jeffrey P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J.

Details of phosphorylation analysis and Western blot are shown in the supplemental materials.Statistical Analysis—A Student's two-tailed non-paired t test was used to determine the statistical significance.RESULTSA New Isoform IL-3RαWe identified previously unrecognized alternatively spliced isoforms of the IL-3Rα among the mRNA sequences in the NCBI expressed sequence tag databases in mouse (GI:5599968; from a placental library) and human (GI:19018027; from a retinal pigment epithelium and choroid library), which we designated SP2. The new SP2 isoforms lack domain 1 of the extracellular region due to precise deletion of exons 3 and 4 of the gene (Fig. 1, A and B). The additional sequence available from the trace archive indicated that apart from deletion of domain 1, the SP2 isoforms were otherwise identical with the previously characterized SP1 isoform (16Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Measurement of expression of the SP2 isoforms in mouse hematopoietic cells by RT-PCR showed that mRNA for the SP2 isoform was readily detectable in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines and in eosinophils, mast cells, and B lymphocyte blasts (Fig. 2A), although it was expressed at a lower level than the SP1 form. Clones encoding the SP2 isoforms were isolated and sequenced from mouse FDCP-1, FDCP-mix, WEHI-3B, and GB2 cells and shown to conform to the structure in Fig. 1. We also examined IL-3Rα isoform protein levels in mouse cells by Western blotting. The sizes of the receptor bands indicated extensive glycosylation (five potential N-glycosylation sites in SP1 and four in SP2). Deglycosylation was carried out on the samples to simplify analysis, and bands corresponding to the predicted molecular masses of the mature SP1 and SP2 proteins (41 and 31 kDa, respectively) were demonstrated in a variety of mouse cell lines (Fig. 2B). The mIL-3Rα SP1 protein was the major form detected in FDCP-1, WEHI-3B, and GB2 cells, although in multipotential FDCP-mix cells the levels of SP2 and SP1 proteins were more comparable. Although low levels of the SP2 form were detected by RT-PCR in the M1 myeloblastic leukemia cell line, no SP2 protein was detected by Western blotting. Similarly in FDCP-mix, the marked differences between relative RNA and protein levels suggested the existence of translational controls affecting SP1 and SP2 levels. Without deglycosylation, the majority of samples showed receptor bands of ∼54 and 41 kDa consistent with glycosylated SP1 and SP2 isoforms. In WEHI-3B cells the receptor was of much higher molecular mass, but deglycosylated samples gave similar receptor sizes to the other cell lines (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Detection of mouse and human IL-3Rα SP1 and SP2 isoforms in hematopoietic cells.

Clones encoding the SP2 isoform were isolated and sequenced from human TF-1 cells and shown to conform to the structure in Fig. 1.Growth Signaling by the Mouse and Human IL-3Rα SP2 IsoformsTo test the ability of the SP2 isoform to function in growth signaling, the mIL-3Rα SP2 isoform was expressed in CTLL-2 cells with and without βIL-3 or mβc. Similarly, the hIL-3Rα SP2 isoform was expressed in CTLL-2 with and without hβc. CTLL-2 is an IL-2-dependent mouse cytotoxic T cell line that does not express the mIL-3Rα, βIL-3 or mβc receptors. Expression of the relevant receptor proteins was verified by FACS (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2A). In the case of the mIL-3Rα SP2 isoform, we were unable to find a suitable antibody for detection by FACS, and Western blotting was used to verify expression (supplemental Fig. S2B).We found that mIL-3 stimulated growth signaling of CTLL-2 cell lines expressing mIL-3Rα SP2/βIL-3, but that higher levels were required than for the receptor system involving the SP1 form to achieve half-maximal stimulation (Fig. 3A). CTLL-2 cells expressing the SP2 form alone were unresponsive to mIL-3, even at concentrations of 480 units/ml. Interestingly, mIL-3Rα SP2 was shown to signal specifically with βIL-3 and could not signal with mβc (Fig. 3B). Similarly, CTLL-2 cells expressing hIL-3Rα SP2/hβc gave full growth signaling in response to hIL-3, but also required higher levels of hIL-3 than the receptor system involving the SP1 form to achieve half-maximal stimulation (Fig. 3C). CTLL-2 cells expressing the hIL-3Rα SP2 form alone were unresponsive to hIL-3, even at doses of 1795 units/ml. In a previous study on hIL-3Rα, where domain 1 was deleted by mutagenesis to yield a receptor similar (but not identical) to the naturally occurring SP2 isoform studied here, a requirement for higher levels of IL-3 to give full growth was also observed (27Barry S.C.

Consistent with previous studies, the Kd for mIL-3Rα SP1/βIL-3 high affinity IL-3 binding was ∼200 pm (22Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Olsen J.E. Gustin S.E. Jeffrey P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol.

These findings are broadly consistent with the relative levels of mIL-3 required for growth signaling by the SP1 and SP2 isoforms in CTLL-2 cells described above.FIGURE 4Scatchard plots of mIL-3 binding assays and growth signaling by mouse Y21A mutant βIL-3.

Open table in a new tab βIL-3 receptors carrying individual mutations in the residues comprising the direct IL-3 binding site were also tested. Our previous, detailed studies have shown that mIL-3 high affinity binding is not significantly affected by any of the βIL-3 mutations that abolish direct IL-3 binding when co-expressed with mIL-3Rα SP1 (22Murphy J.M.

Consistent with these studies, we show in the present work that mIL-3 high affinity binding with βIL-3 Y21A (Tyr21 → Ala)/mIL-3Rα SP1 was similar to that of the wild-type βIL-3 receptor (Table 1). In contrast, mIL-3Rα SP2 high affinity binding was abolished by the Y21A mutation within βIL-3. Indeed, each of the βIL-3 residues that mediate direct mIL-3 binding (Tyr21, Phe85, Asn87, Ile320, Tyr348, and Tyr401) were critical for high affinity binding with mIL-3Rα SP2 (Table 1), indicating that the SP1 and SP2 isoforms have different mechanisms of high affinity binding. To verify this finding in terms of growth signaling, stable transfectants of CTLL-2 expressing βIL-3 Y21A and either the mIL-3Rα SP1 or SP2 isoforms were prepared and tested for IL-3 growth stimulation. The Y21A βIL-3 mutation blocked growth signaling by the mIL-3Rα SP2 isoform but did not affect that by mIL-3Rα SP1 (Fig. 4C).

The hepatocyte growth factor RTK (also known as Met) regulates epithelial remodeling, dispersal, and invasion and is deregulated in human cancers. Impaired down-regulation of the Met RTK leads to sustained signaling, cell transformation, and tumorigenesis, hence understanding mechanisms that regulate this process is crucial. Here we report that, following Met activation, the endocytic adaptor protein, Eps15, is recruited to the plasma membrane and becomes both tyrosine-phosphorylated and ubiquitinated. Recruitment of Eps15 requires Met receptor kinase activity and involves two distinct Eps15 domains. Unlike previous reports for the EGF RTK, which requires the Eps15 ubiquitin interacting motif, recruitment of Eps15 to Met involves the coiled-coil domain of Eps15 and the signaling adaptor molecule, Grb2, which binds through a proline-rich motif in the third domain of Eps15. Expression of the coiled-coil domain is sufficient to displace the wild-type Eps15 protein complex from Met, resulting in loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15. Knockdown of Eps15 results in delayed Met degradation, which can be rescued by expression of Eps15 WT but not an Eps15 mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain, identifying a role for this domain in Eps15-mediated Met down-modulation. This study demonstrates a new mechanism of recruitment for Eps15 downstream of the Met receptor, involving the coiled-coil domain of Eps15 as well as interaction of Eps15 with Grb2. This highlights distinct regulation of Eps15 recruitment and the diversity and adaptability of endocytic molecules in promoting RTK trafficking.

RTK activation must be tightly controlled through multiple levels of regulation to maintain cellular homeostasis. Failure to due so is associated with the development and progression of human disease such as cancer (1Lee J.-H. Han S.-U. Cho H. Jennings B. Gerrard B. Dean M. Schmidt L. Zbar B. Woude G.F.V.

Ligand-induced activation of RTKs promotes their rapid removal from the plasma membrane, a key event in their down-regulation, because it is a prerequisite to their lysosomal degradation. The process of RTK internalization modulates levels of RTK at the cell surface and the duration of signals activated in response to growth factors. Ligand-activated RTKs are mainly internalized through clathrin-dependent pathways to be eventually delivered to sorting endosomes (4Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), although other mechanisms of receptor internalization exist (5Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). From the sorting endosome, RTKs can recycle back to the plasma membrane or become internalized and accumulate on the limiting and internal membranes of multivesicular bodies. This latter event terminates RTK signaling by sequestering the signaling-competent intracellular domain of RTKs and preventing recycling back to the plasma membrane. Multivesicular bodies subsequently fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of proteins located within intralumenal membranes (6Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 7Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These internalization and trafficking events are controlled via a complex network of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that are evolutionary conserved. Ligand-dependent internalization and trafficking of RTKs is regulated in part through ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (8Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In addition, endocytic proteins themselves are modified by RTK-dependent ubiquitin and tyrosine phosphorylation, which serve as signal switches to promote or disassemble protein-protein interactions (8Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Hicke L. Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions have been studied extensively for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) RTK (10Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), yet the mechanisms regulating internalization and trafficking of other RTKs remain poorly understood.The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) RTK (also known as Met) is primarily expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells in the adult. The HGF/Met signaling axis regulates key cellular processes such as scattering of epithelia sheets, as well as epithelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival (11Peschard, P., and Park, M. Oncogene 26, 1276–1285Google Scholar). HGF/Met signaling is essential for embryonic development, namely the growth and survival of epithelial cells as well as the migration of myogenic precursor cells and the outgrowth of motor neurons (12Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Chronic activation of the Met receptor is associated with several human and murine tumors (12Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and in the adult, the HGF/Met signaling axis is involved in wound healing and liver regeneration (14Huh C.-G. Factor V.M. Sanchez A.

Importantly, although deregulation of the Met receptor in human cancers can occur through receptor amplification, point mutations, and chromosomal translocations leading to ligand-independent RTK activation, we and others have recently shown that escape from down-regulation constitutes another mechanism leading to Met RTK deregulation in human cancers (20Peschard P.

The N terminus contains three Eps15 homology (EH) domains that are required for plasma membrane targeting of Eps15 through engagement with proteins containing the tripeptide motif asparagine-proline-phenylalanine and direct binding to phospholipids (32Naslavsky N.

Eps15 also contains a central coiled-coil domain, which mediates homo- and heterodimerization (34Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33430-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and a stretch of aspartate-proline-phenylalanine repeats, which can bind the α-subunit of AP-2. The C terminus harbors two ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIM) of which the second has been shown to participate in ubiquitin binding (35Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and is required for recruitment to a ubiquitinated EGFR (36Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C.

Mutations within the Eps15 UIM domain that abrogate ubiquitin binding disrupt the localization of Eps15 to the plasma membrane upon EGF stimulation (37de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the UIM or use of a poorly ubiquitinated EGFR mutant (Y1045F) also abrogates co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins (36Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Hence, Eps15 acts to recognize ubiquitinated EGFR cargo, which is thought to contribute to selection of the EGFR for internalization (36Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C.

Where investigated, tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 has not been observed downstream of other stimuli such as insulin, platelet-derived growth factor or keratinocyte growth factor (30Delft S.v.

Given the biological importance of the more than 50 RTKs encoded in the human genome, elucidation and validation of the molecular mechanisms governing the down-regulation of different RTKs will be important to determine which commonalities and differences exist between these family members. Because deregulation of trafficking of the Met RTK contributes to its oncogenic potential, we have investigated the role of Eps15 downstream of the Met receptor. Here, we report that HGF-induced activation of the Met receptor results in recruitment of Eps15 to the plasma membrane and causes its rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In contrast to previous studies with the EGFR, we have mapped the coiled-coiled domain of Eps15 as being sufficient and essential for the interaction of Eps15 with the Met receptor and propose a new mechanism for recruitment and regulation of RTKs by Eps15.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents-Antibody 145 was raised in rabbit against a C-terminal peptide of human Met (40Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine (4G10) and Met DL-21 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).

Monoclonal EEA1 antibody and AP-2 (μ2) were obtained from BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), HA.11 and Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibodies were from Covance (Berkeley CA) and BabCO (Richmond, CA), respectively. Mannose 6-phosphate receptor, cation-dependent antibody (22d4) was obtained from the developmental studies hybridoma bank (Iowa City, IA). HGF was a kind gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). EGF was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Cycloheximide purchased from Sigma was reconstituted in water to 10 mg/ml (100×).Cell Culture and Transient Transfections-T47D breast epithelial cells, HeLa cells, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T47D stable cell lines expressing wild-type Met was established and described previously (21Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbe S. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9632-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). K1110A Met stable cells were made through electroporation with pLXSN-Met K1110A cDNA in a similar manor. Transient transfections in HEK293 and HeLa cells were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting-Following stimulation with HGF (0.60 nm unless otherwise indicated), T47D cells, HeLa cells, and HEK293 cells were harvested in TGH lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). HEK293 transfections were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Lysates were incubated with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation followed by 1-h incubation with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads. For FLAG-immunoprecipitations, lysates were directly incubated with Anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) and incubated for 4 h. Captured proteins were collected by washing three times in their respective lysis buffers, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with primary then secondary antibodies in TBST for 1 h. After three washes with TBST, bound proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To detect Eps15 ubiquitination, cells from a 10-cm dish were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (0.05% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 nm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate) and processed as above. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using NIH ImageJ software.Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Cells were seeded at 1 × 104 to 5 × 104 on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) in 24-well plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected 24 h later or left untransfected. 24 h post-transfection cells were serum-starved for 2 h prior to HGF treatment in the presence of cycloheximide. Coverslips were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min followed by washing four times in PBS. Residual paraformaldehyde was removed with three 5-min washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at room temperature, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with immu-mount (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Canada Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada) with 100× objective and 1.5× zoom. Image analysis was carried out using the LSM 5 image browser (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).Generation of Eps15 Constructs-GFP-Eps15, FLAG-Eps15 WT, delta-I, -II, -III, and -IV, and Y850F constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Edward A. Fon (Montreal, CA) and have been described previously (41Klapisz E. Sorokina I. Lemeer S. Pijnenburg M. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30746-30753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). FLAG Eps15-II, -III, and -II/III constructs were made by subcloning fragments amplified by PCR using primers designed with BamHI and XbaI restriction digest sites using the FLAG-Eps15-WT pcDNA3.1zeo as a template. The FLAG-Eps15 P770A point mutation was created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using FLAG-Eps15-WT pcDNA3.1zeo as a template. Primers were designed to include a BstUI restriction enzyme site (underlined). Forward primer, 5′-GTGAAGATGTGCCCGCGGCACTGCCGCCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGCGGCAGTGCCGCGGGCACATCTTCAC-3′. GFP-CC construct was made by subcloning a PCR fragment amplified using primers designed with HindIII/BamHI restriction digest site using the FLAG-Eps15-WT cDNA as a template into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). GFP-Eps15ΔCC was made by subcloning a PCR fragment using primers designed with SalI/BamHI restriction digest sites using FLAG-Eps15ΔII cDNA as a template into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). All DNA sequences were verified by sequencing.GST Pulldown Assays-Fusion proteins were produced in DH5, or BL 21 gold Escherichia coli strain, by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST and GST-Grb2 constructs have been described previously (42Lock L.S. Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2132-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Peschard P.

For pulldown assays, lysates were pre-cleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h, whereas 5–10 μg of GST fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing inhibitors, then pre-cleared lysates were added to the beads. Samples were gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, washed three times in TGH with inhibitors, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies.siRNA-HeLa cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish and 24 h later transfected with 10 nm scramble control siRNA or Eps15 siRNA (target sequence: ATG CTG TAG GTT GAA CCA TTA) with HiPerFect as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Cells were replated 24 h later at 3 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and re-transfected with siRNA (10 nm) or transfected with siRNA-resistant Eps15 cDNA. The following day cells were stimulated with HGF in the presence of cycloheximide and lysed.RESULTSEps15 Is Recruited to the Met Receptor upon HGF Treatment-To examine the role of Eps15 downstream from the Met RTK, we first determined if Eps15 is recruited to the Met receptor following stimulation with HGF. HeLa cells were stimulated with physiological concentrations of HGF (0.60 nm) for 1 h at 4 °C, fixed, and immunostained for endogenous Eps15 and Met proteins and visualized using confocal microscopy. Under these conditions RTKs do not internalize but bind ligand and accumulate into clathrin-coated pits at 4 °C. Receptors are then synchronously internalized upon temperature release from 4 °C to 37 °C (44Gorden P. Carpentier J.L. Cohen S. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 45Sorkina T. Huang F. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This experimental procedure is depicted in Fig. 1A and shall subsequently referred to as a cold load stimulation. Prior to ligand stimulation, Eps15 was localized in punctate structures resembling endosomes as well as being concentrated at the trans-Golgi network, as assessed by co-staining with mannose-6-phosphate receptor (supplemental Fig. S1A), whereas the Met RTK was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, panel a). Following temperature switch to 37 °C post HGF treatment, Met is rapidly internalized and enters the endocytic pathway (21Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbe S. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9632-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Eps15 co-localizes with Met following 1 h at 4 °C (Fig. 1B, panels d–f) and as Met internalizes for up to 60 min post temperature switch (Fig. 1B, panels g–o). These structures were confirmed to be endosomes through co-staining for the endosomal marker, EEA-1 (supplemental Fig. S1B).To further validate the association between Eps15 and the Met receptor, endogenous Eps15 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells and immunoblotted for the Met receptor (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a biphasic, HGF-dependent association was observed (lanes 2 and 4), similar to what has been reported for the EGFR (36Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation was also detected in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with constructs expressing these proteins (supplemental Fig. S1C). Thus, taken together, Eps15 can be recruited to a Met receptor complex upon HGF stimulation.Because ligand concentration has been shown to influence which internalization machinery is utilized by the EGFR (36Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), we also determined the role of Eps15 in Met trafficking under low concentrations of HGF (0.12 nm) in comparison to the moderate levels (0.60 nm) described above (47Funakoshi H. Nakamura T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 327: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After a cold load stimulation and a 15-min release to 37 °C, Met internalized into early endosomes in response to low HGF concentrations, and no significant differences for the recruitment and co-trafficking of Eps15 and Met were observed (Fig. 1D). This demonstrates that Eps15 is recruited to the Met receptor at multiple and/or various stages of internalization and trafficking irrespective of ligand concentration.Eps15 Becomes Tyrosine-phosphorylated at Site Tyr-850 and Is Ubiquitinated in Response to Met Activation-Tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 has been shown downstream of the EGF receptor but not other growth factor receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor (30Delft S.v.

https://openalex.org/W2077227070,"The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study provides direct evidence on visual object-category formation in the human brain. Although brain imaging has demonstrated object-category specific representations in the occipitotemporal cortex, the crucial question of how the brain acquires this knowledge has remained unresolved. We designed a stimulus set consisting of six highly similar bird types that can hardly be distinguished without training. All bird types were morphed with one another to create different exemplars of each category. After visual training, fMRI showed that responses in the right fusiform gyrus were larger for bird types for which a discrete category-boundary was established as compared with not-trained bird types. Importantly, compared with not-trained bird types, right fusiform responses were smaller for visually similar birds to which subjects were exposed during training but for which no category-boundary was learned. These data provide evidence for experience-induced shaping of occipitotemporal responses that are involved in category learning in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W1965531320,"PTPN3 and PTPN4 are two closely-related non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) that, in addition to a PTP domain, contain FERM (Band 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) and PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains. Both PTP have been implicated as negative-regulators of early signal transduction through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), acting to dephosphorylate the TCRζ chain, a component of the TCR complex. Previously, we reported upon the production and characterization of PTPN3-deficient mice which show normal TCR signal transduction and T cell function. To address if the lack of a T cell phenotype in PTPN3-deficient mice can be explained by functional redundancy of PTPN3 with PTPN4, we generated PTPN4-deficient and PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. As in PTPN3 mutants, T cell development and homeostasis and TCR-induced cytokine synthesis and proliferation were found to be normal in PTPN4-deficient and PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. PTPN13 is another FERM and PDZ domain-containing non-receptor PTP that is distantly-related to PTPN3 and PTPN4 and which has been shown to function as a negative-regulator of T helper-1 (Th1) and Th2 differentiation. Therefore, to determine if PTPN13 might compensate for the loss of PTPN3 and PTPN4 in T cells, we generated mice that lack functional forms of all three PTP. T cells from triple-mutant mice developed normally and showed normal cytokine secretion and proliferative responses to TCR stimulation. Furthermore, T cell differentiation along the Th1, Th2 and Th17 lineages was largely unaffected in triple-mutants. We conclude that PTPN3 and PTPN4 are dispensable for TCR signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1969814274,"Cellular molecules possess various mechanisms in responding to oxidant stress. In terms of protein responses, protein S-glutathionylation is a unique post-translational modification of protein reactive cysteines forming disulfides with glutathione molecules. This modification has been proposed to play roles in antioxidant, regulatory and signaling in cells under oxidant stress. Recently, the increased level of protein S-glutathionylation has been linked with the development of diseases. In this report, specific S-glutathionylated proteins were demonstrated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells treated with two different oxidative reagents: diamide and hydrogen peroxide. Diamide is a chemical oxidizing agent whereas hydrogen peroxide is a physiological oxidant. Under the experimental conditions, these two oxidants decreased glutathione concentration without toxicity. S-glutathionylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting and glutathione concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. We further show the effect of alteration of the cellular thiol pool on the amount of protein S-glutathionylation in oxidant-treated cells. Cellular thiol concentrations were altered either by a specific way using buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis or by a non-specific way, incubating cells in cystine-methionine deficient media. Cells only treated with either buthionine sulfoximine or cystine-methionine deficient media did not induce protein S-glutathionylation, even though both conditions decreased 65% of cellular glutathione. Moreover, the amount of protein S-glutathionylation under both conditions in the presence of oxidants was not altered when compared to the amount observed in regular media with oxidants present. Protein S-glutathionylation is a dynamic reaction which depends on the rate of adding and removing glutathione. Phenylarsine oxide, which specifically forms a covalent adduct with vicinal thiols, was used to determine the possible role of vicinal thiols in the amount of glutathionylation. Our data shows phenylarsine oxide did not change glutathione concentrations, but it did enhance the amount of glutathionylation in oxidant-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021332871,"Dynamic inactivation in Kv4 A-type K+ current plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability by shaping action potential waveform and duration. Multifunctional auxiliary KChIP1–4 subunits, which share a high homology in their C-terminal core regions, exhibit distinctive modulation of inactivation and surface expression of pore-forming Kv4 subunits. However, the structural differences that underlie the functional diversity of Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) remain undetermined. Here we have described the crystal structure of KChIP4a at 3.0Å resolution, which shows distinct N-terminal α-helices that differentiate it from other KChIPs. Biochemical experiments showed that competitive binding of the Kv4.3 N-terminal peptide to the hydrophobic groove of the core of KChIP4a causes the release of the KChIP4a N terminus that suppresses the inactivation of Kv4.3 channels. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed that the first N-terminal α-helix peptide (residues 1–34) of KChIP4a, either by itself or fused to N-terminal truncated Kv4.3, can confer slow inactivation. We propose that N-terminal binding of Kv4.3 to the core of KChIP4a mobilizes the KChIP4a N terminus, which serves as the slow inactivation gate.

A-type inactivation, a rapid process of channel closing, leads to the reduction or elimination of potassium currents that can be dynamically regulated by a variety of intracellular factors.

A-type inactivation was first described as a “ball and chain” model in which an intracellular inactivation particle (the α-ball) on a tether physically occludes the pore (10Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T.

This “ball” was later identified as the first 20 amino acids of the N terminus of the Shaker channel (hence the name “N-type inactivation”), and the contiguous 40 or more residues constituted the chain (10Zagotta W.N.

The inactivation gate possesses two essential chemical characteristics. The first 10 residues are hydrophobic, and the remaining 10 are hydrophilic. This segment of the chain, which is rich in positive charge, pushes the ball toward its receptor site (13Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R.

It has been shown that this N-type inactivation occurs through a sequential reaction of a dynamic nature in which the gate initially binds to the T1 domain surface by electrostatic interactions and then enters through the lateral portals to the inner pore and impairs ion movement (13Zhou M.

Cytosolic Kv channel-interacting proteins KChIP1–4 (216–256 amino acids) co-assemble with Kv4 α-subunits to form a native complex that encodes somatodendritic A-type K+ current, which plays critical roles in shaping the action potential waveforms (15An W.F.

For instance, KChIP1 increases Kv4 surface expression, speeds up steady-state inactivation with a moderate effect on fast inactivation, and accelerates recovery from inactivation. In contrast, KChIP4a functions as a suppressor of inactivation to eliminate the fast inactivation of Kv4 channels but does not promote surface expression and has no effect on the recovery time constant following inactivation (20Holmqvist M.H.

It is of interest that KChIP4a can be functionally converted to KChIP1 by truncation of a K-channel inactivation suppressor (KIS) domain that resides in the N terminus (residues 1–34) of KChIP4a. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KChIP4a affects inactivation are not understood (20Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recent evaluation of the co-crystal structure of the KChIP1/Kv4.3 N terminus has revealed that this complex has a clamping mode, in which a single KChIP1 molecule acting as a monomer laterally clamps two neighboring Kv4.3 N termini in a 4:4 manner, and this interaction involves two contact interfaces (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the first interface, the proximal N-terminal peptide of Kv4.3 is sequestered and buried deeply within an elongated groove on the surface of KChIP1. The H10 helix of KChIP1 is pushed out of this groove and is replaced by the Kv4.3 N-terminal peptide, while this same KChIP1 molecule binds to another adjacent T1 domain, resulting in a stabilized tetrameric Kv4.3 T1-KChIP1 complex. Identification of this clamping mode whereby KChIP1 interacts with Kv4 has provided structural insight into how KChIP1 regulates gating kinetics and increases Kv4 surface expression and possibly trafficking (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L.

Res. 2008; 33: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, this clamping mechanism cannot account for the suppression of Kv4 inactivation by KChIP4a that was reported not to promote surface expression, although it shares 79% identify of amino acids in its C-terminal core domain with KChIP1 (20Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The question then arises as to whether this distinct modulation of inactivation of Kv4 channels by KChIP4a without increased current density can be attributed to the differences in the N termini of KChIP4a and KChIP1. Therefore, to gain more information about the structure and molecular mechanism by which KChIP4a modulates Kv4 function, we attempted to visualize the structure of KChIP4a. Subsequently, we investigated the features of this structure and how they serve in the modulation of Kv4 function. Here we describe the crystal structure of KChIP4a, showing that its N-terminal α-helices have a distinctive fork-like conformation that distinguishes it from KChIP1 and that these helices confer the slow gating of Kv4 channels. Taken together with functional and biochemical data, our findings provide a structural mechanism for KChIP4a modulation of Kv4 inactivation. Molecular Biology and Materials—Constructs of full-length Mouse KChIP4a (229 amino acids, GenBank™ accession number AF453243) and the N terminus of human Kv4.3 containing amino acids 6–145 were cloned by PCR into pET28a and pMAL-c2 vectors, respectively. For electrophysiology, WT or mutant cDNA constructs of either Kv4.3 or KChIPs were subcloned into pBluescript KSM (8Jow F. Zhang Z.H. Kopsco D.C. Carroll K.C. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15535-15540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T3 mMESSAGE Machine kit (Ambion) following linearization of the cDNA construct with NotI enzyme. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. All mutations of human Kv4.3 and KChIP4a cDNAs were carried out using the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and insertion of segments in all clones was rigorously verified by sequencing. All materials not specifically identified were purchased from Sigma. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording in Xenopus Oocytes—For oocyte expression, Xenopus oocytes (stages V and VI) were selected and injected with 46 nl of solution containing 0.5–4.0 ng of the selected cRNA using a microinjector (Drummond Scientific Co.). One to 2 days after injection, oocytes were impaled with two microelectrodes (0.5–1.0 megohms) filled with 3 m KCl in a 40 μl recording chamber, and whole cell currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp. The chamber was constantly perfused with ND-96 recording solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. Currents were recorded in ND-96 solution at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) or an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments). Data were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA) and digitized at 1.0 kHz using an ITC-16 (Instrutech Corp.). Data were analyzed using PulseFit, Igor, or Microcal Origin 6.1. Inactivation time constants (τ1 and τ2) were obtained by fitting double exponential functions to the decaying phases of Kv4.3 currents. The inactivation time constant, τ1, was defined as the predominant component of current amplitude. The kinetics of recovery from inactivation were analyzed by curve fitting of current to a single exponential function. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was assessed by the t test. Biochemical Analysis by SEC-FPLC—Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis was performed with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 column and monitored at 280 nm absorbance to determine the protein concentration eluted from the column. The purified protein was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), and SEC was then performed on an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system using a buffer (containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml from the separation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Size exclusion calibration standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used to generate a calibration curve by calculating the size of proteins eluted from the column. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—For protein expression and purification, KChIP4aΔ34 (core of KChIP4a), the KIS domain of KChIP4a (N-terminal residues 1–34), and Kv4.3N (residues 6–145) were cloned into bacterial expression vectors pET28a, pGEX-6p1, and pMAL-c2, respectively, and were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Expression of fused proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 h at 22 °C. The cells were subsequently pelleted and resuspended in buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After lysis by sonication and centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 50 min, the clear supernatant was decanted and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the lysate was loaded onto a previously equilibrated 1-ml HiTrap Ni2+ chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), GST4B resin column (GE Healthcare), and an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs) at a rate of 1 ml/min. After washing the column, the bound proteins Hiscore KChIP4a (KChIP4aΔ34), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KIS domain, and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Kv4.3N were eluted for further use. To test the interaction between the KIS domain and Kv4.3N with the core of KChIP4a (KChIP4aΔ34), ∼200 μg of His-core KChIP4a was loaded into nickel resin, and the resin was divided into two parts used for flow-through of either ∼120 μg of the GST-KIS domain or ∼200 μg of MBP-Kv4.3N. After extensive washing with a buffer (containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole), ∼10 μl of resin was loaded on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. The remaining resin was eluted with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, and proteins were then concentrated and further fractionated by SEC-FPLC. To test for competition between the KIS domain of KChIP4a and Kv4.3N (residues 6–145) with the core domain of KChIP4a, ∼200 μg of His-core KChIP4a was loaded into nickel resin before flow-through of ∼240 μg of the GST-KIS domain into the resin. After extensive washing with buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole, the nickel resin was evenly divided into three parts and mixed with different concentrations of MBP-Kv4.3N at 4 °C for 2 h before separating the liquid and solid phases by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. After discarding the supernatant and washing the resin with the same buffer, ∼10 μl of resin was loaded on SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie staining. The remaining resin from part 2 was eluted with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, and proteins were then concentrated and further fractionated by SEC-FPLC. Structural Biology—For protein expression and purification, full-length mouse WT KChIP4a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF453243) was subcloned into pET28a prokaryotic expression vectors (Novagen). KChIP4a proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells expressing KChIP4a were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 8 h at room temperature, pelleted, then resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, supplemented with 1 tablet per 20 ml of buffer A with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using 5 ml of buffer A per gram of cell pellet. The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1.0 h. The recombinant protein was first purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and then further cleaned by anion exchange (Source-15Q, GE Healthcare) and gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) as described previously (27Wang H.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of KChIP4a were obtained at room temperature by hanging drop vapor diffusion in which the well solution consisted of 1.6–1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 4% (v/v) isopropanol, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and crystals were flash-frozen in mother liquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol. Data for these KChIP4a crystals were collected at home beam (Beijing, China). All the data sets were processed using the program DENZO (31Borek D. Minor W. Otwinowski Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These crystals belong to space group I41 and contain two KChIP4a molecules per asymmetric unit. KChIP4a Structure Determination and Refinement—The KChIP4a crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement (AMORE included in CCP4) using the coordinates of bound KChIP1 (PDB code 2NZ0) as the searching model and refined by position refinement with the program CNS (crystallography and NMR system), version 1.1 (32Brunger A.T.

All of the residues except 173–183 were built into the density for KChIP4a. The statistics for this data collection and refinement are listed in Table 1.

Overall Structure of KChIP4a with Distinctive N-terminal α-Helices—The full-length mouse KChIP4a protein (229 amino acids) expressed in BL21(DE3) cells was purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of KChIP1 as the initial searching model (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Scannevin R.H. Wang K. Jow F. Megules J. Kopsco D.C. Edris W. Carroll K.C. Lu Q. Xu W. Xu Z. Katz A.H. Olland S.

Overall, KChIP4a is composed of an N-terminal region with six α-helices (H0–H5) and a C-terminal region of five α-helices (H6–H10) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal α-helices (H0–H2) of KChIP4a are positioned in such a way that they cause H10 to swing outward ∼45° from the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1B). After a 90° rotation of the upper panels of Fig. 1B, the lower panels show the relative positioning between H10 and N-terminal α-helices H0–H2 that occupy the hydrophobic pocket and push the H10 out from the pocket as compared with data concerning the bound and free KChIP1 proteins in previous studies (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Scannevin R.H. Wang K. Jow F. Megules J.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Compared with KChIP1, substantial structural variations are observed in the three N-terminal α-helices (H0–H2) of KChIP4a (Figs. 1B and 2A, left panels). Except for the N-terminal α-helices (H0–H2), which cause H10 to swing up from the hydrophobic pocket, the core structure of KChIP4a shows good alignment with the bound KChIP1 that sequesters the N terminus of Kv4.3 (Fig. 2A, right panel) (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the most striking difference between KChIP4a and KChIP1 is identifiable around the first 30 N-terminal residues of KChIP4a, which form a long α-helix followed by a short rigid coil. These N-terminal residues bind to a well defined hydrophobic pocket formed by the conserved structural components of KChIP4a (Fig. 2B, left panel). Structural comparison indicates that this hydrophobic pocket of KChIP4a is similar to that of KChIP1 (Fig. 2B, right panel). This hydrophobic pocket has recently been shown to form the same type of binding groove that is recognized by the Kv4.3 N terminus in KChIP1 (27Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The structure of the core of KChIP4a reveals that its hydrophobic groove can sequester the N terminus of Kv4.3 (Fig. 2, A, left panel, and B, right panel). Binding of the first α-helix (H0) of KChIP4a to this pocket is mediated predominantly by hydrophobic interactions. Many of these interactions result from contact of hydrophobic residues, which are located along one side of the first α-helix (such as Val-11, Leu-12, Val-14, Ile-15, Phe-18, Val-19, Leu-21, and Phe-25), with their corresponding neighboring residues in the pocket (Phe-124, Ile-90, Leu-128, Phe-111, Leu-131/Leu-128, Ile-167, Phe-225, Phe-225). In contrast, no hydrogen or salt bond is observed between the first α-helix and its binding groove (Fig. 2B, left panel). Another striking difference in KChIP4a as compared with KChIP1 occurs around α-helix 3 (H2). In this locus residues in H2 are rearranged into one long single α-helix that nearly parallels the first α-helix, H0, and this helix is packed against one side of the groove (Fig. 2A, left panel). Release of N-terminal KChIP4a Bound to the Hydrophobic Groove upon Competitive Binding of Kv4.3N—Structural analysis of KChIP4a indicates that the N-terminal H0 (previously called the KIS domain) of KChIP4a binds to the hydrophobic groove shown to sequester the Kv4.3 N terminus in a recent description of the Kv4.3N-KChIP1 structural complex (27Wang H.

https://openalex.org/W2104443763,"Time series analysis of fossil biodiversity of marine invertebrates in the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) shows a significant periodicity at approximately 63 My, in agreement with previous analyses based on the Sepkoski database. I discuss how this result did not appear in a previous analysis of the PBDB. The existence of the 63 My periodicity, despite very different treatment of systematic error in both PBDB and Sepkoski databases strongly argues for consideration of its reality in the fossil record. Cross-spectral analysis of the two datasets finds that a 62 My periodicity coincides in phase by 1.6 My, equivalent to better than the errors in either measurement. Consequently, the two data sets not only contain the same strong periodicity, but its peaks and valleys closely correspond in time. Two other spectral peaks appear in the PBDB analysis, but appear to be artifacts associated with detrending and with the increased interval length. Sampling-standardization procedures implemented by the PBDB collaboration suggest that the signal is not an artifact of sampling bias. Further work should focus on finding the cause of the 62 My periodicity."
https://openalex.org/W1984314757,"In mouse Paneth cells, alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins (Crps), are activated by matrix metalloproteinase-7-mediated proteolysis of inactive precursors (pro-Crps) to bactericidal forms. The activating cleavage step at Ser(43) downward arrow Ile(44) in mouse pro-Crp4-(20-92) removes nine acidic amino acids that collectively block the membrane-disruptive behavior of the Crp4 moiety of the proform. This inhibitory mechanism has been investigated further to identify whether specific cluster(s) of electronegative amino acids in pro-Crp4-(20-43) are responsible for blocking bactericidal activity and membrane disruption. To test whether specific cluster(s) of electronegative amino acids in pro-Crp4-(20-43) have specific positional effects that block bactericidal peptide activity and membrane disruption, acidic residues positioned at the distal (Asp(20), Asp(26), Glu(27), and Glu(28)), mid (Glu(32) and Glu(33)), and proximal (Glu(37), Glu(38), and Asp(39)) clusters in pro-Crp4-(20-92) were mutagenized, and variants were assayed for differential effects of mutagenesis on bactericidal peptide activity. Substitution of the mid and proximal Asp and Glu clusters with Gly produced additive effects with respect to the induction of both bactericidal activity and membrane permeabilization of live Escherichia coli ML35 cells. In contrast, substitution of distal Glu and Asp residues with Gly or their deletion resulted in pro-Crp4-(20-92) variants with bactericidal and membrane-disruptive activities equal to or greater than that of fully mature Crp4. These findings support the conclusion that the most distal N-terminal anionic residues of pro-Crp4-(20-92) are primarily responsible for blocking Crp4-mediated membrane disruption in the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2084915711,"The heart is a vital organ that provides essential circulation throughout the body. Malfunction of cardiac pumping, thus, leads to serious and most of the times, to fatal diseases. Mechanics of cardiac pumping is a complex process, and many experimental and theoretical approaches have been undertaken to understand this process. We have taken advantage of the simplicity of the embryonic heart of an invertebrate, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand the fundamental mechanics of the beating heart. We applied a live imaging technique to the beating embryonic heart combined with analytical imaging tools to study the dynamic mechanics of the pumping. Furthermore, we have identified one mutant line that exhibits aberrant pumping mechanics. The Drosophila embryonic heart consists of only 104 cardiac cells forming a simple straight tube that can be easily accessed for real-time imaging. Therefore, combined with the wealth of available genetic tools, the embryonic Drosophila heart may serve as a powerful model system for studies of human heart diseases, such as arrhythmia and congenital heart diseases. We, furthermore, believe our mechanistic data provides important information that is useful for our further understanding of the design of biological structure and function and for engineering the pumps for medical uses."
https://openalex.org/W1966239691,"Mammalian defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides that play a central role in host innate immunity and as regulators of acquired immunity. In animals, three structural defensin subfamilies, designated as α, β, and θ, have been characterized, each possessing a distinctive tridisulfide motif. Mature α- and β-defensins are produced by simple proteolytic processing of their prepropeptide precursors. In contrast, the macrocyclic θ-defensins are formed by the head-to-tail splicing of nonapeptides excised from a pair of prepropeptide precursors. Thus, elucidation of the θ-defensin biosynthetic pathway provides an opportunity to identify novel factors involved in this unique process. We incorporated the θ-defensin precursor, proRTD1a, into a bait construct for a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified rhesus macaque stromal cell-derived factor 2-like protein 1 (SDF2L1), as an interactor. SDF2L1 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone complex, which we found to also interact with α- and β-defensins. However, analysis of the SDF2L1 domain requirements for binding of representative α-, β-, and θ-defensins revealed that α- and β-defensins bind SDF2L1 similarly, but differently from the interactions that mediate binding of SDF2L1 to pro-θ-defensins. Thus, SDF2L1 is a factor involved in processing and/or sorting of all three defensin subfamilies.

Thus, SDF2L1 is a factor involved in processing and/or sorting of all three defensin subfamilies. Mammalian defensins are tridisulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides that contribute to innate immunity in all species studied to date. Defensins are comprised of three structural subfamilies: the α-, β-, and θ-defensins (1Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). α- and β-Defensins are peptides of about 29–45-amino acid residues with similar three-dimensional structures. Despite their similar tertiary conformations, the disulfide motifs of α- and β-defensins differ. Expression of human α-defensins is tissue-specific. Four myeloid α-defensins (HNP1–4) are expressed predominantly by neutrophils and monocytes wherein they are packaged in granules, while two enteric α-defensins (HD-5 and HD-6) are expressed at high levels in Paneth cells of the small intestine. Myeloid α-defensins constitute about 5% of the protein mass of human neutrophils. HNPs are discharged into the phagosome during phagocytic ingestion of microbial particles. HD-5 and HD-6 are produced and stored as propeptides in Paneth cell granules and are processed extracellularly by intestinal trypsin (2Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). β-Defensins are produced primarily by various epithelia (e.g. skin, urogenital tract, airway) and are secreted by the producing cells in their mature forms. In contrast to pro-α-defensins, which contain a conserved prosegment of ∼40 amino acids, the prosegments in β-defensins vary in length and sequence. θ-Defensins are found only in Old World monkeys and orangutans and are the only known circular peptides in animals. These 18-residue macrocyclic peptides are formed by ligation of two nonamer sequences excised from two precursor polypeptides, which are truncated versions of ancestral α-defensins. Like myeloid α-defensins, θ-defensins are stored primarily in neutrophil and monocyte granules (3Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Numerous laboratories have demonstrated that the antimicrobial properties of defensins derive from their ability to bind and disrupt target cell membranes (4Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H.

While much has been learned about regulation of defensin expression, little is known about the factors involved in their biosynthesis. Valore and Ganz (17Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the processing of defensins in cultured cells and demonstrated that maturation of HNPs occurs through two proteolytic steps that lead to formation of mature α-defensins, but the proteases involved have yet to be identified. Moreover, there are virtually no published data regarding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor; HA, hemagglutinin; AD, activation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MIR, mannosyl-transferase, IP3 receptor, ryanodine receptor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor; HA, hemagglutinin; AD, activation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MIR, mannosyl-transferase, IP3 receptor, ryanodine receptor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. factors that are responsible for the folding, processing, and sorting steps necessary for defensin maturation and secretion or trafficking to the proper subcellular compartment. It is likely that several chaperones, proteases, and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family proteins are involved. Consistent with this possibility, Gruber et al. (18Gruber C.W. Cemazar M. Clark R.J. Horibe T. Renda R.F. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20435-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the role of a PDI in biosynthesis of cyclotides, small ∼30-residue macrocyclic peptides produced by plants. The primary structures of α- and θ-defensin precursors are closely related. We therefore undertook studies to identify proteins that interact with representative propeptides of each defensin subfamily with the goal of determining common and unique processes that regulate biosynthesis of α- and θ-defensins. We used two-hybrid analysis to first identify interactors of the θ-defensin precursor, proRTD1a. As described, we identified SDF2L1, a component of the ER-chaperone complex as an interactor, and showed that it also specifically interacts with α- and β-defensins. This suggests that SDF2L1 is involved in the maturation/trafficking of defensins at a step common to all three subfamilies of mammalian defensins.

Total RNA prepared from rhesus macaque bone marrow (obtained from the Oklahoma National Primate Research Center) was reverse-transcribed and first strand cDNA was amplified using long distance PCR and purified using spin columns. The amplified cDNA and linearized pGADT7-Rec plasmid were then transformed into yeast AH109 cells containing proRTD1a/pGBKT7 (DBD-proRTD1a) plasmid as recommended by the manufacturer (Matchmaker 3; Clontech). Homologous recombination between the amplified PCR product and pGADT7-Rec produced circular plasmids with the amplified cDNAs cloned downstream of the GAL4 activation domain (AD). Transformants were plated on selective synthetic medium containing dextrose (SDex) and lacking histidine, adenine, tryptophan, and leucine (quadruple drop out; SDex/QDO), disclosing positive interactors. An aliquot of the transformant mixture was also plated on SDex lacking tryptophan and leucine (SDex-TL) to calculate the number of colonies screened, estimated to be ∼2 × 106. Colonies from SDex/QDO plates were replated on SDex/QDO plates containing 20 mg/l 5-bromo-4-chloro-in-doyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal; SDex/QDO+X-α-gal plate) and the pGADT7-Rec plasmid was isolated from blue colonies. The pGADT7-Rec plasmid thus isolated was transformed into Escherichia coli and selected on LB-ampicillin plates. The size of inserts in pGADT7-Rec transformants was determined by agarose electrophoresis of PCR products. Plasmids with inserts of >300 bp were retransformed into yeast AH109 containing proRTD1a/pGBKT7 or control pGBKT7 vector. Inserts that showed two-hybrid interactions in the presence of DBD-proRTD1a but not in the presence of vector alone (putative interactors) were then sequenced. Spot Test Analysis—Triplicate transformant colonies from SDex-TL plates were grown in SDex-TL medium to saturation, and 3 μl of each culture were spotted on SDex/QDO+X-α-gal and control SDex-TL plates. All DBD-fusion and AD-fusion constructs were tested to confirm that they did not activate the reporters by themselves. AH109 cells transformed with plasmids for AD-SV40 large T/DBD-p53 and AD-SV40 large T/DBD-laminin A were used as two-hybrid positive and negative controls, respectively, on all plates (denoted by “+” and “-” in figures). Plates were incubated for 3–5 days at 30 °C. In Vitro Transcription Translation of [35S]HA-SDF2L1—The pGADT7-Rec plasmid, which contains the T7 promoter and an HA-epitope tag downstream of the GAL4-AD, was used for biosynthesis of HA-tagged proteins in vitro. [35S]HA-SDF2L1 was produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and the AD-SDF2L1 plasmid (see Table 1) per the supplier's protocol. Reactions were carried out in triplicate (90 min, 30 °C) in the presence of [35S]Met (>1000 Ci/mmol). Reaction mixtures were pooled and desalted on Zeba desalt spin columns (Pierce) equilibrated in HEN buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl), and stored at –20 °C. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—pCBGST1 plasmids (19Baniahmad C. Baniahmad A. O'Malley B.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 194-196PubMed Google Scholar) expressing GST or GST fusions were transformed into yeast JD47–13C (20Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). Cells were grown in SDex-Trp medium containing 0.1 mm CuSO4, harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100; plus EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) per 50 ml of cell culture. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was re-extracted with buffer A containing protease inhibitors, and this extract was combined with the initial supernatant and clarified by centrifugation. Affinity columns were prepared in duplicate by adding glutathione beads to yeast extracts containing GST fusion proteins and incubating the mixture at 4 °C for 3 h, after which beads were washed with buffer A. Pull-down assays were performed using affinity columns prepared from yeast lysates expressing GST alone, GST-proRTD1a, or GST-proHNP3. One set of columns was loaded with 85 μl of HEN buffer plus 15 μl of [35S]HA-SDF2L1 and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were then washed twice with HEN buffer and boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 15% acrylamide SDS-Tricine gel and analyzed by autoradiography. In parallel, a second set of affinity columns was similarly processed for electrophoresis, but bound proteins were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-Tricine gels to assess the quantity of GST fusion protein bound to each affinity column. Interaction Studies using Human Myeloid α-Defensins (HNPs) Produced in HL-60 Cells—HL-60 cells, grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), were harvested and duplicate 2 × 106 cell-samples were suspended in 1 ml of labeling medium (Cys- and Met-free DMEM, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, antibiotics, and 30 mg/liter Met). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 80 μCi/ml of [35S]Cys (1075 Ci/mmol) was added for 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and extracts were prepared by addition of 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Igepal CA630) containing complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) and extracted for 0.5–1 h. Clarified extracts were added to either GST or GST-ΔN28SDF2L1 (Table 1) columns (prepared as above) and mixed at 4 °C for 3 h. As controls, HNPs from HL-60 extracts were immunoprecipitated with either α-HNP IgG or pre-immune IgG and protein A-Sepharose. The columns were washed twice with cell lysis buffer, and bound proteins were desorbed and analyzed on SDS-tricine gels by autoradiography as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of DBD Fusion Proteins—Extracts of AH109 cells transformed with DBD-vector (pGBKT7), DBD-proRTD1a, or DBD-proseg plasmids (Table 1) were prepared in buffer A containing EDTA-free protease inhibitors by lysis with glass beads. Extracts containing ∼0.7 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated with α-DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) and Protein A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were washed twice with buffer A and bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 15% acrylamide SDS-Tricine gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with α-Myc antibody (Covance), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected with x-ray film. Bioinformatics Analyses—The ExPASy proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics was used for BLAST searches of the SWISSPROT data base, for alignment of protein sequences and for homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL. The Ensembl data base was used for BLASTN search of the Macaca mulatta genome data base (21Flicek P. Aken B.L. Beal K. Ballester B. Caccamo M. Chen Y. Clarke L. Coates G. Cunningham F. Cutts T.

Rhesus SDF2L1 Interacts with proRTD1a—θ-Defensins are synthesized by immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow (3Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To identify proteins involved in θ-defensin biosynthesis, we employed two-hybrid analyses wherein the θ-defensin precursor, proRTD1a (fused with DBD) was used as the bait, and rhesus bone marrow cDNA cloned into pGADT7 provided a library of potential interactors that were screened in the AH109 yeast strain. After eliminating false positives, pGADT7-Rec plasmids bearing interactors were sequenced and identified by BLAST analysis. Among the dozen interactors identified was a 221-amino acid residue protein that was 97.3% identical to human SDF2L1 (Swiss-Prot Accession Number: Q9HCN8; Fig. 1A). A BLASTN search of the M. mulatta genomic data base identified the cloned cDNA as rhesus macaque SDF2L1, a three-exon gene located on chromosome 10.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), we conducted experiments to characterize the interaction of SDF2L1 with defensin precursors in vitro and in vivo. Interaction of SDF2L1 with proRTD1a was confirmed by retransforming AH109 cells with DBD-proRTD1a and SDF2L1/pGADT7-Rec (AD-SDF2L1) plasmids. Colonies from SDex-TL plates were replated and grew as blue colonies on SDex/QDO+X-α-gal plates. In contrast AH109 cells with pGBKT7 vector (DBD-vector) and AD-SDF2L1 or DBD-proRTD1a and pGADT7-Rec (AD-vector) plasmids were incapable of growth on SDex/QDO+X-α-gal plates (Fig. 1B). The plasmid bearing the SDF2L1 sequence encodes the full length protein. To determine whether the N-terminal signal sequence was required for interaction with proRTD1a (which would cast doubt on the physiologic relevance of the interaction) we produced pGADT7-Rec encoding a truncated form of SDF2L1 lacking the N-terminal signal peptide (AD-ΔN28SDF2L1). As shown in Fig. 1B, cells bearing the AD-ΔN28SDF2L1 and DBD-proRTD1a plasmids grew as blue colonies on SDex/QDO+X-α-gal plates, whereas negative controls did not. These data demonstrate that the interaction of proRTD1a with SDF2L1 is not mediated through (nonspecific) interactions with the SDF2L1 signal peptide. To further analyze the interaction of proRTD1a with SDF2L1 we conducted GST pull-down experiments. GST and GST-proRTD1a columns were prepared from yeast lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2, left panel). Columns were incubated with [35S]HA-SDF2L1 and washed with HEN-buffer. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 (right panel), [35S]HA-SDF2L1 was specifically retained on the GST-proRTD1a column, but not on GST columns, demonstrating an in vitro interaction between proRTD1a and SDF2L1. A Nonamer Sequence in RTD1a Is Sufficient for SDF2L1 Interaction—To delineate the proRTD1a sequence that interacts with SDF2L1, we expressed selected truncated forms of proRTD1a fused to the DBD, including the prosegment sequence (DBD-proseg), the propeptide lacking the C-terminal RLL-tripeptide (DBD-proRTD1aΔRLL), and a fusion of DBD to the RTD1a nonapeptide that constitutes half of the mature cyclic θ-defensin structure (DBD-RTD1a-9mer; Fig. 3A). Two hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between AD-SDF2L1 and DBD-proRTD1aΔRLL as well as DBD-RTD1a-9mer. However, neither the DBD vector nor DBD-proseg showed two-hybrid interaction with AD-SDF2L1 (Fig. 3B). The lack of interaction was not due to instability of the mutant protein as evidenced by the presence of comparable amounts of immunoprecipitable DBD, DBD-proRTD1a, and DBD-proseg in yeast lysates (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that the θ-defensin prosegment is not required for interaction with SDF2L1, and that the RTD1a nonapeptide is sufficient for this interaction. Interactions of Human Defensins with SDF2L1—Because human myeloid α-defensins (HNPs) have significant homology to the (pro-θ-defensin) proRTD1a (3Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), we tested for the ability of proHNPs to interact with SDF2L1. For these studies we produced a DBD-proHNP3 fusion and observed a positive interaction that was judged to be specific since DBD-proHNP3 did not activate the reporters in the presence of pGADT7-Rec vector alone. As with proRTD1a, deletion of the SDF2L1 signal sequence did not abolish this interaction, indicating that the interaction was not mediated through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the signal peptide (Fig. 4B). Pull-down experiments were performed using GST or GST-proHNP3 columns incubated with [35S]HA-SDF2L1. Analysis of the bound proteins demonstrated that [35S]HA-SDF2L1 was specifically retained on the GST-proHNP3 column (Fig. 4C). Thus, like proRTD1a, proHNP3 interacts with SDF2L1 in yeast and in vitro. As noted above, processing of (α-defensin) proHNP3 gives rise to a linear peptide, whereas proRTD1a is converted via excision and splicing reactions to a cyclic octadecapeptide. Previously, Liu and Ganz (25Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a 12-amino acid residue motif in the HNP prosegment (amino acid residues 40–51) that was required for correct processing and sorting of mature HNP peptides. We hypothesized that this sequence motif might also interact with SDF2L1. To test this, we produced a two-hybrid construct in which residues 35–49 were deleted (DBD-proHNP3Δ35–49). When tested in the two hybrid assay, we observed an interaction between proHNP3Δ35–49 and SDF2L1 and also between mature HNP3 sequence (DBD-HNP3) and SDF2L1 (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the mature HNP sequence is sufficient for interaction with SDF2L1 and that the prosegment is not required. The human promyelocytic cell line HL60 is known to synthesize HNPs (17Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Herwig S. Su Q. Zhang W. Ma Y. Tempst P. Blood. 1996; 87: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction of HNPs with SDF2L1, GST-ΔN28SDF2L1 and GST columns were prepared (Fig. 4E, left panel) and incubated with extracts of [35S]Cys-labeled HL60 cells. Bound proteins were desorbed and characterized by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4E (right panel), a radiolabeled peptide that comigrated with mature HNP bound to immobilized GST-ΔN28SDF2L1, but not to GST beads. These results demonstrate the interaction of SDF2L1 with endogenous HNPs expressed in human leukemia cells, confirming the interactions detected in the two-hybrid assays. Because SDF2L1 interacted with precursors and mature sequences of structurally diverse (α- and θ-) myeloid defensins, we sought to determine if other defensins interact with SDF2L1. We fused DBD to the prodefensin sequences of human enteric α-defensin HD5 (2Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and human β-defensin HBD-1 (27Hiratsuka T. Nakazato M. Ihi T. Minematsu T. Chino N. Nakanishi T. Shimizu A. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nephron. 2000; 85: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In two hybrid analysis, AH109 cells expressing either DBD-proHBD1 or DBD-proHD5 in the presence of AD-ΔN28SDF2L1 plasmid grew as blue colonies on SDex/QDO+X-α-gal plates. No growth was observed for cells expressing either DBD-proHBD1 or DBD-proHD5 in the presence of the control pGBKT7 plasmid (Fig. 5), indicating that the interaction was specific. These data demonstrate that SDF2L1 interacts with precursors of α-, β-, and θ-defensins. Interactions of Pro-defensins with SDF2L1 Mutants—SDF2L1 has three ∼50 residue MIR (Mannosyltransferase, IP3 receptor, Ryanodine receptor) domains (28Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 48-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which correspond to residues 35–87 (MIR1), 95–150 (MIR2), and 151–205 (MIR3). To date no function has been attributed to any of the MIRs. We constructed a three-dimensional model of SDF2L1 using SWISS-MODEL (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C.
