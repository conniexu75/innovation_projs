https://openalex.org/W3048620154,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1, a pandemic. With rapidly accumulating numbers of cases and deaths reported globally2, a vaccine is urgently needed. Here we report the available safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04368728) among 45 healthy adults (18–55 years of age), who were randomized to receive 2 doses—separated by 21 days—of 10 μg, 30 μg or 100 μg of BNT162b1. BNT162b1 is a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. A second vaccination with 100 μg was not administered because of the increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared with the 30-μg dose. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titres reached 1.9–4.6-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which were obtained at least 14 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate. In a dose-escalation study of the COVID-19 RNA vaccine BNT162b1 in 45 healthy adults, RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second vaccine dose."
https://openalex.org/W3045645692,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019–2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryoelectron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirales order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12 thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapy development."
https://openalex.org/W3048665145,"Summary Checkpoint immunotherapy unleashes T cell control of tumors, but is undermined by immunosuppressive myeloid cells. TREM2 is a myeloid receptor that transmits intracellular signals that sustain microglial responses during Alzheimer’s disease. TREM2 is also expressed by tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Here, we found that Trem2–/– mice are more resistant to growth of various cancers than wild-type mice and are more responsive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Furthermore, treatment with anti-TREM2 mAb curbed tumor growth and fostered regression when combined with anti-PD-1. scRNA-seq revealed that both TREM2 deletion and anti-TREM2 are associated with scant MRC1+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages in the tumor infiltrate, paralleled by expansion of myeloid subsets expressing immunostimulatory molecules that promote improved T cell responses. TREM2 was expressed in tumor macrophages in over 200 human cancer cases and inversely correlated with prolonged survival for two types of cancer. Thus, TREM2 might be targeted to modify tumor myeloid infiltrates and augment checkpoint immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3048711673,"Summary Cell function and activity are regulated through integration of signaling, epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic pathways. Here, we introduce INs-seq, an integrated technology for massively parallel recording of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein activity. We demonstrate the broad utility of INs-seq for discovering new immune subsets by profiling different intracellular signatures of immune signaling, transcription factor combinations, and metabolic activity. Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 1-expressing cells within tumor models, a metabolic immune signature of suppressive activity, discovers novel Arg1+ Trem2+ regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells and identifies markers, metabolic activity, and pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice inhibits accumulation of intra-tumoral Mreg cells, leading to a marked decrease in dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and intra-cellular maps and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid suppressive cells in tumors."

One-carbon (C1) compound assimilation by microorganisms has emerged as a promising approach in abating climate change (Bogorad et al., 2014Bogorad I.W. Chen C.-T. Theisen M.K. Wu T.-Y. Schlenz A.R.

Among all C1 compounds, methanol is the most electron rich in the liquid form and can be derived from the greenhouse gases methane and CO2 (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014Conrado R.J. Gonzalez R.

In addition, methanol is already an industrial feedstock, and, thus, is potentially attractive as a substrate for bioconversion (Bertau et al., 2014Bertau M. Offermanns H. Plass L. Schmidt F. Methanol: the basic chemical and energy feedstock of the future. Springer, 2014Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The native methanol utilization and conversion pathways in natural methylotrophs, such as Methylobacterium extorquens and Bacillus methanolicus, have been well characterized (Bennett et al., 2018bBennett R.K.

Methanol assimilation in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1: demonstration of all enzymes and their regulation.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13001Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These organisms typically utilize the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle or the serine pathway for methanol assimilation (Chistoserdova et al., 2009Chistoserdova L. Kalyuzhnaya M.G. Lidstrom M.E. The expanding world of methylotrophic metabolism.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 477-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, the enzymes involved in the RuMP cycle overlap with those used in the typical sugar metabolism (Figure 1A; Table S1), except for three enzymes (methanol dehydrogenase [Medh], hexulose-6-phosphate synthase [Hps], and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase [Phi]). Thus, significant efforts have been made to convert sugar heterotrophs to methylotrophs for scientific and industrial interests by overexpressing these three enzymes (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.-T. Chen F.Y.-H. Bogorad I.W. Wu T.-Y. Zhang R. Lee A.S. Liao J.C. Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production.Metab.

Engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum for methanol-dependent growth and glutamate production.Metab. Eng. 2018; 49: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If this can be achieved, then the industrial biotechnology sector can include methanol as an alternative non-food carbon source using a common industrial microbe. Despite initial successes in engineering sugar heterotrophs to assimilate methanol, it has not been possible to convert such heterotrophs to methylotrophs that efficiently utilize methanol as the sole carbon and energy source. Reported examples required other carbon sources or nutrients in the medium to support growth (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.-T. Chen F.Y.-H. Bogorad I.W. Wu T.-Y. Zhang R. Lee A.S. Liao J.C.

Lindner S.N. Aslan S. Yishai O. Wenk S. Schann K. Bar-Even A. Growth of E. coli on formate and methanol via the reductive glycine pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Apparently, successful expression of three heterologous genes is insufficient to turn E. coli into a methylotroph. Here we report a major problem involving DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC) that prevented E. coli from growing in methanol as the sole carbon source and how genome editing, copy number variations (CNVs), and mutations introduced by laboratory evolution overcame this hurdle, resulting in a synthetic methylotrophic E. coli that efficiently grows to a high OD with a doubling time of 8 h. To develop a synthetic methylotroph, we began with our RuMP cycle-based methanol auxotrophy strategy (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.-T. Chen F.Y.-H. Bogorad I.W. Wu T.-Y. Zhang R. Lee A.S. Liao J.C. Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production.Metab. Eng. 2018; 49: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Figure 1B; Figure S1A). It calls for disruption of the pentose phosphate pathway by deleting rpiAB and installing methanol-utilizing genes (medh, hps, and phi) so that the cell can grow on methanol plus xylose in minimal medium but not on xylose alone. Thus, methanol assimilation can be used as a selection pressure during evolution. Instead of the previously established BL21 strain, we opted to reconstruct an auxotrophic E. coli BW25113 ΔrpiAB strain for its higher success rate of genome manipulation. We integrated two synthetic operons (Figure S1B) for stable expression, designated CFC381.0. The first operon consists of the three heterologous genes: medh (CT4-1, engineered from Cupriavidus necator; Wu et al., 2016Wu T.-Y. Chen C.T. Liu J.T. Bogorad I.W. Damoiseaux R. Liao J.C. Characterization and evolution of an activator-independent methanol dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator N-1.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2016; 100: 4969-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), hps (from Bacillus methanolicus), and phi (from Methylobacillus flagellatus). The second operon includes the same medh and phi but a different hps (from Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1S) (Figure S1C) along with tkt (encoding transketolase from Methylococcus capsulatus) and tal (encoding transaldolase from Klebsiella pneumoniae; Lin et al., 2018Lin P.P. Jaeger A.J. Wu T.-Y. Xu S.C. Lee A.S. Gao F. Chen P.-W. Liao J.C. Construction and evolution of an Escherichia coli strain relying on nonoxidative glycolysis for sugar catabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because enzymes from different organisms differ in michaelis constant (Km), we intentionally expressed various isofunctional enzymes simultaneously to maximize the flexibility of metabolic flux balance. After 20 liquid transfer cycles, which we define as “passages,” the evolved strain CFC381.20 could grow from OD600 0.1 to OD600 1.0 in a minimal medium containing 400 mM of methanol and 20 mM xylose in 48 h (Figures S1D and S1E) but could not grow without methanol. As approximately 3–4 generations elapsed per passage, CFC381.20 demonstrated the methanol auxotrophy phenotype as desired within 80 generations. Whole-genome sequencing of CFC381.20 (Table S2) revealed a 4-bp insertion in the frmA gene. The inactivation of frmA, which is responsible for detoxifying formaldehyde to formic acid, has also been seen previously in similar efforts (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.-T. Chen F.Y.-H. Bogorad I.W. Wu T.-Y. Zhang R. Lee A.S. Liao J.C. Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production.Metab. Eng. 2018; 49: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Gonzalez et al., 2018Gonzalez J.E. Bennett R.K. Papoutsakis E.T. Antoniewicz M.R. Methanol assimilation in Escherichia coli is improved by co-utilization of threonine and deletion of leucine-responsive regulatory protein.Metab. Eng. 2018; 45: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Meyer et al., 2018Meyer F. Keller P. Hartl J. Gröninger O.G. Kiefer P. Vorholt J.A. Methanol-essential growth of Escherichia coli.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that the formaldehyde flux must be directed to biosynthetic pathways for efficient methanol-dependent growth. Other significant mutations included truncation of gnd (encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [Gnd]) and a frameshift in fdoG (encoding formate dehydrogenase). Gnd forms a non-productive cycle with Hps, Phi, Pgi, and Zwf, with a net reaction to convert formaldehyde to CO2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydride (NADPH). Similarly, frmA and fdoG drain formaldehyde to CO2 while producing excess nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH). These mutations indicated that, through evolution, the methanol auxotrophic strain reduced competing flux away from the productive RuMP cycle for efficient biosynthesis and biomass accumulation. This methanol auxotroph strain demonstrated that the methanol assimilation branch of the RuMP cycle was functional. However, the replenishment of ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) was still supplied by xylose because the regeneration pathway was disrupted by the rpiAB deletion. Next we attempted to close the RuMP cycle by transforming a plasmid (pFC139) that carries a ribosome binding site (RBS) library expressing rpiA so that CFC381.20 could utilize methanol as the sole carbon source. Unfortunately, the strain could only acquire a limited growth advantage after a series of evolutions in the presence of methanol while supplying additional carbon sources, such as amino acids or xylose. We then hypothesized that kinetic traps in the system curtailed the flux during methanol assimilation. To identify them, we used ensemble modeling for robustness analysis (EMRA; Lee et al., 2014Lee Y. Lafontaine Rivera J.G. Liao J.C. Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis in engineering non-native metabolic pathways.Metab. Eng. 2014; 25: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar; Rivera et al., 2015Rivera J.G.L. Lee Y. Liao J.C. An entropy-like index of bifurcational robustness for metabolic systems.Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2015; 7: 1-9Google Scholar), which examines a large number of models with different kinetic parameters and perturbs them by varying enzyme maximum rate (Vmax), which is largely proportional to the expression levels. It then detects the models that become unstable after increasing or decreasing each Vmax up to 10-fold and reports the percentage of stable models after each perturbation. If the system becomes unstable sharply after a small perturbation in the Vmax of an enzyme, then this enzyme may be involved in a kinetic trap. This analysis provides a qualitative assessment to suggest enzymes that require up- or down-expression to avoid system instability caused by kinetic traps. The results revealed that high activities of phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) tend to destabilize the system by diverting the flux away from the RuMP cycle (Figure 2) and preventing replenishment of the cycle intermediates. Accordingly, we reduced these enzyme activities by knocking out pfkA, which accounts for 90% of the Pfk activity (Kotlarz et al., 1975Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Regulation of the amount and of the activity of phosphofructokinases and pyruvate kinases in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and replacing gapA with gapC from E. coli BL21 (Wu et al., 2012Wu Y. Wu M. He G. Zhang X. Li W. Gao Y. Li Z. Wang Z. Zhang C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: a universal internal control for Western blots in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 423: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which possesses around 40% of K12 BW25113 gapA activity (Figure S2A). The resulting strain, CFC526.0, was then subjected to laboratory evolution with different strategies of nutrient weaning (Figure 1B).Figure S2Evolving a Synthetic Methylotrophic Strain, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) E. coli K12 BW25113 GapA activity and BL21 GapC specific activity.

(C) Growth curve that shows the evolution of CFC526.23-53 in 400 mM methanol with nitrate. Specifically, we grew CFC526.0 in a medium containing methanol and a defined semi-minimal medium, Hi-Def Azure (HDA), that contained amino acids. The HDA amount was sequentially reduced and replaced by a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-based methanol -minimal medium (MM medium) until the culture could grow on methanol as the sole carbon source. Extra vitamins were supplied for better cell metabolism. Nitrate was initially supplied as an extra electron acceptor in addition to oxygen because methanol is an electron-rich substrate, and oxygen transfer may be limiting in shaking flasks. After about 180 days and 21 passages, the culture could finally grow on methanol without any amino acid supplement (Figure 3A; Figure S2B). This initial methylotrophic culture, CFC680.1, which grew solely on methanol, required 20 days to grow to saturation at OD600 1. After 20 more passages, CFC680.20 grew to OD600 1 within 41 h (Figure 3B). We evolved the culture without nitrate and generated a culture, CFC688.20, that could grow without nitrate to reach a similar growth rate (Figure 3C). Independently, we also obtained another methanol-growing strain, CFC526.23, by employing a slower nutrient reduction strategy and evolved it to obtain CFC526.53 (Figure S2C). To ensure that all metabolic products were derived from methanol, 13C labeling experiments were performed. CFC680.8 was passaged six times in MM medium with 13C methanol until all isotopes reach a steady state. As expected, we found that acetate was double labeled, whereas formate was single labeled (Figures 3D and 3E). The isotope labeling experiments provided solid evidence that methanol was the sole carbon source for growth. One noticeable phenotype of these methylotrophic cultures was an exceedingly long lag phase (up to 20 days) when the culture was inoculated from stationary phase (Figure 4A) but not from log phase. Similarly, colonies on a methanol minimal medium plate could not proliferate in a liquid minimal medium. Although microorganisms do exhibit a lag phase when inoculated from a stationary-phase culture, these synthetic methylotrophic E. coli cultures seemed to go through a “point of no return” beyond which the exceedingly long lag phase appeared. After monitoring the viability of the cells at stationary phase by flow cytometry, we found that up to 11% of the cells were dead (Figure 4B). We speculated that the strain may have experienced toxicity from intermediate metabolites, mostly likely formaldehyde. This was foreseeable because the inactivation of frmA inherited from the auxotrophy strain hindered the entire formaldehyde detoxification pathway. Surveying the broad spectrum of biomolecules susceptible to formaldehyde reactions, we hypothesized that DPC was the most likely cause of cell death, which may lead to disruption of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein function (Stingele and Jentsch, 2015Stingele J. Jentsch S. DNA-protein crosslink repair.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis, we purified DPC products from methanol-growing cultures by a modified DNA extraction method (Qin and Wang, 2009Qin H. Wang Y. Exploring DNA-binding proteins with in vivo chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After de-crosslinking the extractant, we analyzed the protein portion by SDS-PAGE. The results suggested that DPC did occur as the culture reached stationary phase (Figure S3A). We then imaged the isolated DPC products using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and unveiled the severity of formaldehyde crosslinking (Figure 4C). Typically, DNA could not be seen with negative staining without coating by proteins such as cytochrome c because the DNA string is too thin for TEM observation (Serwer, 1978Serwer P. A technique for observing extended DNA in negatively stained specimens: observation of bacteriophage T7 capsid-DNA complexes.J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 65: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As expected, during the log phase, only free protein particles were observed, most likely attributable to protein leftovers during the salting-out process. In contrast, the DPC level increased when the culture reached stationary phase (OD600 1.2), causing the entire DNA string to be visible as protein was coated to DNA because of formaldehyde crosslinking. Moreover, we could see protein aggregates along the DNA string. At OD600 1.5, formaldehyde-induced crosslinking became extremely severe; the DNA started to form a web-like structure by DNA-protein-DNA crosslinking or even DNA-DNA crosslinking. Noticeably, DNA strings disappeared when we heated and de-crosslinked DPCs, ruling out the possibility of DNA-protein nonspecific binding or image overlapping. DPC was less severe when the cells were growing in lower methanol concentrations (Figures S3B and S3C). We then conducted quantitative proteomics to reveal that more than 500 proteins were crosslinked with DNA. The common 61 hits of the 100 proteins with the highest abundance from 3 independent samples were then visualized with a heatmap (Figure 4D; Figure S4). As expected, there was a clear trend of increasing crosslinked proteins as the culture entered stationary phase, and the protein abundance in DPC products in the same culture could differ up to 7 orders of magnitude between log phase and late stationary phase. Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis of the 61 proteins suggested that DPCs mainly consisted of ribosomes and outer membrane proteins, whereas several metabolic enzymes were also identified, such as Medh, Tkt, Tal, AceA, Eno, Pyk, and Pgk. Malfunction of these proteins may cause cell death because of outer membrane porin-induced programmed cell death (Noor, 2015Noor R. Mechanism to control the cell lysis and the cell survival strategy in stationary phase under heat stress.Springerplus. 2015; 4: 599Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or metabolic flux imbalance. Moreover, the strong presence of ribosomes also suggested that transcription and translation were heavily affected by DPC. The accumulation of DPC could explain why the culture exhibited an exceedingly long lag phase when inoculated from a stationary-phase culture and may also shed light on the difficulty of evolving a non-methanol-utilizing bacterium to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source. Another phenomenon identified was that the cultures evolved to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source initially failed to grow in the same medium after passing through Luria-Bertani (LB)-rich medium. This observation implied that the sub-populations emerged during evolution and were enriched in different media. To determine how CFC526.0 evolved to grow in methanol, we sequenced 18 evolved cultures in total along the evolution process (Figure 5A; Figure S5). The results showed that some mutations appeared but then vanished within a few passages. Along the evolution line, insertion sequence element 2 (IS2) was inserted upstream of two genes, gltA and ptsH, which distances their promoter away from the open reading frame. Accordingly, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity may be impeded, whereas the ptsH-encoded Hpr protein may be expressed insufficiently, causing a disruption in the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Other mutations included a 12-bp in-frame deletion in pgi and truncated ptsP and proQ. Noticeably, the heterologous genes in the two operons we integrated, which included medh, hps, phi, tkt, and tal, remained unchanged during evolution.Figure S5Strain Characterization of Methylotrophic E. coli, Related to Figure 5Show full captionRelationships between evolution cultures that are sequenced by Illumina Miseq/ Hiseq are shown.

All strains on this chart except strains in gray boxes were sequenced by Illumina Miseq/ Hiseq. Only mutations that are still preserved in SM1 were annotated. We also identified that the evolved mixed cultures had three high-coverage regions flanked by IS elements in their chromosomes: a 70k region spanning from yggE to yghO (Figure 5B) that contains many glycolytic genes and a synthetic operon, PLlacO1:: medh-tkt-tal-hps-phi, in the RuMP pathway; a 7k region encoding the dipeptide transporter operon (ddp) (Figure 5C); and an 130k region from rrsA to rrlB containing several 16S RNAs. The high coverage implies that the cells may have increased expression of genes in those regions. The plasmid sequence also showed three different versions (Figure 5D): one (pFC139A) that contained a specific RBS from the library, one (pFC139B) that contained a triplicated untranslated region (UTR) upstream of rpiA and an IS2 insertion between the p15A replication origin and the cat gene, and another one (pFC139C) that contained the same RBS as pFC139A and an additional inserted IS2 before the promoter of the cat gene. To evaluate the genome variation through evolution, we found that the copy number of the 70k region gradually increased up to 5.6 copies (Figure 6A).Plasmids pFC139A and pFC139B dominated at the early stage of evolution, but pFC139C eventually dominated at the end of evolution (Figure 6B). The coherent increase in the copy number of the 70k region, pFC139C, and some single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) implies that there are two main sub-populations in the evolved CFC526 and CFC680 culture series: one real synthetic methylotrophic strain (SM1) containing pFC139C and the 70k multicopy region (Figure 5B) and the other non-methylotrophic strain (BB1) containing pFC139B and the 7k multicopy region but not the 70k repeated region (Figure 5C). After several attempts, we isolated SM1 and BB1 single colonies by colony PCR verification of unique mutations such as pgi 12-bp deletion in SM1. The final SM1 strain retains its ability to grow on MeOH even after culturing in LB (Figure S6A). Moreover, the strain can also grow without any nitrate or vitamin supplementation (Figure S6B). Illumina HiSeq sequencing of SM1 showed similar SNVs with increased frequency (close to 100%) compared with the last sequenced mixed culture, CFC5"

Our work demonstrates the power of cryo-electron tomography to generate models of previously unsolved structures in their cellular environment. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. About 10% of patients show a clear family history, and mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial PD (Roosen and Cookson, 2016Roosen D.A. Cookson M.R. LRRK2 at the interface of autophagosomes, endosomes and lysosomes.Mol. Neurodegener. 2016; 11: 73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Thomas and Beal, 2007Thomas B. Beal M.F. Parkinson’s disease.Hum Mol Genet. 2007; 16: R183-R194Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). LRRK2 is a 286 kDa protein with an N-terminal half containing repeating motifs and a C-terminal half composed of kinase and GTPase domains surrounded by protein-protein interaction domains (Kalia and Lang, 2015Kalia L.V. Lang A.E. Parkinson’s disease.Lancet. 2015; 386: 896-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). Most of the pathogenic mutations are found in the two catalytic domains, but all result in hyperactivation of the kinase in cells (Steger et al., 2016Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. et al.Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases.eLife. 2016; 5: e12813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of LRRK2’s kinase is also reported in non-familial PD cases (Di Maio et al., 2018Di Maio R. Hoffman E.K. Rocha E.M. Keeney M.T. Sanders L.H. De Miranda B.R. Zharikov A. Van Laar A. Stepan A.F. Lanz T.A. et al.LRRK2 activation in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10: eaar5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that suppression of kinase activity might be beneficial for a wide range of PD patients. However, how LRRK2 kinase activity is regulated on a molecular and cellular level and how abnormal LRRK2 kinase activity leads to PD remains unclear. LRRK2 is involved in several cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth and synaptic morphogenesis, membrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein synthesis (Kalia and Lang, 2015Kalia L.V. Lang A.E. Parkinson’s disease.Lancet. 2015; 386: 896-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to phosphorylate a subgroup of Rab GTPases, modulating their membrane localization and function (Steger et al., 2016Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. et al.Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson’s disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases.eLife. 2016; 5: e12813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells, wild-type LRRK2, as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, is predominantly cytosolic (Eguchi et al., 2018Eguchi T. Kuwahara T. Sakurai M. Komori T. Fujimoto T. Ito G. Yoshimura S.I. Harada A. Fukuda M. Koike M. Iwatsubo T. LRRK2 and its substrate Rab GTPases are sequentially targeted onto stressed lysosomes and maintain their homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E9115-E9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed wild-type LRRK2, visualized via epitope or fluorescent protein tags, is also mostly cytosolic while some of the common PD mutations can also be seen forming filamentous structures surrounding microtubules. Filament formation is enhanced in N1437H, R1441G/C, Y1699C, and I2020T LRRK2 mutants and has been observed in multiple cell types (Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017Blanca Ramírez M. Lara Ordóñez A.J.

While it remains to be determined how enhanced microtubule association by the LRRK2 mutants may contribute to their pathogenicity, pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2’s kinase causes rapid and reversible recruitment of both wild-type and mutant LRRK2 proteins to microtubules (Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017Blanca Ramírez M.

A major barrier to understanding the mechanism of LRRK2 is the lack of structural information on the protein, which to date only includes structures of domains, either single or in tandem. Many of these are from a distantly related bacterial homolog (Deyaert et al., 2019Deyaert E. Leemans M. Singh R.K. Gallardo R. Steyaert J. Kortholt A. Lauer J. Versées W.

Given the paucity of structural information about LRRK2 and its importance as a target for PD treatment, we set out to determine the structure of human LRRK2 using in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Achieving high-resolution in situ using cryo-ET is greatly helped by helical structures because they combine symmetry with all of the views required to generate a fully sampled structure. Given the helical nature of microtubules, we reasoned that microtubule-associated LRRK2 would be an ideal sample. Here, we report a 14 Å structure of human LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules as ordered filaments, determining the overall domain structure of LRRK2 in cells and the architecture of the microtubule-associated filaments. To determine the structure of microtubule-associated LRRK2, we used cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) to image LRRK2 filaments in situ (Figure 1). To increase the population of LRRK2-decorated microtubules we could image, we used several approaches. First, we chose to express LRRK2 bearing the pathogenic I2020T mutation because it has previously been shown to spontaneously undergo filament formation and decorate cellular microtubules by immuno-electron microscopy (Kett et al., 2012Kett L.R. Boassa D. Ho C.C. Rideout H.J. Hu J. Terada M. Ellisman M. Dauer W.T. LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Second, we stabilized microtubules with Taxol, which was previously shown to increase the percentage of cells showing LRRK2 filamentous structures but was not necessary for their formation (Kett et al., 2012Kett L.R. Boassa D. Ho C.C. Rideout H.J. Hu J. Terada M. Ellisman M. Dauer W.T. LRRK2 Parkinson disease mutations enhance its microtubule association.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We began by growing human HEK293T cells expressing amino-terminally yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged LRRK2 with the I2020T mutation, hereafter LRRK2(I2020T), on EM grids. After vitrification, cells containing filamentous LRRK2(I2020T) were identified by cryo-fluorescence microscopy. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling of these cells was then used to prepare lamellae for cryo-ET (Figures 1A–1C). The LRRK2(I2020T)-decorated microtubules were identified by CLEM as regions where microtubule bundles in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images overlapped with the YFP signal of LRRK2(I2020T) in the fluorescence images (Figures 1D–1F). Subsequently, cryo-ET was performed in these regions (Figures 1G and 1H). We first characterized the microtubules in our tomograms. Microtubules are formed from heterodimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin and polymerize into polar left-handed helical arrays, which, in human cells, typically consist of 13 protofilaments (Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017Chaaban S. Brouhard G.J. A microtubule bestiary: structural diversity in tubulin polymers.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28: 2924-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We annotated each microtubule individually by computationally determining its coordinates (Figure S1A). Within bundles, most of the decorated microtubules were aligned parallel to each other (Figures 2B–2E), with a center-to-center distance of 70 ± 18 nm (Figure 2E). This regular distribution of angles and distances suggests that pathogenic LRRK2 mediates microtubule bundling. Most microtubules were either undecorated or fully decorated, and these two populations coexisted within the same cellular regions (Figure 2A). Protofilament number and polarity of each microtubule was determined by subtomogram analysis (Figure S1B). Microtubules within a given bundle largely had the same polarity (Figures 2B and 2C). Unexpectedly, we observed populations of non-conventional 11- and 12-protofilament microtubules (5% and 56%, respectively), in addition to the 13-protofilament microtubules (39%) that are typically found in human cells (Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017Chaaban S. Brouhard G.J. A microtubule bestiary: structural diversity in tubulin polymers.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28: 2924-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). To determine if bundling and microtubule protofilament number was specific to LRRK2(I2020T) expression, we examined microtubule populations in cells treated with Taxol but without LRRK2(I2020T) expression. Under these conditions, we did not observe any decorated microtubules or bundles and found that microtubules consisted primarily of 13-protofilament (92%) microtubules (Figures 2F–2I).Figure 2LRRK2(I2020T)-Decorated Microtubules Have Various Protofilament Numbers and Are Found in BundlesShow full caption(A) Slice of a tomogram of a HEK293T cell expressing LRRK2(I2020T) showing undecorated (white arrow) and LRRK2-decorated (green arrows) microtubules.(B) Slice of a tomogram showing bundles of LRRK2(I2020T)-decorated microtubules.(C) Segmented microtubules from the tomogram in (B).

Scale bars represent 100 nm (A) and 200 nm (B and F). After classification of microtubules according to protofilament numbers, we used subtomogram analysis to resolve the helical arrangement of LRRK2(I2020T) bound to microtubules (Figure 3A; Figures S1C and S1D). We found that LRRK2(I2020T) forms a right-handed double helix around 11-, 12-, and 13-protofilament microtubules (Figure 3A). Thus, there is a symmetry mismatch between the right-handed LRRK2(I2020T) and the left-handed microtubule helices (Figures 3A and 3B; helical parameters in Table S1). Along the LRRK2(I2020T) helix, we identified repeating units (protomers) with a C2 symmetry axis perpendicular to the filament axis. The number of LRRK2(I2020T) protomers per turn matched the microtubule protofilament number, with 11, 12, and 13 LRRK2(I2020T) protomers per turn around 11-, 12-, and 13-protofilament microtubules, respectively (Figure 3A). LRRK2(I2020T) showed a clear preference for 11- and 12-protofilament microtubules (Figure 2D). The interaction between LRRK2 bound to 11-protofilament microtubules also appeared better resolved than LRRK2 bound to 12- and 13-protofilament microtubules, despite its smaller dataset (Figure 3A). The physiological significance of the preferential LRRK2 decoration and possible stabilization of microtubules with non-conventional protofilament numbers remains to be determined. To determine the three-dimensional architecture of LRRK2 in microtubule-associated filaments, we performed further subtomogram analysis by extracting individual protomer subtomograms from 12-protofilament microtubule-bound LRRK2 because this was the most abundant species in our dataset (Figure 3A; Figures S1F–S1N). We obtained a map at a resolution of 14 Å (Figure 3C; Figures S1K and S1L), with higher local resolution in parts of the LRRK2 protomer (Figure 3D). To date, the only eukaryotic in situ structures of comparable resolution are of ribosomes (Delarue et al., 2018Delarue M. Brittingham G.P. Pfeffer S. Surovtsev I.V. Pinglay S. Kennedy K.J.

A salient feature in our map was adjacent donut-shaped densities (Figures 3C and 3F). We could unambiguously assign the identity of these densities as the LRRK2 WD40 domains by docking their recently reported X-ray structure, which was solved as a dimer (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang P. Fan Y. Ru H. Wang L. Magupalli V.G. Taylor S.S. Alessi D.R. Wu H. Crystal structure of the WD40 domain dimer of LRRK2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Figures 3E and 3F). The LRRK2 filament density shows two 2-fold axes of symmetry perpendicular to the microtubule axis, suggesting two sites of homotypic interaction (Figures 3G and 3H), one of which forms a Z-shaped protomer dimerizing through the WD40:WD40 interface (Figure 3G). The second homotypic interaction results in a S-shaped dimer and most likely involves a C-terminal of ROC (COR):COR interface (Figure 3H; see below). Thus, the repeating unit of the LRRK2 helix is a protomer representing a LRRK2 dimer, which can be defined by either a WD40:WD40 or a COR:COR interface (Figures 3G and 3H). We did not observe the characteristic extended arch-shaped densities for the N-terminal Armadillo (ARM) and Ankyrin (ANK) or Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains in the best resolved area of the protomer close to the microtubule. This is consistent with the previous observation that the four C-terminal domains, Ras of complex (ROC), COR, kinase, and WD40 domains (Figure 4A), are sufficient for microtubule association in cells (Kett et al., 2012Kett L.R.

Systematic sampling of combinations of domain placements within the cryo-EM density map, subject to polypeptide connectivity and steric-clash restraints, yielded a single possible architecture of LRRK2(I2020T) in terms of the relative spatial arrangement of its domains, represented by 1,167 models that were further categorized into 53 clusters with slight variations in the centroid and orientation of each domain (Figures S2 and S6). One of these models of human LRRK2(I2020T), displayed inside the subtomogram average of the protomer, is shown in Figures 4C–4E. Our LRRK2 model recapitulates the monomeric ROC-COR configuration observed in the X-ray structure of the homologous bacterial protein (PDB: 6HLU) (Deyaert et al., 2019Deyaert E. Leemans M. Singh R.K.

Comparing the architecture of the monomeric bacterial ROC-COR (PDB: 6HLU) and our LRRK2 monomer models indicated that among the 53 clusters, one cluster particularly resembles the bacterial ROC-COR conformation with an average backbone RMSD of ∼10 Å, reflecting slight changes in orientation (Figures S3F and S3G).

To obtain information on fate plus transcriptome in the same cell, we developed the PolyloxExpress allele, enabling Cre-recombinase-dependent RNA barcoding in situ. Linking fates to single HSC transcriptomes provided the information required to identify transcriptional signatures of HSC fates, which were not apparent in single-HSC transcriptomes alone. We find that differentiation-inactive, multilineage, and lineage-restricted HSC clones reside in distinct regions of the transcriptional landscape of hematopoiesis. Differentiation-inactive HSC clones are closer to the origin of the transcriptional trajectory, yet they are not characterized by a quiescent gene signature. Fate-specific gene signatures imply coherence of clonal HSC fates, and HSC output toward short-lived lineage progenitors indicates stability of HSC fates over time. These combined analyses of fate and transcriptome under physiological conditions may pave the way toward identifying molecular determinants of HSC fates."
https://openalex.org/W3048518102,"Surgical site infection is one of the most severe complications of surgical treatments. However, the optimal procedure to prevent such infections remains uninvestigated. Ultraviolet radiation C (UVC) with a short wavelength has a high bactericidal effect; however, it is cytotoxic. Nonetheless, given that UVC with a wavelength of 222 nm reaches only the stratum corneum, it does not affect the skin cells. This study aimed to investigate the safety of 222-nm UVC irradiation and to examine its skin sterilization effect in healthy volunteers.This trial was conducted on 20 healthy volunteers. The back of the subject was irradiated with 222-nm UVC at 50-500 mJ/cm2, and the induced erythema (redness of skin) was evaluated. Subsequently, the back was irradiated with a maximum amount of UVC not causing erythema, and the skin swabs before and after the irradiation were cultured. The number of colonies formed after 24 hours was measured. In addition, cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer (CPD) as an indicator of DNA damage was measured using skin tissues of the nonirradiated and irradiated regions.All subjects experienced no erythema at all doses. The back of the subject was irradiated at 500 mJ/cm2, and the number of bacterial colonies in the skin swab culture was significantly decreased by 222-nm UVC irradiation. The CPD amount produced in the irradiated region was slightly but significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated region.A 222-nm UVC at 500 mJ/cm2 was a safe irradiation dose and possessed bactericidal effects. In the future, 222-nm UVC irradiation is expected to contribute to the prevention of perioperative infection."

Intensive research on rice aroma identified mutations in betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (OsBADH2) leading to production of aroma in rice. Gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 system has opened new avenues for accelerated improvement of rice grain quality through targeted mutagenesis. In this study, we have employed CRISPR/Cas9 tool to create novel alleles of OsBADH2 leading to introduction of aroma into an elite non-aromatic rice variety ASD16. PCR analysis of putative transformants using primers targeting the flanking regions of sgRNA in the 7th exon of OsBADH2 identified 37.5% potential multi-allelic mutations in T0 generation. Sensory evaluation test in the leaves of T0 lines identified thirteen lines belonging to five independent events producing aroma. Sequence analysis of these aromatic T0 lines identified 22 different types of mutations located within -17 bp to +15bp of sgRNA region. The -1/-2 bp deletion in the line # 8-19 and -8/-5 bp deletion in the line # 2-16 produced strong aroma and the phenotype was stably inherited in the T1 generation. Comparative volatile profiling detected novel aromatic compounds viz., pyrrolidine, pyridine, pyrazine, pyradazine and pyrozole in the grains of T1 progenies of line # 8-19. This study has demonstrated the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in creating novel alleles of OsBADH2 to introduce aroma into any non-aromatic rice varieties."

https://openalex.org/W3048383854,"The vestibular system broadcasts head-movement-related signals to sensory areas throughout the brain, including visual cortex. These signals are crucial for the brain's ability to assess whether motion of the visual scene results from the animal's head movements. However, how head movements affect visual cortical circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we discover that ambient luminance profoundly transforms how mouse primary visual cortex (V1) processes head movements. While in darkness, head movements result in overall suppression of neuronal activity; in ambient light, the same head movements trigger excitation across all cortical layers. This light-dependent switch in how V1 processes head movements is controlled by somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory neurons, which are excited by head movements in dark, but not in light. This study thus reveals a light-dependent switch in the response of V1 to head movements and identifies a circuit in which SOM cells are key integrators of vestibular and luminance signals."

Whether or how such movements affect neuronal activity in sensory cortical areas remains largely unknown, because most experiments exploring movement-related modulation have been performed in head-fixed animals. Here, we show that 3D head-orienting movements (HOMs) modulate primary visual cortex (V1) activity in a direction-specific manner that also depends on light. We identify two overlapping populations of movement-direction-tuned neurons that support this modulation, one of which is direction tuned in the dark and the other in the light. Although overall movement enhanced V1 responses to visual stimulation, HOMs suppressed responses. We demonstrate that V1 receives a motor efference copy related to orientation from secondary motor cortex, which is involved in controlling HOMs. These results support predictive coding theories of brain function and reveal a pervasive role of 3D movement in shaping sensory cortical dynamics.

Rats maintain a binocular field centered on the horizon.F1000Res. 2013; 2: 176Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice also move their eyes under head-fixed conditions (Sakatani and Isa, 2007Sakatani T. Isa T.

However, the neural consequences of many of these movements remain unclear. Despite the number of various movements animals make to support visual perception, vision has typically been studied by presenting stimuli to restrained animals. In this framework, vision is a passive sense and visual processing is a feedforward computation in which information enters the brain through the retina and is processed one stage at a time as it travels deeper into the brain, through thalamus and cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H.

Canonical computations of cerebral cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, the majority of neurophysiological experiments on primary sensory cortical areas have found that information in those areas is chiefly sensory in nature. Importantly, visual cortical areas receive a multitude of feedback and modulatory inputs that influence sensory processing; this feedback may afford visual areas with information required to distinguish between self-generated sensory signals and those that arise in the outside world (Schneider et al., 2014Schneider D.M.

Churchland A.K. Single-trial neural dynamics are dominated by richly varied movements.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1677-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, such studies have primarily been performed in head-fixed rodents, which has made it difficult to answer whether sensory areas are modulated by naturalistic self-generated movements that support sensory sampling. Here, by recording activity in V1 during free behavior in rats, we demonstrate that head-orienting movements are associated with suppression or enhancement of neural activity in visual cortical neurons in the dark or light, respectively. Furthermore, V1 activity reflected the direction of head movement, both in the dark and in the light, with individual neurons tuned independently either in the dark or light. Responses to visual stimulation were modulated bidirectionally during movement, with responses enhanced or suppressed during overall movement or orienting movements of the head, respectively, relative to rest. Finally, V1 responses to orienting movements and direction encoding depended on M2. Our results demonstrate that cortical sensory dynamics encode the direction of self-generated movements in 3D, provide evidence for direction-specific efference copy signaling in V1, and raise the possibility that head-orienting movements in rodents serve the same functional purpose as saccades do in primates (Morris and Krekelberg, 2019Morris A.P. Krekelberg B. A stable visual world in primate primary visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2019; 29: 1471-1480.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate the impact of spontaneous movements on sensory cortical dynamics, we recorded neuronal activity using tetrode arrays targeting layer 2/3 of rat V1 while the animals behaved freely in a home-cage arena (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S2A–S2E). Movements were captured using a head-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) (see Method Details). Recordings were made continuously (24/7) and split into 2-h sessions in the dark or light in order to investigate the effects of movement in the absence or presence of visual cues, respectively. The timing of lighting conditions was pseudo-randomized to offset possible circadian effects on V1 activity (Figures S1A and S1B). We focused our analysis on 3D orienting movements of the head, which we refer to as head-orienting movements (HOMs), as well as total acceleration, which we term overall movement. Bouts of overall movement rarely also contained HOMs (∼8% of the time). This dissociation enabled us to distinguish overall-movement-related activity—such as forward locomotion—from activity related to particular directions of orienting head movements (Figures 1C and 1D). Animals spent <3% of time above the velocity threshold of 100°/s (Figures 1E and 1F). The rate of HOMs was somewhat higher at the beginning of each session but relatively steady throughout (Figures S1C and S1D). We focused our analysis on HOMs along individual directions, although about 25% of the time, animals made movements along multiple axes (Figure S1E). Individual animals made similar numbers of opposing turns (Figures S1F and S1G), and across rats, above-threshold velocities in opposing directions (e.g., left versus right) could not be distinguished from one another (Figure 1G). Thus, although the animals moved more in the dark, the head-velocity dynamics were similar between the two lighting conditions, which allowed us next to ask how V1 dynamics are affected by general movements or HOMs in the dark or light. As previously observed in V1 of head-fixed mice running on spherical treadmills, multiunit activity (MUA) firing rates were indeed higher during overall movement compared to rest, both in the dark and the light (Figures 2A–2C). To examine the cellular basis for movement modulation of V1, we sorted the extracted multiunit spikes into single units (Figures S2F–S2J). Sorted single units were classified into regular-spiking putative excitatory units (RSUs) and fast-spiking putative inhibitory units (FSUs) based on waveform shape. Firing rates of single units were on average higher during epochs of overall movement compared to rest in the dark and the light, with RSU rates affected more than FSUs (Figure 2D). Approximately a fifth of individual RSUs had significantly modulated firing rates during movement, with the vast majority of the significantly modulated firing rates increasing during movement. A smaller fraction of FSUs had significantly modulated firing rates during movement, and these were more bidirectionally modulated than RSUs (Figure 2E). RSU mean firing rates were more strongly modulated by the animals’ overall movement than the lighting condition (Figure 2D), further highlighting the significance of movement on neural coding in V1. Approximately 75% of single units were responsive to overall movement onset and offset (Figure 2F), in contrast to the small fraction of units whose mean firing rates changed during overall movement. To address the possibility that sleep contributed to lower firing rates during rest bouts, we examined V1 activity as a function of the length of rest or movement bout duration (Figures S2K–S2M).

We hypothesized that Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263 (BFM) would attenuate hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats, a renin-independent model of hypertension. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, DOCA-salt, treated DOCA-salt-BFM, treated DOCA-salt-butyrate, and treated DOCA-salt-acetate, for 5 weeks. BFM prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac weight, and renal damage induced by DOCA-salt. BFM increased acetate-producing bacterial population and gut acetate levels, improved colonic integrity, normalized endotoxemia, plasma trimethylamine (TMA) levels, and restored the Th17 and Treg content in mesenteric lymph nodes and aorta. Furthermore, BFM improved nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine in aortic rings and reduced NADPH oxidase activity in DOCA-salt animals. These protective effects were mimicked by acetate, but not by butyrate supplementation. These data demonstrate that BFM induces changes in gut microbiota linked with attenuation of endothelial dysfunction and increase in blood pressure in this low-renin form of hypertension. These beneficial effects seem to be mediated by increased acetate and reduced TMA production by gut microbiota, thus, improving gut integrity and restoring Th17/Tregs polarization and endotoxemia."

Among them, 49 patients had PCOS infertility, and 29 were non-PCOS patients whose infertility resulted from fallopian tube and male factors. The elisa method was used to detect the changes in the expression levels of inflammatory factors in the cells. The correlations between the serum inflammatory cytokine expression levels and the corresponding clinical hormones were analyzed. The changes in the expression (mRNA and protein) levels of the serum inflammatory cytokines were studied by real-time quantitative PCR and protein printing. Fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry were used to detect the glucose uptake capacity of ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS patients under the action of insulin after berberine.In the PCOS group, IL-17a (P = 0.001), IL-1Ra (P<0.0001), and IL-6 (P = 0.035) were significantly higher than those in the non-PCOS group. In the non-PCOS group, AMH level was negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokines IL-17a (r = -0.819;P = 0.004), IL-1a (r = -0.716;P = 0.0.02), IL-1b (r = -0.678;P = 0.031), IL-2 (r = -0.765;P = 0.01), and IL-8 (r = -0.705;P = 0.023). However, in the PCOS group, AMH levels were not significantly correlated with the levels of the examined inflammatory cytokines. Berberine significantly reduced the expression level of mTOR mRNA (P = 0.001), and increased the expression level of IRS-1 mRNA (P = 0.009) in the PCOS granule cells.In this study, we find that the elevated levels of serum inflammatory factors IL-17a, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 cause women to be in a subclinical inflammatory state for a long time. Abnormal changes in inflammatory factors alter their original negative correlations with AMH levels, thereby weakening the metabolism of glycolipids, promoting insulin resistance, destroying the normal ovulation and fertilization system of women, leading to polycystic ovary syndrome characterized by menstrual thinning and abnormal ovulation. Berberine can improve the sensitivity of insulin by regulating the signal pathway of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in PCOS patients and achieve a therapeutic effect of treating PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W3048517172,"Background The world is going through the critical phase of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. Methods To have an idea of the global changes in 5’ and 3’-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by ‘RBPmap’ and ‘RNA22 v2’ respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. Results We identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV-2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5’-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3’UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. Conclusion Our results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov-2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future."
https://openalex.org/W3048664408,"Background Multimorbidity is a global health challenge that is associated with polypharmacy, increasing the risk of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP). There are tools to improve prescription, such as implicit and explicit criteria. Objective To estimate the prevalence of PIP in a population aged 65 to 74 years with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, according to American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® (2015, 2019), the Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescription -STOPP- criteria (2008, 2014), and the Medication Appropriateness Index -MAI- criteria in primary care. Methods This was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. The sample included 593 community-dwelling elderly aged 65 to 74 years, with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, who participated in the MULTIPAP trial. Socio-demographic, clinical, professional, and pharmacological-treatment variables were recorded. Potentially inappropriate prescribing was detected by computerized prescription assistance system, and family doctors evaluated the MAI. The MAI-associated factors were analysed using a logistic regression model. Results A total of 4,386 prescriptions were evaluated. The mean number of drugs was 7.4 (2.4 SD). A total of 94.1% of the patients in the study had at least one criterion for drug inappropriateness according to the MAI. Potentially inappropriate prescribing was detected in 57.7%, 43.6%, 68.8% and 71% of 50 patients according to the explicit criteria STOPP 2014, STOPP 2008, Beers 2019 and Beers 2015 respectively. For every new drug taken by a patient, the MAI score increased by 2.41 (95% CI 1.46; 3.35) points. Diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and asthma were independently associated with lower summated MAI scores. Conclusions The prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing detected in the sample was high and in agreement with previous literature for populations with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. The MAI criteria detected greater inappropriateness than did the explicit criteria, but their application was more complex and difficult to automate."
https://openalex.org/W3048473467,"Background Mental health is considered an integral part of human health. Reliable and valid measurement instruments are needed to assess various facets of mental health in the native language of the people involved. This paper reports on five studies examining evidence for the factorial validity of the Twi versions of five mental health and well-being measurement instruments: Affectometer-2 (AFM-2); Automatic Thought Questionnaire–Positive (ATQ-P); Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSEs); Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) in a rural Ghanaian adult sample. Method Measures were translated and evaluated using a research-committee approach, pilot-tested, and administered to adults (N = 444) randomly selected from four rural poor communities in Ghana. We applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), bifactor CFA, exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), and bifactor ESEM to the AFM-2, ATQ-P, and the PHQ-9, and CFA to the GSEs and the SWLS. The omega coefficient of composite reliability was computed for each measure. Results A two-factor bifactor ESEM model displayed superior model fit for the AFM-2. The total scale and the Negative Affect subscale, but not the Positive Affect subscale, attained sufficient reliability. Two models (a four-factor 22-item bifactor ESEM model and a 5-factor 22-item ESEM model) fitted the data best for the ATQ-P. The bifactor ESEM model displayed a high reliability value for the total scale and satisfactory reliability values for three of its four subscales. For the GSEs, a one-factor CFA model (residuals of items 4 and 5 correlated) demonstrated superior model fit with a high reliability score for the total scale. A two-factor ESEM model outperformed all other models fitted for the PHQ-9, with moderate and satisfactory reliability scores for the subscales. A one-factor CFA model (residuals of item 4 and 5 correlated) demonstrated superior model fit for the SWLS, with a satisfactory reliability value for the total scale. Conclusions Findings established evidence for the factorial validity of the Twi versions of all five measures, with the global scores, but not all subscale scores, demonstrating satisfactory reliability. These validated measurement instruments can be used to assess mental health and well-being in the research and practice contexts of the current sample."

In this study, we focus on the function of melanocyte releasing exosomes as well as exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) and investigate whether ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation exerts an impact on it. Materials and methods Exosomes derived from human primary melanocytes were isolated through differential centrifugation and were identified in three ways, including transmission electron microscopy observation, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot analysis. Melanocytes were irradiated with UVB for the indicated time, and then melanin production and exosome secretion were measured. The exosomal miRNA expression profile of melanocytes were obtained by miRNA sequencing and confirmed by real-time PCR. Results Exosomes derived from human primary melanocytes were verified. UVB irradiation induced melanin production and increased the exosome release by the melanocytes. In total, 15 miRNAs showed higher levels in UVB-irradiated melanocyte-derived exosomes compared with non-irradiated ones, and the top three upregulated exosomal miRNAs were miR-4488, miR-320d, and miR-7704 (fold change > 4.0). Conclusion It is verified for the first time that UVB irradiation enhanced the secretion of exosomes by melanocytes and changed their exosomal miRNA profile. This findings open a new direction for investigating the communication between melanocytes and other skin cells, and the connection between UVB and skin malignant initiation."

This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of uric acid on the development of lipid metabolic disorders. We collected blood samples from 100 healthy people and 100 patients with hyperuricemia for whom serum lipid analysis was performed. Meanwhile, a mouse model of hyperuricemia was generated, and lipidomics was performed on liver tissues, comparing control and hyperuricemia groups, to analyze lipid profiles and key metabolic enzymes. Uric acid directly induced serum lipid metabolic disorders in both humans and mice based on triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Through lipidomic analysis, 46 lipids were differentially expressed in hyperuricemic mouse livers, and the phosphatidylcholine composition was altered, which was mediated by LPCAT3 upregulation. High-uric acid levels-induced p-STAT3 inhibition and SREBP-1c activation in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, LPCAT3-knockdown significantly attenuated uric acid-induced p-STAT3 inhibition, SREBP-1c activation, and lipid metabolic disorders in L02 cells. In conclusion, uric acid induces lipid metabolic disturbances through LPCAT3-mediated p-STAT3 inhibition and SREBP-1c activation. LPCAT3 could be a key regulatory factor linking hyperuricemia and lipid metabolic disorders. These results might provide novel insights into the clinical treatment of hyperuricemia."
https://openalex.org/W3048445428,"Metformin, a biguanide agent, is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its glucose-lowering effect. Despite its wide application in the treatment of multiple health conditions, the glycemic response to metformin is highly variable, emphasizing the need for reliable biomarkers. We chose the RNA-Seq-based comparative transcriptomics approach to evaluate the systemic effect of metformin and highlight potential predictive biomarkers of metformin response in drug-naïve volunteers with type 2 diabetes in vivo. The longitudinal blood-derived transcriptome analysis revealed metformin-induced differential expression of novel and previously described genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (SLC46A1 and LRP1), cancer development (CYP1B1, STAB1, CCR2, TMEM176B), and immune responses (CD14, CD163) after administration of metformin for three months. We demonstrate for the first time a transcriptome-based molecular discrimination between metformin responders (delta HbA1c ≥ 1% or 12.6 mmol/mol) and non-responders (delta HbA1c < 1% or 12.6 mmol/mol), that is determined by expression levels of 56 genes, explaining 13.9% of the variance in the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. Moreover, we found a significant upregulation of IRS2 gene (log2FC 0.89) in responders compared to non-responders before the use of metformin.

It is estimated that around a quarter of the adult population is affected by OA in the knee and hip and that the prevalence of OA will increase over the coming decades largely due to aging and adverse life-style factors. Prevention and effective care are critical to manage the challenges posed by OA. Digital technologies offer opportunities to deliver cost-effective care for chronic diseases, including for OA. We report the results of a costing analysis of a new digital platform for delivering first-line care including disease information and physiotherapy to patients with OA and compare this with an existing face-to-face model of treatment. Both models are in accordance with National Treatment Guidelines in Sweden. The results show that overall the digital model costs around 25% of the existing face-to-face model of care. Based on existing evidence on the effects of these models, our findings also suggest that the digital platform offers a cost-effective alternative to the existing model of OA care. Depending on the extent to which the digital model substitutes for the existing model of care, significant resources can be saved."
https://openalex.org/W3048397140,"Increased maternal health care (MHC) service utilisation in Bangladesh over the past decades has contributed to improvements in maternal health outcomes nationally, yet there is little understanding of Indigenous women's experiences of accessing MHC services in Bangladesh.Face-to-face semi-structured qualitative interviews with 21 Indigenous women (aged 15-49 years) within 36 months of delivery from three ethnic groups (Chakma, Marma and Tripura) were conducted between September 2017 and February 2018 in Khagrachhari district. Purposive sampling was used to recruit women representative of the population distribution in terms of age, ethnic community and service use experience. All interviews were conducted in Bangla language and audio-recorded with consent. Interviews were transcribed directly into English before being coded. Data were analysed thematically using a qualitative descriptive approach aided by NVivo12 software.Of the 21 women interviewed, 14 had accessed at least one MHC service during their last pregnancy or childbirth and were categorised as the User group. The remaining seven participants were categorised as 'Non-users' as they had not access antenatal care, facility delivery or postnatal care services. Women reported that they wanted culturally relevant, respectful, home-based and affordable care, and generally perceived formal MHC services as being only for complications and emergencies. Barriers to accessing MHC services included low levels of understanding about the importance of MHC services, concerns about service costs, limited transport and fears of intrusive practices. Experiences within health services that deterred women from accessing future MHC services included demands for unofficial payments and abusive treatment by public facility staff.Improving access to MHC services for the CHT Indigenous women requires improved understandings of cultural values, priorities and concerns. Multifaceted reform is needed at individual, community and health systems levels to offer culturally appropriate health education and flexible service delivery options."

These data provide a roadmap for brown adipocyte development and indicate that BAs generated from hPSCs have potential as a tool for therapeutic development. Two classes of thermogenic adipocytes have been identified in mammals that have distinct anatomical locations and developmental trajectories. Brown adipocytes (BAs), for example, are found around the neck and interscapular regions and characterized by the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). These cells generate heat in response to cold exposure and are derived from bipotent FOXC1+ PAX3+ MYF5+ paraxial mesoderm (PM)/dermal myotome progenitor cells (Atit et al., 2006Atit R. Sgaier S.K.

These progenitors are bipotent and also serve as precursors for skeletal muscle cells during embryonic development (Atit et al., 2006Atit R. Sgaier S.K. Mohamed O.A. Taketo M.M. Dufort D. Joyner A.L.

The second pool of thermogenic adipocytes are referred to as “beige” adipocytes, and although they share some of the cellular and molecular characteristics displayed by BAs, they arise through an entirely different developmental pathway. Instead of being descendants of PM progenitors, beige cells are derived from splanchnic mesoderm (SplM) and follow a developmental pathway through the same pre-adipocyte progenitor cells that contribute to “white” adipocytes (WA) (Long et al., 2014Long J.Z.

As part of a homeostatic mechanism, beige adipocytes are generated by transdifferentiation of WAs or from de novo differentiation of pre-adipocyte progenitors (Lee et al., 2015Lee Y.-H. Petkova A.P.

Consequently, beige cells are found interspersed in white adipose depots. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays important roles in metabolic homeostasis by increasing the clearance of circulating glucose and triglycerides (Bartelt et al., 2011Bartelt A. Bruns O.T. Reimer R.

For example, increased activity of thermogenic adipocytes restores insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics (Hanssen et al., 2015Hanssen M.J. Hoeks J. Brans B. van der Lans A.A. Schaart G. van den Driessche J.J. Jörgensen J.A. Boekschoten M.V. Hesselink M.K.

Autio A. et al.USF1 deficiency activates brown adipose tissue and improves cardiometabolic health.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 323ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, a clear inverse correlation exists between body mass index and BAT composition in humans (Cypess et al., 2009Cypess A.M. Lehman S. Williams G. Tal I. Rodman D. Goldfine A.B. Kuo F.C. Palmer E.L. Tseng Y.-H. Doria A. et al.Identification and importance of brown adipose tissue in adult humans.N. Engl. J.

Med. 2009; 360: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). A prominent model to explain these clinical outcomes invokes a role for BAT as a “metabolic sink” for circulating metabolites (Kajimura et al., 2015Kajimura S. Spiegelman B.M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: physiological roles beyond heat generation.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 546-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar; Sidossis and Kajimura, 2015Sidossis L. Kajimura S. Brown and beige fat in humans: thermogenic adipocytes that control energy and glucose homeostasis.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Important outcomes of increased BA activity include the normalization of circulating metabolite levels, improvement of systemic metabolic homeostasis, and increased energy expenditure. Following cold exposure, BAs significantly increase their rate of glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and overall metabolic activity. Unlike most cells that use oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, electron transport in BAs is largely uncoupled from ATP synthesis due to expression of the UCP1 proton conduction channel, which bypasses normal H+ flow through the ATP synthase complex. This results in energy generated by the proton motive force being dissipated as heat. Due to these properties, BAs and beige adipocytes ameliorate the effects of obesity and type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) by normalizing circulating glucose levels and increasing energy expenditure, following transplantation into recipients (Gunawardana and Piston, 2012Gunawardana S.C.

Brown adipose tissue regulates glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The development of BAs as a cell therapeutic or as a pharmacological target has been severely restricted by the availability of a suitable cell source. To address this issue, we developed a highly efficient method for the generation of BAs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In this report, we show that hPSC-derived BAs develop through a PM intermediate and exhibit molecular and metabolic characteristics that are consistent with them being authentic BAs. Dissecting BA differentiation at the molecular level reveals cohorts of genes expressed at specific developmental stages with corresponding changes to the chromatin landscape and the identification of potential lineage regulators. Stably engrafted BAs increase whole-body energy expenditure and O2 consumption while displaying robust thermogenic activity. These observations, combined with their ability to modulate blood glucose clearance, reinforce the concept that BAs have potential for the treatment of metabolic disease and obesity. Beige adipocytes can be easily mistaken for BAs in culture by their expression of UCP1, but they can be readily distinguished through the characterization of their developmental origins. This motivated us to establish whether previous reports (Nishio et al., 2012Nishio M. Yoneshiro T. Nakahara M. Suzuki S. Saeki K. Hasegawa M. Kawai Y. Akutsu H. Umezawa A.

The remaining two approaches (Mohsen-Kanson et al., 2014Mohsen-Kanson T. Hafner A.L. Wdziekonski B. Takashima Y. Villageois P. Carrière A. Svensson M. Bagnis C. Chignon-Sicard B.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) rely on undirected differentiation to generate CD73+ MSCs from embryoid bodies that are composed of complex mixtures of cells from the three germ layers (Figure S1). These approaches generate different amounts of NKX2.5+ SplM and PAX3+ FOXC1+ PM in addition to SOX17+ endoderm and PAX6+ ectoderm, as expected for embryoid bodies (EBs) cultured in 15% FBS. The utilization of attachment selected CD73+ MSCs indicates that beige adipocytes are being produced by these methods (Su et al., 2018Su S. Guntur A.R. Nguyen D.C. Fakory S.S. Doucette C.C. Leech C. Lotana H. Kelley M. Kohli J. Martino J. et al.A renewable source of human beige adipocytes for development of therapies to treat metabolic syndrome.Cell Rep. 2018; 25: 3215-3228.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The characteristics of adipocytes and methods of generation for these approaches are summarized in Table S1. In summary, it is concluded that hPSC-derived BAs described previously are generated through a SplM-derived CD73+ MSC intermediate and should be referred to as beige adipocytes. With the knowledge that BAs arise from PM progenitor cells (Atit et al., 2006Atit R. Sgaier S.K. Mohamed O.A. Taketo M.M. Dufort D. Joyner A.L. Niswander L.

Erdjument-Bromage H. et al.PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch.Nature. 2008; 454: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), a multistep protocol was developed to recapitulate BA development with hPSCs. Differentiation of hPSC suspension aggregates toward a PM identity was performed by directed differentiation in rotation culture (Figure S2A), using serum-free medium (Figure 1A; Table S2). First, hPSC aggregates were treated with BMP4, bFGF and rapamycin in base medium for 48 h to promote mesoderm induction (Figure 1A). This was followed by the inhibition of BMP signaling (+Noggin), activation of the canonical WNT pathway (+WNT3a, +GSK3 inhibitor (2′Z,3′E)-6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime [BIO]) and addition of rapamycin (Chal and Pourquié, 2017Chal J. Pourquié O. Making muscle: skeletal myogenesis in vivo and in vitro.Development. 2017; 144: 2104-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) to generate PM. Efficacy of the approach was confirmed by evaluating levels of FOXC1, PAX3, and MYF5 mRNAs (Figure 1B) and protein (Figures 1C, 1D, S2B, and S2C). All markers increased significantly during this stage of differentiation. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis shows that >90% of cells were MYF5+ FOXC1+ and MYF5+ PAX3+ (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2B), confirming the efficient “specification” to a PM identity. Increases in PM markers were accompanied by loss of the pluripotency marker OCT4 (Figure S2B). One million hPSCs generated an average of 4.9 × 106 PM cells by this method (Figure S2D). The generation of BAs from hPSCs at high efficiency through a PM intermediate has proven to be problematic for the field (Singh and Dalton, 2018Singh A.M. Dalton S. What can ‘Brown-ing’ do for you?.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2018; 29: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This issue was revisited here by using serum-free medium supplemented with defined factors that have reported browning activity. It was also reasoned that using a correctly specified PM progenitor would be a useful starting point to facilitate efficient BA differentiation. By taking an empirical approach, PM was exposed to combinations of factors with established browning activity (Table S2) in a two-step procedure, comprising specification, “commitment,” and “establishment” phases (Figure 1A). The BA specification phase (BA1) involved plating single-cell suspensions of PM onto Geltrex-coated dishes in basal media supplemented with a cocktail of browning factors for 8 days (Table S2). The commitment phase (BA2) utilized most factors used for specification, except that SB 431542 was omitted and media was supplemented with lipid concentrate. Finally, committed cells transition from a commitment stage to an “establishment” phase comprising BAs. A list of media additives used at each stage and a rationale for their mode of action is summarized in Table S2. One million hPSC cells typically yielded an average of 4.2 × 107 BAs, indicating that considerable expansion occurred during the specification and commitment phases of differentiation (Figure S2D). During the commitment-establishment phase, cells acquire multilocular lipid droplets as shown by bright field microscopy (Figure 1E). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy shows that lipid droplets are organized into multilocular structures characteristic of thermogenic adipocytes (Figure 1F) (Cinti and Vettor, 2009Cinti S. Vettor R. The adipose organ.in: Awad A.B. Bradford P.G. Adipose Tissue and Inflammation. CRC Press, 2009: 11-31Google Scholar). In comparison to PM, transcript levels for UCP1, DIO2, and ADIPOQ are significantly elevated by 50 days and elevated further by forskolin treatment (Figure 1G). Reconstruction of z stack confocal images showed these cells to be organized in a tightly packed three-dimensional array with high mitochondrial density and uniform UCP1 expression (Figures 1H and S2E; Video S1). In contrast, WAs differentiated from human adipose derived stem cells have lower mitochondrial content and an absence of UCP1 expression (Figure S2E). 63% and 72% of cells were UCP1+ positive under nonstimulated and forskolin-treated conditions, respectively (Figure 1I). This is likely to be an underestimate of the proportion of BAs in the population, because cells with a high lipid content are lost during processing for flow cytometry due to their high buoyancy. Phenotypically, the cells produced by this method are consistent with them having a BA identity. This protocol was reproduced in two additional hPSC lines with similar results (Figure S2E). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhM2U1NzAwNmEwYjRhNGY5ODBkZDViNDRkYWY5MGIwZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM2MjE2MDY4fQ.IkwkGt6wSmdDUByH4Mg8ERVz9RyYrC475M2r9vsBl4FzZB7YMSNO1TPDDS81UmJjAxt6yTJ14I-LL5hHmDIkU46UhSzZKuZ03ILTDyimFa-48wLhlXK-UNw7DXVq8WIUuKf5OYFdanRzLjEBAcSBccvdsmpmr5jvz2CcYzbFPGod8knhYjwZP84bGhuiNOU7PRJ-R6PblE4jI10TPf-l_U5QvLJmPcxa7rco-jHQEYfBk03oM54I4U9uXRlfME_eYGzrLFOp0UH3nDljBgmLzpitltAeXlxM66VIt6ZEZhQd3o6NnCl_Roh3MUf6H8PQJ2FEuhNi9b2h1H44PfBzag Download .mp4 (5.44 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. 3D Immunofluorescence Image of Human iPSC-Derived Brown AdipocytesRelated to Figure 1 3D view of re-constructed Z stack confocal images token in iPSC derived brown adipocytes at day 50.

The identity of BAs was investigated further by using the neural network-based computational tool ProFat (Cheng et al., 2018Cheng Y. Jiang L. Keipert S. Zhang S. Hauser A. Graf E. Strom T. Tschöp M. Jastroch M. Perocchi F. Prediction of adipose browning capacity by systematic integration of transcriptional profiles.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 3112-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From this analysis, hPSC-derived BAs obtained a “browning probability” score of 0.733. This is comparable to primary human BAs (0.772) under basal conditions (Figure 2B). This probability score is increased to 0.929 following forskolin (FSK) stimulation. In contrast, pre-WAs, pre-BAs, and WAs show a low (<0.15) probability score, indicating that ProFat reliably distinguishes between different classes of adipocyte-related cell types. Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data identified a cohort of transcripts that are elevated in BAs and further upregulated in response to FSK (Figure 2C). This gene set includes PPARGC1A, DIO2, IRF4, and UCP1 and is consistent with molecular responses of authentic BAs to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The molecular signature of hPSC-derived BAs is therefore comparable to that of human BAs from BAT. These data confirm that hPSC-derived BAs exhibit a molecular signature that is characteristic of thermogenic adipocytes under basal and activated conditions. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of BA differentiation, a high-resolution time-course analysis of the transcriptome was performed by RNA-seq. Progression of cells through the time course to a BA identity was first evaluated to confirm that BA markers, including UCP1, CEBPα,β, and IRF4, are temporally regulated in the anticipated developmental pattern (Figure 2D). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the RNA-seq data demonstrates that differentiating cells follow an ordered progression from PM toward a UCP1+ state (Figure 2E). More detailed interrogation of the RNA-seq data using k-means cluster analysis identified five transcript clusters (c1–c5) displaying temporal regulation during BA development (Figure 2F). A sixth cluster (c6) represents transcripts that do not change during the time course. c1 and c2 represent transcripts that are elevated in PM but rapidly downregulated upon differentiation and include TCF15, TBX6, and ZIC2,3. 0–8 days of differentiation marks the specification stage, where a new cluster of mRNAs (c3), including GATA2,3 and EBF3, is upregulated. By day 15, transcripts in c3 are replaced by a new cluster (c4) that increases from days 15 to 44. This commitment stage is marked by elevation of PRDM16, PPARγ, CIDEA, and CEBPβ/δ/⍺, which persist during emergence of the final establishment cohort of transcripts (c5) that include UCP1, DIO2, and PPARGC1A. Transcripts belonging to c1-c5 were then subject to protein-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database to identify potential regulatory networks (Figure 2G). This approach was successful at placing established regulators of PM (FOXC2 and TBX6; c1 and c2) (Chal and Pourquié, 2017Chal J. Pourquié O. Making muscle: skeletal myogenesis in vivo and in vitro.Development. 2017; 144: 2104-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) within a network containing regulators not previously implicated in early PM function, such as GATA2/3, EN1, and DLX1. The commitment stage (c4), implicates regulators associated with progression along the BA lineage (PRDM16, PPARγ, EBF2, and CEBPβ/δ) in addition to a network of others that have yet to be functionally characterized in the context of BA development. Finally, the c5 “BA establishment” regulatory network is anchored by PPARGC1A to which several previously “uncharacterized” regulators are connected. The data presented in Figure 2 are a rich source of information for fully understanding BA development. To take advantage of this, we used these data as a starting point to understand specification and commitment along the BA lineage. This line of investigation is driven by an incomplete understanding of how PM progenitors progress along the BA lineage (Inagaki et al., 2016Inagaki T. Sakai J. Kajimura S.

Identification of disease patterns as well as characteristics of populations affected by multimorbidity is important for prevention strategies to identify those at risk.The aim of the study was to identify and describe demographic characteristics of multimorbidity classes in three age groups (16-44 years, 45-64 years, and 65+ years).Based on register information on 47 chronic diseases and conditions, we used latent class analysis to identify multimorbidity classes in a random sample of the Danish population (n = 470,794). Information on sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, region of origin, educational level, employment status, and marital status) was obtained from registers and linked to the study population. Age- and sex-adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between multimorbidity classes and sociodemographic characteristics.We identified seven classes among individuals in the age groups 45-64 years and 65+ years and five classes in the age group 16-44 years. Overall, the classes were similar in the three age groups, but varied in size, i.e. the class 'No or few diseases' was larger in the younger age group. The class 'Many diseases' (a class with both somatic diseases and mental illnesses) was only seen in individuals aged 45-64 years and 65+ years. There were social inequalities in odds of belonging to the multimorbidity classes compared to the healthier class. These social inequalities varied but were especially strong in the classes named 'Many diseases' and 'Mental illness, epilepsy'.The results of the study suggest that there are social inequalities in multimorbidity but that these inequalities are not universal to all types of multimorbidity. This supports that multimorbidity is diverse and should be prevented and treated accordingly."

Previous studies have shown that cognitive effort can be both detrimental and facilitative for the experienced sense of agency. We hypothesized that the reason for these contradictory findings might lie in the use of differential time windows in which cognitive effort operates. The current study therefore examined the effect of cognitive effort exerted on the current trial, on the previous trial or across a block of trials on sense of agency, using implicit (Experiment 1) and explicit (Experiment 2) measures of sense of agency. We showed that the exertion of more cognitive control on current trials led to a higher explicit sense of agency. This surprising result was contrasted to previous studies to establish potential reasons for this surprising finding and to formulate recommendations for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3048420814,"Prolonged ER stress has been known to be one of the major drivers of impaired lipid homeostasis during the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). However, the downstream mediators of ER stress pathway in promoting lipid accumulation remain poorly understood. Here, we present data showing the b-ZIP transcription factor E4BP4 in both the hepatocytes and the mouse liver is potently induced by the chemical ER stress inducer tunicamycin or by high-fat, low-methionine, and choline-deficient (HFLMCD) diet. We showed that such an induction is partially dependent on CHOP, a known mediator of ER stress and requires the E-box element of the E4bp4 promoter. Tunicamycin promotes the lipid droplet formation and alters lipid metabolic gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes from E4bp4flox/flox but not E4bp4 liver-specific KO (E4bp4-LKO) mice. Compared with E4bp4flox/flox mice, E4bp4-LKO female mice exhibit reduced liver lipid accumulation and partially improved liver function after 10-week HFLMCD diet feeding. Mechanistically, we observed elevated AMPK activity and the AMPKβ1 abundance in the liver of E4bp4-LKO mice. We have evidence supporting that E4BP4 may suppress the AMPK activity via promoting the AMPKβ1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, acute depletion of the Ampkβ1 subunit restores lipid droplet formation in E4bp4-LKO primary mouse hepatocytes. Our study highlighted hepatic E4BP4 as a key factor linking ER stress and lipid accumulation in the liver. Targeting E4BP4 in the liver may be a novel therapeutic avenue for treating NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3048694483,"The incidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing worldwide, including in Asian countries. We reported that the hepatic expression of bile salt export pump (BSEP) was downregulated in patients with NASH, suggesting that BSEP is involved in the pathogenesis of NASH. To identify the underlying mechanism, we analyzed Bsep heterozygous knock-out (Bsep+/- mice) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (32.0% animal fat) or normal diet. We examined histological changes, levels of hepatic lipids and hepatic bile acids, and expression of genes related to bile acid and cholesterol metabolism. HFD-fed Bsep+/- mice exhibited milder hepatic steatosis and less weight gain, compared to HFD-fed WT mice. The concentrations of total bile acid, triglycerides, and cholesterols were reduced in the liver of HFD-fed Bsep+/- mice. Regarding hepatic bile acid metabolism, the expression levels of Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) and Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 were significantly upregulated in HFD-fed Bsep+/- mice, compared to HFD-fed WT mice. Furthermore, several alterations were observed in upstream cholesterol metabolism in the liver. The expression levels of bile acid metabolism-related genes were also altered in the intestine of HFD-fed Bsep+/- mice. In conclusion, HFD-fed Bsep+/- mice exhibited significant alterations of the expression levels of genes related to bile acid and lipid metabolism in both the liver and ileum, resulting in alleviated steatosis and less weight gain. These results suggest the importance of BSEP for maintenance of bile acid and cholesterol metabolism. Further investigations of the involvement of BSEP in the pathogenesis of NASH will provide greater insight and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic modalities."

The spatiotemporal patterns of soundscape in this area were thus studied and described here. Acoustic data collected from February 2018 to February 2019 at ten monitoring sites, spanning ~200 km of the coastline, were analyzed. The ambient sound characteristics in the investigated area showed significant spatiotemporal variations. Sound levels centered at 0.5 and 1 kHz were higher during dusk and night than other times of the day at all monitoring sites except for one. Higher sound levels at frequencies above 8 kHz were documented during autumn and winter at all sites except for three of them. Biological and anthropogenic sound sources including soniferous fishes, snapping shrimps, dolphins, ships, pile-driving activities, and explosions were identified during spectrogram analyses of a subsample of the dataset. The shipping noise was frequently detected throughout the monitoring sites. Spatiotemporal variations of the soundscape in the investigated waters provided baseline information on the local marine environment, which will be beneficial to the protection of the vulnerable Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population recently discovered in the investigated waters."
https://openalex.org/W3048902766,"Straw mulching has been widely adopted in dryland cropping but its effect on soil respiration and microbial communities under warming are not well understood. Soil samples were collected from a corn field with straw mulching (SM) for nine years and without straw mulching (CK), and incubated at 15°C, 25°C, and 35°C for 60 days. Soil respiration, C fractions and bacterial and fungal community structure were measured SM had greater soil organic carbon and potential C mineralization and a similar microbial biomass carbon throughout the incubation when compared with CK. Soil respiration increased with increasing temperature and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) was lower with SM than CK. Similar microbial community composition was found in the soils with SM and CK before incubation. However, SM had a greater bacterial richness and the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, and Basidiomycota, but lower relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Ascomycota than CK after incubation. Bacterial richness and diversity were greater at 15°C and 25°C than 35°C, but there was no difference in fungal richness and diversity among the incubation temperatures. As temperature increased, the relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes decreased, but Gemmatimonadetes and Ascomycota increased, and were significantly correlated with soil C fractions and respiration. These findings indicated that the effect of straw mulching on soil C cycling and microbial community structure can be highly modified by increasing temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3048915251,"Soil archives are an important resource in agronomic and ecosystem sciences. If microbial communities could be reconstructed from archived soil DNA, as prehistoric plant communities are reconstructed via pollen data, soil archive resources would assume even greater value for reconstructing land-use history, forensic science, and biosphere modelling. Yet, the effects of long-term soil archival on the preservation of microbial DNA is still largely unknown. To address this, we assessed the capacity of high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes for reconstructing soil microbial communities across a 20 years time-series. We studied air-dried soil archives and fresh soil samples taken from Populus bioenergy and deciduous forest research plots at the Kellogg Biological Station. Habitat and archival time explained significant amounts of variation in soil microbial α- and β-diversity both in fungal and prokaryotic communities. We found that microbial richness, diversity, and abundance generally decreased with storage time, but varied between habitat and taxonomic groups. The high relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal species including Hebeloma and Cortinarius detected in older soil archives raises questions regarding traits such as long-term persistence and viability of ectomycorrhizal propagules in soils, with relevance to forest health and ecosystem succession. Talaromyces, Paecilomyces and Epicoccum spp. were detected in fresh and across 20-year-old archived soils and were also cultured from these soils demonstrating their long-term spore viability. In summary, we found that microbial DNA in air-dried soils archived over the past 20 years degraded with time, in a manner that differed between soil types and phylogenetic groups of microbes."

The current study assessed the association of common polymorphisms in the CLOCK and FTO genes with standardized body mass index scores (BMI z-scores) and their potential modification of the impact of a culinary nutrition and physical activity intervention in school-age children. Anthropometric measurements were collected in 121 children at the baseline and one-year follow-up of a controlled trial of a school-based culinary nutrition and physical activity intervention. Genotypes of the CLOCK polymorphism (rs1801260) and the FTO polymorphism (rs9939609) were obtained from buccal swabs. Linear mixed-effects regression was applied to evaluate the genetic association and adjust for clusters within families and schools. In our participants, obesity affected 6.6% (8/121) of the children at the baseline and 6.4% (7/109) of the children at the follow-up. The associations between the age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores and the two polymorphisms did not reach statistically significance. Yet, sex potentially modified the association between rs1801260 and BMI z-scores. In girls, the G allele carriers had a higher BMI z-scores at the baseline and the follow-up. These polymorphisms did not modify the effect of our culinary nutrition and physical activity intervention on BMI z-scores. Sex is a potential modifier for the association between the CLOCK polymorphism, rs1801260, and BMI z-scores in school-age children. Further investigation is warranted to delineate the sex-dependent role of the CLOCK polymorphisms in the development of childhood obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3048553691,"Two cross-modal priming experiments were conducted to investigate morphological processing in Chinese spoken word recognition during sentence comprehension. Participants heard sentences that contained opaque prime words and performed lexical decisions on visual targets that were related to second morpheme meanings of opaque words or whole-word meanings. The targets were presented at the auditory onset of the second morphemes or the subsequent syllables after the opaque primes to examine the time course of effects. In a neutral sentence context (Experiment 1), opaque word morpheme meanings produced morphological priming on target word recognition, which preceded lexical priming. When context biased toward whole opaque words (Experiment 2), morphological priming disappeared, while the effect of lexical meanings remained significant and emerged earlier than the effect of lexical meanings in the neutral context. These findings suggest that morphemes play a role in Chinese spoken word recognition, but their effects depend on the prior context during sentence comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W3048813224,"Can people categorize complex visual scenes unconsciously? The possibility of unconscious perception remains controversial. Here, we addressed this question using psychophysical methods applied to unmasked visual stimuli presented for extremely short durations (in the μsec range) by means of a custom-built modern tachistoscope. Our experiment was composed of two phases. In the first phase, natural or urban scenes were either absent or present (for varying durations) on the tachistoscope screen, and participants were simply asked to evaluate their subjective perception using a 3-points scale (absence of stimulus, stimulus detection or stimulus identification). Participants’ responses were tracked by means of two staircases. The first psychometric function aimed at defining participants’ proportion of subjective detection responses (i.e., not having seen anything vs. having seen something without being able to identify it), while the second staircase tracked the proportion of subjective identification rates (i.e., being unaware of the stimulus’ category vs. being aware of it). In the second phase, the same participants performed an objective categorization task in which they had to decide, on each trial, whether the image was a natural vs. an urban scene. A third staircase was used in this phase so as to build a psychometric curve reflecting the objective categorization performance of each participant. In this second phase, participants also rated their subjective perception of each stimulus on every trial, exactly as in the first phase of the experiment. Our main result is that objective categorization performance, here assumed to reflect the contribution of both conscious and unconscious trials, cannot be explained based exclusively on conscious trials. This clearly suggests that the categorization of complex visual scenes is possible even when participants report being unable to consciously perceive the contents of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3048494194,"Ghana Health Service (GHS) has strengthened community-based surveillance (CBS) to facilitate early detection and rapid reporting of health events of all origins. Since June 2017, GHS has employed an event-based surveillance approach at the community level in a phased manner. CBS coverage has broadened from 2 to 30 districts across Ghana. Through this effort, capacity was built across all administrative levels in these districts to detect, report, triage, and verify signals, and to perform risk assessment and investigate events. Data were collected and analyzed during an evaluation of initial 2-district implementation in March 2018 and during expanded 30-district implementation in March 2019. Between September 2018 and March 2019, 317 health events were detected through CBS. These events included vaccine-preventable disease cases, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis outbreaks, clusters of unexpected animal deaths, and foodborne illness clusters. Eighty-nine percent of the 317 events were reported to district-level public health staff within 24 hours of detection at the community level, and 87% of all detected events were responded to within 48 hours of detection. CBS detected 26% of all suspected vaccine-preventable disease cases that were reported from implementing districts through routine disease surveillance. GHS strengthened CBS in Ghana to function as an early warning system for health events of all origins, advancing the Global Health Security Agenda."
https://openalex.org/W3048854503,"High and variable pre-weaning mortality is a persistent problem in laboratory mouse breeding. Assuming a modest 15% mortality rate across mouse strains, means that approximately 1 million more pups are produced yearly in the EU to compensate for those which die. This paper presents the first large study under practical husbandry conditions to determine the risk factors associated with mouse pre-weaning mortality. We analysed historical records from 219,975 pups from two breeding facilities, collected as part of their management routine and including information on number of pups born and weaned per litter, parents' age and identification, and dates of birth and death of all animals. Pups were counted once in their first week of life and at weaning, and once every one or two weeks, depending on the need for cage cleaning. Dead pups were recorded as soon as these were found during the daily cage screening (without opening the cage). It was hypothesized that litter overlap (i.e. the presence of older siblings in the cage when new pups are born), a recurrent social configuration in trio-housed mice, is associated with increased newborn mortality, along with advanced dam age, large litter size, and a high number and age of older siblings in the cage. The estimated probability of pup death was two to seven percentage points higher in cages with litter overlap compared to those without. Litter overlap was associated with an increase in death of the entire litter of five and six percentage points, which represent an increase of 19% and 103% compared to non-overlapped litters in the two breeding facilities, respectively. Increased number and age of older siblings, advanced dam age, small litter size (less than four pups born) and large litter size (over 11 pups born) were associated with increased probability of pup death."
https://openalex.org/W3048812120,"Overweight/obese dogs are at increased risk of health issues and it is up to the dog owner to uphold successful weight management. In children, overweight relates to their parent's permissive style of parenting. We predicted that permissive dog-directed parenting likewise associates with a dog being overweight (including obesity). If styles in parenting dogs indeed associate with a dog's overweight, these may provide action points for effective weight management. For 2,303 Dutch dog owners, answers on their dog's (nine-point scale) body condition scores were compared to ways of parenting the dog. We used an adapted version of the 32-item Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire and compared the distributions of dog counts across aggregated body condition score categories of underweight (scores one to three), healthy-weight (scores four and five) and overweight/obese (scores six to nine) with Chi-square tests across the quartiles of a given parenting style. Overweight/obese dogs were overrepresented in the quartile of dog owners with the highest level of permissive parenting, which is in line with findings on parenting styles and overweight/obesity in children. Supplementary logistic regression analyses on the likelihood of dogs being overweight/obese (i.e. having a body condition score of six or higher) confirmed the importance of parenting and identified the risk factors of dogs having little exercise, being of older age, neutered or owned by someone with lower level education. Our results indicate that strategies to promote proper weight management in dogs could benefit from addressing especially a dog owner's permissiveness in parenting his/her dog."

Long noncoding (lnc) RNAs are emerging regulators of inflammation with unknown clinical relevance. Herein, we report that levels of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-related lnc interleukin (IL) 7 receptor (IL7R) were significantly reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COPD compared with those from normal controls, and the levels were correlated with pulmonary function. Moreover lnc-IL7R levels were reduced in lavaged alveolar macrophages and primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEpCs) from patients with COPD. Lnc-IL7R knockdown in primary human macrophages, HSAEpCs, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) significantly augmented the induction of proinflammatory mediators after TLR2/4 activation. By contrast, lnc-IL7R overexpression attenuated inflammation after TLR2/4 activation. Similar results with lnc-IL7R-mediated inflammation were observed in COPD HSAEpCs. Mechanistically, lnc-IL7R mediated a repressive chromatin state of the proinflammatory gene promoter as a result of decreased acetylation (H3K9ac) and increased methylation (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). Plasma lnc-IL7R levels were reduced in patients with COPD who experienced more acute exacerbation in the previous year. Notably, patients with lower lnc-IL7R levels in the subsequent year had increased exacerbation risk. Low lnc-IL7R expression in COPD may augment TLR2/4-mediated inflammation and be associated with acute exacerbation."
https://openalex.org/W3048586074,"Knowledge about population genetic structure and dispersal capabilities is important for the development of targeted management strategies for agricultural pest species. The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), is a pre-dispersal seed predator. Larvae feed on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia), and when rowanberry seed production is low (i.e., inter-masting), the moth switches from laying eggs in rowanberries to apples (Malus domestica), resulting in devastating losses in apple crops. Using genetic methods, we investigated if this small moth expresses any local genetic structure, or alternatively if gene flow may be high within the Scandinavian Peninsula (~850.000 km2, 55o - 69o N). Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71). For three out of ten tetranucleotide STRs, we detected heterozygote deficiency caused by null alleles, but tests showed little impact on the overall results. Genetic differentiation between the 28 sampling locations was very low (average FST = 0.016, P < 0.000). Surprisingly, we found that all individuals could be assigned to one of two non-geographic genetic clusters, and that a third, geographic cluster was found to be associated with 30% of the sampling locations, with weak but significant signals of isolation-by-distance. Conclusively, our findings suggest wind-aided dispersal and spatial synchrony of both sexes of the apple fruit moth over large areas and across very different climatic zones. We speculate that the species may recently have had two separate genetic origins caused by a genetic bottleneck after inter-masting, followed by rapid dispersal and homogenization of the gene pool across the landscape. We suggest further investigations of spatial genetic similarities and differences of the apple fruit moth at larger geographical scales, through life-stages, across inter-masting, and during attacks by the parasitoid wasp (Microgaster politus)."

Towards achieving optimal integration and reducing feelings of artificiality and enforcement, we explored perceptual simultaneity through electrical muscle stimulation, which involved changing the interval between intentional and induced movements. We report on two experiments in which we evaluated the ranges between detection and stimulus for perceptual simultaneity achievable with an electromyography-triggered electrical muscle stimulation system. We found that the peak range was approximately 80-160 ms, with the timing of perceptual simultaneity shifting according to different adaptation states. Our results indicate that perceptual simultaneity is controllable using this adaptation strategy."

Methods The animals were randomized and divided into seven experimental groups treated with placebo, PBMT, prednisone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), PBMT plus prednisone and PBMT plus NSAID. Wild type animals were used as control. All treatments were performed during 14 consecutive weeks. Muscular morphology, protein expression of dystrophin and functional performance were assessed at the end of the last treatment. Results Both treatments with prednisone and PBMT applied alone or combined, were effective in preserving muscular morphology. In addition, the treatments with PBMT (p = 0.0005), PBMT plus prednisone (p = 0.0048) and PBMT plus NSAID (p = 0.0021) increased dystrophin gene expression compared to placebo-control group. However, in the functional performance the PBMT presented better results compared to glucocorticoids (p<0.0001). In contrast, the use of NSAIDs did not appear to add benefits to skeletal muscle tissue in mdx mice. Conclusion We believe that the promising and optimistic results about the PBMT in skeletal muscle of mdx mice may in the future contribute to this therapy to be considered a safe alternative for patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in a washout period (between treatment periods with glucocorticoids), allowing them to remain receiving effective and safe treatment in this period, avoiding at this way periods without administration of any treatment."

However, studies that assessed health benefits associated with vegan diet practices during the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian (EOC) Lenten fasting remains limited. This study has, therefore, assessed how short-term vegan diet associated with metabolic traits, including weight, body mass index (BMI), circumference, blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), through longitudinal cross-sectional study design.Seventy-five subjects (34 females and 41 males) with a mean age of [+SD] 27.3 + 5.8 years (range, 18 and 35) took part in the study. The study followed three assessment sessions: at baseline, during the Lenten (week 7), and 7 weeks after the end of the Lenten (week 14). An automatic chemistry analyzer (Mindray, BE-2000, China) used for lipid profile analysis. We used paired sample t-test in pre and post-performance and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc adjustment between time points. The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The EOC fasting with vegan diet induced significantly lower blood pressure, weight, BMI, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TC: HDL-C ratios, during Lenten (that is vegan diet consumption), but a regain noted in these parameters 7-weeks after Lenten (that is omnivore diet). On gender differences, vegan diet associated with significantly lower blood pressure, TC, and LDL-C in females compared with age-matched male counterparts. Some methodological limitations of this study are discussed with particular reference to lack of a randomized control group and self-reported data that limit this study in establishing a causal relationship through observed associations.Vegan diet consumption even for short period corroborate ideal metabolic traits, with more favorable changes noted in women than age-matched men counterparts. These findings might help to define vegetarian diets as part of religious fasting (beyond its spiritual goals) as a non-pharmacological prescription in different populations, and our findings add to growing evidence in these subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3048376439,"Dynamical networks are pervasive in a multitude of natural and human-made systems. Often, we seek to guarantee that their state is steered to the desired goal within a specified number of time steps. Different network topologies lead to implicit trade-offs between the minimum number of driven nodes and the time-to-control. In this study, we propose a generative model to create artificial dynamical networks with trade-offs similar to those of real networks. Remarkably, we show that several centrality and non-centrality measures are not necessary nor sufficient to explain the trade-offs, and as a consequence, commonly used generative models do not suffice to capture the dynamical properties under study. Therefore, we introduce the notion of time-to-control communities, that combine networks' partitions and degree distributions, which is crucial for the proposed generative model. We believe that the proposed methodology is crucial when invoking generative models to investigate dynamical network properties across science and engineering applications. Lastly, we provide evidence that the proposed generative model can generate a variety of networks with statistically indiscernible trade-offs (i.e., the minimum number of driven nodes vs. the time-to-control) from those steaming from real networks (e.g., neural and social networks)."
https://openalex.org/W3048456382,"Background The myocardial adaptive mechanism in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) is less understood. We aimed to investigate biventricular myocardial adaptive remodeling in rTOF patients. Methods We recruited 32 rTOF patients and 38 age- and sex-matched normal controls. The pulmonary stenosis of rTOF patients was measured using catheterized pressure gradient between right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PGRVPA). rTOF patients with PGRVPA < 15 mmHg and ≥15 mmHg were classified as low pulmonary stenosis (rTOFlow, n = 19) and high pulmonary stenosis (rTOFhigh, n = 13) subgroups, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging tissue phase mapping was employed to evaluate the voxelwise biventricular myocardial motion in longitudinal (Vz), radial (Vr), and circumferential (Vφ) directions. Results The rTOFlow subgroup presented higher pulmonary regurgitation fraction than rTOFhigh subgroup (p < 0.001). Compared with the normal group, only rTOFlow subgroup presented a decreased RV ejection fraction (RVEF) (p < 0.05). The rTOFlow subgroup showed decreased systolic and diastolic Vz in RV and LV, whereas rTOFhigh subgroup showed such change only in RV. In rTOFlow subgroup, RVEF significantly correlated with RV systolic Vr (r = 0.56, p < 0.05), whereas LVEF correlated with LV systolic Vz (r = 0.51, p = 0.02). Prolonged QRS correlated with RV systolic Vr (r = -0.58, p < 0.01) and LV diastolic Vr (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). No such correlations occurred in rTOFhigh subgroup. Conclusions The avoidance of unfavorable functional interaction in RV and LV in rTOFhigh subgroup suggested that adequate pulmonary stenosis (PGRVPA ≥ 15 mmHg in this sereis) has a protective effect against pulmonary regurgitation."
https://openalex.org/W3048605430,"Habitat loss caused by deforestation is a global driver of predator population declines. However, few studies have focussed on these effects for mesopredator populations, particularly the cryptic and elusive species inhabiting tropical rainforests. We conducted camera trapping from 2009–11 and 2014–16, and used occupancy modelling to understand trends of Sumatran mesopredator occupancy in response to forest loss and in the absence of threats from poaching. By comparing the two survey periods we quantify the trend of occupancy for three sympatric felid species in the tropical rainforest landscape of Kerinci Seblat National Park. Between 2000 and 2014, forest loss across four study sites ranged from 2.6% to 8.4%. Of three threatened felid species, overall occupancy by Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Asiatic golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) remained stable across all four areas between the two survey periods, whilst marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata) occupancy increased. In general occupancy estimates for the three species were: lower in lowland forest and increased to attain their highest values in hill forest, where they declined thereafter; increased further from the forest edge; positively correlated with distance to river, except for golden cat in the second survey where the relationship was negative; and, increased further from active deforestation, especially for clouded leopard in the second survey, but this was some 10-15km away. Our study offers fresh insights into these little known mesopredators in Sumatra and raises the practically important question of how far-reaching is the shadow of the encroachment and road development that typified this deforestation."
https://openalex.org/W3048831072,"Aiming to solve the problem of low data utilization and privacy protection, a personalized differential privacy protection method based on cross-correlation constraints is proposed. By protecting sensitive location points on the trajectory and their affiliated sensitive points, this method combines the sensitivity of the user's trajectory location and user privacy protection requirements and privacy budget to propose a (R,Ɛ) -extended differential privacy protection model. Using autocorrelation Laplace transform, specific Gaussian white noise is transformed into noise that is related to the user's real trajectory sequence in both time and space. Then the noise is added to the user trajectory sequence to ensure spatio-temporal correlation between the noise sequence and the user trajectory sequence. This defines the cross-correlation constraint mechanism of the published trajectory sequence. By superimposing the real trajectory sequence on the user’s noise sequence that satisfies the autocorrelation, a published trajectory sequence that satisfies the cross-correlation constraint condition is established to provide strong privacy guarantees against adversaries. Finally, the feasibility, effectiveness and rationality of the algorithm are verified by simulation experiments, and the proposed method is compared with recent studies in the same field on basis of merits and weakness and so on."
https://openalex.org/W3048735887,"The forgetting of previously remembered information has, for a long time, been explained by purely passive processes. This viewpoint has been challenged by the finding that humans show worse memory for specific items that they have been instructed to forget. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has, through imaging, lesion and brain stimulation studies, been implied in controlling such active forgetting processes. In this study, we attempted to solidify evidence for such a causal role of the dlPFC in directed forgetting by replicating an existing rTMS study (Hanslmayr S, 2012) in a preregistered within-participant design. We stimulated participants at the dlPFC (BA9) or vertex using 45s of 1Hz rTMS after instructions to forget previously remembered words in a list-method directed forgetting paradigm and tested for effects on the amount of forgotten information. Contrary to the study we were attempting to replicate, no significant increase in forgetting under dlPFC stimulation was found in our participants. However, when combining our results with the study we were attempting to replicate, dlPFC stimulation led to significantly increased directed forgetting in both studies combined. We further explored if the rTMS parameters used here and in earlier work (Hanslmayr S, 2012) influenced inhibitory processing at their time of delivery or in a more persistent manner. Unaltered incongruency and negative priming effects in a Stroop task conducted directly after stimulation suggests that our rTMS stimulation did not continue to influence inhibitory processing after the time of stimulation. As the combined evidence for increased directed forgetting due to rTMS dlPFC stimulation is still quite weak, additional replications are necessary to show that directed forgetting is indeed causally driven by an active prefrontal process."
https://openalex.org/W3048916409,"Although the peer review system of academic journals is seen as fundamental to scientific achievement, a major threat to the validity of the system is a potential evaluation bias resulting from constraints at the journal level. In this study, we examine how the time pressure to maintain a fixed periodical quota for journal publication can influence a journal editor’s decision to accept or reject a paper at any given point in time. We find that an increase in publication backlog, proxied as the average delay between paper acceptance and print publication, is correlated with an increase in the subsequent rejection rates of new submissions. Our findings suggest that time pressures inherent in the peer review system may be a source of potential evaluator bias, calling for a need to reconsider the current quota system."
https://openalex.org/W3048515067,"A new generalized linear mixed quantile model for panel data is proposed. This proposed approach applies GEE with smoothed estimating functions, which leads to asymptotically equivalent estimation of the regression coefficients. Random effects are predicted by using the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) based on the Tweedie exponential dispersion distributions which cover a wide range of distributions, including those widely used ones, such as the normal distribution, Poisson distribution and gamma distribution. A Taylor expansion of the quantile estimating function is used to linearize the random effects in the quantile process. The parameter estimation is based on the Newton-Raphson iteration method. Our proposed quantile mixed model gives consistent estimates that have asymptotic normal distributions. Simulation studies are carried out to investigate the small sample performance of the proposed approach. As an illustration, the proposed method is applied to analyze the epilepsy data."
https://openalex.org/W3048752323,"Squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards) rely on chemical cues from conspecifics to search the environment for potential mates. How such cues are used by invasive species to facilitate reproduction, especially seasonally, is a key question that can inform management practices. The Argentine black and white tegu (Salvator merianae) is an invasive reptile species in south Florida threatening native fauna in biodiverse regions such as Everglades National Park. While some information exists on the reproductive ecology of this species in its native range in South America, the chemical ecology of S. merianae is unclear especially in its invasive range. By testing both male (n = 7) and female (n = 7) tegus in a Y-maze apparatus, we assessed if either sex follows chemical trails left by conspecifics and if behaviors were sex- or season-specific. We conducted three types of trials where conspecifics created odor trails: Male-only (male scent only in base and one arm of Y), Female-only, and Male vs. female. Males did not preferentially follow scent trails from either sex, but they did differentially investigate conspecific scent from both sexes. Seasonally, males showed increased rates of chemosensory sampling (rates of tongue-flicking) during the spring (breeding season; March-May) compared to fall (non-breeding season; September-November). Males also had reduced turning and pausing behavior while trailing in the spring. Female tegus exhibited stronger conspecific trailing abilities than males, following both male and female scent trails, and they explored the maze less before making an arm choice. Females also investigated the scent trails intensely compared to males (more passes in scented arms, more time with scent trails). Our results demonstrate for the first time that females of an invasive reptile species can follow conspecific scent trails. Given the strong female responses to odor, sex-specific targeting of tegus via application of a conspecific chemical cue in traps could enhance removal rates of females during the breeding season."
