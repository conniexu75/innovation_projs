Each of the twelve systems has now been studied over the full range of composition, and the phases listed in the accompanying table have been characterized."

https://openalex.org/W1996469677,"IN the course of investigations with radioactive isotopes in this Department, anomalous rates of decay have been observed with some isotopes in particular chemical forms. The escape of iodine-131 from evaporated samples of sodium iodide has already been reported by one of us1, and Hevesy2 has reported the escape of carbon-14 from exposed samples of barium carbonate. Anomalies have also been observed in the decay of phosphorus-32 as disodium hydrogen phosphate in solution. In this case, the solution sometimes appears to form a mould (often very rapidly even in sterile solution) on to which the activity appears to concentrate. The activity of the solution over a period of time usually appears to decay more rapidly than the normal half-life of phosphorus-32 would indicate, although it does not appear to decrease regularly. Also phosphorus-32 incorporated as red phosphorus in polythene plastic, which has uses as a superficial applicator in radio-therapy, appears to exude phosphoric acid when pre-pared by calendering. Particularly in warm weather, apparent half-lives as short as eight days have been observed for phosphorus-32 in this form."

https://openalex.org/W2042751773,"SMALL amounts of barium and strontium can be detected in the tissues of many insects by means of the extremely sensitive rhodizonate reaction. This reaction was described for microchemical use by Feigl1, who has since investigated its limitations2,3. In the present histochemical method, tissues are fixed in carefully neutralized 10 per cent formalin in 70 per cent alcohol and immersed for 30–60 min. in a freshly prepared 1 or 2 per cent solution of sodium rhodizonate, in distilled water or in phosphate buffer at pH 7. Excess sodium rhodizonate is afterwards removed by washing in dilute alcohol. Stained tissues can be sectioned in the usual manner and permanent preparations obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1991684604,"WHILE studying the role of the thyroid on body growth1 and sexual development2 in the young male rabbit, it was decided to observe the effects of known levels of thyroidal stimulation and inhibition on the adrenals, because they appear to be linked up with that part of the complex endocrine system which influences the various reproductive processes in the male. As castration and summer season both cause a decrease in the rate of secretion of thyroxine in the young male rabbit3, their effects on the adrenals were also studied."
https://openalex.org/W1994006155,"THE association of certain serological types of Bact. coli type I with infantile diarrhœa has been described by many investigators, particularly in Great Britain1–4. Identification of these strains has been based on the serological identification of the somatic O, the surface K and the flagellar H antigens5,6. Kauffmann subdivides the K antigens into three types, capsular A, thermolabile L and B; when heated, the B antigen retains its antibody-binding capacity, but loses its agglutinability."

https://openalex.org/W2033568495,"IN the course of experiments designed to test the production by clover roots of a factor inhibitory to nodule formation, plants have been grown in the presence of a wide range of adsorbents including montmorillonite (Wyoming bentonite) and fuller's earth. Both these minerals, besides stimulating the formation of nodules, show strong colour reactions in the neighbourhood of the root."

https://openalex.org/W2004529810,"WE have investigated the emission of light pulses from thin films under α-particle bombardment. In all cases, irrespective of the material used, light pulses were observed to be emitted from those films the thickness of which did not exceed the range of the α-particle in the material. The following materials were included in our investigations: Sulphur, Iodine, Carbon; Nickel Sulphate, Sodium Chromate, Stannous Chloride, Mercuric Iodide; Aluminium, Copper, Tungsten, Iron; Nylon, Glass, Mica, Collodion."

https://openalex.org/W2061771613,"IN view of a recent statement1 “that solutions of macromolecular substances may show an anomalous fall in the coefficient of viscosity at high rates of shear”, it is emphasized once again2 that, at sufficiently high rates of shear, any liquid consisting of elongated molecules must be expected to exhibit a decrease of the coefficient of viscosity with increasing rate of shear. This means that there is only a quantitative, but no qualitative, difference between the dependence of viscosity on rate of shear of so-called Newtonian liquids and that of solutions of macro-molecular substances. Grunberg and Nissan3 estimated that at a rate of shear of about 106 sec.−1 pentane might begin to show an appreciable reduction of viscosity, and Bondi4 predicted that temporary reductions of viscosity would become apparent for shearing stresses of more than 105 dynes/cm.2 for straight hydrocarbon chains with molecular weights of 500 and more. In addition to our own previous results on castor oil and straight mineral oils5, experimental evidence is now presented to prove that a chemically defined liquid, such as tetradecane, suffers an appreciable fall of its coefficient of viscosity over a range of rates of shear extending to about 350,000 sec.−1."

https://openalex.org/W2324336135,"DURING the course of investigations on the effect of the various œstrogenic hormones on the reticulo-endothelial system, it was noted that many animals showed toxic effects. The relative toxicity of the various œstrogens was therefore investigated. Such toxic effects of natural and synthetic œstrogens have been studied in various laboratory animals by many workers1–7, who noted hepatic and renal damage and anaplastic anæmia in animals treated with large daily doses of œstrogens. Castrodale et al.4 observed in dogs some fatty degeneration and central necrosis in the liver, and MacBryde et al.7 noted that the changes in the liver parenchyma were not widespread and consisted of fatty and hydropic degenerations, which were produced equally by all œstrogens used (œstrone, œstradiol benzoate, and diethylstilbœstrol dipropionate)."

https://openalex.org/W2046940994,"Scott Blair, Cowie and Coppen1 found that when uterine cervical secretions from the cow were examined in an emptying capillary viscometer the shape of the flow curve changed during pregnancy; but Scott Blair, Cowie and Folley2 showed that a parameter derived from such curves gave a reliable test for pregnancy only about sixteen weeks after conception. It seemed likely that the test could be improved in four ways: (1) by ensuring that all samples were taken directly from the cervix without vaginal contamination; (2) by using unmixed samples, thereby avoiding disturbance to the structure; (3) by measuring changes in pressure at constant rate of flow rather than extruding at constant pressure and measuring rates, thus largely eliminating accelerations; and (4) by averaging the results of two or three tests."

https://openalex.org/W1971684615,"ACCORDING to Butler and Jones1, two reports only of the finding of cleistocarps of the oak mildew in Great Britain have been published, the first2 referring to six cleistocarps on one leaf of Q. robur at Bricket Wood, Herts, in October 1945, the second3 to “a few perithecia on leaves of Quercus robur” at Aberystwyth in October 1947. A third collection (Herb. I.M.I. 19315) identified by E. A. Ellis as Microsphæra alphitoides on Q. robur, from Wheatfen Broad, Surlingham, Norfolk, also in October 1947, is deposited at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute (information from S. J. Hughes)."
https://openalex.org/W2020342238,"MOST text-books of organic chemistry contain the statement that formic acid and formates owe their reducing character to the presence of an aldehyde group in their molecule, quoting in support of this their ability to reduce ammoniacal silver nitrate to the metal; while this reaction certainly is given by aldehydes, it is not specific for this class of compound since many other acids, such as tartaric or citric, similarly reduce silver nitrate. The reduction of mercuric chloride to mercurous chloride by formates likewise offers no support for the aldehyde theory, since aldehydes in general, including formaldehyde, cannot effect this change. Actually, formates give none of the reactions which characterize an aldehyde; thus they fail to restore the colour to Schiff's reagent, produce no reaction with 2.4 dinitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride, and above all do not reduce Fehling's solution, which is probably the most specific of all aldehyde reagents."

https://openalex.org/W2041646845,"THE viscosity of dividing cells goes through definite changes, increasing during prophase, dropping abruptly at metaphase, and increasing sharply just prior to division1. These changes are believed essential for mitosis. Heilbrunn2 has pointed out many similarities between the protoplasmic gelation which precedes the appearance of the mitotic spindle and blood clotting."
https://openalex.org/W2042644785,"IN Nature of November 11, S. L. Rabasa1 discusses the reduction in genetic variability which can take place in a population bred by artificial insemination. The problem he raises is not peculiar to populations bred in this way, but is a general one which must be faced in any population in which the parents of later generations are selected out of the whole number of adults available. The reduction in genetic variability resulting from using only a small number of animals as parents, and the loss of vigour which usually accompanies the unavoidable inbreeding, has to be weighed against the benefits resulting from the genetic superiority of the parents selected—a genetic superiority which can be increased only if the selected fraction is allowed to decrease. Artificial insemination makes it possible to have a smaller ratio of parents to non-parents but otherwise leaves the situation unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W2090933115,"THE thyroid hormone, which regulates about 40 per cent of the body metabolism, is likely to influence the body temperature; but very little systematic work has been done to study the effects of the thyroid on the body-temperatures of growing animals. This seems to have some practical value, because the body-temperature gives an indication of the physiological state of the animal. In the present investigation the effects of known levels of thyroidal stimulation and inhibition, for short or long periods, on the rectal temperatures of the growing male rabbit and the ram have been studied."

Development of the boll was investigated in four varieties: Ashmouni, Sakel, Wafir and Maarad. Two of these, namely, Ashmouni and Maarad, were selected for the determination of the oil in the developing seed."
