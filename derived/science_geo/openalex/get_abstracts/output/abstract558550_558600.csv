https://openalex.org/W2341088037,"Microglia maintain homeostasis in the brain, but whether aberrant microglial activation can cause neurodegeneration remains controversial. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive upregulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and enhanced synaptic pruning in microglia. During aging, Grn(-/-) mice show profound microglia infiltration and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which lead to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn(-/-) microglia and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes, and premature mortality in Grn(-/-) mice. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing aberrant microglia activation during aging. These results represent an important conceptual advance that complement activation and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning are major drivers, rather than consequences, of neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2343868815,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain lifelong blood production and increase blood cell numbers in response to chronic and acute injury. However, the mechanism(s) by which inflammatory insults are communicated to HSCs and their consequences for HSC activity remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1), which functions as a key pro-inflammatory ‘emergency’ signal, directly accelerates cell division and myeloid differentiation of HSCs through precocious activation of a PU.1-dependent gene program. Although this effect is essential for rapid myeloid recovery following acute injury to the bone marrow, chronic IL-1 exposure restricts HSC lineage output, severely erodes HSC self-renewal capacity, and primes IL-1-exposed HSCs to fail massive replicative challenges such as transplantation. Importantly, these damaging effects are transient and fully reversible on IL-1 withdrawal. Our results identify a critical regulatory circuit that tailors HSC responses to acute needs, and is likely to underlie deregulated blood homeostasis in chronic inflammation conditions. Passegué and colleagues reveal that pro-inflammatory IL-1 accelerates cell division and induces PU.1-mediated differentiation of HSCs into myeloid cells, whereas chronic IL-1 exposure compromises HSC function."
https://openalex.org/W2335934832,"Little is known about cooperative behaviour among the gut microbiota; here, limited cooperation is demonstrated for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, but Bacteroides ovatus is found to extracellularly digest a polysaccharide not for its own use, but to cooperatively feed other species such as Bacteroides vulgatus from which it receives return benefits. Microbial communities are essentially cooperative networks and here Seth Rakoff-Nahoum et al. examine the mechanisms of cooperative behaviour among gut microbiota. Using a combination of in vitro experiments and a mouse model, the authors show that Bacteroides ovatus uses an enzyme system for the extracellular digestion of the dietary polysaccharide inulin, which is a costly process, but benefits other species such as Bacteroides vulgatus, by supplying a source of food. Potential routes by which B. vulgatus may provide return benefits to B. ovatus include detoxification of inhibitory substances and the secretion of a depleted or growth promoting factor. This is a rare example of naturally evolved cooperation within complex microbial communities that is likely to have an important role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Cooperative phenotypes are considered central to the functioning of microbial communities in many contexts, including communication via quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis1,2,3,4,5. The human intestine houses a dense and diverse microbial community critical to health1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, yet we know little about cooperation within this important ecosystem. Here we test experimentally for evolved cooperation within the Bacteroidales, the dominant Gram-negative bacteria of the human intestine. We show that during growth on certain dietary polysaccharides, the model member Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exhibits only limited cooperation. Although this organism digests these polysaccharides extracellularly, mutants lacking this ability are outcompeted. In contrast, we discovered a dedicated cross-feeding enzyme system in the prominent gut symbiont Bacteroides ovatus, which digests polysaccharide at a cost to itself but at a benefit to another species. Using in vitro systems and gnotobiotic mouse colonization models, we find that extracellular digestion of inulin increases the fitness of B. ovatus owing to reciprocal benefits when it feeds other gut species such as Bacteroides vulgatus. This is a rare example of naturally-evolved cooperation between microbial species. Our study reveals both the complexity and importance of cooperative phenotypes within the mammalian intestinal microbiota."

Chronic 50% reduction of C9ORF72 did not provoke disease, while its absence produced splenomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes, and mild social interaction deficits, but not motor dysfunction.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases with distinct clinical features but common pathological features and genetic causes (Ling et al., 2013Ling S.C.

Proposed mechanisms by which C9ORF72 repeat expansions cause disease (referred to as C9ALS/FTD) include loss of C9ORF72 protein function and gain of toxicity (Gendron et al., 2014Gendron T.F.

By production and analysis of mice in which one or both C9orf72 alleles were inactivated, and multiple transgenic mouse lines expressing up to 450 C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeats, we tested disease mechanism(s) associated with C9ALS/FTD. Herein we show a repeat-length-dependent gain of toxicity, while chronic reduction of C9ORF72 does not produce nervous system disease. Single-dose injection of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively target repeat-containing RNAs causes a rapid reduction in RNA foci and DPR proteins, while maintaining overall levels of C9ORF72-encoding mRNAs and producing a sustained alleviation of behavioral deficits. To determine the consequence of loss of C9ORF72 function in vivo, mice were generated in which a LacZ reporter replaced exons 2–6 of the endogenous C9orf72 gene (Figure 1A). As expected, total C9orf72 RNAs and the full-length 54 kD C9ORF72 protein were reduced to 50% in brains of heterozygous C9orf72+/− mice and were completely absent in homozygous C9orf72−/− mice (Figures 1B and 1C). A β-galactosidase activity assay, used to assess endogenous C9orf72 gene expression throughout the CNS, revealed broad expression of C9orf72 not only in neurons of the gray matter as previously reported (Suzuki et al., 2013Suzuki N. Maroof A.M. Merkle F.T. Koszka K. Intoh A. Armstrong I. Moccia R. Davis-Dusenbery B.N. Eggan K. The mouse C9ORF72 ortholog is enriched in neurons known to degenerate in ALS and FTD.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1725-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but also in glial cells of white matter in various CNS regions, including the cerebellum and spinal cord (Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Further evidence confirming substantial expression of the C9orf72 gene in glial cells was obtained using high-throughput sequencing of translated RNAs purified from BacTRAP transgenic mice that express EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein L10a in defined cell populations (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M.

The structures, along with glycan-array binding and molecular dynamics, reveal a diversity in oligosaccharide affinity and a requirement for accommodating glycans among known broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan-shielded trimer. Glycan shields reside at the interface between virology, glycobiology, and immunology. Very few pathogens withstand the antibody-mediated onslaught of the humoral immune system, but HIV can. Indeed, despite the presence of high-titer HIV-reactive antibodies, sustained viremia is frequently observed over years of chronic HIV infection (Wei et al., 1995Wei X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. et al.Viral dynamics in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.Nature. 1995; 373: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (2914) Google Scholar). The primary mechanism appears to be an evolving glycan shield (Wei et al., 2003Wei X. Decker J.M. Wang S. Hui H. Kappes J.C. Wu X. Salazar-Gonzalez J.F. Salazar M.G. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. et al.Antibody neutralization and escape by HIV-1.Nature. 2003; 422: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar), which couples the typical mutational rate of a small RNA virus (Jenkins et al., 2002Jenkins G.M. Rambaut A. Pybus O.G. Holmes E.C. Rates of molecular evolution in RNA viruses: a quantitative phylogenetic analysis.J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) with an extraordinary level of N-linked glycosylation on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins (Allan et al., 1985Allan J.S. Coligan J.E. Barin F. McLane M.F. Sodroski J.G. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Lee T.H. Essex M. Major glycoprotein antigens that induce antibodies in AIDS patients are encoded by HTLV-III.Science. 1985; 228: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), gp120 and gp41, which trimerize to form the HIV-1 viral spike, the only exposed viral antigen on the virion surface (reviewed in Wyatt and Sodroski, 1998Wyatt R. Sodroski J. The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens.Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). A median of 93 N-linked glycans (95% CI = 75–105), based on 2,994 Env M-group sequences (www.hiv.lanl.gov), cloak the surface of the trimeric spike and comprise over half its mass (Leonard et al., 1990Leonard C.K. Spellman M.W. Riddle L. Harris R.J. Thomas J.N. Gregory T.J. Assignment of intrachain disulfide bonds and characterization of potential glycosylation sites of the type 1 recombinant human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10373-10382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table S1). Each N-linked glycan is encoded by a tripeptide, Asn-X-Ser/Thr, the N-glycan sequon (reviewed in Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Assembly of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar), which is recognized by oligosaccharyltransferase on nascent polypeptides as they extrude into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum to couple a fully formed Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2 precursor (2371 Da) to Asn in the N-glycan sequon (Hanover and Lennarz, 1980Hanover J.A. Lennarz W.J. N-Linked glycoprotein assembly. Evidence that oligosaccharide attachment occurs within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3600-3604PubMed Google Scholar). The Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2 precursor is trimmed by glycosidases through high mannose forms and then modified by glycosyltransferases, which assemble complex glycans in the Golgi meant for signaling and other glycobiology functions utilized by nearly all secreted or cell-surface-expressed proteins in humans (Varki, 2011Varki A. Evolutionary forces shaping the Golgi glycosylation machinery: why cell surface glycans are universal to living cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005462Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because of their ubiquitous presence, all of these forms of N-linked glycosylation—high mannose through complex—are privileged from antibody recognition through immune tolerance of the functional antibody repertoire. While antibodies can recognize non-self glycans (such as their recognition of the glycan antigens that define the human blood groups) (Stowell et al., 2008Stowell S.R. Arthur C.M. Mehta P. Slanina K.A. Blixt O. Leffler H. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Galectin-1, -2, and -3 exhibit differential recognition of sialylated glycans and blood group antigens.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10109-10123Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), if antibody recognition of a viral N-linked glycan were to result in cross-recognition of host N-linked glycans, such self-recognition results in the anergy or apoptosis of the N-glycan-reactive B cell (Wardemann et al., 2003Wardemann H. Yurasov S. Schaefer A. Young J.W. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors.Science. 2003; 301: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The upshot is that antibodies only recognize viral N-linked glycans in the context of a viral protein (a glycoprotein epitope) (Kong et al., 2013Kong L. Lee J.H. Doores K.J. Murin C.D. Julien J.P.

The ability of glycan shields to thwart the humoral response is demonstrated in part by their ubiquity—viruses as diverse as hepatitis C virus (HCV; Flaviviridae) (Helle et al., 2011Helle F.

Of these, the HIV-1 glycan shield is perhaps the most well characterized. Structural studies of the HIV-1 Env trimer or its gp120 subunit have revealed tantalizing glimpses; however, glycosylated gp120 structures lack the interprotomer interactions of the pre-fusion closed state (Diskin et al., 2013Diskin R.

Thus, despite its importance, knowledge of the glycan shield has been primarily antibody-epitope focused, with little understanding of its cumulative characteristics, organizing principles, and overall atomic-level structure. Here, we present the 3.4 Å structure of a fully glycosylated HIV-1 pre-fusion trimer from clade G and characterize the organization of glycans and clustering of oligomannose residues. Additionally, we present the 3.7 Å structures of fully glycosylated HIV-1 pre-fusion trimers from clades A and B and carried out molecular dynamics simulations and other analyses to provide insight into antibody-glycan interactions. The results reveal the HIV-1 glycan shield to comprise prominent ridges of hydrogen-bonded oligosaccharides, ordered by glycan crowding, supported by N-acetylglucosamine stems, and protruding 20 Å above the Env-protein surface; these encase the pre-fusion trimer and enable the critical closed conformation of Env to avoid recognition by most antibody. To provide a general understanding of the HIV-1 glycan shield, we sought to determine crystal structures of glycan-shielded Env trimers from diverse HIV-1 clades. The production of pre-fusion closed trimers from diverse HIV-1 strains has been an obstacle to structural and immunogenicity studies. Sanders et al., 2013Sanders R.W. Derking R. Cupo A. Julien J.P.

However, when SOSIP mutations were incorporated into other HIV-1 strains, many misfolded or formed aberrant structures, although recently, a few additional well-folded HIV-1 Env strains in the SOSIP context have been identified (de Taeye et al., 2015de Taeye S.W.

As the addition of antibody VRC01 to BaL gp160 HIV-1 virions stabilizes the pre-fusion closed state as assessed by cryo-electron tomography (Tran et al., 2012Tran E.E. Borgnia M.J. Kuybeda O.

To aid in VRC01-trimer complex formation, we designed cysteine mutations across the interface of the heavy chain of antibody VRC01 (A60CHC) and the CD4-binding site of HIV-1 gp120 (G459Cgp120) from a range of HIV-1 clades (Figure S1A) (for clarity, the molecule is added as subscript, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We succeeded in expressing covalent complexes of scFv or Fab VRC01 with SOSIP-stabilized trimers, as stable pre-fusion closed Env trimers from diverse HIV-1 strains (Figures S1B–S1J). We observed the lattice formed by antibodies PGT122 and 35O22 in the BG505 SOSIP.664 T332N trimer structure (PDB 4TVP) (Pancera et al., 2014Pancera M. Zhou T. Druz A. Georgiev I.S. Soto C. Gorman J.

Data extended to a nominal 3.4 Å resolution, and the structures were refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 21.4%/27.2% with an average of 4.8 refined saccharide units/sequon and a solvent-accessible surface area for protein versus carbohydrate of 74,915 Å2 and 73,948 Å2, respectively. (Tables S2, S3, and S4; Experimental Procedures; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Electron density was observed for all HIV-1 Env residues between 31 and 665 of strain X1193.c1, except for 3 gp120 C-terminal amino acids of the engineered R6 furin cleavage site from 508–510. All five variable loops (V1–V5) of gp120 were resolved along with the complete fusion peptide of gp41, which was partially stabilized by an interprotomer interaction with a neighboring gp41 α9 helix (Figure S2A). In terms of glycan, ultra-performance liquid chromatography confirmed the N-linked glycan to be primarily high mannose, with Man5GlcNAc2 (Man-5) constituting 31.4% of the glycan and Man-6 and Man-7 being much less predominant than Man-8 and Man-9 (Table S5). We observed electron density for 29 of the 31 N-linked glycans of X1193.c1 strain, which were distributed across the trimer protein surface (Figures 1B, S1L, and S1M). 19 of these glycans were largely exposed to the solvent space between individual trimers suspended by the PGT122 and 35O22 Fabs in the crystal lattice (Figures S1N and S1O). Three glycans showed extensive interactions with antibody, including N88 to 35O22, N276 to VRC01, and N332 to PGT122, whereas no glycans were involved in forming crystallization contacts, thereby providing a mostly unperturbed view of the HIV-1 glycan shield.Figure S2Structural Details of Three Pre-fusion HIV-1 Envs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Comparison of pre-fusion HIV-1 gp140 protein structures from clades A, B and G, showing regional differences in protein structure and structural features of HIV-1 gp41 in JR-FL and X1193.c1 structures (shown with 2Fo-Fc electron density).

(F) Representative X1193.c1 glycan Fo-Fc maps at 1 σ after protein-only simulated annealing refinement showing gp120 V1/V2 apex glycans. We observed numerous occurrences of glycans organized into discrete structural groups. For example, at the apex of the trimer where the three C-strands of V1V2 associate, glycan N160 was substantially ordered—two N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc2) and the β-mannose sugar (Manβ) projected perpendicularly 20 Å from the protein surface (Figure 1B, right insert), with oligomannose branches engaged horizontally, making direct contacts with neighboring N160 oligomanose branches and assembling into an interprotomeric oligomannose ring ∼15 Å in diameter. The N160 glycans were buttressed by V1 side chains Glu187A and Lys187B, which contacted N160 mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues, respectively. Additionally, mannose residues of the V1 glycan N188 contacted mannose residues of the N160 glycan ring. The conformation of the N160-glycan ring thus appeared to depend on the V1 sequence, its structure, and its glycosylation. The N-glycan density on the gp120 outer domain was particularly high (Figure 1B, left insert). This region contained glycans that were most clearly defined in the electron density (except for glycans bound by antibody). The structure revealed Manβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc stems to extend perpendicularly ∼20 Å from the protein surface, with oligosaccharide branches forming a lateral canopy of glycans that extended from the membrane-proximal 35O22 epitope all the way to the variable loop cover of the trimer apex. In this ridge of interconnected glycans, oligosaccharides showed extensive electron density and allowed five Man-8 and Man-9 glycans to be modeled. However, in other regions such as the glycans from gp41, only two to three sugar residues could be fitted to the electron density. In general, glycans not bound by antibody had B-factors similar to those observed for hypervariable loop residues (Figures S2B and S2C). We used the PGT122-35O22-HIV-1 trimer lattice to crystallize a fully glycosylated VRC01-complexed Env trimer from the clade B strain JR-FL, as well as a fully glycosylated Env trimer from the clade A strain BG505 (Figure S2D). Diffraction from these crystals extended to nominal resolutions of 3.7 Å, and molecular replacement and refinement led to Rwork/Rfree of 25.3%/30.9% and 26.0%/30.7% for JR-FL and BG505, respectively, with an average of 4.6 and 3.8 refined saccharide units/sequon, respectively, and protein verses carbohydrate solvent accessible-surface area values of 66,575 verses 68,502 Å2 (JR-FL) and 67,960 verses 60,640 Å2 (BG505) (Tables S2, S3, and S4). Interestingly, despite general similarity of the lattice, the crystallizing antibodies did show strain-dependent variation, such as with N137, a glycan known to be important in PGT122 recognition (Garces et al., 2014Garces F. Sok D. Kong L. McBride R. Kim H.J. Saye-Francisco K.F. Julien J.P. Hua Y. Cupo A.

N137 was disordered in JR-FL (where it is numbered residue N138), ordered in BG505, and displaced by a V1 extension in X1191.c1 (Figure S2E). Glycan compositions were high mannose, consistent with the GnTI-deficient cell line used for production, with Man-5 constituting 24.6% and 15.3% of the glycan from JR-FL and BG505 strains, respectively, and with Man-8 and Man-9 dominating over Man-7 and Man-6 (Table S5 and Figure S3A). The glycan shields of BG505 SOSIP.664 and JR-FL SOSIP.664 revealed varied organizations of glycans on the HIV-1 trimer surfaces (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2F), likely arising from differences in the positions of glycan sequons, as well as differences in Env loop lengths and amino acids near N-linked glycans. Stem structures involving Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc, however, were generally conserved and projected similarly from the protein surface (Figure 2C), with oligomannose arms forming strain-dependent organizations. Overall, each of the three glycan structures appeared to provide substantial shielding of the pre-fusion HIV-1 Env trimer (Figure 2D).Figure 2Fully Glycosylated HIV-1 Envelopes from Clades A and B at 3.7 Å Reveal Conservation and Diversity of Protein and Glycan ShieldShow full caption(A and B) HIV-1 trimers with protein in ribbon representation and glycan (BG505; blue, JR-FL; magenta) in sticks. 2Fo-Fc electron density (slate blue) is shown at 0.8 σ for glycans; assuming the average glycan is Man-7, ∼50% of the glycan mass is visualized.(C and D) Superposition of Env trimers from clades A, B, and G.

The protein structures of the clades A, B, and G Env analyzed here serve to define a conserved pre-fusion HIV-1 Env core (Figures 2E and 2F), with structural variability for both surface residues and internal residues such as the interhelical region of gp41 (Figures S2A and S2D). Comparison of the glycan order present in the three gp140 strains showed high correlation between different clades (r = 0.766–0.798) (Figure 2G). Thus, the clade A and clade B Env structures confirmed much of the ordered glycan shield observed with the clade G Env structure, and together with the clade G structure defined conserved glycan and protein core structures, as well as variable features. Analysis of the inter-sequon neighbor distances revealed glycans on the HIV-1 trimers to have average nearest inter-glycan sequon distance peaking at 12 Å, and we classified these into three categories: (I) 4–7 Å, (II) 9–18 Å, and (III) >20 Å (as measured by glycan"
https://openalex.org/W2342514051,"Wild relatives of domesticated crop species harbor multiple, diverse, disease resistance (R) genes that could be used to engineer sustainable disease control. However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5-15 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (linkage drag). Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq)-that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr22 and Sr45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other commercially relevant crops and their relatives, including, for example, pea, bean, barley, oat, rye, rice and maize."

Two groups recently reported BAC mouse models that produce RNA foci and RAN proteins but, surprisingly, do not develop the neurodegenerative or behavioral features of ALS/FTD. We now report a BAC mouse model of C9orf72 ALS/FTD that shows decreased survival, paralysis, muscle denervation, motor neuron loss, anxiety-like behavior, and cortical and hippocampal neurodegeneration. These mice express C9orf72 sense transcripts and upregulated antisense transcripts. In contrast to sense RNA foci, antisense foci preferentially accumulate in ALS/FTD-vulnerable cell populations. RAN protein accumulation increases with age and disease, and TDP-43 inclusions are found in degenerating brain regions in end-stage animals. The ALS/FTD phenotypes in our mice provide a unique tool that will facilitate developing therapies targeting pathways that prevent neurodegeneration and increase survival."
https://openalex.org/W2336641763,"Oxytocin promotes social interactions and recognition of conspecifics that rely on olfaction in most species. The circuit mechanisms through which oxytocin modifies olfactory processing are incompletely understood. Here, we observed that optogenetically induced oxytocin release enhanced olfactory exploration and same-sex recognition of adult rats. Consistent with oxytocin’s function in the anterior olfactory cortex, particularly in social cue processing, region-selective receptor deletion impaired social recognition but left odor discrimination and recognition intact outside a social context. Oxytocin transiently increased the drive of the anterior olfactory cortex projecting to olfactory bulb interneurons. Cortical top-down recruitment of interneurons dynamically enhanced the inhibitory input to olfactory bulb projection neurons and increased the signal-to-noise of their output. In summary, oxytocin generates states for optimized information extraction in an early cortical top-down network that is required for social interactions with potential implications for sensory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2342394313,"Global yields of potato and tomato crops have fallen owing to potato late blight disease, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans. Although most commercial potato varieties are susceptible to blight, many wild potato relatives show variation for resistance and are therefore a potential source of Resistance to P. infestans (Rpi) genes. Resistance breeding has exploited Rpi genes from closely related tuber-bearing potato relatives, but is laborious and slow. Here we report that the wild, diploid non-tuber-bearing Solanum americanum harbors multiple Rpi genes. We combine resistance (R) gene sequence capture (RenSeq) with single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (SMRT RenSeq) to clone Rpi-amr3i. This technology should enable de novo assembly of complete nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) genes, their regulatory elements and complex multi-NLR loci from uncharacterized germplasm. SMRT RenSeq can be applied to rapidly clone multiple R genes for engineering pathogen-resistant crops."

This tension-based model also has the potential to inform pharmacologic treatment options in cardiomyopathy patients. Inherited cardiomyopathy defines a heterogeneous group of heart muscle diseases that affects 1:500 people in the general population (McNally et al., 2013McNally E.M. Golbus J.R. Puckelwartz M.J. Genetic mutations and mechanisms in dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). There are two primary clinical phenotypes that include hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy. Morphologically, HCM is characterized by asymmetric heart growth with a reduction in ventricular chamber dimension, thickening of the interventricular septum, and diastolic dysfunction with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia (Fatkin and Graham, 2002Fatkin D. Graham R.M. Molecular mechanisms of inherited cardiomyopathies.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 945-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). By comparison, DCM is defined by an enlarged left ventricular chamber that is accompanied by a type of dilated or eccentric “hypertrophy” in which myocytes typically lengthen resulting in reduced systolic function (McNally et al., 2013McNally E.M. Golbus J.R. Puckelwartz M.J. Genetic mutations and mechanisms in dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In either case, there is no cure for these two disease states, with the only effective long-term treatment being transplantation (Tardiff et al., 2015Tardiff J.C. Carrier L. Bers D.M. Poggesi C. Ferrantini C. Coppini R. Maier L.S. Ashrafian H. Huke S. van der Velden J. Targets for therapy in sarcomeric cardiomyopathies.Cardiovasc. Res. 2015; 105: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Familial HCM and DCM arise from nearly 1,500 distinct mutations in the genes that encode for proteins of the sarcomere (McNally et al., 2013McNally E.M. Golbus J.R. Puckelwartz M.J. Genetic mutations and mechanisms in dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The sarcomere is the basic unit in muscle that generates tension and subsequent contraction through a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. In the heart, depolarization of the muscle cell membrane results in Ca2+ influx through sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels that then induces a much larger release of Ca2+ from the intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) network. This Ca2+ then binds the sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin C (cTnC) to initiate crossbridge cycling between myosin and actin, which then generates force and cellular shortening (Bers, 2002Bers D.M. Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). During relaxation, Ca2+ is transported back into the SR by the SR Ca2+ ATPase2 (SERCA2), which lowers cytosolic Ca2+, allowing for increased Ca2+ dissociation from cTnC and a reduction in crossbridge adherence and sarcomeric tension (Bers, 2002Bers D.M. Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, Gordon et al., 2000Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Sarcomeric gene mutations typically disrupt the highly tuned balance between mechanical force generation and Ca2+-cycling dynamics. For example, HCM-related mutations sensitize the myofilaments toward greater Ca2+ adherence, thereby prolonging mechanical relaxation and delaying Ca2+ reuptake into the SR. DCM-linked mutations typically desensitize the myofilaments to Ca2, requiring higher levels of free cytosolic Ca2+ for tension generation, and Ca2+ more rapidly dissociates from the sarcomere during relaxation. However, it is unknown how such mutations program a continuum of cardiac remodeling from severe hypertrophic growth with myocyte thickening to extreme dilation and cellular lengthening (Kehat and Molkentin, 2010Kehat I. Molkentin J.D. Molecular pathways underlying cardiac remodeling during pathophysiological stimulation.Circulation. 2010; 122: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, McNally et al., 2013McNally E.M. Golbus J.R. Puckelwartz M.J. Genetic mutations and mechanisms in dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A lack of such understanding makes it difficult to predict clinical outcomes of genotyped patients treated with standard-of-care medications used in the heart failure setting. Indeed, pediatric patients with familial HCM appear to do worse when treated with Ca2+ channel blockers (Ostman-Smith, 2010Ostman-Smith I. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in childhood and adolescence - strategies to prevent sudden death.Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2010; 24: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and β-adrenergic receptor blockers do not reduce adult HCM disease progression and hypertrophy (Hamada et al., 2014Hamada M.

Pharmacological treatment options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: high time for evidence.Eur. Heart J. 2012; 33: 1724-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Using an array of genetically altered mice, we systematically altered the Ca2+-tension relationship in vivo with quantifiable changes in either myofilament tension generation or Ca2+ transient kinetics to assess the ramifications on cardiac remodeling and disease. Experimental data from this approach was used to develop a mathematical index that predicts if the heart will undergo either hypertrophic or dilated cardiac growth through two signaling pathways that directly interpret the area under the tension/shortening curve. This index also predicts the type of cardiac growth associated with select pharmacotherapies in mice with simulated HCM or DCM mutations in sarcomeric proteins. Moreover, the tension index calculated from human HCM and DCM cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) accurately predicts a patient’s known clinical phenotype. It remains unclear how mutations in sarcomeric genes mediate differential heart growth typical of familial HCM and DCM. Two diametrically opposed cTnC (Tnnc1 gene) variant proteins were used that quantitatively shift Ca2+-binding and tension-producing characteristics of the myofilaments at a set amount on either side of normal to correlate with cardiac structural remodeling (Kreutziger et al., 2011Kreutziger K.L.

Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were first infected with recombinant adenovirus-encoding β-galactosidase (βgal, control for virus infection) and FLAG-epitope-tagged wild-type (WT), L48Q, or I61Q cTnC mutants. At 3 days post infection, approximately 50% of endogenous cTnC was replaced with either the FLAG-tagged WT, L48Q, or I61Q cTnC, without changes in other sarcomeric proteins like tropomyosin (Tm) or α-actinin (Figure 1A). Moreover, there was no difference in the relative expression of the cTnC variants between intact and fully permeable myocytes, suggesting that the FLAG-tagged cTnC constructs were incorporating into the sarcomeres (Figure 1A). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitating (coIP) the troponin complex with anti-cTnT demonstrated that the two FLAG-tagged mutants were each incorporated into the troponin complex at roughly the same level (Figure 1B). In myocyte contractile assays, L48Q cTnC significantly increased cellular fractional shortening in the absence of changes in Ca2+ transient amplitude (data not shown), as previously reported (Feest et al., 2014Feest E.R. Steven Korte F. Tu A.Y. Dai J. Razumova M.V. Murry C.E. Regnier M.

Acute expression of I61Q cTnC caused a modest reduction in fractional shortening with no changes in Ca2+ transient amplitude, reflecting the decreased sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca2+ (data not shown). In terms of kinetics, L48Q cTnC significantly slowed myocyte relaxation and Ca2+ decay, while I61Q cTnC accelerated both of these parameters (Figures 1C and 1D). Together, these data suggest that sarcomeric incorporation of the L48Q or I61Q cTnC variants effectively redistributes Ca2+ either onto the sarcomere to enhance tension generation (L48Q cTnC) or freely into the cytosol, thereby decreasing overall tension generation (I61Q cTnC). To understand the in vivo consequence associated with directionally adjusting myofilament Ca2+-mechanical coupling, transgenic mice (TG) were generated with cardiac-specific expression of L48Q, I61Q, or WT cTnC using a tetracycline bi-transgenic inducible system (Figure 1E). All of the constructs were tagged with a FLAG epitope to determine percent replacement with the transgene-encoded protein (Figure 1E). Previous work demonstrated that expression of an epitope-tagged cTnC is innocuous (Davis and Metzger, 2010Davis J. Metzger J.M. Combinatorial effects of double cardiomyopathy mutant alleles in rodent myocytes: a predictive cellular model of myofilament dysregulation in disease.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9140Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Replacement of the endogenous cTnC with the epitope-tagged versions was assessed by western blotting at 1 month of age (Figure 1F). Overexpression of WT, L48Q, and I61Q cTnC in mice averaged 50%, 40%, and 45% stoichiometric replacement, respectively (Figure 1F, slower migrating band is FLAG-tagged). In the absence of the tTA (tetracycline transactivator) transgene, both the L48Q and I61Q responder lines had a minor degree of leak resulting in 5%–10% replacement at baseline (Figure 1F). The inducibility feature of this bi-transgenic system was not employed given that constitutive expression of cTnC WT and the two variants did not reduce birth rates of the mice. Using data from these cTnC-expressing TG mice, we refined an existing computational model of myocyte contraction to simulate Ca2+ transients and tension dynamics (Negroni and Lascano, 2008Negroni J.A. Lascano E.C. Simulation of steady state and transient cardiac muscle response experiments with a Huxley-based contraction model.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 300-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These simulations predicted that L48Q prolongs the time a myocyte experiences elevated tension with a set amount of Ca2+, as well as slowed relaxation, while I61Q reduced tension and hastened relaxation for the same amount of Ca2+ (Figures 1G and 1H). Relative to WT, the L48Q Ca2+ transient also had slower decay kinetics, while the I61Q variant invoked a greater transient with a shortened decay time (Figure 1H). A linear regression analysis was used to assess how accurately values from the Ca2+- and myocyte-shortening simulations predicted actual values from the cTnC variants, and in both cases, the R2 values were significant and >0.6, suggesting a strong correlation (Figures S1A–S1D). Together, these simulations suggested a highly integrated relationship between changes in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and tension production with reflexive changes in the Ca2+ transient to maintain a contractile set-point. Cardiac myocytes isolated from L48Q mice had increased fractional shortening despite smaller Ca2+ amplitudes compared with control myocytes, confirming that this mutation enhances myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (Figures 2A and 2B ). L48Q myocytes also had significantly slower relaxation and rate of Ca2+ transient decay in comparison to the tTA and WT cTnC controls (Figures 2C and 2D). Despite prolonged relaxation, L48Q TG mice had hyperfunctional hearts (Figure 2E) with no change in cardiac growth or chamber dimensions up to 1 year of age (Figures 2F–2I). There are other examples of TG and knockin mouse models of HCM that fail to phenocopy the asymmetric hypertrophic thickening of the myocardium observed in HCM patients, including independently generated L48Q TG mice (Shettigar et al., 2016Shettigar V.

Res. 2002; 91: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the effects of L48Q cTnC are masked by the high contractile state and heart rate of the mouse, with accelerated diastolic function through increase of Ca2+ reuptake by SERCA2 and desensitization of the sarcomere to Ca2+ by phosphorylating the amino terminal serine residues (23/24) on cTnI (Metzger and Westfall, 2004Metzger J.M.

Res. 2004; 94: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We reasoned that tempering the adrenergic state of the mouse with chronic delivery of the β-receptor antagonist metoprolol might unmask the effects of L48Q cTnC in vivo. While 3 months of metoprolol treatment in L48Q TG mice had no effect on systolic performance (Figure 2J), these mice now developed significant heart remodeling in which both the left ventricular (LV) chamber dimension, septal wall thickness, and cardiac mass became significantly larger (Figures 2K–2N). In contrast, metoprolol delivery to tTA control mice had negligible effects on ventricular performance or cardiac remodeling (Figure 2J–2N). Because the effects of metoprolol were unexpected, we repeated this entire experimental paradigm using adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 6 to overexpress either WT cTnC or L48Q cTnC in mice for the first time at 8 weeks of age (each was FLAG-tagged). Infected mice were then given metoprolol-treated water for 1 month. This in-vivo-gene-transfer strategy produced 50%–60% and 40%–50% replacement of native cTnC with WT cTnC and L48Q cTnC, respectively (Figure S2A). Similar to results in the TG mice, the acutely infected L48Q mice developed a significant increase in septal and posterior wall thickness, as well as increased ventricular mass with metoprolol administration, while WT AAV-cTnC expressing mice showed no effect (Figures S2B–S2D). Consistent with this profile, acute metoprolol treatment further slowed L48Q cellular relaxation time and Ca2+ re-uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes, an effect that was also seen in tTA control myocytes, albeit to a lesser extent (Figures 2O and 2P). To further examine this effect observed with β-blockers, a cohort of AAV-infected WT cTnC and L48Q mice were also chronically treated with the sinoatrial-node antagonist ivabradine (10 mg/kg/day) to decrease chronotropy and increase the time in diastole. Similar to the effects of β-blockers, ivabradine treatment caused a mild hypertrophic growth of the septal and posterior walls and an increased cardiac mass in L48Q-infected mice, but not in WT cTnC infected mice (Figures S2E–S2G). Together, these data suggest that prolonging mechanical tension initiates growth signaling, which in the mouse is compensated by an increase in contractile drive. The converse experiments were also performed, in which the high cardiac contractile set-point of the mouse was mimicked in isolated myocytes by applying the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. As expected, isoproterenol corrected the slowed relaxation and Ca2+ decay times in L48Q myocytes to vehicle-treated tTA values (Figures 2O and 2P). To corroborate these data, the Ca2+-binding affinity of cTnC and L48Q cTnC were examined in the presence of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated cTnI using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Phosphorylated cTnI caused a decreased Ca2+-binding affinity of both WT cTnC and L48Q cTnC, as indicated by the rightward shift in binding fluorescence for a given Ca2+ concentration (pCa, Figure 2Q). Similar to the cell-shortening assay, phosphorylated cTnI normalized L48Q-cTnC-Ca2+-binding affinity back to WT with non-phosphorylated cTnI levels (Figure 2Q). L48Q mice were also subjected to 2 weeks of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce pressure overload on the heart, which increased ventricular fractional shortening in control mice but had little effect on L48Q mutant mice that were already hyperfunctional (Figure 2R). While pressure overload induced hypertrophy in tTA control mice, it produced significantly greater hypertrophy in L48Q mice (Figures 2S and 2T), suggesting that greater Ca2+ binding to the sarcomeric regulatory proteins predisposes the heart to the hypertrophic growth response, which likely occurs by further increasing the net tension of the myofilaments. The I61Q TG mouse has decreased Ca2+-myofilament-binding affinity (Kreutziger et al., 2011Kreutziger K.L. Piroddi N. McMichael J.T. Tesi C. Poggesi C. Regnier M. Calcium binding kinetics of troponin C strongly modulate cooperative activation and tension kinetics in cardiac muscle.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2011; 50: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thereby recapitulating what might happen in familial DCM. I61Q TG mice have reduced myocyte shortening despite a compensatory increase in the Ca2+-transient amplitude when compared with tTA control myocytes (Figures 3A and 3B ). I61Q mutant myocytes also show faster relaxation times and Ca2+ decay kinetics compared to tTA myocytes (Figures 3C and 3D). At baseline, myocytes from I61Q TG mice have significantly elongated sarcomeres compared to tTA controls (Figure 3E), which is consistent with a general decrease in thin filament activation, despite increased diastolic Ca2+ concentration (Figure 3F). In vivo, I61Q cTnC TG mice showed reduced cardiac function (Figures 3G and 3H) and a dilated phenotype characterized by increased diastolic LV chamber dimension and decreased septal wall thickness compared to age-matched tTA littermates (Figures 3I–3K). Hearts harvested from I61Q mice also had increased cardiac mass (Figure 3L) and increased myocyte length-to-width ratios, suggestive of dilated eccentric growth remodeling (Figures 3M and 3N). These mice also have early mortality, in which a substantial fraction of the cohort died by 4 months of age with no mouse surviving beyond 8 months (Figure 3O). Due to the early mortality of these mice, all of the aforementioned measurements were made at 6–8 weeks of age. Since the I61Q mutation reduces myofilament tension, we reasoned that a competing sarcomeric mutation that increased myofilament tension might nullify the disease effect. Hence, we employed a well-characterized mouse model of HCM, which is due to a mutation in Myh6 at position 403 (R403Q) that promotes more time in a force-generating state with prolonged relaxation (Geisterfer-Lowrance et al., 1996Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Christe M. Conner D.A. Ingwall J.S. Schoen F.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Science. 1996; 272: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). I61Q TG offspring heterozygous for the R403Q mutation showed significantly improved fractional shortening, reduced left ventricle chamber dilation, and normalization of septal thickness, but no change in LV wall thickness (Figures 4A–4D ). Remarkably, I61Q-R403Q+/− mice showed a 40% reduction in overall heart growth when compared to the I61Q TG mice alone (Figures 4E and 4G). The presence of R403Q mutant Myh6 allele also prolonged the survival of I61Q mice, collectively demonstrating that enhancing the tension-producing qualities of the myofilaments in “trans” could partially compensate for less cTnC Ca2+ binding (Figure 4F). The correction of I61Q-dependent dilated heart growth with the R403Q mutant myosin allele suggests that the myocyte changes its growth characteristics by sensing deviations in the time and magnitude of tension generated at a given cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. To examine this hypothesis, we computationally simulated the twitch force and Ca2+ transient for myocytes that have rapid Ca2+ dissociation from the sarcomere due to the combined effects of I61Q cTnC and enhanced SR Ca2+ reuptake. Biologically, this can be achieved by increasing the Ca2+-binding affinity of SERCA2 through the loss of its regulatory protein, phospholamban (Pln gene). Our model predicts that such an increase in SERCA2 activity would reduce the time for tension generation (Figure 5A , I61Q-Pln−/−) due to the rapid re-uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ in I61Q cTnC mice (Figure S3A), thus producing even greater dilated hypertrophic growth. In the context of L48Q cTnC, this same enhancement in SERCA2 activity, due to loss of phospholamban, is predicted to reduce tension time and hasten the Ca2+ transient decay, thereby correcting the tension-Ca2+ transients toward tTA WT values (Figures 5B and S3B).Figure S3Computationally and Experimentally Derived Twitches and Ca2+ Transients with Altered Ca2+ Cycling on the I61Q and L48Q Backgrounds, Related to Figures 5A–5GShow full caption(A and B) (A) Computationally derived Ca2+ transients over time of a single contraction in simulated myocytes expressing tTA (black), I61Q (pink), and I61Q-Pln−/− (dashed pink), and (B) tTA (black), L48Q (pink), and L48Q-Pln−/− (dashed pink).(C and D) (C) Mean twitch shortening and (D) a Ca2+ transient measured in isolated mouse myocytes from tTA (black), I61Q (peach) and I61Q-Pln−/− (pink) littermates.

To experimentally verify the model’s predictions, I61Q and L48Q TG mice were crossed with Pln−/− mice. Loss of phospholamban had no cardiac growth effect on the benign phenotype of L48Q mice, with respect to LV chamber size, septal thickness, or overall heart weight (Figures 5C–5E). However, loss of phospholamban did cause greater cardiac hypertrophy with increased septal thickness and overall heart weight in I61Q TG mice as predicted (Figures 5C–5E). Contractile measurements made in myocytes isolated from I61Q-Pln−/− mice showed faster mechanical relaxation and Ca2+ transient decay times compared to I61Q myocytes, as predicted with our computational simulations (Figures S3C and S3D). Hence, loss of Pln−/− in I61Q mice further accelerated Ca2+ transient decay, thereby exacerbating the tension deficits in an already tension-poor genetic background, which correlated with greater disease and remodeling. Using an opposing approach, we simulated the effects of decreasing SERCA2 pump function in the context of I61Q and L48Q cTnC mutant phenotypes, which was compared to data in Atp2a2 (SERCA2a) heterozygous mice. Here, the model predicts that increasing the time of free cytosolic Ca2+ due to reduced activity of SERCA2, in the presence of the I61Q mutation, would augment the time-force development relationship, thereby partially protecting from dilated growth in I61Q mice (Figures 5F and S3F). In contrast, decreasing SERCA2 activity in the presence of L48Q cTnC more than doubled the area under the tension curve and Ca2+ transient, slowing mechanical and Ca2+ decay, in comparison to simulations run with just L48Q (Figure 5G and S3G). Indeed, experimental data from I61Q-Atp2a2+/− mice showed significantly reduced ventricular chamber dilation, although without a change in LV wall or septal thicknesses or heart weights (Figures 5H–5K). The lack of a decrease in absolute heart weight appears to be due to a shift in the cardiac growth profile from a dilated program to more of a concentric hypertrophic program. In comparison, reduction in SERCA2 activity in the L48Q cTnC TG background produced a thickening hypertrophic response for the first time, as measured by LV wall and septal thicknesses and greater overall heart weights without a change in LV chamber size (Figures 5H–5K). Together with the data observed in Pln−/− mice, the overall results suggest that altered myofilament Ca2+-binding properties are directly linked to SR Ca2+ fluxing and total free cytosolic Ca2+ within the cardiomyocyte, as suggested by a previously proposed disease-sensing mechanism (Fatkin et al., 2000Fatkin D.

Changes in striatal processing, particularly in the NAc, are thought to be necessary for the maintenance of addictive behaviors, and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse leads to predictable changes in synaptic strength in the NAc (Lüscher and Malenka, 2011Lüscher C.

However, repeated cocaine treatment in vivo (5 days of noncontingent administration) results in an initial decrease in the AMPA/NMDA ratio on MSNs in the NAc, as measured 24 hr after the last cocaine injection (Kourrich et al., 2007Kourrich S.

A period of abstinence results in a gradual elevation of AMPA/NMDA ratios and AMPAR surface expression (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005Boudreau A.C. Wolf M.E.

Self-administration of cocaine also causes similar changes in the NAc, with cocaine exposure causing a loss of AMPA receptors and depressing synaptic strength on MSNs and extended abstinence resulting in synaptic strengthening and accumulation of surface AMPA receptors (Conrad et al., 2008Conrad K.L.

This bidirectional plasticity suggests that other factors, in addition to dopamine, contribute to the synaptic changes induced by drug exposure. Recently, we have shown that TNF-α drives internalization of AMPARs on MSNs, reducing corticostriatal synaptic strength, and reduces the aberrant changes in striatal circuit function induced by chronic blockade of D2 dopamine receptors (Lewitus et al., 2014Lewitus G.M. Pribiag H. Duseja R. St-Hilaire M. Stellwagen D. An adaptive role of TNFα in the regulation of striatal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 6146-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Glia are the main source of TNF-α in the CNS, and both microglia (Sekine et al., 2008Sekine Y. Ouchi Y. Sugihara G. Takei N. Yoshikawa E. Nakamura K. Iwata Y. Tsuchiya K.J. Suda S. Suzuki K. et al.Methamphetamine causes microglial activation in the brains of human abusers.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5756-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and astrocytes (Bowers and Kalivas, 2003Bowers M.S. Kalivas P.W. Forebrain astroglial plasticity is induced following withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) are activated by psychostimulants. Further, glia have been suggested to regulate drug-induced behavior (Miguel-Hidalgo, 2009Miguel-Hidalgo J.J. The role of glial cells in drug abuse.Curr. Drug Abuse Rev. 2009; 2: 72-82Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, glia through the release of TNF-α could have a mitigating effect on the circuit changes induced by cocaine. Here we demonstrate that striatal microglia are activated by cocaine, and moderate the synaptic and behavioral changes induced by the repeated administration of cocaine. To determine the effect of in vivo cocaine exposure on TNF-α levels in the NAc, we measured TNF-α mRNA and protein levels in mice after i.p. injections of saline or cocaine. A single injection of cocaine had no effect on TNF-α levels (measured 24 hr postinjection), but 5 days of daily cocaine treatment (measured 24 hr after the final injection) increased both TNF-α mRNA and protein, compared to saline injected controls (Figures 1A–1D). TNF-α was no longer elevated following 10 days of abstinence from cocaine. To understand the impact of TNF-α on synaptic function in the NAc, we measured AMPA/NMDA ratios on MSNs in the NAc core. Alteration in NAc core AMPA receptors is involved in the expression of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants (Kalivas, 2009Kalivas P.W. The glutamate homeostasis hypothesis of addiction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TNF-α drives internalization of AMPARs on MSNs in the dorsal striatum (Lewitus et al., 2014Lewitus G.M. Pribiag H. Duseja R. St-Hilaire M. Stellwagen D. An adaptive role of TNFα in the regulation of striatal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 6146-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As repeated cocaine administration primarily affects direct-pathway MSNs, we tested specific subpopulations of MSNs in the NAc core for their response to TNF-α. Acute NAc slices were incubated with TNF-α and whole-cell recording made from Drd1a-td Tomato (D1) positive and negative (D2) MSNs. A low dose of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) had no significant effect on either cell type. However, 100 ng/ml TNF-α significantly reduced the AMPA/NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs, with a nonsignificant reduction in ratios on D2-MSNs (Figure 1E). These results suggest that D1-MSNs are more sensitive to TNF-α than D2-MSNs, although D2-MSNs may respond to a lesser degree. Repeated noncontingent administration of cocaine results in lower AMPA/NMDA ratios of excitatory inputs onto the NAc specifically on D1-MSNs (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Park B.H. Lee J.H. Park S.K. Kim J.H. Cell type-specific alterations in the nucleus accumbens by repeated exposures to cocaine.Biol. Psychiatry. 2011; 69: 1026-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Pascoli et al., 2012Pascoli V. Turiault M. Lüscher C. Reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic potentiation resets drug-induced adaptive behaviour.Nature. 2012; 481: 71-75Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To test whether this decrease in AMPA/NMDA ratios is due to increased TNF-α expression, we evaluated AMPA/NMDA ratios in the NAc core after cocaine or saline administration in WT and TNF-α−/− mice. As expected for WT mice, a single injection of cocaine did not significantly reduce AMPA/NMDA ratios on D1-MSNs as measured 1 day later, but five daily cocaine injections did (Figure 1F). Strikingly, in TNF-α−/− mice, a single injection of cocaine significantly increased AMPA/NMDA ratios, which remained elevated after 5 days of cocaine treatment (Figure 1F). No significant differences were observed in D2-MSNs for either genotype (see Figure S1A available online). These results suggest that the reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratios in D1-MSNs after repeated cocaine is due to increased TNF-α in the NAc, and that cocaine itself increases synaptic strength. This is consistent with the exocytosis of AMPARs observed with direct stimulation of D1Rs on MSNs (Mangiavacchi and Wolf, 2004Mangiavacchi S. Wolf M.E. D1 dopamine receptor stimulation increases the rate of AMPA receptor insertion onto the surface of cultured nucleus accumbens neurons through a pathway dependent on protein kinase A.J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, this result suggests that, following cocaine treatment, D1-MSNs are more responsive to lower endogenous levels of TNF-α, perhaps because newly inserted AMPARs are more labile, as has been seen at potentiated synapses in the amygdala (Clem and Huganir, 2010Clem R.L. Huganir R.L. Calcium-permeable AMPA receptor dynamics mediate fear memory erasure.Science. 2010; 330: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that potentiated D1-MSNs are more sensitive to TNF-α, we treated TNF-α −/− mice with a single injection of cocaine and evaluated the effect of a low level of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) on AMPA/NMDA ratios. Although this level of TNF-α had no significant effect on MSNs from WT untreated animals (Figure 1E), it significantly reduced AMPA/NMDA ratios on D1-MSNs from cocaine treated knockout animals (Figure 1G). This treatment had no effect on D2-MSNs (Figure S1B). To test whether cocaine-induced TNF-α signaling occludes further synaptic depression by TNF-α, we treated WT animals with cocaine for 5 days and then treated striatal slices ex vivo with TNF-α (100 ng/ml). The AMPA/NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs (already reduced compared to saline treated animals; Figure 1E) was not further reduced by treatment with TNF-α (Figure 1G). This shows that the synaptic depression induced by repeated cocaine injections occludes the TNF-α-mediated reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratio. Overall, these data suggest that repeated cocaine treatment elevates TNF-α, which suppresses the synaptic changes directly induced by cocaine in the NAc core. Depressing synaptic strength in the NAc can reduce behavioral sensitization to cocaine (Pascoli et al., 2012Pascoli V. Turiault M. Lüscher C. Reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic potentiation resets drug-induced adaptive behaviour.Nature. 2012; 481: 71-75Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Behavioral sensitization is a simple model of drug-induced behavioral change, which measures the progressive increase in locomotor response to psychostimulants. TNF-α−/− mice displayed an increased initial locomotor response to cocaine and increased sensitization, compared to WT mice (Figure 1H). This is similar to what has been observed with methamphetamine sensitization in TNF-α−/− mice (Nakajima et al., 2004Nakajima A. Yamada K. Nagai T. Uchiyama T. Miyamoto Y. Mamiya T. He J. Nitta A. Mizuno M. Tran M.H. et al.Role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in methamphetamine-induced drug dependence and neurotoxicity.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To exclude compensatory mechanisms resulting from the absence of TNF-α during development, we pharmacologically blocked the soluble form of TNF-α in WT mice using XENP1595 (a dominant-negative variant of TNF-α [DN-TNF]). WT mice were administered DN-TNF either during the 5 days of conditioning (to block TNF-α signaling during acquisition) or during the abstinence period starting immediately after the last cocaine injection (to test the role of TNF-α in the maintenance of the behavior). Blocking TNF-α signaling during acquisition was sufficient to increase sensitization as well as maintain the elevated response on the challenge day, while blocking TNF-α signaling during the 10 day period of abstinence had no effect on the response to the challenge dose (Figure 1I). These results suggest that TNF-α is active during acquisition but not during drug abstinence, consistent with the increased TNF-α expression observed during that period (Figures 1C and 1D). Further, the increased sensitivity observed in TNF-α−/− mice on the first day of cocaine is not due to an acute loss of TNF-α signaling and is likely to be unrelated to the increase in sensitization. In other brain regions, TNF-α that regulates synaptic function is produced by glia (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). To assess the source of TNF-α regulating sensitization, we utilized a Cre-loxP system to selectively delete TNF-α from microglia (CX3CR1-Cre; Figure S2A) and astrocytes (GFAP-Cre; Figure S2B). Mice that lack microglial TNF-α showed significantly higher sensitization to cocaine from the second cocaine injection that was maintained through the period of abstinence (Figure 2A). Conversely, mice that lack astrocytic TNF-α did not display a significant change in sensitization compared with littermate controls (Figure 2B). These results suggest that microglia are important for the adaptive TNF-α response to repeated cocaine administration. To verify this, we isolated microglia from the striatum of cocaine and saline treated animals by magnetic bead sorting (Figure S2C) and compared TNF-α mRNA in the microglial and nonmicroglial fractions. Microglia contained the vast majority of TNF-α mRNA, showing over a 20-fold enrichment compared with the other striatal cell types (Figure 2C). Further, the TNF-α mRNA was increased by cocaine treatment specifically in microglia cells (Figure 2D) and not in other cell types (Figure S2D). Resting microglia continuously survey the healthy brain and respond to a variety of activation signals by undergoing progressive morphological and functional changes (Kettenmann et al., 2011Kettenmann H. Hanisch U.K. Noda M. Verkhratsky A. Physiology of microglia.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 461-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). Using Iba1, we labeled microglia in adult mice 24 hr after a single cocaine injection, 24 hr after 5 days of daily cocaine injections, or after 10 days of drug abstinence. Although the number of microglia in the NAc did not change at any time point (Figure S2E), Iba1 intensity was increased in microglia by 5 days of cocaine, and after a period of abstinence (Figures 2E and 2F). Microglia cell body size was increased by 5 days of cocaine (Figure 2G), accompanied by a decrease in process length (Figures 2H and 2I). These changes in microglia morphology are consistent with an activated phenotype. In contrast, we did not observe any activation of astrocytes, as judged by the area or intensity of GFAP expression (Figures S2F and S2G). These data strongly suggest that microglia are the source of the cocaine-induced upregulation of TNF-α production in the striatum observed during sensitization. Cocaine could activate microglia directly by binding the sigma receptor (Navarro et al., 2010Navarro G. Moreno E. Aymerich M. Marcellino D. McCormick P.J. Mallol J. Cortés A. Casadó V. Canela E.I. Ortiz J. et al.Direct involvement of sigma-1 receptors in the dopamine D1 receptor-mediated effects of cocaine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 18676-18681Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Northcutt et al., 2015Northcutt A.L. Hutchinson M.R. Wang X. Baratta M.V. Hiranita T. Cochran T.A. Pomrenze M.B. Galer E.L. Kopajtic T.A. Li C.M. et al.DAT isn’t all that: cocaine reward and reinforcement require Toll-like receptor 4 signaling.Mol. Psychiatry. 2015; 20: 1525-1537Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), or indirectly through the elevation of dopamine. To test this, we treated microglia cultures with dopamine or cocaine for 3 hr. Treatment of microglia with 0.1 μM dopamine, but not 1 μM cocaine, significantly increased TNF-α mRNA (Figures 3A and 3B ). This concentration of dopamine is reflective of the concentration found in the NAc in vivo following cocaine administration in rats (Hooks et al., 1992Hooks M.S. Colvin A.C. Juncos J.L. Justice Jr., J.B. Individual differences in basal and cocaine-stimulated extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens using quantitative microdialysis.Brain Res. 1992; 587: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The same treatment applied to cultured astrocytes had no effect on TNF-α mRNA (Figure S3A). Multiple dopamine receptors are expressed on microglia (Kettenmann et al., 2011Kettenmann H. Hanisch U.K. Noda M. Verkhratsky A. Physiology of microglia.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 461-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). Stimulating microglia with the D2-like agonist quinpirole increased TNF-α mRNA, while the D1 agonist SKF-38393 and specific D3 agonist pramipexole had no effect (Figure 3C). This suggests that dopamine increases TNF-α production in microglia through D2 receptors. Microglia transcriptional profiles change substantially during both development and the culturing process (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O. Jedrychowski M.P. Moore C.S. Cialic R. Lanser A.J. Gabriely G. Koeglsperger T. Dake B. Wu P.M. Doykan C.E. et al.Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). We therefore cultured microglia from adult animals, in a manner that preserves an in vivo transcriptional profile (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O. Jedrychowski M.P. Moore C.S. Cialic R. Lanser A.J. Gabriely G. Koeglsperger T. Dake B. Wu P.M. Doykan C.E. et al.Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). We saw a similar response to dopamine and lack of response to cocaine (Figures S3B and S3C). To directly test the response of microglia in vivo, we treated mice with quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.; 24 and 1 hr prior to harvest) and isolated microglia. Quinpirole treatment increased the TNF-α mRNA in striatal microglia cells (Figure 3D), but not in other striatal cell types (Figure S3D), nor in cortical microglia (Figure S3E), indicating that D2-agonism specifically increases microglial TNF-α in the striatum in vivo. Coadministrating cocaine with the D2 antagonist L741,626 for 5 days reduced the cocaine-induced increase in microglial TNF-α production (Figure 3E). Finally, to verify that D2-like receptor activation was required for the TNF-α-dependent decrease in AMPA/NMDA ratio observed on D1-MSNs, we treated animals for 5 days with cocaine and the D2 antagonist. Blocking D2 receptors (and thus preventing the activation of microglia) resulted in a large cocaine-induced increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio on D1-MSNs, similar to TNF-α−/− animals (Figure 3F). Overall, this suggests that cocaine elevates dopamine levels, which act on D1 receptors on direct pathway MSNs to increase synaptic strength; simultaneously activates microglia through D2 receptors; and temporarily increases TNF-α production. Our data suggest that the activation of microglia limits the cocaine-induced changes to NAc circuitry, but this activation occurs only during a narrow window following cocaine exposure. Because depotentiation of MSNs reduces cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization (Pascoli et al., 2012Pascoli V. Turiault M. Lüscher C. Reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic potentiation resets drug-induced adaptive behaviour.Nature. 2012; 481: 71-75Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we tested if reactivation of microglia to increase TNF-α could depress NAc synapses and suppress sensitization. To do this, we utilized monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a detoxified variant of LPS (Casella and Mitchell, 2008Casella C.R. Mitchell T.C. Putting endotoxin to work for us: monophosphoryl lipid A as a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3231-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). MPLA is a weak TLR4 agonist that does not induce extensive neuroinflammation or sickness behavior (Michaud et al., 2013Michaud J.P. Hallé M. Lampron A. Thériault P. Préfontaine P. Filali M. Tribout-Jover P. Lanteigne A.M. Jodoin R. Cluff C. et al.Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation with the detoxified ligand monophosphoryl lipid A improves Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We first verified that MPLA activates microglia in the NAc, by injecting 10 μg MPLA IP after 10 days of abstinence from cocaine. MPLA treatment significantly increased Iba1 intensity within 4 hr compared to saline treated controls (Figure 4A) and was associated with an increase in striatal TNF-α expression, at both 4 and 24 hr after injection (Figure 4B). We next tested if MPLA would depress synaptic strength in the NAc core. After 10 days of abstinence from cocaine, mice were injected with MPLA and evaluated 24 hr later for AMPA/NMDA ratios on D1-MSNs. MPLA treatment significantly reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio in D1-MSNs compared to saline-treated controls (Figure 4C). Because artificially reducing synaptic strength in the NAc can reduce behavioral sensitization (Pascoli et al., 2012Pascoli V. Turiault M. Lüscher C. Reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic potentiation resets drug-induced adaptive behaviour.Nature. 2012; 481: 71-75Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar), these data suggest that MPLA might suppress drug-induced behaviors. We first established that MPLA does not alter basal locomotion (Figure S4A). Further, MPLA (10 μg; 24 hr prior to testing) did not decrease the locomotor response to an initial dose of cocaine, as tested in saline-treated animals given an initial dose of cocaine at the challenge time point (Figure 4D). We then tested sensitized mice by injecting 10 μg or 50 μg MPLA or saline, 24 hr prior to the challenge dose of cocaine. Mice treated with MPLA had significantly reduced locomotor response to the cocaine challenge in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4E). This suggests that MPLA reduces sensitization, rather than the locomotor response to cocaine. The effects of MPLA also did not appear to be due to an increase in sensitivity to cocaine, as we observed no increase in stereotypic behaviors in MPLA treated mice (Figures S4B–S4D). Moreover, MPLA had no effect on sensitization in TNF-α−/− mice (Figure 4F), which suggests that MPLA acts through an elevation of TNF-α and not other cytokines. However, this effect is temporary, as MPLA had little impact on sensitization when tested 4 days after injection (Figure S4E). These observations suggest that even after a prolonged period of abstinence from cocaine, increasing TNF-α can be effective in reducing the behavioral response to cocaine, although it does not revert the system to the presensitized state. Chronic cocaine administration produces long-erm neuroadaptions of glutamatergic signaling in the NAc that contribute to addiction-related changes in drug sensitivity and craving. Here we show that microglia in the NAc are transiently activated following cocaine administration, and act to downregulate AMPARs on MSNs through TNF-α signaling. Importantly, this limits the development of behavioral sensitization. Following a period of abstinence, MPLA can reactivate microglia and decrease both synaptic strength in the NAc and locomotor sensitization to cocaine. Our results suggest that microglia have an adaptive role in the response to cocaine and that their modulation could be an effective avenue of treatment. Alterations in the NAc core may be particularly important for the expression of locomotor sensitization (Kalivas, 2009Kalivas P.W. The glutamate homeostasis hypothesis of addiction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Infusion of AMPA into the NAc core enhances locomotion in animals that were exposed to cocaine 2–3 weeks earlier (Bell and Kalivas, 1996Bell K. Kalivas P.W. Context-specific cross-sensitization between systemic cocaine and intra-accumbens AMPA infusion in the rat.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1996; 127: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), while AMPAR antagonists administered into the NAc core prevent the expression of sensitization (Bell et al., 2000Bell K. Duffy P. Kalivas P.W. Context-specific enhancement of glutamate transmission by cocaine.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Pierce et al., 1996Pierce R.C. Bell K. Duffy P. Kalivas P.W. Repeated cocaine augments excitatory amino acid transmission in the nucleus accumbens only in rats having developed behavioral sensitization.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1550-1560PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in NAc synaptic strength has been hypothesized to correlate with the development of craving (Conrad et al., 2008Conrad K.L. Tseng K.Y. Uejima J.L. Reimers J.M. Heng L.J. Shaham Y. Marinelli M. Wolf M.E. Formation of accumbens GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors mediates incubation of cocaine craving.Nature. 2008; 454: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), and reducing synaptic strength reduces cue-induced self-administration (Wisor et al., 2011Wisor J.P. Schmidt M.A. Clegern W.C. Cerebral microglia mediate sleep/wake and neuroinflammatory effects of methamphetamine.Brain Behav. Immun. 2011; 25: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that increasing TNF-α with mild TLR4 activation may help blunt craving or incentive sensitization. Further, our results explain a perplexing feature of chronic cocaine administration—that synaptic strength on D1-MSNs decreases initially and then slowly increases during withdrawal. While the formation and subsequent unsilencing of silent synapses likely contribute (Huang et al., 2009Huang Y.H. Lin Y. Mu P. Lee B.R. Brown T.E. Wayman G. Marie H. Liu W. Yan Z. Sorg B.A. et al.In vivo cocaine experience generates silent synapses.Neuron. 2009; 63: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to the changes in AMPA/NMDA ratios, our results suggest an additional mechanism is involved. Our data support the idea that dopamine does, as predicted by in vitro results, increase AMPA/NMDA ratios while simultaneously activating microglia to release TNF-α. This TNF-α release causes the decreased AMPA/NMDA ratios observed following repeated administration of cocaine. This suppression is temporary, as microglia slowly deactivate during abstinence from cocaine, revealing the underlying dopamine-induced potentiation. A challenge dose would reactivate the microglia, increase TNF-α release, and again suppress AMPA/NMDA ratios as observed (Boudreau et al., 2007Boudreau A.C. Reimers J.M. Milovanovic M. Wolf M.E. Cell surface AMPA receptors in the rat nucleus accumbens increase during cocaine withdrawal but internalize after cocaine challenge in association with altered activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10621-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, Thomas et al., 2001Thomas M.J. Beurrier C. Bonci A. Malenka R.C. Long-term depression in the nucleus accumbens: a neural correlate of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that TNF-α has an adaptive role in regulating glutamatergic transmission in the NAc when circuit homeostasis is perturbed, akin to the role of TNF-α in homeostatic synaptic plasticity (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data suggest that microglia are adaptive regulators of striatal function. This is to suggest not that astrocytes do not regulate striatal function, including the response to drugs, but merely that astrocytes do not supply the TNF-α that opposes the circuit and behavioral changes induced by cocaine. CX3CR1 is expressed in other cell types (including macrophages and a small number of neurons), and a TLR4 agonist like MPLA will act on astrocytes and other cell types. Therefore we cannot exclude the contribution of other cell types to the TNF-α response, but it is difficult to argue that microglia are not the major source of the response. Microglia express a variety of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and immune receptors and have the capacity to rapidly respond to physiological changes in the brain (Kettenmann et al., 2011Kettenmann H. Hanisch U.K. Noda M. Verkhratsky A. Physiology of microglia.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 461-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). Our results support the idea that moderate microglia activation has a role in a homeostatic-type response to significant deviations from the basal state (Kierdorf and Prinz, 2013Kierdorf K. Prinz M. Factors regulating microglia activation.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and has a similar beneficial response in re-establishing homeostasis following stress (Kreisel et al., 2014Kreisel T. Frank M.G. Licht T. Reshef R. Ben-Menachem-Zidon O. Baratta M.V. Maier S.F. Yirmiya R. Dynamic microglial alterations underlie stress-induced depressive-like behavior and suppressed neurogenesis.Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Hence, augmenting the microglial response, through TLR4 or other means, might be a useful approach to treat addiction, provided it only moderately activates the microglia. MPLA, a weak TLR4 agonist, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive function in a mouse model of neurodegeneration (Michaud et al., 2013Michaud J.P. Hallé M. Lampron A. Thériault P. Préfontaine P. Filali M. Tribout-Jover P. Lanteigne A.M. Jodoin R. Cluff C. et al.Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation with the detoxified ligand monophosphoryl lipid A improves Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We found that MPLA can acutely reduce behavioral sensitization after prolonged abstinence from cocaine. If MPLA is found to similarly diminish reinstatement, it would suggest that MPLA could reduce the motivation to acquire drugs and be used to prevent relapse, a significant problem in the treatment of addiction.

Distortions of the gut microbiota have been found to correlate with fatal diseases in preterm infants, however, developmental patterns of gut microbiome and factors affecting the colonization progress in preterm infants remain unclear. The purpose of this prospective longitudinal study was to explore day-to-day gut microbiome patterns in preterm infants during their first 30 days of life in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and investigate potential factors related to the development of the infant gut microbiome. A total of 378 stool samples were collected daily from 29 stable/healthy preterm infants. DNA extracted from stool was used to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene region for community analysis. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and α-diversity of the community were determined using QIIME software. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, accounting for 54.3% of the total reads. Result showed shift patterns of increasing Clostridium and Bacteroides, and decreasing Staphylococcus and Haemophilus over time during early life. Alpha-diversity significantly increased daily in preterm infants after birth and linear mixed-effects models showed that postnatal days, feeding types and gender were associated with the α-diversity, p< 0.05-0.01. Male infants were found to begin with a low α-diversity, whereas females tended to have a higher diversity shortly after birth. Female infants were more likely to have higher abundance of Clostridiates, and lower abundance of Enterobacteriales than males during early life. Infants fed mother's own breastmilk (MBM) had a higher diversity of gut microbiome and significantly higher abundance in Clostridiales and Lactobacillales than infants fed non-MBM. Permanova also showed that bacterial compositions were different between males and females and between MBM and non-MBM feeding types. In conclusion, infant postnatal age, gender and feeding type significantly contribute to the dynamic development of the gut microbiome in preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2336598759,"Cholinergic inputs to the auditory cortex from the basal forebrain (BF) are important to auditory processing and plasticity, but little is known about the organization of these synapses onto different auditory cortical neuron types, how they influence auditory responsiveness, and their activity patterns during various behaviors. Using intersectional tracing, optogenetic circuit mapping, and in vivo calcium imaging, we found that cholinergic axons arising from the caudal BF target major excitatory and inhibitory auditory cortical cell types, rapidly modulate auditory cortical tuning, and display fast movement-related activity. Furthermore, the BF and the motor cortex-another source of movement-related activity-provide convergent input onto some of the same auditory cortical neurons. Cholinergic and motor cortical afferents to the auditory cortex display distinct activity patterns and presynaptic partners, indicating that the auditory cortex integrates bottom-up cholinergic signals related to ongoing movements and arousal with top-down information concerning impending movements and motor planning."
https://openalex.org/W2343513463,"Half of the human genome is made up of repetitive DNA. However, mechanisms underlying replication of chromosome regions containing repetitive DNA are poorly understood. We reconstituted replication of defined human chromosome segments using bacterial artificial chromosomes in Xenopus laevis egg extract. Using this approach we characterized the chromatin assembly and replication dynamics of centromeric alpha-satellite DNA. Proteomic analysis of centromeric chromatin revealed replication-dependent enrichment of a network of DNA repair factors including the MSH2-6 complex, which was required for efficient centromeric DNA replication. However, contrary to expectations, the ATR-dependent checkpoint monitoring DNA replication fork arrest could not be activated on highly repetitive DNA due to the inability of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA to accumulate on chromatin. Electron microscopy of centromeric DNA and supercoil mapping revealed the presence of topoisomerase I-dependent DNA loops embedded in a protein matrix enriched for SMC2-4 proteins. This arrangement suppressed ATR signalling by preventing RPA hyper-loading, facilitating replication of centromeric DNA. These findings have important implications for our understanding of repetitive DNA metabolism and centromere organization under normal and stressful conditions."

In a screen for abnormal dendrite development, we identified Minibrain (MNB)/DYRK1a, a kinase implicated in DS and ASDs, as a regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We show that MNB is necessary to establish the length and cytoskeletal composition of terminal dendrites by controlling microtubule growth. Altering MNB levels disrupts dendrite morphology and perturbs neuronal electrophysiological activity, resulting in larval mechanosensation defects. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we uncover a molecular pathway whereby direct phosphorylation of β-tubulin by MNB inhibits tubulin polymerization, a function that is conserved for mammalian DYRK1a.

https://openalex.org/W2343603245,"Antibiotic use is considered among the most severe causes of disturbance to children's developing intestinal microbiota, and frequently causes adverse gastrointestinal effects ranging from mild and transient diarrhoea to life-threatening infections. Probiotics are commonly advocated to help in preventing antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. However, it is currently unknown whether probiotics alleviate the antibiotic-associated changes in children's microbiota. Furthermore, it is not known how long-term probiotic consumption influences the developing microbiota of children. We analysed the influence of long-term Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG intake on preschool children's antibiotic use, and antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal complaints in a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial with 231 children aged 2-7. In addition, we analysed the effect of L. rhanmosus GG on the intestinal microbiota in a subset of 88 children. The results show that long-term L. rhamnosus GG supplementation has an influence on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in children, causing an increase in the abundance of Prevotella, Lactococcus, and Ruminococcus, and a decrease in Escherichia. The treatment appeared to prevent some of the changes in the microbiota associated with penicillin use, but not those associated with macrolide use. The treatment, however, did reduce the frequency of gastrointestinal complaints after a macrolide course. Finally, the treatment appeared to prevent certain bacterial infections for up to 3 years after the trial, as indicated by reduced antibiotic use.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01014676."
https://openalex.org/W2344539925,"Anaphase chromatin bridges can lead to chromosome breakage if not properly resolved before completion of cytokinesis. The NoCut checkpoint, which depends on Aurora B at the spindle midzone, delays abscission in response to chromosome segregation defects in yeast and animal cells. How chromatin bridges are detected, and whether abscission inhibition prevents their damage, remain key unresolved questions. We find that bridges induced by DNA replication stress and by condensation or decatenation defects, but not dicentric chromosomes, delay abscission in a NoCut-dependent manner. Decatenation and condensation defects lead to spindle stabilization during cytokinesis, allowing bridge detection by Aurora B. NoCut does not prevent DNA damage following condensin or topoisomerase II inactivation; however, it protects anaphase bridges and promotes cellular viability after replication stress. Therefore, the molecular origin of chromatin bridges is critical for activation of NoCut, which plays a key role in the maintenance of genome stability after replicative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2342741654,"In type 1 diabetes (T1D), β-cell loss is silent during disease progression. Methylation-sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of β-cell-derived DNA in the blood can serve as a biomarker of β-cell death in T1D. Amylin is highly expressed by β-cells in the islet. Here we examined whether demethylated circulating free amylin DNA (cfDNA) may serve as a biomarker of β-cell death in T1D. β cells showed unique methylation patterns within the amylin coding region that were not observed with other tissues. The design and use of methylation-specific primers yielded a strong signal for demethylated amylin in purified DNA from murine islets when compared with other tissues. Similarly, methylation-specific primers detected high levels of demethylated amylin DNA in human islets and enriched human β-cells. In vivo testing of the primers revealed an increase in demethylated amylin cfDNA in sera of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice during T1D progression and following the development of hyperglycemia. This increase in amylin cfDNA did not mirror the increase in insulin cfDNA, suggesting that amylin cfDNA may detect β-cell loss in serum samples where insulin cfDNA is undetected. Finally, purified cfDNA from recent onset T1D patients yielded a high signal for demethylated amylin cfDNA when compared with matched healthy controls. These findings support the use of demethylated amylin cfDNA for detection of β-cell-derived DNA. When utilized in conjunction with insulin, this latest assay provides a comprehensive multi-gene approach for the detection of β-cell loss."
https://openalex.org/W2342838247,"Autophagy is associated with regulation of both the survival and death of neurons, and has been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in elderly patients following anesthesia, but the pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unexplored. Similar effects have been found in aged rats under sevoflurane anesthesia; however, the role of autophagy in sevoflurane anesthesia-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis of older rats remains elusive. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of autophagy on the sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in aged rats, and to identify the role of autophagy in sevoflurane-induced neuron apoptosis. We used 20-month-old rats under sevoflurane anesthesia to study memory performance, neuron apoptosis, and autophagy. The results demonstrated that sevoflurane anesthesia significantly impaired memory performance and induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Interestingly, treatment of rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, improved the cognitive deficit observed in the aged rats under sevoflurane anesthesia by improving autophagic flux. Rapamycin treatment led to the rapid accumulation of autophagic bodies and autophagy lysosomes, decreased p62 protein levels, and increased the ratio of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II (LC3-II) to LC3-I in hippocampal neurons through the mTOR signaling pathway. However, administration of an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) attenuated the autophagic flux and increased the severity of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neuronal apoptosis and memory impairment. These findings suggest that impaired autophagy in the hippocampal neurons of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia may contribute to cognitive impairment. Therefore, our findings represent a potential novel target for pro-autophagy treatments in patients with sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2345148984,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) still represents a considerable medical and health economic problem in Europe and entails a potential threat to travellers. The aim of this study was to characterise the conditions of severe TBE by precisely recording its clinical variants, the related neuroimaging features, and the variant-specific long-term outcome and by identifying predictors for severe courses.A cohort of 111 TBE patients (median age 51, range 17-75 years; 42% females) was analysed prospectively. Data were acquired from the department of neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the infectious diseases registry of the Robert-Koch institute Berlin. Neurological status was ascertained by protocol at admission and discharge and the degree of disability was scored using the modified RANKIN Scale (mRS; clinical score addressing neurological disability, range from 0, healthy to 6, dead) at admission and at follow-up. Follow-up examination was conducted by means of a telephone interview. To identify independent predictors for severe TBE and functional outcome, modelled logistic regression was performed. MRI changes were correlated with infection variants. To assess alpha-motor neuron injury patterns, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (hrMRN). Analyses were performed at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital, University of Heidelberg from April 2004 through September 2014.Acute course: 3.6% of patients died during the acute infection. All patients with a lethal course suffered from meningoencephaloradiculitis (MER, 14.4% of the cohort), which is associated with a significantly higher risk of requiring intensive care (p = 0.004) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) than menigoencephalitis (ME, 27.9% of the cohort). At admission, both MER and ME groups were severely affected, with the MER group having a statistically higher mRS score (median of 5 in the MER groups versus 4 in the ME group; p<0.001). Long-term outcome: outcome for MER was considerably worse (median mRS = 4) than for ME (mRS = 1, p<0.0001) and meningitis (mRS = 0, 57.7% of the cohort).advanced age (p<0.001) and male gender (p = 0.043) are independent risk factors for a severe infection course. Furthermore, we identified pre-existing diabetes mellitus (p = 0.024) as an independent risk factor for MER. In MER, alpha-motor neuron injury accounts for the poor prognosis confirmed by hrMRN.These data provide critical information for neurologists and other health professionals to use in evaluating TBEV patients who live in or travel to endemic areas. This information can be used to classify clinical presentation and estimate infection-associated complications and individual prognosis. Furthermore, the risk for severe, disabling infections in older patients should prompt general practitioners to recommend and encourage vaccination to those patients living in or travelling to endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2342734681,"We aimed to assess whether oxidative stress is a predictor of mortality in HIV-infected patients.We conducted a nested case-control study in CoRIS, a contemporary, multicentre cohort of HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral-naïve at entry, launched in 2004. Cases were patients who died with available stored plasma samples collected. Two age and sex-matched controls for each case were selected. We measured F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) plasma levels in the first blood sample obtained after cohort engagement.54 cases and 93 controls were included. Median F2-IsoPs and MDA levels were significantly higher in cases than in controls. When adjustment was performed for age, HIV-transmission category, CD4 cell count and HIV viral load at cohort entry, and subclinical inflammation measured with highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), the association of F2-IsoPs with mortality remained significant (adjusted OR per 1 log10 increase, 2.34 [1.23-4.47], P = 0.009). The association of MDA with mortality was attenuated after adjustment: adjusted OR (95% CI) per 1 log10 increase, 2.05 [0.91-4.59], P = 0.080. Median hsCRP was also higher in cases, and it also proved to be an independent predictor of mortality in the adjusted analysis: OR (95% CI) per 1 log10 increase, 1.39 (1.01-1.91), P = 0.043; and OR (95% CI) per 1 log10 increase, 1.46 (1.07-1.99), P = 0.014, respectively, when adjustment included F2-IsoPs and MDA.Oxidative stress is a predictor of all-cause mortality in HIV-infected patients. For plasma F2-IsoPs, this association is independent of HIV-related factors and subclinical inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2344752387,"Escherichia coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have been detected in the Norwegian broiler production, despite the fact that antimicrobial agents are rarely used. The genetic mechanism responsible for cephalosporin resistance is mainly attributed to the presence of the blaCMY-2 gene encoding a plasmid-mediated AmpC-beta-lactamase (pAmpC). The aim of this study was to characterize and compare blaCMY-2 containing Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal flora of broilers and retail chicken meat (fillets) to identify possible successful clones and/or resistance plasmids widespread in the Norwegian broiler production. Methods used included PCR based phylotyping, conjugation experiments, plasmid replicon typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multiple locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis and whole genome sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an IncK plasmid carrying blaCMY-2 was determined. Intestinal isolates displayed a higher degree of genetic diversity than meat isolates. A cluster of genetically related isolates belonging to ST38, phylogroup D, carrying blaCMY-2 containing IncK plasmids was identified. Furthermore, genes encoding plasmid stability systems (relBE/stbDE and pndAC) were identified on the IncK plasmid. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of a subset of isolates confirmed a close genetic relationship within the two most prevalent STs. The IncK plasmids within these two STs also shared a high degree of similarity. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli with the same genetic characteristics have been identified in the broiler production in other European countries, and the IncK plasmid characterized in this study showed close homology to a plasmid isolated from retail chicken meat in the Netherlands. The results indicate that both clonal expansion and horizontal transfer of blaCMY-2 containing plasmids contribute to dissemination of cephalosporin resistant E. coli in the broiler production. The presence of plasmid stability systems may explain why the IncK plasmid containing blaCMY-2 is maintained and disseminated in the Norwegian broiler production in absence of selection pressure from the use of antimicrobial agents."

The large number of particles types and energies that makeup primary or secondary radiation in HZE particle exposures precludes tumor induction studies in animal models for all but a few particle types and energies, thus leading to the use of surrogate endpoints to investigate the details of the radiation quality dependence of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors. In this report we make detailed RBE predictions of the charge number and energy dependence of RBE's using a parametric track structure model to represent experimental results for the low dose response for chromosomal exchanges in normal human lymphocyte and fibroblast cells with comparison to published data for neoplastic transformation and gene mutation. RBE's are evaluated against acute doses of γ-rays for doses near 1 Gy. Models that assume linear or non-targeted effects at low dose are considered. Modest values of RBE (<10) are found for simple exchanges using a linear dose response model, however in the non-targeted effects model for fibroblast cells large RBE values (>10) are predicted at low doses <0.1 Gy. The radiation quality dependence of RBE's against the effects of acute doses γ-rays found for neoplastic transformation and gene mutation studies are similar to those found for simple exchanges if a linear response is assumed at low HZE particle doses. Comparisons of the resulting model parameters to those used in the NASA radiation quality factor function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2344481548,"Orthopedic implant failure due to aseptic loosening and mechanical instability remains a major problem in total joint replacement. Improving osseointegration at the bone-implant interface may reduce micromotion and loosening. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) has been shown to enhance bone formation when coated onto titanium femoral implants and in rat calvarial defect models. However, the most appropriate method of BSP coating, the necessary level of BSP coating, and the effect of BSP coating on cell behavior remain largely unknown. In this study, BSP was covalently coupled to titanium surfaces via an aminosilane linker (APTES), and its properties were compared to BSP applied to titanium via physisorption and untreated titanium. Cell functions were examined using primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) and L929 mouse fibroblasts. Gene expression of specific bone turnover markers at the RNA level was detected at different intervals. Cell adhesion to titanium surfaces treated with BSP via physisorption was not significantly different from that of untreated titanium at any time point, whereas BSP application via covalent coupling caused reduced cell adhesion during the first few hours in culture. Cell migration was increased on titanium disks that were treated with higher concentrations of BSP solution, independent of the coating method. During the early phases of hOB proliferation, a suppressive effect of BSP was observed independent of its concentration, particularly when BSP was applied to the titanium surface via physisorption. Although alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced in the BSP-coated titanium groups after 4 days in culture, increased calcium deposition was observed after 21 days. In particular, the gene expression level of RUNX2 was upregulated by BSP. The increase in calcium deposition and the stimulation of cell differentiation induced by BSP highlight its potential as a surface modifier that could enhance the osseointegration of orthopedic implants. Both physisorption and covalent coupling of BSP are similarly effective, feasible methods, although a higher BSP concentration is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2343245981,"Chitinases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of chitin. Human chitotriosidase (CHIT1) is one of the two active human chitinases, involved in the innate immune response and highly expressed in a variety of diseases. CHIT1 is composed of a catalytic domain linked by a hinge to its chitin binding domain (ChBD). This latter domain belongs to the carbohydrate-binding module family 14 (CBM14 family) and facilitates binding to chitin. So far, the available crystal structures of the human chitinase CHIT1 and the Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase) comprise only their catalytic domain. Here, we report a crystallization strategy combining cross-seeding and micro-seeding cycles which allowed us to obtain the first crystal structure of the full length CHIT1 (CHIT1-FL) at 1.95 Å resolution. The CHIT1 chitin binding domain (ChBDCHIT1) structure shows a distorted β-sandwich 3D fold, typical of CBM14 family members. Accordingly, ChBDCHIT1 presents six conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide bridges and several exposed aromatic residues that probably are involved in chitin binding, including the highly conserved Trp465 in a surface- exposed conformation. Furthermore, ChBDCHIT1 presents a positively charged surface which may be involved in electrostatic interactions. Our data highlight the strong structural conservation of CBM14 family members and uncover the structural similarity between the human ChBDCHIT1, tachycitin and house mite dust allergens. Overall, our new CHIT1-FL structure, determined with an adapted crystallization approach, is one of the few complete bi-modular chitinase structures available and reveals the structural features of a human CBM14 domain."
https://openalex.org/W2344684164,"Objectives Our hospital replaced the format for delivering portable antimicrobial prescribing guidance from a paper-based pocket guide to a smartphone application (app). We used this opportunity to assess the relationship between its use and the attitudes and behaviours of antimicrobial prescribers. Methods We used 2 structured cross-sectional questionnaires issued just prior to and 3 months following the launch of the smartphone app. Ordinal Likert scale responses to both frequencies of use and agreement statements permitted quantitative assessment of the relationship between variables. Results The smartphone app was used more frequently than the pocket guide it replaced (p < 0.01), and its increased use was associated with sentiments that the app was useful, easy to navigate and its content relevant. Users who used the app more frequently were more likely to agree that the app encouraged them to challenge inappropriate prescribing by their colleagues (p = 0.001) and were more aware of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship (p = 0.005). Reduced use of the app was associated with agreement that senior physicians’ preferences for antimicrobial prescribing would irrespectively overrule guideline recommendations (p = 0.0002). Conclusions Smartphone apps are an effective and acceptable format to deliver guidance on antimicrobial prescribing. Our findings suggest that they may empower users to challenge incorrect prescribing, breaking well-established behaviours, and thus supporting vital stewardship efforts in an era of increased antimicrobial resistance. Future work will need to focus on the direct impact on drug prescriptions as well as identifying barriers to implementing smartphone apps in other clinical settings."

Biochemical estimation was carried out for in vitro testing of plant growth promoting traits present in these isolates. PCR screening were performed for plant growth-promoting related genes involved in the biosynthesis of acid phosphatase (AcPho), indolepyruvate decarboxylase (ipdC), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (accd) and siderophore biosynthesis protein (asbA). 76% of the sacred grove isolates gave an amplified fragment for AcPho. Three of the isolates gave an amplified fragment for IpdC gene. Apart from 2 isolates, all the other isolates including the reference strains were positive for the amplification of the accd gene indicating their potential to produce ACC deaminase enzyme. 42% of the isolates gave an amplified fragment for asbA gene indicating the potential ability of these isolates to produce the catechol type siderophore, petrobactin. Overall findings indicated multiple PGP genetic traits present in these isolates which suggested that these isolates are capable of expressing multiple PGP traits. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of accd and asbA genes from the isolates revealed that asbA genes from Paenibacillus taichungiensis SG3 and Paenibacillus tylopili SG24 indicated the occurrence of intergeneric horizontal transfer between Paenibacillus and Bacillus."

Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with these patterns.LCA identified five distinct smoking patterns during the pre-conception, pregnancy and postnatal period: ""non-smokers"" (74.1% of women); ""pregnancy-inspired quitters"" (10.2%); ""persistent smokers"" (10.1%); ""temporary quitters"" (4.4%); and postnatal quitters (1.1%). Smoking patterns varied markedly according to socio-demographic variables and parity. After adjusting for these variables, mothers who lived during pregnancy with a partner who smoked were more likely to be temporary quitters (aOR 2.64, 95% CI 1.74-3.99) or persistent smokers (aOR 3.32, 95% CI 2.34-4.72) than pregnancy-inspired quitters. Mothers who lived during pregnancy with someone else other than a partner who smoked were more likely to be persistent smokers (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.38-3.97) or postnatal quitters (aOR 2.97, 95% CI 1.07-8.24) than pregnancy-inspired quitters. Mothers given information on how their partner could stop smoking if they lived during pregnancy with a smoking partner were less likely to be persistent smokers (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27-0.65) than pregnancy-inspired quitters.Health professionals should ask about smoking at every opportunity, and refer women who self-report as current smokers to an evidence based smoking cessation service."
https://openalex.org/W2343101722,"When increasing ambulation speed in Parkinson’s disease, step cadence increases more than stride length, indicating movement scaling difficulties that affect step generation in particular. We investigated whether step length variation when increasing ambulation speed was related to disease progression. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (N = 39) and controls (N = 152) performed two timed ambulation tasks: at a 'free' (self-selected) pace and then at 'maximal' speed. The total number of steps (including during turns) and time to complete the task were clinically measured. The relative contribution of step length and cadence to increased ambulation speed was determined using two methods: the ratios of change in step length or in cadence to the change in ambulation speed, and the step length index. While the relative contribution of step length and cadence to increased ambulation speed was independent of age in both control and patient groups, in Parkinson’s disease there was a negative correlation between time from diagnosis and the ratio of change in step length to change in ambulation speed (R = 0.54; p = 0.0004) and the step length index (R = 0.56, p = 0.0002). In parallel, there was a positive correlation between time since diagnosis and the ratio of change in cadence to change in ambulation speed (R = 0.57; p = 0.0002). The relative contribution of step length and cadence to increased ambulation speed is age invariant but a marker of Parkinson's disease advancement, and can be easily determined in the clinical setting."

Although chronic low-grade inflammation has been identified as a central effector of IR development, it has never been investigated simultaneously at systemic level and locally in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in obese humans characterized for their insulin sensitivity.We compared metabolic parameters and inflammation at systemic and tissue levels in normal-weight and obese subjects with different insulin sensitivity to better understand the mechanisms involved in IR development.30 post-menopausal women were classified as normal-weight insulin-sensitive (controls, CT) and obese (grade I) insulin-sensitive (OIS) or insulin-resistant (OIR) according to their body mass index and homeostasis model assessment of IR index. They underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, blood sampling, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, an activity questionnaire and a self-administrated dietary recall. We analyzed insulin sensitivity, inflammation and IR-related parameters at the systemic level. In tissues, insulin response was assessed by P-Akt/Akt expression and inflammation by macrophage infiltration as well as cytokines and IκBα expression.Systemic levels of lipids, adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, and lipopolysaccharides were equivalent between OIS and OIR subjects. In subcutaneous adipose tissue, the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages was higher in OIR than in CT and OIS and was associated with higher IL-6 level. Insulin induced Akt phosphorylation to the same extent in CT, OIS and OIR. In skeletal muscle, we could not detect any inflammation even though IκBα expression was lower in OIR compared to CT. However, while P-Akt/Akt level increased following insulin stimulation in CT and OIS, it remained unchanged in OIR.Our results show that systemic IR occurs without any change in systemic and tissues inflammation. We identified a muscle defect in insulin response as an early mechanism of IR development in grade I obese post-menopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2342949532,"Background Genetic polymorphisms of the Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene may play a role in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to investigate the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DPP4 gene in Malaysian subjects with T2DM and evaluated whether they had an effect on the serum levels of soluble dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (sDPP-IV). Method Ten DPP4 SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan genotyping assays in 314 subjects with T2DM and 235 controls. Of these, 71 metabolic syndrome (MetS) subjects were excluded from subsequent analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using multiple logistic regression for the association between the SNPs of DPP4 and T2DM. In addition, the serum levels of sDPP-IV were investigated to evaluate the association of the SNPs of DPP4 with the sDPP-IV levels. Results Dominant, recessive, and additive genetic models were employed to test the association of DPP4 polymorphisms with T2DM, after adjusting for age, race, gender and BMI. The rs12617656 was associated with T2DM in Malaysian subjects in the recessive genetic model (OR = 1.98, p = 0.006), dominant model (OR = 1.95, p = 0.008), and additive model (OR = 1.63, p = 0.001). This association was more pronounced among Malaysian Indians, recessive (OR = 3.21, p = 0.019), dominant OR = 3.72, p = 0.003) and additive model (OR = 2.29, p = 0.0009). The additive genetic model showed that DPP4 rs4664443 and rs7633162 polymorphisms were associated with T2DM (OR = 1.53, p = 0.039), and (OR = 1.42, p = 0.020), respectively. In addition, the rs4664443 G>A polymorphism was associated with increased sDPP-IV levels (p = 0.042) in T2DM subjects. Conclusions DPP4 polymorphisms were associated with T2DM in Malaysian subjects, and linked to variations in sDPP-IV levels. In addition, these associations were more pronounced among Malaysian Indian subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2342806467,"Background Surveillance systems are increasingly relying upon community-based or crowd-sourced data to complement traditional facilities-based data sources. Data collected by community health workers during the routine course of care could combine the early warning power of community-based data collection with the predictability and diagnostic regularity of facility data. These data could inform public health responses to epidemics and spatially-clustered endemic diseases. Here, we analyze data collected on a daily basis by community health workers during the routine course of clinical care in rural Nepal. We evaluate if such community-based surveillance systems can capture temporal trends in diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory infections. Methods During the course of their clinical activities from January to December 2013, community health workers recorded healthcare encounters using mobile phones. In parallel, we accessed condition-specific admissions from 2011–2013 in the hospital from which the community health program was based. We compared diarrhea and acute respiratory infection rates from both the hospital and the community, and assigned three categories of local disease activity (low, medium, and high) to each week in each village cluster with categories determined by tertiles. We compared condition-specific mean hospital rates across categories using ANOVA to assess concordance between hospital and community-collected data. Results There were 2,710 cases of diarrhea and 373 cases of acute respiratory infection reported by community health workers during the one-year study period. At the hospital, the average weekly incidence of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections over the three-year period was 1.8 and 3.9 cases respectively per 1,000 people in each village cluster. In the community, the average weekly rate of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections was 2.7 and 0.5 cases respectively per 1,000 people. Both diarrhea and acute respiratory infections exhibited significant differences between the three categories of disease rate burden (diarrhea p = 0.009, acute respiratory infection p = 0.001) when comparing community health worker-collected rates to hospital rates. Conclusion Community-level data on diarrhea and acute respiratory infections modestly correlated with hospital data for the same condition in each village each week. Our experience suggests that community health worker-collected data on mobile phones may be a feasible adjunct to other community- and healthcare-related data sources for surveillance of such conditions. Such systems are vitally needed in resource-limited settings like rural Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W2343665986,"The purpose of the study was to compare the force outputs achieved during a squat exercise using a rotational inertia device in stable versus unstable conditions with different loads and in concentric and eccentric phases. Thirteen male athletes (mean ± SD: age 23.7 ± 3.0 years, height 1.80 ± 0.08 m, body mass 77.4 ± 7.9 kg) were assessed while squatting, performing one set of three repetitions with four different loads under stable and unstable conditions at maximum concentric effort. Overall, there were no significant differences between the stable and unstable conditions at each of the loads for any of the dependent variables. Mean force showed significant differences between some of the loads in stable and unstable conditions (P < 0.010) and peak force output differed between all loads for each condition (P < 0.045). Mean force outputs were greater in the concentric than in the eccentric phase under both conditions and with all loads (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in peak force between concentric and eccentric phases at any load in either stable or unstable conditions. In conclusion, squatting with a rotational inertia device allowed the generation of similar force outputs under stable and unstable conditions at each of the four loads. The study also provides empirical evidence of the different force outputs achieved by adjusting load conditions on the rotational inertia device when performing squats, especially in the case of peak force. Concentric force outputs were significantly higher than eccentric outputs, except for peak force under both conditions. These findings support the use of the rotational inertia device to train the squatting exercise under unstable conditions for strength and conditioning trainers. The device could also be included in injury prevention programs for muscle lesions and ankle and knee joint injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2342697035,"Two studies investigated the role of group allegiances in contributing to the failure of institutions to appropriately respond to allegations of child sexual abuse. In Study 1, 601 participants read a news article detailing an allegation of child sexual abuse against a Catholic Priest. Catholics were more protective of the accused–and more skeptical of the accuser—than other participants, an effect that was particularly pronounced among strongly identified Catholics. In Study 2 (N = 404), the tendency for Catholics to be more protective of the accused and more skeptical of the accuser than non-Catholics was replicated. Moreover, these effects held independently of the objective likelihood that the accused was guilty. Overall, the data show that group loyalties provide a psychological motivation to disbelieve child abuse allegations. Furthermore, the people for whom this motivation is strongest are also the people who are most likely to be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations: highly identified ingroup members. The findings highlight the psychological mechanisms that may limit the ability of senior Church figures to conduct impartial investigations into allegations of child abuse within the Church."

Articles and reviews were identified in the Web of Science on research in six non-communicable respiratory diseases that were published in 2002–13 from 31 European countries. They represented only 0.8% of biomedical research output but these diseases accounted for 4.7% of the European disease burden, as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), so the sub-field is seriously under-researched. Europe is prominent in the sub-field and published 56% of the world total, with the UK the most productive and publishing more than France and Italy, the next two countries, combined. Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were the diseases with the most publications and the highest citation rates. They also received the most funding, with around two acknowledgments per paper (in 2009–13), whereas cystic fibrosis and emphysema averaged only one. Just over 37% of papers had no specific funding and depended on institutional support from universities and hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2343072313,"In this work, collapse of corroded pipeline under combined external pressure and tension is investigated through numerical method. Axially uniform corrosion with symmetric imperfections is firstly considered. After verifying with existing experimental results, the finite element model is used to study the effect of tension on collapse pressure. An extensive parametric study is carried out using Python script and FORTRAN subroutine to investigate the influence of geometric parameters on the collapse behavior under combined loads. The results are used to develop an empirical equation for estimating the collapse pressure under tension. In addition, the effects of loading path, initial imperfection length, yielding anisotropy and corrosion defect length on the collapse behavior are also investigated. It is found that tension has a significant influence on collapse pressure of corroded pipelines. Loading path and anisotropic yielding are also important factors affecting the collapse behavior. For pipelines with relatively long corrosion defect, axially uniform corrosion models could be used to estimate the collapse pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2344311117,"Despite improved availability of simple, relatively inexpensive, and highly effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS, the disease remains a major public health challenge for women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Given the numerous barriers in access to care for women in this region, every health issue that brings them into contact with the health system should be optimized as an opportunity to integrate HIV/AIDS prevention. Because most non-condom forms of modern contraception require a clinical appointment for use, contraception appointments could provide a confidential opportunity for access to HIV counseling, testing, and referral to care. This study sought to investigate the relationship between contraceptive methods and HIV testing among women in SSA. Data from the Demographic and Health Survey from four African countries—Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda—was used to examine whether modern (e.g., pills, condom) or traditional (e.g., periodic abstinence, withdrawal) forms of contraception were associated with uptake of HIV testing. Data for the current analyses were restricted to 35,748 women with complete information on the variables of interest. Chi-square tests and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between uptake of HIV testing and respondents' baseline characteristics and contraceptive methods. In the total sample and in Mozambique, women who used modern forms of contraception were more likely to be tested for HIV compared to those who did not use contraception. This positive association was not demonstrated in Congo, Nigeria, or Uganda. That many women who access modern contraception are not tested for HIV in high HIV burden areas highlights a missed opportunity to deliver an important intervention to promote maternal and child health. Given the increasing popularity of hormonal contraception methods in low-income countries, there is an urgent need to integrate HIV counseling, testing, and treatment into family planning programs. Women on hormonal contraceptives should be encouraged to continue to use condoms for HIV-prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2343175525,"Protein function is controlled by the cellular proteostasis network. Proteostasis is energetically costly and those costs must be balanced with the energy needs of other physiological functions. Hypertonic stress causes widespread protein damage in C. elegans. Suppression and management of protein damage is essential for optimal survival under hypertonic conditions. ASH chemosensory neurons allow C. elegans to detect and avoid strongly hypertonic environments. We demonstrate that mutations in osm-9 and osm-12 that disrupt ASH mediated hypertonic avoidance behavior or genetic ablation of ASH neurons are associated with enhanced survival during hypertonic stress. Improved survival is not due to altered systemic volume homeostasis or organic osmolyte accumulation. Instead, we find that osm-9(ok1677) mutant and osm-9(RNAi) worms exhibit reductions in hypertonicity induced protein damage in non-neuronal cells suggesting that enhanced proteostasis capacity may account for improved hypertonic stress resistance in worms with defects in osmotic avoidance behavior. RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes that play roles in managing protein damage are upregulated in osm-9(ok1677) worms. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of work demonstrating that intercellular communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells plays a critical role in integrating cellular stress resistance with other organismal physiological demands and associated energy costs."
https://openalex.org/W2340295225,"Object Patients with familial intracranial aneurysms (IA) have a higher risk of rupture than patients with sporadic IA. We compared geometric and morphological risk factors for aneurysmal rupture between patients with familial and sporadic aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to analyse if these risk factors contribute to the increased rupture rate of familial IA. Methods Geometric and morphological aneurysm characteristics were studied on CT-angiography in a prospectively collected series of patients with familial and sporadic aSAH, admitted between September 2006 and September 2009, and additional patients with familial aSAH retrieved from the prospectively collected database of familial IA patients of our center. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the aneurysm characteristics between patients with familial and sporadic aSAH. Results We studied 67 patients with familial and 184 with sporadic aSAH. OR’s for familial compared with sporadic aSAH were for oval shape 1.16(95%CI:0.65–2.09), oblong shape 0.26(95%CI:0.03–2.13), irregular shape 0.83(95%CI:0.47–1.49), aspect ratio ≥ 1.6 0.94(95%CI:0.54–1.66), contact with the perianeurysmal environment (PAE) 1.15(95%CI:0.56–2.40), deformation by the PAE 1.05(95%CI:0.47–2.35) and for dominance of the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) in case of PCoA aneurysms 1.97(95% CI:0.50–7.83). Conclusions The geometric and morphological risk factors for aneurysm rupture do not have a higher prevalence in familial than in sporadic aSAH and thus do not explain the increased risk of IA rupture in patients with familial IA. We recommend further search for other potential risk factors for rupture of familial IA, such as genetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2344514911,"Learning is not a unitary phenomenon. Rather, learning progresses through stages, with the stages reflecting different challenges that require the support of specific cognitive processes that reflect the functions of different brain networks. A theory of general learning proposes that learning can be divided into early and late stages controlled by corticolimbic networks located in frontal and posterior brain regions, respectively. Recent human studies using dense-array EEG (dEEG) support these results by showing progressive increases in P3b amplitude (an Event Related Potential with estimated sources in posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus) as participants acquire a new visuomotor skill. In the present study, the P3b was used to track the learning and performance of participants as they identify defensive football formations and make an appropriate response. Participants acquired the task over three days, and P3b latency and amplitude significantly changed when participants learned the task. As participants demonstrated further proficiency with extensive training, amplitude and latency changes in the P3b continued to closely mirror performance improvements. Source localization results across all days suggest that an important source generator of the P3b is located in the posterior cingulate cortex. Results from the study support prior findings and further suggest that the careful analysis of covert learning mechanisms and their underlying electrical signatures are a robust index of task competency."
https://openalex.org/W2342702200,"Opa proteins are major surface-expressed proteins located in the Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane, and are potential meningococcal vaccine candidates. Although Opa proteins elicit high levels of bactericidal antibodies following immunisation in mice, progress towards human clinical trials has been delayed due to previous findings that Opa inhibits T cell proliferation in some in vitro assays. However, results from previous studies are conflicting, with different Opa preparations and culture conditions being used. We investigated the effects of various Opa+ and Opa- antigens from N. meningitidis strain H44/76 in a range of in vitro conditions using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4+ T cells, measuring T cell proliferation by CFSE dilution using flow cytometry. Wild type recombinant and liposomal Opa proteins inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation after stimulation with IL-2, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and these effects were reduced by mutation of the CEACAM1-binding region of Opa. These effects were not observed in culture with ex vivo PBMCs. Opa+ and Opa- OMVs did not consistently exert a stimulatory or inhibitory effect across different culture conditions. These data do not support a hypothesis that Opa proteins would be inhibitory to T cells if given as a vaccine component, and T cell immune responses to OMV vaccines are unlikely to be significantly affected by the presence of Opa proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2343565443,"HIV testing is the first point of HIV treatment entry for HIV-infected individuals and an avenue to engage persons at risk in prevention. In China, where the prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been rising over the last decade, uptake of HIV testing has been low.We examined changes in HIV testing in the preceding 12 months through two cross-sectional surveys conducted among MSM in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China in 2008 and 2012. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used to recruit participants. Questionnaire interviews and venous blood were collected to measure HIV testing, risk behaviors, and prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2.A total of 430 and 589 MSM were surveyed in 2008 and 2012, respectively, with comparable samples in each round with respect to demographic characteristics. HIV testing in the past 12 months increased significantly from 20.1% (95% CI 13.3-26.8) in 2008 to 46.0% (95% CI 39.3-51.4, p < 0.001) in 2012. HIV prevalence was stable, at 6.6% (95% CI 2.5-11.3) in 2008 and 10.1% (95% CI 6.6-13.9, p = 0.240) in 2012, as was syphilis (14.3% in 2008 vs. 9.9% in 2012, p = 0.240). HSV-2 prevalence (18.6% in 2008 vs. 10.2% in 2012, p = 0.040) and self-reported STI in the last year (24.3% in 2008 vs. 14.3% in 2012, p = 0.020) significantly decreased. Changes in reported sexual behaviors were mixed and the profiles of who did and did not test varied between 2008 and 2012.HIV testing uptake more than doubled among MSM in Nanjing from 2008 to 2012 -a period of massive promotion and scale up of testing programs for MSM. However, additional efforts are still needed to further increase the proportion of men being not only tested but also undergoing repeat testing if they engage in continued risk taking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2344323747,"Numerous red blood cells are generated every second from proliferative progenitor cells under a homeostatic state. Increased erythropoietic activity is required after myelo-suppression as a result of chemo-radio therapies. Our previous study revealed that the endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), an authentic hematopoietic stem cell marker, plays essential roles in stress-induced hematopoiesis. To determine the physiological importance of ESAM in erythroid recovery, ESAM-knockout (KO) mice were treated with the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). ESAM-KO mice experienced severe and prolonged anemia after 5-FU treatment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Eight days after the 5-FU injection, compared to WT mice, ESAM-KO mice showed reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors in bone marrow (BM) and spleen, and reticulocytes in peripheral blood. Megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) from the BM of 5-FU-treated ESAM-KO mice showed reduced burst forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E) capacities than those from WT mice. BM transplantation revealed that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from ESAM-KO donors were more sensitive to 5-FU treatment than that from WT donors in the WT host mice. However, hematopoietic cells from WT donors transplanted into ESAM-KO host mice could normally reconstitute the erythroid lineage after a BM injury. These results suggested that ESAM expression in hematopoietic cells, but not environmental cells, is critical for hematopoietic recovery. We also found that 5-FU treatment induces the up-regulation of ESAM in primitive erythroid progenitors and macrophages that do not express ESAM under homeostatic conditions. The phenotypic change seen in macrophages might be functionally involved in the interaction between erythroid progenitors and their niche components during stress-induced acute erythropoiesis. Microarray analyses of primitive erythroid progenitors from 5-FU-treated WT and ESAM-KO mice revealed that various signaling pathways, including the GATA1 system, were impaired in ESAM-KO mice. Thus, our data demonstrate that ESAM expression in hematopoietic progenitors is essential for erythroid recovery after a BM injury."
https://openalex.org/W2345178171,"The present study investigated the influence of an auditory tone on the localization of visual objects in the stream/bounce display (SBD). In this display, two identical visual objects move toward each other, overlap, and then return to their original positions. These objects can be perceived as either streaming through or bouncing off each other. In this study, the closest distance between object centers on opposing trajectories and tone presentation timing (none, 0 ms, ± 90 ms, and ± 390 ms relative to the instant for the closest distance) were manipulated. Observers were asked to judge whether the two objects overlapped with each other and whether the objects appeared to stream through, bounce off each other, or reverse their direction of motion. A tone presented at or around the instant of the objects' closest distance biased judgments toward ""non-overlapping,"" and observers overestimated the physical distance between objects. A similar bias toward direction change judgments (bounce and reverse, not stream judgments) was also observed, which was always stronger than the non-overlapping bias. Thus, these two types of judgments were not always identical. Moreover, another experiment showed that it was unlikely that this observed mislocalization could be explained by other previously known mislocalization phenomena (i.e., representational momentum, the Fröhlich effect, and a turn-point shift). These findings indicate a new example of crossmodal mislocalization, which can be obtained without temporal offsets between audiovisual stimuli. The mislocalization effect is also specific to a more complex stimulus configuration of objects on opposing trajectories, with a tone that is presented simultaneously. The present study promotes an understanding of relatively complex audiovisual interactions beyond simple one-to-one audiovisual stimuli used in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W2343972123,"The ε-amino group of lysine residues may be mono-, di- or tri-methylated by protein lysine methyltransferases. In the past few years it has been highly considered that methylation of both histone and non-histone proteins has fundamental role in development and progression of various human diseases. Thus, the establishment of tools to study lysine methylation that will distinguish between the different states of methylation is required to elucidate their cellular functions. The 3X malignant brain tumor domain (3XMBT) repeats of the Lethal(3)malignant brain tumor-like protein 1 (L3MBTL1) have been utilized in the past as an affinity reagent for the identification of mono- and di-methylated lysine residues on individual proteins and on a proteomic scale. Here, we have utilized the 3XMBT domain to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that allows the high-throughput detection of 3XMBT binding to methylated lysines. We demonstrated that this system allows the detection of methylated peptides, methylated proteins and PKMT activity on both peptides and proteins. We also optimized the assay to detect 3XMBT binding in crude E. coli lysates which facilitated the high throughput screening of 3XMBT mutant libraries. We have utilized protein engineering tools and generated a double site saturation 3XMBT library of residues 361 and 411 that were shown before to be important for binding mono and di-methylated substrates and identified variants that can exclusively recognize only di-methylated peptides. Together, our results demonstrate a powerful new approach that will contribute to deeper understanding of lysine methylation biology and that can be utilized for the engineering of domains for specific binders of other post-translational modifications."
