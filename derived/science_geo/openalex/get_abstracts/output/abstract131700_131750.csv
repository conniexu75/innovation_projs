PTH mRNA levels are markedly increased in rats fed low calcium diets and decreased after low phosphate diets, and this effect is post-transcriptional. Protein-PTH mRNA binding studies, with parathyroid cytosolic proteins, showed three protein-RNA bands. This binding was to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the PTH mRNA and was dependent upon the terminal 60 nucleotides. Parathyroid proteins from hypocalcemic rats showed increased binding, and proteins from hypophosphatemic rats decreased binding, correlating with PTH mRNA levels. There is no parathyroid cell line; however, a functional role was provided by an in vitro degradation assay. Parathyroid proteins from control rats incubated with a PTH mRNA probe led to an intact transcript for 40 min; the transcript was intact with hypocalcemic proteins for 180 min and with hypophosphatemic proteins only for 5 min. A PTH mRNA probe without the 3′-UTR, or just the terminal 60 nucleotides, incubated with hypophosphatemic proteins, showed no degradation at all, indicating that the sequences in the 3′-UTR determine PTH mRNA degradation. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia regulate PTH gene expression post-transcriptionally. This correlates with binding of proteins to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR, which determines its stability.

PTH 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; PT, parathyroid; UTR, untranslated region; DTT, dithiothreitol. is the major hormone that regulates calcium homeostasis and also has an important role in regulating bone strength. In turn, the synthesis and secretion of PTH is finely regulated by the serum calcium concentration, with hypocalcemia resulting in a marked increase in serum PTH, PTH mRNA levels, and parathyroid cell number (1Silver J. Kronenberg H.M. Bilezikian J.B. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar, 2Naveh-Many T. Silver J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1313-1319Google Scholar). Changes in extracellular calcium are sensed by the PT cell by a cell membrane sensor, which then leads to a change in intracellular calcium and inositol triphosphate concentrations (3Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi R. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert J. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar). How these factors then determine the levels of PTH secretion, gene expression, and PT cell proliferation is not clear. A negative calcium regulatory element in the atrial natriuretic peptide gene, with a homologous sequence in the PTH gene (4Okazaki T. Ando K. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1268-1273Google Scholar) has been shown to bind a protein (ref1), which was known to activate several transcription factors (5Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Google Scholar). Because no parathyroid cell line is available, these studies were performed in nonparathyroid cell lines, so their relevance to physiologic PTH gene regulation remains to be established. A post-transcriptional effect of calcium on PTH gene expression in primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells has been demonstrated (6Hawa N.S. O'Riordan J.L. Farrow S.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 43-49Google Scholar), which correlated with binding of parathyroid proteins to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of bovine PTH mRNA probes (7Vadher S. Hawa N.S. O'Riordan J.L.H. Farrow S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 746-753Google Scholar). PTH leads to a decrease in serum phosphate by increasing renal phosphate excretion, and in turn, serum phosphate has a direct effect to increase PTH secretion and PTH mRNA levels (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar, 9Almaden Y. Canalejo A. Hernandez A. Ballesteros E. Garcia-Navarro S. Torres A. Rodriguez M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 970-976Google Scholar, 10Slatopolsky E. Finch J. Denda M. Ritter C. Zhong A. Dusso A. MacDonald P. Brown A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2534-2540Google Scholar, 11Nielsen P.K. Feldt-Rasmusen U. Olgaard K. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 1762-1768Google Scholar). Dietary induced hypophosphatemia leads to a dramatic decrease in PTH gene expression, and this effect is posttranscriptional (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar). We have now studied the mechanism whereby hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia in vivo regulate PTH mRNA levels. We show that the effect of hypocalcemia to increase PTH mRNA levelsin vivo is post-transcriptional, similar to the effect of hypophosphatemia to decrease PTH mRNA levels, which is also post-transcriptional (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar). PT cellular proteins bind to PTH mRNA and specifically to the 3′-UTR. PT proteins from hypocalcemic rats led to increased protein-RNA binding and hypophosphatemic PT proteins decreased this binding. In vitro mRNA degradation studies show that the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR mediates the rapid degradation of the transcript by parathyroid proteins from hypophosphatemic rats and stabilization of the transcript by parathyroid proteins from hypocalcemic rats. Weanling male Sabra rats were fed a normal calcium (0.6%), normal phosphate (0.3%) diet, a low calcium (0.02%) normal phosphate (0.3%) diet, or a low phosphate (0.02%) normal calcium (0.6%) diet (Teklad, IL) for different time intervals. This low phosphate diet at 2 weeks results in a serum phosphate of 4.0 ± 0.4 mg/dl (control = 9.8 ± 1.2 mg/dl) and serum calcium of 12.6 ± 0.6 mg/dl (control = 10.6 ± 0.4 mg/dl) (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar). At timed intervals the thyroparathyroid tissue, microdissected parathyroid and thyroid, and other tissues were removed under pentobarbital anesthesia, and blood samples were taken for serum calcium and PTH measurements. The thyroparathyroid tissue for RNA extraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until analysis. To confirm the accuracy of the microdissection, Northern blots were performed and showed that the microdissected parathyroids had PTH mRNA, and the isolated thyroid had no PTH mRNA even after a prolonged exposure. Tissues for nuclear run-on assays and protein extracts were used immediately as described below. RNA was extracted from rat parathyroid tissue, and the levels of PTH mRNA were measured by Northern blots after extraction with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described previously (12Naveh-Many T. Almogi G. Livni N. Silver J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2434-2438Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA and the uniformity of RNA transfer to the membrane were determined by UV visualization of the ribosomal RNA bands of the gels and the filters. Hybridization was to a random primed rat PTH cDNA probe and 18 S rRNA as a control. The autoradiograms were scanned by a densitometer and quantitated as optical density units. Serum Ca2+ and phosphate were measured in a Roche autoanalyzer. Serum PTH levels were measured with a rat Allegro immunoradiometric assay (Nichols, San Clemente, CA). Nuclei were prepared from pooled thyroparathyroid tissue of 10 rats, and nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed as described previously (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar). RNA was extracted and resuspended in 300 μl of hybridization buffer (7% SDS, 10% polyethylene glycol (8,000), 1.5% SSPE). Aliquots of RNA from treated and untreated samples were counted in a scintillation counter, and an equal number of counts from each condition (1–2 × l06 cpm) were hybridized to linearized cDNAs (5 μg) for PTH, calcitonin, actin, rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pBR322 DNA (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar), which were immobilized to Hybond filters using a slot blot apparatus. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 72 h. The filters were washed three times at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS for 5 min, then washed once at 55 °C for 15 min. The blots were exposed to Agfa CURIX-RP2 film at −70 °C with intensifying screens for 14 days. In addition, the filters were exposed for 24 h to a bio-imaging plate and quantified by a bio-imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Japan). Rat PTH cDNA was recloned by inserting the PstI/PstI rat PTH cDNA fragment from PT43 plasmid into Bluescript II KS+ plasmid, which contains T3/T7 promoters (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This fragment spans the region of the PTH cDNA from 32 to 817 base pairs and includes most of the 5′-UTR and all the 3′-UTR, including the long poly(A) tail (13Kemper B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Google Scholar). A clone in which the 5′ of the PTH cDNA insert was adjacent to the T3 promoter was used for sense RNA synthesis (see Fig. 4). RNA was transcribed from plasmids that had been linearized using different restriction enzymes followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The template for probe A was prepared by digesting the plasmid with SmaI, probe B by digestion withDraI, probe C by digestion with XbaI, probe D by digestion with BstXI, and probe E by digestion withNcoI. The 3′-UTR template for probe F was prepared by a polymerase chain reaction as described previously (12Naveh-Many T. Almogi G. Livni N. Silver J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2434-2438Google Scholar) of the PTH cDNA fragment using two oligonucleotides complimentary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the 3′-UTR. The 5′ primer that included the T3 polymerase primer sequence (underlined) was 5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGATGCTGACGTATTC-3′. The 3′ primer was 5′-GATCATTAAACTTTA-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was run on a 2% agarose gel, and the single product of the expected size of 247 base pairs was purified using a DNA isolation kit (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) and used for RNA transcription. Radiolabeled RNA probes for UV cross-linking were prepared from linearized templates using T3 RNA polymerase in a transcription reaction containing 1 μg of DNA, 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, 8 μm UTP, 2 μm bromo-UTP, 500 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), and [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 20 mCi/ml). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and purified on Sephadex G-50 columns, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting. The specific activity of the RNA probe was 0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm/ng. For RNA degradation assays the RNA was labeled without bromo-UTP. For competition experiments and for RNA translation, unlabeled PTH mRNA was transcribed similarly in the presence of 1 mm each of the four nucleotides. The RNA was visualized on a 2% agarose gel, and the transcription level was estimated. Cytoplasmic proteins (S100) were extracted by the method of Dignam et al. (14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Different tissues were removed from the rats and immediately washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Parathyroid proteins were prepared from microdissected parathyroids or from thyroparathyroid tissue. The tissue was cut with a scalpel, suspended in 5 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min (4 °C) the pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A and homogenized by a Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was carefully decanted, mixed with 0.1 volume of buffer B containing 0.3 m HEPES, 1.4m KCl, and 0.03 m MgCl2, and centrifuged (4 °C) at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman type TL-100). The high speed supernatant (S100) was dialyzed for 20 h at 4 °C against 50 volumes of buffer D containing 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT. For RNA degradation assays and in vitro translation the S100 fraction was prepared by homogenizing the tissue with a Polytron in 2 volumes of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. 0.1 volume of the extraction buffer (1.5 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT) was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cytoplasmic extracts were immediately frozen at −80 °C in aliquots. Protein concentration was determined by optical density densitometry (595-μm wavelength) using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). 1 ng of RNA probe (0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm) was incubated with different amounts (10–30 μg) of cytoplasmic protein extracts (S100) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT (binding buffer). After 30 min at room temperature, heparin was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, to eliminate nonspecific binding, and the samples were irradiated at 2.5 J/cm2 with a UV light source of 312 nm. RNase A-XII (Sigma) was then added for 15 min at 37 °C to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to digest unprotected RNA. The samples were heated for 5 min at 65 °C after addition of 5 μl of Leamlli sample buffer containing 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.4 mTris, pH 6.8, 0.5 m DTT, and a small amount of bromphenol blue. The samples were then loaded on a SDS 10% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. RNA-protein binding was visualized by autoradiography. A molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) was also run on the gel for size estimation of the protein-RNA bands. In some experiments proteinase K (200 μg/ml) was added. For competition experiments unlabeled RNA was added. In vitrocell free degradation was performed essentially as described previously (15Krikorian C.R. Read G.S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 112-122Google Scholar, 16Agy M.B. Sherbert C.H. Katze M.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 158-166Google Scholar, 17Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA transcripts (0.3 × 106cpm) were incubated with 40 μg of cytoplasmic extract and 80 units/ml RNasin to prevent nonspecific RNA degradation in a total volume of 40 μl at room temperature. At each time point 6 μl were transferred to a tube containing 300 μl of TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center), and RNA was extracted. Samples were run on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham, UK), and autoradiographed. The remaining undegraded transcripts at the different time points were quantified by densitometry. A RNA transcript (1 μg) for the full-length PTH mRNA (probe A) was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions using [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, Amersham). Translation was conducted in the presence or absence of cytosolic parathyroid proteins (30 μg). At timed intervals aliquots of the reaction were removed, analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with the post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons test to determine the significance of differences between means. Probability values under 5% were determined as significant. The results are presented as the mean ± S.E. To study the mechanism of the effect of hypocalcemia on PTH gene expression, weanling rats were fed a low calcium diet, and the levels of serum calcium, PTH, and PTH mRNA were determined at different times. Serum calcium had decreased from 8.9 to 7.5 mg/dl after 3 days on the low calcium diet with an increase in serum PTH. PTH mRNA levels, as measured by Northern blots (2Naveh-Many T. Silver J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1313-1319Google Scholar), were increased from day 7, and at day 21 both PTH and PTH mRNA levels had increased ∼10-fold (Fig. 1). There was no change in a control gene 18 S RNA (not shown). The effect of hypocalcemia to increase PTH mRNA was also demonstrated byin situ hybridization, where it was evident that there was an in increase in PTH mRNA uniformly throughout the PT gland, involving all the PT cells (not shown). To differentiate whether the increase in PTH mRNA levels was transcriptional or post-transcriptional, nuclear transcript run-on experiments were performed on thyroparathyroid nuclei from rats fed either a control diet or a low calcium diet for 3, 7, and 21 days after weaning. The nuclear transcription rates for the PTH gene, as well as a number of other genes expressed in this tissue, showed that there was no difference between the nuclei from control and hypocalcemic rats at day 21 (Fig. 2), as well as at days 3 and 7 (not shown). At day 21, the ratio of transcription rates in hypocalcemic rats:control rats for PTH was 1.5, for calcitonin 3.0, for actin 1.5, for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2.5, which show that PTH transcription was the same or less than that of control genes studied. The same results were shown in two repeat experiments. The results of the nuclear run-on experiments therefore indicate that the major effect of hypocalcemia to increase PTH gene expression is post-transcriptional. In addition, we have previously shown that PTH mRNA levels are markedly decreased in hypophosphatemic rats and that this effect is also post-transcriptional (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar).Figure 2Nuclear transcript run-ons for PTH, calcitonin (CT), actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDN), and pBR322 of rats fed a normal (ND NCa) or low calcium (−D −Ca) diet for 21 days after weaning. The thyroparathyroid tissue from 10 rats was pooled in each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Post-transcriptional regulation is often determined by proteins binding to mRNAs and altering mRNA stability. To study the mechanism of the post-transcriptional regulation of PTH mRNA by dietary calcium and phosphate, we performed protein-RNA binding experiments. In vitrosynthesized radiolabeled PTH mRNA riboprobes spanning the full-length mRNA were incubated with cytoplasmic proteins isolated from rat parathyroids as well as from other tissues, cross-linked by UV light, digested with RNase A, to digest the RNA that was not protected by protein, and run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When no extract was added, all the RNA was digested and no bands were detected (not shown). Incubation of parathyroid protein extracts with PTH mRNA probe resulted in three specific protected bands (Fig. 3). The sizes of the proteins, which were estimated by running molecular mass markers, were approximately 110, 60, and 50 kDa (see Fig. 3). When the reaction mix was treated with proteinase K, there were no bands detected (not shown), indicating that protein binding had protected the radiolabeled PTH mRNA sequences. Excess unlabeled PTH mRNA competed for binding of the radiolabeled PTH mRNA (see Fig. 5, last three lanes). These results indicate that there is specific binding of protein(s) to the PTH mRNA.Figure 5Competition experiment for parathyroid protein binding to the full-length PTH mRNA probe with unlabeled PTH RNA. Parathyroid proteins were incubated with the full-length PTH mRNA probe and increasing amounts of unlabeled PTH mRNA without the terminal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR, or with the unlabeled full-length RNA and analyzed by UV cross-linking.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if this binding has a role in the regulation of PTH mRNA levels by calcium and phosphate, RNA protein binding was analyzed with proteins from hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats. Parathyroid proteins from rats fed a normal diet, a low calcium diet, or a low phosphate diet for 2 weeks were incubated with PTH mRNA probe and analyzed by UV cross-linking. RNA protein binding was increased by proteins from the hypocalcemic rats and decreased by proteins from the hypophosphatemic rats (Fig. 3 A). Proteins isolated from rat brain and liver (Fig. 3 B), thyroid, muscle, spleen, and heart (not shown) also showed the same binding pattern as the parathyroid. Proteins from brain of hypophosphatemic rats showed the same levels of binding as did control rats (Fig. 3 B). The intensity of binding to proteins from brain was consistently higher than other tissues. Proteins from liver of hypocalcemic rats did not lead to increased RNA binding (Fig. 3 B). There was also no difference in binding of proteins from thyroid of hypophosphatemic and hypocalcemic rats (not shown). These results show that the increased binding to PTH mRNA in hypocalcemia and the decreased binding in hypophosphatemia are specific to parathyroid proteins and do not occur in other tissues studied. To determine which region of the PTH mRNA bound the cytoplasmic proteins, shorter PTH mRNA constructs were prepared. The PTH cDNA consists of three exons (13Kemper B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Google Scholar, 18Kronenberg H.M. McDevitt B.E. Majzoub J.A. Nathans J. Sharp P.A. Potts J.T.J. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4981-4985Google Scholar, 19Schmelzer H.J. Gross G. Widera G. Mayer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6740Google Scholar, 20Vasicek T.J. McDevitt B.E. Freeman M.W. Fennick B.J. Hendy G.N. Potts J.T.J. Rich A. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2127-2131Google Scholar). Exon I codes for the 5′-UTR, exon II for most of the prepro sequence of prepro-PTH mRNA, and exon III for the PTH structural gene and the 3′-UTR. A restriction map of the rat PTH cDNA is shown in Fig. 4, as well as the sites of restriction enzyme cleavage used to prepare the different RNA probes: probe A, the full-length PTH mRNA; probe B, consisting of exon I, II, and part of exon III designed to exclude 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR; probe C, consisting of exon I, II, and part of exon III designed to exclude the complete 3′-UTR; probe D, consisting of exons I and II; probe E, consisting of exon I.Probe F for the 3′-UTR RNA was transcribed from a polymerase chain reaction product (Fig. 4). A radiolabeled riboprobe of part of the PTH mRNA spanning the 5′-UTR, the coding region of the gene, and most of the 3′-UTR excluding about 60 nucleotides (probe B) did not bind any proteins (Figs. 4 and 6). Probe C, representing exons I, II, and the translated region of exon III; probe D, representing exons I and II; and probe E, representing the 5′-UTR of exon I, also showed no binding (not shown). However, a probe representing only the 3′-UTR (probe F) bound parathyroid cytoplasmic proteins with the same pattern as the full-length mRNA, indicating that this was the region to which the proteins bound. The sizes of the proteins were the same size as when the full-length probe was studied (Figs. 3, 5, and 6). The specificity of the binding to the 3′-UTR was confirmed by competition experiments (Fig. 5). The addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled RNA which excluded the terminal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR did not compete with protein binding of the full-length PTH mRNA at 100 × concentration, and showed a moderate competition at higher concentrations (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). However, the full-length unlabeled RNA competed for binding even at low concentrations (10 ×) (Fig. 5, last three lanes). This confirms the specificity of the binding to the 3′-UTR and shows that the terminal 60 nucleotides are necessary for binding. Fig. 6 demonstrates that a probe excluding the terminal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR (probe B) did not bind any parathyroid proteins. In addition, a 3′-UTR probe (probe F) showed the same binding pattern size as the full-length probe, with three RNA-protein bands of the same size (Fig. 6). Moreover, protein-RNA binding to the 3′-UTR with parathyroid proteins from hypocalcemic rats was markedly increased (Fig. 6). Proteins from rats fed a low phosphate diet for 2 weeks showed decreased binding (Fig. 6). Proteins from brain, liver, and thyroid of hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats did not lead to changes in binding to the 3′-UTR (not shown). These results are the same as for the full-length probe (Fig. 3, A and B). Identical results were found in three repeat experiments using protein pools from different rats. It should be noted that the intensity of the three bands differed among experiments; however, the specificity of the binding was constant and was always regulated by dietary calcium and phosphate with proteins from the parathyroid. To characterize the differences in binding of parathyroid proteins from rats on the different diets to PTH mRNA, the binding was performed with increasing concentrations of the full-length RNA probe. Binding was analyzed by UV cross-linking experiments and the autoradiograms quantified by densitometry of the three bands together (Fig. 7). The proteins from hypocalcemic rats showed greater binding than controls at all RNA probe concentrations. The binding of proteins from hypocalcemic rats reached a plateau at 1.0 ng of RNA. The proteins from rats fed a low phosphate diet showed decreased binding at all probe concentrations studied (Fig. 7). A plateau of RNA-protein binding was not reached with the control and low phosphate proteins, because increases in the amount of probe above 2 ng resulted in high levels of background, which prevented the accurate measurement of binding. Attempts to decrease the specific activity of the probe did not improve the resolution. For this reason, it was not possible to determine the maximum binding of the control and low phosphate protein preparations. Degradation assays were performed by incubating PTH RNA transcripts with cytoplasmic extracts at room temperature and measuring the amount of undegraded transcript remaining at different time intervals. After addition of the proteins from rats on a control diet to the full-length PTH mRNA, the transcript was still intact at 40 min (Fig. 8, A and B). Hypocalcemic parathyroid proteins led to an intact transcript for a much longer period (180 min). When proteins from hypophosphatemic rats were added, the decrease was dramatic and already evident at 5 min (Fig. 8, A and B). Cytosolic proteins from the livers of these hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats did not show any differences in PTH transcript degradation (not shown). The mRNA transcripts without the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4,probe C) and without the terminal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4, probe B), were not degraded at all until 180 min, with proteins from rats fed normal, low calcium (not shown) as well as a low phosphate diet (Fig. 8 C). This is in contrast to the rapid degradation of the full-length transcript (probe A) by the low phosphate parathyroid proteins (Fig. 8 C). These results suggest that there are instability regions in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR which are degraded by parathyroid cytosolic proteins, and appreciably more with proteins from hypophosphatemic rats than hypocalcemic and control rats. The instability region is the same sequence of RNA, which is necessary for protein binding, suggesting that the binding protects the RNA from degradation. Translation of the PTH mRNA in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay resulted in a single product of molecular mass 17 kDa (not shown). There was no difference in the amount of PTH protein synthesized in the presence of parathyroid cytosol proteins from normal, hypocalcemic, and hypophosphatemic rats, indicating that in this assay there is no translational regulation by dietary calcium and phosphate. The translation was performed for 0.5 and 2.0 h to ensure that a difference at a short time interval would be detected. The present studies have defined the time sequence with which weanling rats develop hypocalcemia and increase their serum PTH and PTH mRNA levels. To determine whether the increased PTH gene expression was transcriptional or post-transcriptional, nuclear transcript run-ons were performed. Transcription rates were the same in nuclei from rats fed a normal or low calcium diet, in contrast to the 10-fold increase in PTH mRNA levels. Therefore, the effect of hypocalcemia to increase PTH mRNA levels in vivo is predominantly post-transcriptional. The marked decrease in PTH mRNA levels in hypophosphatemic rats is also post-transcriptional (8Kilav R. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 327-333Google Scholar). Further studies were performed to determine the role of protein-RNA interactions in these post-transcriptional effects. A full-length radiolabeled PTH cDNA riboprobe incubated with rat parathyroid cytoplasmic proteins as well as other tissues resulted in three specific protein-RNA bands after UV cross-linking of the RNA-protein complexes. UV cross-linking enables the sizes of the proteins which bind the RNA to be estimated. In this method RNase treatment leaves only a small portion of the RNA, which is protected by the bound protein. This enables a reasonably accurate estimate of the size of the bound proteins, which were about 50, 60, and 110 kDa. This raises the possibility that the larger 110-kDa protein represents a heterodimer or a homodimer of the smaller proteins. Parathyroid proteins from hypocalcemic rats had an increase in RNA binding, and proteins from hypophosphatemic rats decreased binding. The changes in binding may represent both changes in the affinity and the amount of the RNA binding proteins, but to differentiate between these two possibilities requires a more purified protein preparation. It is clear from these studies that proteins from hypocalcemic rats bind PTH mRNA much more than proteins from hypophosphatemic rats. Proteins from brain, liver, muscle, spleen, and thyroid showed the same binding pattern as did parathyroid proteins, but in contrast the binding was not affected by the different diets. The region of the PTH mRNA that bound cytoplasmic proteins was determined by using different PTH cDNA constructs, and it was found to be specific to the 3′-UTR of the RNA. Furthermore, a probe that lacked 60 nucleotides of the 3′ end of the mRNA did not bind proteins. This suggests that this region is important for protein binding. Further studies are needed to determine if this is the binding site. The 3′-UTR itself was sufficient for protein binding and showed the same binding pattern as the full-length mRNA probe. Proteins from hypocalcemic rats increased the binding to the 3′-UTR, and proteins from hypophosphatemic rats decreased the binding to the 3′-UTR, as for the full-length probe. These results confirm the importance of this region for protein binding. There is no parathyroid cell line to measure PTH mRNA half-lifein vitro; however, the effect of parathyroid cytosolic proteins to degrade PTH mRNA can be studied by an in vitro degradation assay. This assay has been used to define the post-transcriptional regulation of other mRNAs, such as vascular endothelial growth factor by hypoxia (17Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Google Scholar, 21Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Google Scholar). After addition of the proteins from rats on a control diet to the full-length PTH mRNA, the transcript was still intact at 40 min. After proteins from hypophosphatemic rats were added, the decrease was dramatic and evident as early as 5 min, reaching 20% of the initial transcript. Hypocalcemic parathyroid proteins led to an intact transcript up to 180 min. The mRNA transcript without the 3′-UTR was not degraded at all, with proteins from rats fed normal as well as a low phosphate diet. These results suggest that there are instability regions in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR, which are degraded by parathyroid cytosolic proteins. In addition to proteins that degrade RNA, the cytosolic protein preparation includes the proteins that bind to the PTH mRNA to stabilize it. The mRNA half-life in vivo and in vitro is determined by both these degrading and stabilizing proteins. Parathyroid proteins from hypocalcemic rats protect the PTH mRNA from degradation, possibly by the increased binding to the 3′-UTR. Hypophosphatemic parathyroid proteins led to a rapid degradation of the PTH mRNA, which may be related to the decreased binding to the 3′-UTR. Deletion of the 3′-UTR stabilizes the RNA even in the presence of hypophosphatemic proteins. There was no difference in the degradation of PTH mRNA with cytosolic proteins from the livers of these hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats, indicating the specificity of the parathyroid's response to hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia. There are well characterized paradigms of protein-RNA interactions determining mRNA stability (22Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1989; 246: 870-872Google Scholar). An example is the effect of iron on the transferrin receptor mRNA stability and ferritin translation (23Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar, 24Klausner R.D. Rouault T.R. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Google Scholar, 25Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Google Scholar). There are also several genes which have hormone-induced changes in mRNA stability such as thyrotropin β-subunit (26Leedman P.J. Stein A.R. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 375-387Google Scholar), growth hormone (27Paek I. Axel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1496-1507Google Scholar), vitellogenin (28Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Google Scholar), and vasopressin (29Carrazana E.J. Pasieka K.B. Majzoub J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2267-2274Google Scholar). To this group should now be added the regulation of PTH mRNA by proteins from hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats, where the RNA-binding trans-acting factors remain to be identified. Serum calcium and phosphate determine PTH mRNA levels by regulating the binding of proteins to the 3′-UTR of the PTH mRNA. Identification of the proteins that determine PTH mRNA stability will help us to understand how calcium and phosphate regulate the PTH gene.

https://openalex.org/W2081642673,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important second messengers for the induction of several genes in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation has recently been shown to generate lipid peroxidation products and hydroxyl radicals (HO⋅) with detrimental long term effects like cancer formation and premature aging of the skin. Here, we addressed the question of whether ferric/ferrous iron via the generation of ROS may mediate the UVB response, finally leading to connective tissue degradation, a hallmark in carcinogenesis and aging. Therefore, we studied the involvement of iron and ROS in the modulation of Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) activity, c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels, key signaling steps in the transcriptional control of matrix-degrading metalloprotease (MMP)-1/interstitial collagenase and MMP-3/stromelysin-1 after UVB irradiation of human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. The iron-driven generation of lipid peroxides and hydroxyl radicals were identified as early events in the downstream signaling pathway of the UVB response leading to a 15-fold increase in JNK2 activity, a 3.5-fold increase in c-jun, to a 6-fold increase in MMP-1, and a 3.8-fold increase in MMP-3 mRNA levels, while virtually no alteration of c-fos mRNA levels were observed. Diminished generation of reactive oxygen species resulted in a significant reduction of JNK2 activity, c-jun, MMP-1, and MMP-3 mRNA levels after UVB irradiation compared with UVB-irradiated cells. Collectively, we have identified the iron-driven Fenton reaction and lipid peroxidation as possible central mechanisms underlying signal transduction of the UVB response.

Collectively, we have identified the iron-driven Fenton reaction and lipid peroxidation as possible central mechanisms underlying signal transduction of the UVB response. Cells have evolved exclusive regulatory networks for the most common heavy metal, iron, which plays an ambivalent role in biology. While iron is required as cofactor for many biological reactions, its toxicity threatens cellular integrity (1Hentze M.W. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 1. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1995: 241-265Google Scholar). Besides a transferrin-independent iron-uptake at the cellular level, the transferrin/ferritin system as a post-transcriptional regulatory circuit has evolved that coordinates iron uptake, storage, and utilization by involvement of the iron regulatory protein (2Jaffrey S.R. Haile D.J. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4627-4631Google Scholar, 3Melefors Ö. Hentze M.W. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 251-258Google Scholar, 4Oshiro S. Nakamura Y. Ishige R. Hori M. Nakajima H. Gahl W.A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 849-852Google Scholar). At the molecular level, a well regulated equilibrium between mainly stored and less “free” ferric/ferrous iron positively influences ribonucleotide reductase in several cell lines, which catalyzes reduction of the four common ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, an essential step in DNA synthesis, normal cell growth, and viability (5Burdon R.H. Gill V. Rice-Evans C. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 7: 149-159Google Scholar, 6Haq R.U. Werely J.P. Chitambar C.R. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 428-432Google Scholar). Furthermore, in many cell lines iron is involved in the regulation of the protein kinase C gene expression, which plays a central role in signal transduction pathways (7Alcantara O. Obeid L. Hannun Y. Ponka P. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3510-3517Google Scholar). Iron exerts its toxicity through a series of reactions with reactive oxygen species called the modified Haber-Weiss or Fenton reaction (Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + [H2O2−] → HO⋅ + HO−), generating the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (HO⋅). The generation of hydroxyl radicals via Fenton chemistry represents one of the most important mechanisms in various pathological conditions. Hydroxyl radicals can lead to DNA damage and impairment of normal DNA and protein synthesis and cell proliferation and thus has been thought to be causally involved in the multistep process of carcinogenesis (8Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 56-63Google Scholar, 9Spear N. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 111-116Google Scholar). Furthermore, ferrous/ferric iron has a decisive function in lipid peroxidation processes by direct reaction with unsaturated fatty acids or reaction with preformed lipid hydroperoxides to form chain-carrying alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals, leading to severe damage of cellular integrity (10Cheeseman K.H. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. DNA and Free Radicals. Ellis Horwood, New York, London1993: 109-144Google Scholar, 11Schaich K.M. Lipids. 1992; 27: 209-218Google Scholar, 12Minotti G. Aust S.D. Lipids. 1992; 27: 219-226Google Scholar, 13Lin F. Girotti A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 714-723Google Scholar). In addition, the initiation of lipid peroxidation often depends on the occurrence of the HO⋅radical, suggesting that iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction and lipid peroxidation processes work in cooperation (14Babbs C.F. Steiner M.G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 471-485Google Scholar, 15Van Lenten B.J. Prieve J. Navab M. Hama S. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2104-2110Google Scholar).

Atsumi T. Sakurai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 474-479Google Scholar, 17Perez S. Sergent O. Morel P. Chevanne M. Dubos M.P. Cillard P. Cillard J. CR Sceanes Soc. Biol. Fil. 1995; 189: 453-465Google Scholar). The iron content is substantially elevated over basal levels in the skin of mice exposed to UVB irradiation and in the skin of sun-exposed body sites of healthy individuals (18Bissett D.L. Chatterjee R. Hannon D.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 215-223Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism appears to be the UVB-dependent formation of the superoxide radical (O·̄2) (19Masaki H. Atsumi T. Sakurai H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1995; 10: 25-34Google Scholar) and its attack on ferritin, resulting in release and mobilization of “free” iron (20Biemond P. Swakk A.J.G. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1988; 4: 185-198Google Scholar). Furthermore, O·̄2 can react to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which again enters the Fenton reaction (16Masaki H. Atsumi T. Sakurai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 474-479Google Scholar). Therefore, in actinically damaged skin, the significantly increased iron content may drive the production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent tissue damage and long term consequences like cancer (21Cerutti P.A. Lancet. 1994; 344: 862-863Google Scholar) or premature aging of the skin (22Black H.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 213-221Google Scholar). UV-inducible genes involved in these pathological conditions comprise several proteases, among them matrix-degrading metalloproteases (MMPs), which contribute to degradation of connective tissue compounds (23Gilchrest B.A. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1989; 21: 610-613Google Scholar, 24Scharffetter K. Wlaschek M. Hogg A. Bolsen K. Schothorst A. Goerz G. Krieg T. Plewig G. Arch. Dermatol.

Due to promotor similarities, a variety of matrix-degrading metalloproteases, like the interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) (30Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tan E.M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Google Scholar), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) (31Sawamura D. Ohta T. Hanada K. Ishikawa H. Tamai K. Yazima H. Meng X. Nomura K. Hashimoto I. Mauviel A. Uitto J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 288: 628-632Google Scholar), and matrilysin (MMP-7) (32Gaire M. Magbanua Z. McDonnell S. McNeil L. Lovett D.H. Matrisian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Google Scholar), have been shown to be similarly regulated in different experimental settings. Accordingly, MMP-1 and MMP-3 have been found to be similarly induced upon UVA and UVB irradiation (27Herrmann G. Wlaschek M. Lange T.S. Prenzel K. Goerz G. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Dermatol. 1993; 2: 92-97Google Scholar, 29Brenneisen P. Oh J. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Briviba K. Hommel C. Herrmann G. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Photochem.

The promotor of MMP-1 carries five AP-1 sites (30Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tan E.M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Google Scholar), and that of MMP-3 has a single AP-1 site (31Sawamura D. Ohta T. Hanada K. Ishikawa H. Tamai K. Yazima H. Meng X. Nomura K. Hashimoto I. Mauviel A. Uitto J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 288: 628-632Google Scholar); these sites are transactivated by binding of the newly synthesized and heterodimerized Fos and Jun, which constitute the AP-1 transcription factor (33Fisher G.J. Datta S.C. Talwar H.S. Wang Z.-Q. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 335-339Google Scholar, 34Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of AP-1 activity is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (35Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar), among them the two extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK-1, ERK-2) and the Fos-regulating kinase. These kinases exert their activating effects on c-fos transcription via phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor (TCF) and c-Fos, respectively. The ternary complex is composed of the serum response element, a serum response factor, and a ternary complex factor (TCF) such as Elk-1, which by itself cannot bind to the serum response element and is recruited to the ternary complex by the serum response factor (36Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Google Scholar). This ternary complex is responsible for c-fostranscription and, thus, also for the transcriptional regulation of AP-1 activity (for a review, see Ref. 37Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 by ERKs was reported to facilitate the formation of the ternary complex and to further stimulate its ability to activate c-fostranscription (38Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar). There is some evidence that ROS are involved in activation of ERKs preceding phosphorylation of the TCF/Elk-1 (39Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1, JNK2) phosphorylate both components of the heterodimeric c-Jun/ATF2 (activating transcription factor), responsible for c-juntranscription, and c-Jun of the AP-1 complex (35Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar, 40Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Google Scholar, 41Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Google Scholar). Research on the regulation of the activity of kinases, of c-jun and of c-fos transcription by extracellular and environmental stimuli like growth factors and ROS, is a matter of increasing interest and relevance (42Janknecht R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Google Scholar, 43Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Google Scholar, 44Lee S.F. Huang Y.T. Wu W.S. Lin J.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 437-448Google Scholar), since it may provide ultimate clues for mechanisms underlying connective tissue degradation in pathological states. In view of the compelling evidence for an increase in the intensity of UVB irradiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion (45Lloyd S.A. Lancet. 1993; 342: 11156-11160Google Scholar), we have focused our studies on the regulation of the UVB induction of two major matrix-degrading metalloproteases, the interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). While MMP-1 mainly cleaves interstitial collagens, the major structural components of the dermis, MMP-3 preferentially degrades proteoglycans as well as structural glycoproteins (25Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Wlaschek M. Bolsen K. Herrmann G. Lehmann P. Goerz G. Mauch C. Plewig G. Plewig G. Marks R. The Environmental Threat to the Skin. Martin Dunitz Publishers, London1992: 72-82Google Scholar). Here, we provide circumstantial evidence that the iron-driven generation of hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxides substantially affects JNK2 activity and c-jun transcription, two key steps of the signaling pathway, leading to MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA induction after UVB irradiation, while c-fostranscription is unaffected. In addition, we have outlined preventive strategies that may stimulate further development of protective agents to prevent iron-dependent pathological processes such as photoaging and tumor progression. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), an inhibitor of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase; buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an indirect inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase; aminotriazol (ATZ), an inhibitor of catalase; butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and vitamin E derivative Trolox, both inhibitors of lipid peroxidation; Me2SO and mannitol, both scavengers of hydroxyl radicals; Fe(III) citrate; and the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Fe(OH)3-dextrin was obtained from Asta-Werke (Bielefeld, Germany). The iron chelatorN-2-hydroxybenzylN′-benzylethylenediaminediacetic acid (HBED) (46Dean R.T. Nicholson P. Free Radical Res. 1994; 20: 83-101Google Scholar) was provided by H. Sies. The MMP-1 probe used was a 920-base pairHindIII/SmaI fragment of human collagenase cDNA (47Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Pöting A. Lücke-Huhle C. Herrlich P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 351-360Google Scholar), and the MMP-3 probe was a 160-base pairEcoRI/XbaI cDNA fragment of human stromelysin-1 (48Sirum K.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8691-8698Google Scholar). The probe for c-jun was a 1400-base pairHindIII/BamHI fragment of the cDNA clone hcJ-1 (49Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Google Scholar), and the probe for c-fos was an 800-base pairBglII/NcoI fragment originally inserted in pUC 18 (50Angel P. Smeal T. Meek J. Karin M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 35-43Google Scholar). A 24-mer oligonucleotide (5′-ACG GTA TCT GAT CGT CTT CGA ACC-3′) (51Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Google Scholar) for the 18 S rRNA was synthesized (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Dermal foreskin fibroblasts were established by outgrowth from biopsies of healthy human donors (52Fleischmajer R. Perlish J.S. Krieg T. Timpl R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 76: 400-403Google Scholar) with an average age between 3 and 6 years and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (400 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), but without sodium ascorbate, and grown on plastic tissue culture dishes in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were used at passages 7–16, corresponding to cumulative population doubling levels 14–34 (53Bayreuther K. Francz P.I. Rodemann H.P. Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 1992; (Suppl. 3): 47-74Google Scholar, 54Brenneisen P. Gogol J. Bayreuther K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 219-230Google Scholar). Confluent cells were preincubated for 18 h with different chemical compounds, subsequently irradiated with total UVB at a dose of 200 J/m2 (29Brenneisen P. Oh J. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Briviba K. Hommel C. Herrmann G. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 649-657Google Scholar), and incubated for 24 h prior to Northern blot analysis. A 1000-watt xenon high pressure UV source was used in conjunction with a monochromator with holographic grating (Dermolum UMW, Fa. Müller, Moosinning, Germany). For the experiments, the total UVB spectrum (280–320 nm) was used. Fluence rates were determined by an integrated thermopile that is equally sensitive in the range from 270 up to 4000 nm. The dose rates on the cell surface were 3.4 milliwatts/cm2 for the total UVB spectrum. To guarantee a constant intensity and spectral distribution, dosimetry and spectroradiometric analyses were performed prior to experiments with an OL-754 UV/visible light spectroradiometer (Optronic, Orlando, FL). Confluent fibroblast monolayer cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and all irradiations were performed under a thin layer of phosphate-buffered saline. There was negligible loss in viability of cell populations compared with cells held under similar conditions without irradiation. Following UV irradiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and supplements for various periods of time. The viability of the dermal fibroblasts was measured 48 h after incubation with BSO, DDC, ATZ, DFO, HBED, Fe(III) citrate, Fe(OH)3-dextrin, mannitol, Me2SO, and Trolox. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) was used for the quantification of living metabolically active cells. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases metabolize MTT to purple formazan dye (55Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of formazan formation in cells treated with the agents compared with mock-treated cells. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with specific cDNA probes or oligonucleotides for interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), c-fos, c-jun, and 18 S rRNA as described elsewhere (27Herrmann G. Wlaschek M. Lange T.S. Prenzel K. Goerz G. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Dermatol. 1993; 2: 92-97Google Scholar, 29Brenneisen P. Oh J. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Briviba K. Hommel C. Herrmann G. Sies H.

Briefly, after extraction of total RNA, equal amounts (5 μg/lane) were fractionated on a 0.9% 2.2 m formaldehyde/agarose gel. After diffusion transfer to nitrocellulose filters and vacuum baking (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), hybridizations were performed using denatured α-32P-labeled cDNA probes. For 3′-end labeling of the 24-mer 18 S rRNA probe, 5 × terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer (0.5 m potassium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 10 mm cobalt chloride (CoCl2), 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 pmol of 3′-ends (equal to 80 ng of DNA of the 24-mer), 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP/μl of reaction volume, and 1 unit/μl terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Sequential hybridizations with different probes were performed. Densitometric analysis was carried out using the ScanPackII system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Lipid peroxidation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) with minor modifications. 4–5 × 106 cells were collected in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 μm BHT 0.5 h after irradiation and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and sonicated in 250 μl of sterile H2O. Total protein content was determined according to the Bradford-DC protocol (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). 200-μl samples were added to 650 μl of a solution consisting of 3 volumes of 10.3 mm N-methyl-2-phenylindole in acetonitrile and 1 volume of 100% methanol and vortexed. Subsequently, 150 μl of 15.4 mm methanesulfonic acid was added, and the mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 40 min. The reaction was stopped on ice, and the absorbance (A) of the blue to purple color was measured at 568 nm. The equation MDA + 4-HNE = A × 5/ε gives the concentration where ε is the apparent molar extinction coefficient obtained from the standard curve. C-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 was immunoprecipitated for 2–3 h on ice from cell lysates (50 μg of total protein in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4), 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) using 10 μl of an anti-JNK2 antiserum (rabbit; diluted 1:10 in distilled water), which we gratefully received from P. E. Shaw (Nottingham, United Kingdom). Immune complexes were collected at 4 °C overnight with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia) preequilibrated in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. The pelleted immune complex/Protein A conglomerate was washed with both ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer and kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) three times each. 35 μl of kinase buffer was added to the pellets, followed by 5 μl of 150 μm ATP, 6 μl (1 μg/μl) glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (residues 1–79, 37 kDa) fusion protein (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany) (57Hibi M. Li A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Gen. Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar), and 5 μl (5 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/μmol). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 25 min and repeatedly vortexed during this incubation time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer (58Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) followed by denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After the gel was dried, the phosphorylated JNK2 substrate glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun was identified by autoradiography. We intended to avoid interference of cytotoxicity from chemical agents. Therefore, the MTT assay was used to determine the optimal concentrations at which more than 75% of the mitotic fibroblasts survived at least 48 h after incubation with the different agents with no change in morphology (Fig. 1,A–C). The optimal concentration for both iron chelators DFO and HBED (46Dean R.T. Nicholson P. Free Radical Res. 1994; 20: 83-101Google Scholar) and for the iron(III) compounds Fe(OH)3-dextrin and Fe(III) citrate was 1 mm(Fig. 1 A). For the hydroxyl radical scavengers, Me2SO (DMSO in figures) and mannitol concentrations of 30 and 3 mm, respectively, fit the above mentioned requirement (Fig. 1 B). Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E derivative with chain-breaking capacity for lipid peroxidation, was used at a concentration of 100 μm, and BHT was used at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1 C). DDC, an inhibitor of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, was used at a concentration of 10 μm, and ATZ, the catalase-inhibiting agent, was used at a concentration of 50 μm. BSO, the agent indirectly inhibiting the glutathione peroxidase, was used at a concentration of 50 μm(59Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 515-524Google Scholar). We have used several experimental approaches to study the role of intracellular reactive oxygen species and iron in the signal transduction pathway of the UVB response in terms of MMP-1 and MMP-3 induction. First, the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase was inhibited with diethyl dithiocarbamate, thus increasing the intracellular concentration of superoxide anions. Second, the enzymes that detoxify intracellular hydrogen peroxide like the catalase and, independently, the glutathione peroxidase were inhibited with aminotriazol (for inhibition of catalase) and buthionine sulfoximine (for indirect inhibition of glutathione peroxidase). Both inhibitors have been used alone and in combination, leading to an increase in the concentration of intracellular hydrogen peroxide. Third, iron chelators, like DFO or HBED have been used to block the Fenton reaction, resulting in a decrease in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxides. Mechanistically, the Fenton reaction strongly depends on the presence of unchelated iron, in that ferrous iron (Fe2+) becomes oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+) by hydrogen peroxide, thereby generating the highly aggressive hydroxyl radical, which exerts its toxicity and modulatory effects on gene expression mainly via the initiation of lipid peroxidation processes (12Minotti G. Aust S.D. Lipids. 1992; 27: 219-226Google Scholar). Therefore, depletion of iron by chelating agents (desferrioxamine and others) is supposed to completely abrogate the formation of hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxides, at least if generated by the Fenton reaction. To study the role of the iron-driven Fenton reaction in the UVB-dependent up-regulation of matrix-degrading metalloproteases, confluent fibroblast monolayer cultures were preincubated with the above mentioned different chemical agents in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h, subsequently irradiated with UVB at a dose of 200 J/m2 (29Brenneisen P. Oh J. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Briviba K. Hommel C. Herrmann G. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 649-657Google Scholar), and subjected to Northern blot analysis and densitometry (Fig. 2, A and B). A further increase in intracellular superoxide anions or hydrogen peroxide via the inhibition of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase by DDC or of catalase or glutathione peroxidase by ATZ or BSO, respectively, did not enhance the UVB-dependent MMP-1 response (Fig. 2,A and B); rather, the MMP-1 mRNA levels were slightly, although not significantly, diminished compared with that of the UVB-irradiated control (p ≥ 0.07). However, the iron-chelating agent DFO alone or in any combination with other compounds significantly reduced the MMP-1 mRNA levels to 85% compared with the level of UVB-irradiated cells, which was set at 100% (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained by the iron chelator HBED (data not shown). In a previous paper (59Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 515-524Google Scholar), buthionine sulfoximine at the used concentration extremely reduced total glutathione and, thus, severely impaired the function of the classic glutathione peroxidase in dermal fibroblasts. Depending on the cell type, aminotriazol was demonstrated to significantly abrogate catalase activity by 80–90% (60Aalto K. Raivio"

As a follow up we wished to test the hypothesis that metabolic oxidative stress was the causative process or at least the link between causative processes behind the cytotoxicity. In the studies described here, we demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated within 3 min of being in glucose-free medium and remained activated for 3 h. Glucose deprivation for 2–4 h also caused oxidative stress as evidenced by a 3-fold greater steady state concentration of oxidized glutathione and a 3-fold increase in pro-oxidant production. Glucose and glutamate treatment rapidly suppressed MAPK activation and rescued cells from cytotoxicity. Glutamate and the peroxide scavenger, pyruvate, rescued the cells from cell killing as well as suppressed pro-oxidant production. In addition the thiol antioxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, rescued cells from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and suppressed MAPK activation.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Google Scholar), the hypothesis that glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and alterations in MAPK signal transduction could result from metabolic oxidative stress was tested. Metabolic oxidative stress is defined as oxidative stress generated by mitochondrial biochemical pathways.MAPK, also known as extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERKs), are serine/threonine kinases (7Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Google Scholar). Three MAPK homologs have been identified in mammalian cells as follows: ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3 (7Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N.

The MAPK pathway is activated by various growth factors (8Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Google Scholar, 9Oliver B.L. Sha'afi R.I. Hajjar J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

MAPK activation appears to involve extracellular signals including oxidants stimulating the formation of active Ras, GTP (12Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Google Scholar, 13Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Google Scholar). The GTP-bound Ras protein binds to Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase cascade that leads to MAPK activation (14Merrall N.W. Plevin R.J. Stokoe D. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 351-355Google Scholar, 15Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Google Scholar). Activated MAPK is believed to translocate into the nucleus (16Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Google Scholar) and phosphorylate nuclear substrates including redox regulated transcription factors believed to be involved with cellular responses to oxidative stress (e.g. ternary complex factor Elk-1, c-Myc, and c-Fos) (9Oliver B.L.

Davies K.J. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 21: 521-525Google Scholar). Therefore, the MAPK pathway appears to be activated in response to oxidative stress and could be involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress.Glucose metabolism has been shown to be involved with cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated by hydroperoxides (22Averill-Bates D.A. Przybytkowski E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Google Scholar) presumably via the formation of pyruvate and NADPH. Furthermore, superoxide and hydroperoxides (i.e.H2O2) have been shown to be produced as by-products of mitochondrial respiration (23Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Google Scholar). Since mitochondrial metabolism would be the preferred route of energy production during glucose deprivation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that glucose deprivation would create a metabolic state where superoxide and hydroperoxide concentrations were increased and peroxide scavenging via pyruvate as well as NADPH-dependent reactions was decreased. This would be expected to result in a condition of metabolic oxidative stress characterized by increased levels of pro-oxidant production and increased levels of oxidized glutathione.In this report, we demonstrate that glucose deprivation-induced cell death in MCF-7/ADR is accompanied by activation of the MAPK pathway as well as oxidative stress as evidenced by significant increases in intracellular oxidized glutathione content and pro-oxidant production. Glucose or glutamate treatment shortened the duration of MAPK activation and rescued cells from cytotoxicity indicating that cellular metabolism was integrally related to both processes. In addition pyruvate (a known peroxide scavenger) as well as glutamate rescued MCF-7/ADR from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and suppressed pro-oxidant production. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a well known thiol antioxidant, also protected cells from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and prevented prolonged activation of MAPK, suggesting that oxidative stress was causally related to both processes. These findings support the hypothesis that glucose deprivation causes an increase in the steady state levels of intracellular pro-oxidants (presumably hydroperoxides) resulting in metabolic oxidative stress which triggers MAPK activation in MCF-7/ADR cells. The increase in oxidative stress also appears to account for the cytotoxicity seen during prolonged periods of glucose deprivation in MCF-7/ADR.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this work is that glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress appears to account for the cytotoxicity and alterations in MAPK signal transduction which were observed in MCF-7/ADR cells. The source of the increased pro-oxidant production caused by glucose deprivation is currently unknown, but several observations support the hypothesis that intracellular hydroperoxide production (i.e. hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxides) by mitochondrial metabolism may be involved. First, glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress clearly involves a disruption in the steady state levels of total and reduced glutathione levels in the MCF-7/ADR cells (Table II). This suggests that cells exposed to glucose deprivation are increasing glutathione synthesis in an attempt to counteract the increased production of intracellular pro-oxidant(s). In addition, it is clear that the increase in glutathione content is not sufficient to counteract the pro-oxidant production. This is evident by significant increases in oxidized glutathione and hydroperoxide production during the first 4 h of deprivation and significant cytotoxicity during the same time. Second, the most direct pathway to obtain elevated levels of oxidized glutathione is through the action of glutathione peroxidases. These enzymes metabolize H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides ROOH at the expense of reduced glutathione, with two molecules of GSH being consumed and one molecule of GSSG formed for each molecule of hydroperoxide which is decomposed. Glutathione reductase then uses the reducing equivalents in NADPH to reduce GSSG back to GSH. In most mammalian cells exhibiting steady state metabolism of O2, the major source of superoxide and H2O2 is thought to be derived from mitochondrial respiration (23Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Google Scholar). Therefore, the most logical explanation for the increases in oxidized glutathione content seen in MCF-7/ADR cells is that the intracellular mitochondrial production of hydroperoxides exceeds the metabolic capabilities of the glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, NADPH system to maintain glutathione in the reduced form, and therefore, oxidized glutathione accumulates. This idea was tested by measuring pro-oxidant production with an oxidation-sensitive dye, and glucose deprivation was shown to lead to an increase in pro-oxidant production (Table II). Furthermore, the increase in pro-oxidant production and cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation was suppressed by addition of an α-ketoacid (pyruvate) which has previously been shown to be an excellent peroxide scavenger (31Nath K.A. Ngo E.O. Hebbel R.P. Croatt A.J. Zhou B. Nutter L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 26: C227-C236Google Scholar).During any condition of oxidative stress the combination of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione reductase represents a major pathway available to cells for reducing hydroperoxide concentration. NADPH production is integrally related to glucose metabolism because glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the entry point for the pentose phosphate cycle to generate NADPH. Since MCF-7/ADR have been shown to have a 3-fold elevation in glycolysis when compared with parental MCF-7 (33Muindi R.J.F. Shoemaker M. Cowan K.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1986; 27: 272Google Scholar, 34Cohen J.S. Lyon R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 508: 216-228Google Scholar) and would be expected to shift to mitochondrial energy production during glucose deprivation, they would be expected to generate substantial amounts of hydroperoxides as a by-product of respiratory activity and use up glucose and NADPH stores rapidly. When the combination of reduced glutathione and NADPH was no longer capable of effectively decomposing hydroperoxides, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity would result from the build-up of intracellular hydroperoxides and oxidized glutathione would accumulate. Our data are therefore completely consistent with the hypothesis that glucose deprivation results in oxidative stress via increased steady state concentrations of hydroperoxides from mitochondrial metabolism. In support of this hypothesis other workers (22Averill-Bates D.A. Przybytkowski E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Google Scholar) have previously provided convincing evidence demonstrating that glucose deprivation results in dramatic cellular sensitization to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous H2O2 exposure.The ability of the thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to completely block both the cytotoxicity and alterations in signal transduction induced by glucose deprivation also supports the assumption that glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress and disruption of thiol metabolism are causally related to the biological effects which were observed. Several possibilities exist for how NAC could be blocking oxidative stress during glucose deprivation. NAC can function directly as an antioxidant to scavenge radicals generated by hydroperoxides undergoing Fenton chemistry. NAC could also increase intracellular cysteine pools which could directly scavenge radicals as well as provide a vital substrate for increased synthesis of glutathione. Finally, by increasing intracellular reduced thiol pools NAC could block oxidative stress-induced changes in signal transduction by maintaining redox-sensitive proteins in their reduced form (35Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Google Scholar).The results of this work showing that glutamate was capable of reversing the glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress and alterations in signal transduction in the MCF-7/ADR cells can also be interpreted in light of the aforementioned hypothesis. It is well known that the energy metabolism of cancer cells is quite different from that of normal cells. Whereas normal cells depend primarily on oxidative phosphorylation to synthesize ATP, in normal steady state conditions, cancer cells demonstrate relatively high rates of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen as well as demonstrating slightly reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation (36Eigenbrodt E. Fister P. Reinacher M. Beitner R. Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 141-179Google Scholar). Moreover, since MCF-7/ADR cells are known to have high rates of glycolysis (33Muindi R.J.F. Shoemaker M. Cowan K.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1986; 27: 272Google Scholar, 34Cohen J.S. Lyon R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 508: 216-228Google Scholar), glucose deprivation would be expected to rapidly impact upon the process of ATP generation as well as NADPH production in these cells due to their rapid utilization of glucose. During glucose deprivation energy generation would be expected to become increasingly dependent upon the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the common central pathway for the degradation of the two-carbon acetyl residues derived not only from carbohydrates but also from fatty acids and amino acids, as well as ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. As previously stated, if metabolism in the glucose-deprived condition was shifted to primarily respiration, the steady state levels of superoxide and hydroperoxides would be expected to increase. Glutamate could therefore rescue the cells from glucose deprivation by directly entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle leading to increased NADH production and increased ATP levels. In addition excess glutamate would be expected to increase the formation of α-ketoacids such as pyruvate which have been shown to be excellent scavengers of hydroperoxides (31Nath K.A. Ngo E.O. Hebbel R.P. Croatt A.J. Zhou B. Nutter L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 26: C227-C236Google Scholar). In fact, our data show that α-ketoacids are capable of suppressing pro-oxidant production as well as cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation (Table II). Glutamate is also required for the first committed step in the synthesis of glutathione catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. By using these different pathways glutamate could rapidly contribute to increased glutathione synthesis, increased peroxide scavenging, as well as ATP and NADH production.Another major finding of this work is that oxidative stress associated with glucose deprivation appears to be capable of causing alterations in signal transduction through the ERK1/ERK2 MAPK pathways that are also reversed by the thiol antioxidant NAC and glutamate. This supports the speculation that alterations in signal transduction caused by hydroperoxide-induced metabolic oxidative stress could represent one possible mechanism by which signal transduction and gene expression are mechanistically linked to metabolism resulting in a diversity of biological effects, including induction of protective responses as well as possible triggers for the cell death signal. In support of this assumption, oxidative stress has been shown by other investigators to trigger signal transduction pathways (3Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Google Scholar, 4Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15Google Scholar, 5Forrest V.J. Kang Y.H. McClain D.E. Robinson D.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Google Scholar), and recent studies also suggest that reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion can play a role in the Ras signaling pathway (13Lander H.M.

Collectively, our studies show that glucose deprivation induces activation of ERK1/ERK2 (this report), Ras, Lyn kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) cascades (38Liu X. Gupta A.K. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11690-11693Google Scholar), all of which could be involved with alterations in gene expression seen during glucose deprivation. The activation of MAPK is clearly associated with oxidative stress during glucose deprivation, and MAPK activation has previously been associated with regulation of glucose transport to supply energy for cell growth and division (14Merrall N.W. Plevin R.J. Stokoe D. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 351-355Google Scholar,39Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence Jr., J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Google Scholar). Our observations therefore suggest that the prolonged activation of MAPK (and the resulting changes in gene expression) caused by metabolic oxidative stress could represent an attempt by the cells to induce protective mechanisms to try and alleviate the cytotoxic effects of glucose deprivation. Likewise, activation of other kinases such as JNK1 could contribute to the induction of cytotoxic responses during glucose deprivation.Since tumor cells in general have been suggested to have a disruption in intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions as well as glycolytic metabolism (40Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Buettner G.R. Med. Hypotheses. 1981; 7: 21-42Google Scholar, 41Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1984; 106: 403-422Google Scholar, 42Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-312Google Scholar), the current results linking glucose metabolism to MAPK signal transduction as well as cytotoxicity via oxidation/reduction reactions may have far reaching implications to understanding the contribution of metabolism to the phenotypic changes associated with cancer as well as suggesting metabolic targets for the design of novel therapeutic interventions. We have previously observed that glucose deprivation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular regulated protein kinases; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular regulated protein kinases; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and induces cell death in multidrug-resistant human breast carcinoma MCF-7/ADR cells (1Gupta A.K.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 681-686Google Scholar). Since activation of MAPK has been suggested to result from oxidative stress (3Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Google Scholar, 4Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15Google Scholar, 5Forrest V.J. Kang Y.H. McClain D.E. Robinson D.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Google Scholar), the hypothesis that glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and alterations in MAPK signal transduction could result from metabolic oxidative stress was tested. Metabolic oxidative stress is defined as oxidative stress generated by mitochondrial biochemical pathways. MAPK, also known as extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERKs), are serine/threonine kinases (7Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Google Scholar). Three MAPK homologs have been identified in mammalian cells as follows: ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3 (7Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 are expressed ubiquitously, and their molecular masses are 44 and 42 kDa, respectively. The MAPK pathway is activated by various growth factors (8Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Google Scholar, 9Oliver B.L. Sha'afi R.I. Hajjar J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 162-170Google Scholar), alterations in intracellular redox state (3Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Google Scholar, 6Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Google Scholar), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (10Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y.S. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Google Scholar, 11Rao G.N. Alexander R.W. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 842-847Google Scholar). MAPK activation appears to involve extracellular signals including oxidants stimulating the formation of active Ras, GTP (12Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Google Scholar, 13Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Google Scholar). The GTP-bound Ras protein binds to Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase cascade that leads to MAPK activation (14Merrall N.W. Plevin R.J. Stokoe D. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 351-355Google Scholar, 15Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Google Scholar). Activated MAPK is believed to translocate into the nucleus (16Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Google Scholar) and phosphorylate nuclear substrates including redox regulated transcription factors believed to be involved with cellular responses to oxidative stress (e.g. ternary complex factor Elk-1, c-Myc, and c-Fos) (9Oliver B.L.

Davies K.J. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 21: 521-525Google Scholar). Therefore, the MAPK pathway appears to be activated in response to oxidative stress and could be involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress. Glucose metabolism has been shown to be involved with cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated by hydroperoxides (22Averill-Bates D.A. Przybytkowski E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Google Scholar) presumably via the formation of pyruvate and NADPH. Furthermore, superoxide and hydroperoxides (i.e.H2O2) have been shown to be produced as by-products of mitochondrial respiration (23Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Google Scholar). Since mitochondrial metabolism would be the preferred route of energy production during glucose deprivation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that glucose deprivation would create a metabolic state where superoxide and hydroperoxide concentrations were increased and peroxide scavenging via pyruvate as well as NADPH-dependent reactions was decreased. This would be expected to result in a condition of metabolic oxidative stress characterized by increased levels of pro-oxidant production and increased levels of oxidized glutathione. In this report, we demonstrate that glucose deprivation-induced cell death in MCF-7/ADR is accompanied by activation of the MAPK pathway as well as oxidative stress as evidenced by significant increases in intracellular oxidized glutathione content and pro-oxidant production. Glucose or glutamate treatment shortened the duration of MAPK activation and rescued cells from cytotoxicity indicating that cellular metabolism was integrally related to both processes. In addition pyruvate (a known peroxide scavenger) as well as glutamate rescued MCF-7/ADR from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and suppressed pro-oxidant production. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a well known thiol antioxidant, also protected cells from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and prevented prolonged activation of MAPK, suggesting that oxidative stress was causally related to both processes. These findings support the hypothesis that glucose deprivation causes an increase in the steady state levels of intracellular pro-oxidants (presumably hydroperoxides) resulting in metabolic oxidative stress which triggers MAPK activation in MCF-7/ADR cells. The increase in oxidative stress also appears to account for the cytotoxicity seen during prolonged periods of glucose deprivation in MCF-7/ADR. DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this work is that glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress appears to account for the cytotoxicity and alterations in MAPK signal transduction which were observed in MCF-7/ADR cells. The source of the increased pro-oxidant production caused by glucose deprivation is currently unknown, but several observations support the hypothesis that intracellular hydroperoxide production (i.e. hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxides) by mitochondrial metabolism may be involved. First, glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress clearly involves a disruption in the steady state levels of total and reduced glutathione levels in the MCF-7/ADR cells (Table II). This suggests that cells exposed to glucose deprivation are increasing glutathione synthesis in an attempt to counteract the increased production of intracellular pro-oxidant(s). In addition, it is clear that the increase in glutathione content is not sufficient to counteract the pro-oxidant production. This is evident by significant increases in oxidized glutathione and hydroperoxide production during the first 4 h of deprivation and significant cytotoxicity during the same time. Second, the most direct pathway to obtain elevated levels of oxidized glutathione is through the action of glutathione peroxidases. These enzymes metabolize H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides ROOH at the expense of reduced glutathione, with two molecules of GSH being consumed and one molecule of GSSG formed for each molecule of hydroperoxide which is decomposed. Glutathione reductase then uses the reducing equivalents in NADPH to reduce GSSG back to GSH. In most mammalian cells exhibiting steady state metabolism of O2, the major source of superoxide and H2O2 is thought to be derived from mitochondrial respiration (23Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Google Scholar). Therefore, the most logical explanation for the increases in oxidized glutathione content seen in MCF-7/ADR cells is that the intracellular mitochondrial production of hydroperoxides exceeds the metabolic capabilities of the glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, NADPH system to maintain glutathione in the reduced form, and therefore, oxidized glutathione accumulates. This idea was tested by measuring pro-oxidant production with an oxidation-sensitive dye, and glucose deprivation was shown to lead to an increase in pro-oxidant production (Table II). Furthermore, the increase in pro-oxidant production and cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation was suppressed by addition of an α-ketoacid (pyruvate) which has previously been shown to be an excellent peroxide scavenger (31Nath K.A. Ngo E.O. Hebbel R.P. Croatt A.J. Zhou B. Nutter L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 26: C227-C236Google Scholar).During any condition of oxidative stress the combination of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione reductase represents a major pathway available to cells for reducing hydroperoxide concentration. NADPH production is integrally related to glucose metabolism because glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the entry point for the pentose phosphate cycle to generate NADPH. Since MCF-7/ADR have been shown to have a 3-fold elevation in glycolysis when compared with parental MCF-7 (33Muindi R.J.F. Shoemaker M. Cowan K.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1986; 27: 272Google Scholar, 34Cohen J.S. Lyon R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 508: 216-228Google Scholar) and would be expected to shift to mitochondrial energy production during glucose deprivation, they would be expected to generate substantial amounts of hydroperoxides as a by-product of respiratory activity and use up glucose and NADPH stores rapidly. When the combination of reduced glutathione and NADPH was no longer capable of effectively decomposing hydroperoxides, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity would result from the build-up of intracellular hydroperoxides and oxidized glutathione would accumulate. Our data are therefore completely consistent with the hypothesis that glucose deprivation results in oxidative stress via increased steady state concentrations of hydroperoxides from mitochondrial metabolism. In support of this hypothesis other workers (22Averill-Bates D.A. Przybytkowski E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Google Scholar) have previously provided convincing evidence demonstrating that glucose deprivation results in dramatic cellular sensitization to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous H2O2 exposure.The ability of the thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to completely block both the cytotoxicity and alterations in signal transduction induced by glucose deprivation also supports the assumption that glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress and disruption of thiol metabolism are causally related to the biological effects which were observed. Several possibilities exist for how NAC could be blocking oxidative stress during glucose deprivation. NAC can function directly as an antioxidant to scavenge radicals generated by hydroperoxides undergoing Fenton chemistry. NAC could also increase intracellular cysteine pools which could directly scavenge radicals as well as provide a vital substrate for increased synthesis of glutathione. Finally, by increasing intracellular reduced thiol pools NAC could block oxidative stress-induced changes in signal transduction by maintaining redox-sensitive proteins in their reduced form (35Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Google Scholar).The results of this work showing that glutamate was capable of reversing the glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress and alterations in signal transduction in the MCF-7/ADR cells can also be interpreted in light of the aforementioned hypothesis. It is well known that the energy metabolism of cancer cells is quite different from that of normal cells. Whereas normal cells depend primarily on oxidative phosphorylation to synthesize ATP, in normal steady state conditions, cancer cells demonstrate relatively high rates of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen as well as demonstrating slightly reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation (36Eigenbrodt E. Fister P. Reinacher M. Beitner R. Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 141-179Google Scholar). Moreover, since MCF-7/ADR cells are known to have high rates of glycolysis (33Muindi R.J.F. Shoemaker M. Cowan K.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1986; 27: 272Google Scholar, 34Cohen J.S. Lyon R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 508: 216-228Google Scholar), glucose deprivation would be expected to rapidly impact upon the process of ATP generation as well as NADPH production in these cells due to their rapid utilization of glucose. During glucose deprivation energy generation would be expected to become increasingly dependent upon the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the common central pathway for the degradation of the two-carbon acetyl residues derived not only from carbohydrates but also from fatty acids and amino acids, as well as ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. As previously stated, if metabolism in the glucose-deprived condition was shifted to primarily respiration, the steady state levels of superoxide and hydroperoxides would be expected to increase. Glutamate could therefore rescue the cells from glucose deprivation by directly entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle leading to increased NADH production and increased ATP levels. In addition excess glutamate would be expected to increase the formation of α-ketoacids such as pyruvate which have been shown to be excellent scavengers of hydroperoxides (31Nath K.A. Ngo E.O. Hebbel R.P. Croatt A.J. Zhou B. Nutter L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 26: C227-C236Google Scholar). In fact, our data show that α-ketoacids are capable of suppressing pro-oxidant production as well as cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation (Table II). Glutamate is also required for the first committed step in the synthesis of glutathione catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. By using these different pathways glutamate could rapidly contribute to increased glutathione synthesis, increased peroxide scavenging, as well as ATP and NADH production.Another major finding of this work is that oxidative stress associated with glucose deprivation appears to be capable of causing alterations in signal transduction through the ERK1/ERK2 MAPK pathways that are also reversed by the thiol antioxidant NAC and glutamate. This supports the speculation that alterations in signal transduction caused by hydroperoxide-induced metabolic oxidative stress could represent one possible mechanism by which signal transduction and gene expression are mechanistically linked to metabolism resulting in a diversity of biological effects, including induction of protective responses as well as possible triggers for the cell death signal. In support of this assumption, oxidative stress has been shown by other investigators to trigger signal transduction pathways (3Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Google Scholar, 4Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15Google Scholar, 5Forrest V.J. Kang Y.H. McClain D.E. Robinson D.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Google Scholar), and recent studies also suggest that reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion can play a role in the Ras signaling pathway (13Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Google Scholar, 37Pennisi E. Science. 1997; 275: 1567-1568Google Scholar). Collectively, our studies show that glucose deprivation induces activation of ERK1/ERK2 (this report), Ras, Lyn kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) cascades (38Liu X. Gupta A.K. Corry P.M.

Plevin R.J. Stokoe D. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 351-355Google Scholar,39Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence Jr., J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Google Scholar). Our observations therefore suggest that the prolonged activation of MAPK (and the resulting changes in gene expression) caused by metabolic oxidative stress could represent an attempt by the cells to induce protective mechanisms to try and alleviate the cytotoxic effects of glucose deprivation. Likewise, activation of other kinases such as JNK1 could contribute to the induction of cytotoxic responses during glucose deprivation. Since tumor cells in general have been suggested to have a disruption in intracellular oxidation/reduction reactions as well as glycolytic metabolism (40Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Buettner G.R. Med. Hypotheses. 1981; 7: 21-42Google Scholar, 41Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1984; 106: 403-422Google Scholar, 42Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-312Google Scholar), the current results linking glucose metabolism to MAPK signal transduction as well as cytotoxicity via oxidation/reduction reactions may have far reaching implications to understanding the contribution of metabolism to the phenotypic changes associated with cancer as well as suggesting metabolic targets for the design of novel therapeutic interventions.

https://openalex.org/W2318311156,"Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and β1-syntrophin proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly interacting with their PDZ domains."
https://openalex.org/W2068459027,"Although the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA are distinct platelet membrane receptors, previous studies have suggested that these structures may be co-localized. To determine more directly the proximity of GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA, we assessed the effects of anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibodies on FcγRIIA-mediated platelet aggregation and on the direct binding of polymeric IgG to human platelets. In addition, we directly examined the proximity of FcγRII and GP Ib-IX-V using flow cytometric fluorescence energy transfer and immunoprecipitation studies. Preincubation of platelets with either of two monoclonal antibodies (AN51 or SZ2) directed against GP Ibα completely blocked platelet aggregation by polymeric IgG. Similarly, these antibodies totally inhibited platelet aggregation by two strains of viridans group streptococci known to induce aggregation via FcγRIIA. In addition, AN51 and SZ2 significantly reduced the binding of polymeric IgG to washed fixed platelets. When assessed by flow cytometry, significant levels of bidirectional energy transfer were detected between FcγRIIA and GP Ibα, indicating a physical proximity of less than 10 nm between these receptors. This energy transfer was not due to high receptor density, because no homoassociative energy transfer was seen. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of FcγRIIA from platelet lysates also co-precipitated GP Ibα. These results indicate that GP Ibα and FcγRIIA are co-localized on the platelet membrane and that this association is not random. Although the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA are distinct platelet membrane receptors, previous studies have suggested that these structures may be co-localized.

The GP Ib-IX-V complex contains four polypeptides (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V), which are present in a stoichiometry of 2:2:2:1 on the platelet plasma membrane (1López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Google Scholar). The precise configuration by which these peptides form a functional receptor is unknown, although more than one copy of each polypeptide per receptor complex is probable (1López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Google Scholar). This receptor mediates platelet adhesion to sites of blood vessel injury by binding von Willebrand factor in the subendothelium and participates in platelet activation by thrombin by providing a high affinity binding site for this agonist. In contrast to the GP Ib-IX-V complex, the platelet receptor for the Fc portion of IgG, FcγRIIA, is much simpler in structure, consisting of a single transmembrane polypeptide. This receptor is responsible for the aggregation and activation of platelets induced by immune complexes, opsonized bacteria, and certain antibodies that bind other platelet surface proteins (2Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Google Scholar).Although GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA are structurally unrelated, a functional interaction between these receptors has been suspected for some time. Moore et al. reported that both polymeric IgG and IgG Fc fragments could inhibit platelet aggregation induced by von Willebrand factor and ristocetin (3Moore A. Ross G.D. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 1053-1060Google Scholar). The reciprocal phenomenon was also observed, i.e. prior incubation of platelets with von Willebrand factor and ristocetin inhibited platelet aggregation by polymeric IgG. More recent studies examining heparin-induced platelet aggregation, which is mediated by anti-heparin antibodies, further suggest a proximity of GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA. In particular, platelet aggregation by heparin can be blocked by antibodies directed against either FcγRIIA or GP Ibα (4Chong B.H. Fawaz I. Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 73: 235-240Google Scholar, 5Adelman B. Sobel M. Fujimura Y. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1989; 113: 204-210Google Scholar). Moreover, anti-GP Ib antibodies inhibit heparin-induced aggregation of platelets obtained from normal donors but not of platelets from individuals with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which lack the GP Ib-IX-V complex (4Chong B.H. Fawaz I. Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 73: 235-240Google Scholar).Although these findings suggest a physical proximity or functional interaction of FcγRIIA and the GP Ib-IX-V complex, such an association has never been demonstrated directly. In the current studies, we used three distinct approaches to determine whether these receptors are physically associated. First, we assessed whether anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibodies would affect either FcγRIIA-mediated platelet aggregation (induced by polymeric IgG or antibody-coated bacteria) or the direct binding of polymeric IgG to human platelets. Second, we directly examined the proximity of FcγRIIA and GP Ib-IX-V on the platelet membrane as measured by flow cytometric fluorescence energy transfer. Third, we assessed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments whether these receptors were linked covalently. As discussed below, these studies strongly indicate that GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA are co-localized on the platelet membrane and that these receptors may be functionally interactive.DISCUSSIONAlthough GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA are seemingly unrelated receptors on the platelet membrane, previous reports had suggested a functional cooperation or structural association of these surface structures. With this study, we provide strong evidence that the functional interaction between GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA is largely due to a direct physical interaction. Several observations support this conclusion. First, we found that mAbs to GP Ibα completely blocked platelet aggregation induced by polymeric IgG, which is an FcγRIIA-mediated process. These antibodies apparently inhibited aggregation by blocking the binding of polymeric IgG to FcγRIIA. Indeed, we found that mAbs directed against GP Ibα could significantly reduce platelet binding by polymeric IgG and that these mAbs inhibited binding by amounts comparable with those obtained with the anti-FcγRII mAb IV.3. Because the GP Ibα-specific mAbs do not appear to bind FcγRIIA directly (data not shown), these findings indicate that the above inhibitory activity results from steric hindrance, suggesting that FcγRIIA and GP Ibα are in close proximity on the platelet membrane.We also demonstrated the proximity of these receptors more directly by two methods, resonance energy transfer between antibodies bound to FcγRIIA and GP Ibα and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Fluorophor-labeled antibodies bound to the respective antigens were able to transfer emission energy from the FITC-labeled antibody to the Cy3-labeled antibody, regardless of whether the donor dye was associated with FcγRIIA or GP Ibα. The detection of energy transfer between epitopes on FcγRIIA and GP Ibα indicates that these receptors are within 10 nm of each other. This proximity cannot be explained by the random co-localization of FcγRIIA and GP Ibα. Indeed, we observed no homoassociative energy transfer for epitopes on either receptor, indicating that the densities of FcγRIIA and GP Ibα on the platelet membrane are too low to randomly produce FET. Our calculations of receptor density also argue against the association being due to random distribution. Based on previous estimates of platelet surface area (20–80 μm2) (8Karas S.P. Rosse W.F. Kurlander R.J. Blood. 1982; 60: 1277-1282Google Scholar) and receptor number (25,000 and 500–8,000 copies/platelet for GP Ibα (1López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Google Scholar, 17Koksch M. Rothe G. Kiefel V. Schmitz G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 187: 53-67Google Scholar) and FcγRIIA (2Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Google Scholar, 22Tomiyama Y. Kunicki T.J. Zipf T.F. Ford S.B. Aster R.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2261-2268Google Scholar), respectively), and assuming random receptor distribution, the predicted distance between these receptors would exceed the limits of detectable FET. Thus, the observed FET in our studies indicates nonrandom association between FcγRIIA and GP Ibα.We obtained further evidence for a direct physical association between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA in our platelet in immunoprecipitation studies. Using mAb IV.3, GP Ibα was invariably coprecipitated with FcγRIIA from platelet membranes that had been pretreated with DTSSP, a chemical cross-linking reagent that is membrane-impermeable (23Jung S.M. Moroi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 152-162Google Scholar). In the absence of this pretreatment, the GP Ibα was still recovered, but the yield and frequency of recovery varied considerably. These findings indicate that there is a direct interaction between the GP Ib-IX complex and FcγRIIA, although the interaction is weak enough to be disrupted under certain conditions of lysis. Moreover, our ability to chemically cross-link these receptors on the surface of intact platelets provides additional evidence for their proximity.Of note, platelet aggregation by streptococci was also blocked by mAbs to GP Ibα. In addition to providing corroborative data for the aggregation studies using polymeric IgG, these results may clarify some inconsistent findings on the mechanisms of platelet aggregation by these organisms. Our previous studies had demonstrated that platelet aggregation by many strains was mediated by FcγRIIA (11Sullam P.M. Valone F.H. Mills J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1743-1750Google Scholar, 14Sullam P.M. Jarvis G.A. Valone F.H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2907-2911Google Scholar). A subsequent report, however, indicated that mAbs to GP Ibα could inhibit platelet aggregation by viridans group streptococci, suggesting a role for this receptor (24Ford I. Douglas C.W. Preston F.E. Lawless A. Hampton K.K. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 95-100Google Scholar). Although these divergent observations may reflect different mechanisms of platelet activation used by different species, our current data suggest that the inhibitory activity observed by Ford et al. (24Ford I. Douglas C.W. Preston F.E. Lawless A. Hampton K.K. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 95-100Google Scholar) is due to steric blockade of FcγRIIA by the anti-GP Ib antibodies.What are the potential consequences of the association between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA? As yet no definitive information exists to answer this question, but one possible reason for their association may be for participation in signal transduction. The interaction between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and von Willebrand factor leads to signal transduction across the platelet membrane, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins and an influx of calcium (25Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Google Scholar, 26Oda A. Yokoyama K. Murata M. Tokuhira M. Nakamura K. Handa M. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 736-742Google Scholar, 27Razdan K. Hellums J.D. Kroll M.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 681-686Google Scholar). As yet, the mechanism for this signal transduction has not been delineated, and in particular it is unclear as to how the GP Ib-IX-V complex is coupled to the signal transduction machinery. Its subunits do not have tyrosine kinase activity, are not known to bind to G-proteins, and are not phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. Recently, one of the 14–3-3 proteins has been shown to associate with the GP Ib-IX-V complex (28Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Google Scholar, 29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Google Scholar), but as yet no clear mechanism has been proposed for how this association is involved in signal transduction. The association of FcγRIIA with the complex may provide a mechanism for signal transduction by the complex. FcγRIIA is able to transduce activation signals when cross-linked by aggregated IgG or IgG bound to bacteria, as we have demonstrated here. This activation is partly mediated by an interaction of an immune tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIA and the SH2 motif containing kinase Syk, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (30Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Google Scholar, 31Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the GP Ib-IX-V complex must be cross-linked to transmit signals (32Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H. Ward C.M. Rose J.W. Scarborough R.M. Smith A.I. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12629-12639Google Scholar), a mechanism similar to that employed by FcγRIIA for signal transmission (31Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Thus, if an agonist is able to change the conformation of the GP Ib-IX-V complex such that subcomponents of the complex are brought together, this action may also bring together and cross-link associated FcγRIIA polypeptides, resulting in signal transduction.

Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Thus, if an agonist is able to change the conformation of the GP Ib-IX-V complex such that subcomponents of the complex are brought together, this action may also bring together and cross-link associated FcγRIIA polypeptides, resulting in signal transduction. Although GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA are seemingly unrelated receptors on the platelet membrane, previous reports had suggested a functional cooperation or structural association of these surface structures. With this study, we provide strong evidence that the functional interaction between GP Ib-IX-V and FcγRIIA is largely due to a direct physical interaction. Several observations support this conclusion. First, we found that mAbs to GP Ibα completely blocked platelet aggregation induced by polymeric IgG, which is an FcγRIIA-mediated process. These antibodies apparently inhibited aggregation by blocking the binding of polymeric IgG to FcγRIIA. Indeed, we found that mAbs directed against GP Ibα could significantly reduce platelet binding by polymeric IgG and that these mAbs inhibited binding by amounts comparable with those obtained with the anti-FcγRII mAb IV.3. Because the GP Ibα-specific mAbs do not appear to bind FcγRIIA directly (data not shown), these findings indicate that the above inhibitory activity results from steric hindrance, suggesting that FcγRIIA and GP Ibα are in close proximity on the platelet membrane. We also demonstrated the proximity of these receptors more directly by two methods, resonance energy transfer between antibodies bound to FcγRIIA and GP Ibα and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Fluorophor-labeled antibodies bound to the respective antigens were able to transfer emission energy from the FITC-labeled antibody to the Cy3-labeled antibody, regardless of whether the donor dye was associated with FcγRIIA or GP Ibα. The detection of energy transfer between epitopes on FcγRIIA and GP Ibα indicates that these receptors are within 10 nm of each other. This proximity cannot be explained by the random co-localization of FcγRIIA and GP Ibα. Indeed, we observed no homoassociative energy transfer for epitopes on either receptor, indicating that the densities of FcγRIIA and GP Ibα on the platelet membrane are too low to randomly produce FET. Our calculations of receptor density also argue against the association being due to random distribution. Based on previous estimates of platelet surface area (20–80 μm2) (8Karas S.P. Rosse W.F. Kurlander R.J. Blood. 1982; 60: 1277-1282Google Scholar) and receptor number (25,000 and 500–8,000 copies/platelet for GP Ibα (1López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Google Scholar, 17Koksch M. Rothe G. Kiefel V. Schmitz G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 187: 53-67Google Scholar) and FcγRIIA (2Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Google Scholar, 22Tomiyama Y. Kunicki T.J. Zipf T.F. Ford S.B. Aster R.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2261-2268Google Scholar), respectively), and assuming random receptor distribution, the predicted distance between these receptors would exceed the limits of detectable FET. Thus, the observed FET in our studies indicates nonrandom association between FcγRIIA and GP Ibα. We obtained further evidence for a direct physical association between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA in our platelet in immunoprecipitation studies. Using mAb IV.3, GP Ibα was invariably coprecipitated with FcγRIIA from platelet membranes that had been pretreated with DTSSP, a chemical cross-linking reagent that is membrane-impermeable (23Jung S.M. Moroi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 152-162Google Scholar). In the absence of this pretreatment, the GP Ibα was still recovered, but the yield and frequency of recovery varied considerably. These findings indicate that there is a direct interaction between the GP Ib-IX complex and FcγRIIA, although the interaction is weak enough to be disrupted under certain conditions of lysis. Moreover, our ability to chemically cross-link these receptors on the surface of intact platelets provides additional evidence for their proximity. Of note, platelet aggregation by streptococci was also blocked by mAbs to GP Ibα. In addition to providing corroborative data for the aggregation studies using polymeric IgG, these results may clarify some inconsistent findings on the mechanisms of platelet aggregation by these organisms. Our previous studies had demonstrated that platelet aggregation by many strains was mediated by FcγRIIA (11Sullam P.M. Valone F.H. Mills J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1743-1750Google Scholar, 14Sullam P.M. Jarvis G.A. Valone F.H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2907-2911Google Scholar). A subsequent report, however, indicated that mAbs to GP Ibα could inhibit platelet aggregation by viridans group streptococci, suggesting a role for this receptor (24Ford I. Douglas C.W. Preston F.E. Lawless A. Hampton K.K. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 95-100Google Scholar). Although these divergent observations may reflect different mechanisms of platelet activation used by different species, our current data suggest that the inhibitory activity observed by Ford et al. (24Ford I. Douglas C.W. Preston F.E. Lawless A. Hampton K.K. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 95-100Google Scholar) is due to steric blockade of FcγRIIA by the anti-GP Ib antibodies. What are the potential consequences of the association between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and FcγRIIA? As yet no definitive information exists to answer this question, but one possible reason for their association may be for participation in signal transduction. The interaction between the GP Ib-IX-V complex and von Willebrand factor leads to signal transduction across the platelet membrane, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins and an influx of calcium (25Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Google Scholar, 26Oda A. Yokoyama K. Murata M. Tokuhira M. Nakamura K. Handa M. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 736-742Google Scholar, 27Razdan K. Hellums J.D. Kroll M.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 681-686Google Scholar). As yet, the mechanism for this signal transduction has not been delineated, and in particular it is unclear as to how the GP Ib-IX-V complex is coupled to the signal transduction machinery. Its subunits do not have tyrosine kinase activity, are not known to bind to G-proteins, and are not phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. Recently, one of the 14–3-3 proteins has been shown to associate with the GP Ib-IX-V complex (28Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Google Scholar, 29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Google Scholar), but as yet no clear mechanism has been proposed for how this association is involved in signal transduction. The association of FcγRIIA with the complex may provide a mechanism for signal transduction by the complex. FcγRIIA is able to transduce activation signals when cross-linked by aggregated IgG or IgG bound to bacteria, as we have demonstrated here. This activation is partly mediated by an interaction of an immune tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIA and the SH2 motif containing kinase Syk, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (30Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Google Scholar, 31Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the GP Ib-IX-V complex must be cross-linked to transmit signals (32Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H. Ward C.M. Rose J.W. Scarborough R.M. Smith A.I. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12629-12639Google Scholar), a mechanism similar to that employed by FcγRIIA for signal transmission (31Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Thus, if an agonist is able to change the conformation of the GP Ib-IX-V complex such that subcomponents of the complex are brought together, this action may also bring together and cross-link associated FcγRIIA polypeptides, resulting in signal transduction.

It is generally assumed that it is the DNA damage produced by these agents that triggers such responses, but there is limited direct evidence to support this assumption. Here, we used DNA alkylation repair proficient and deficient isogenic mouse cell lines to demonstrate that the signal to trigger p53 induction, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in response to alkylating agents does emanate from DNA damage. Moreover, we established that 3-methyladenine, a relatively minor DNA lesion produced by most methylating agents (which form mainly 7-methylguanine), can specifically induce sister chromatid exchange, chromatid and chromosome gaps and breaks, S phase arrest, the accumulation of p53, and apoptosis. This study was made possible by the generation of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase null mutant cells by targeted homologous recombination and by the chemical synthesis of a methylating agent that almost exclusively produces 3-methyladenine DNA lesions. The combined use of these two experimental tools has defined the biological consequences of 3-methyladenine, a DNA lesion produced by endogenous cellular metabolites, environmental carcinogens, and chemotherapeutic alkylating agents.

Overlapping cellular responses protect mammals against DNA-damaging agents. The abilities to repair DNA damage, to stop cells with damaged genomes from cycling, and to eradicate cells bearing extensive DNA damage each contribute to that protection. Defects in cellular responses to DNA damage can result in cancer prone disease, as witnessed in individuals suffering from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and xeroderma pigmentosum (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Numerous mammalian proteins have been characterized for their roles as effectors of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, most notably p53 (2Smith M.L. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 340: 109-124Google Scholar). However, little is known about the specific types of DNA damage that can elicit these cellular responses or about the mechanisms for converting DNA damage into a signal for arrest or apoptosis. Indeed, direct evidence that DNA damage per se is the primary signal for the initiation of arrest and apoptosis is surprisingly limited. DNA double strand breaks are currently the only defined DNA lesion shown definitively to cause p53 induction (3Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Google Scholar) or to trigger cell cycle arrest (4Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Google Scholar), and indirect evidence suggests that they induce apoptosis (5Gurley K.E. Kemp C.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2537-2542Google Scholar); there is little evidence that more subtle forms of DNA damage can elicit these responses. In addition, it is quite clear that the cell nucleus is not required for the induction of apoptosis in response to some agents, such as ionizing radiation, thus excluding DNA damage as the trigger in these cases (6Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Google Scholar). Alkylating agents are cytotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic. These agents are present in our environment, they exist as normal cellular metabolites, and they are used for cancer chemotherapy (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Alkylating agents can induce p53, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (7Meyn R.E. Murray D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1984; 24: 147-163Google Scholar, 8Hickman J.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 121-139Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether alkylated DNA elicits the signal to activate these responses and, if so, which specific alkylated DNA lesions are responsible. Most methylating agents transfer methyl groups to over a dozen nucleophilic nitrogens and oxygens in DNA (9Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar), and so studies on the biological consequences of specific lesions have been difficult. One methyl lesion that has been studied extensively is O 6-methylguanine (O 6MeG). 1The abbreviations used are:O 6MeG, O 6-methylguanine; Aag, alkyladenine DNA glycosylase; 3MeA, 3-methyladenine; 7MeG, 7-methylguanine; 3MeG, 3-methylguanine; Me-Lex, MeOSO2(CH2)2-N-methylpyrrole dipeptide; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; SCE, sister chromatid exchange; ES, embryonic stem.1The abbreviations used are:O 6MeG, O 6-methylguanine; Aag, alkyladenine DNA glycosylase; 3MeA, 3-methyladenine; 7MeG, 7-methylguanine; 3MeG, 3-methylguanine; Me-Lex, MeOSO2(CH2)2-N-methylpyrrole dipeptide; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; SCE, sister chromatid exchange; ES, embryonic stem.Because this lesion is repaired by a highly specific DNA repair methyltransferase and cells deficient in this enzyme were readily available, the biological consequences of this toxic and mutagenic lesion have been explored in detail (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The focus of this report is the N-alkylated DNA base lesion 3-methyladenine (3MeA), produced upon exposure of DNA to exogenous and endogenous methylating agents. 3MeA is excised from DNA by DNA glycosylases that initiate the base excision repair pathway (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar); these glycosylases are present across species, from bacteria to humans, implicating 3MeA as a biologically important DNA lesion. The mammalian 3MeA DNA glycosylase (named Aag for alkyladenine DNA glycosylase) has a relatively broad substrate range, which includes 3MeA, 3-methylguanine (3MeG), and 7-methylguanine (7MeG), in addition to more complex alkyl lesions (10O'Connor T.R. Laval F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3337-3342Google Scholar, 11Dosanjh M.K. Chenna A. Kin E. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Samson L. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1024-1028Google Scholar, 12Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Google Scholar), but does not includeO 6MeG. 2L. D. Samson, unpublished observations.2L. D. Samson, unpublished observations.This broad substrate range, in conjunction with the fact that most simple methylating agents transfer methyl groups to numerous sites in DNA, has made it difficult to study the effects of 3MeA itself. Ideally, a method to specifically introduce 3MeA into DNA, used in conjunction with isogenic cell lines proficient and deficient in 3MeA repair, would provide the necessary tools for determining the biological effects of 3MeA. We therefore created 3MeA DNA glycosylase-deficient cells by targeted homologous recombination (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar) and developed a methylsulfonate ester tethered lexitropsin compound (Me-Lex) that produces 3MeA DNA lesions almost exclusively (14Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Google Scholar, 15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar). Here we combine these tools to show that 3MeA in DNA elicits p53 induction, S phase arrest, sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosome aberrations, and apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Log phase ES cells were cultured as described previously (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar) and treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Aldrich), Me-Lex, hydrolyzed Me-Lex (prereacted for 48 h in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer at room temperature), ionizing radiation, or UV radiation. For treatments, cells were incubated in drug containing serum-free ES medium for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Excess drug was removed with PBS. For irradiation, cells were exposed to either a 60Co source or a UV (254 nm) source. 107 Aag −/− cells were treated with MMS, Me-Lex, or control medium. Cells were subsequently scraped from dishes, pelleted, and frozen in liquid N2. Cells were suspended in 0.5 ml 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, to which was added 0.05 volume of 10% SDS. After RNase treatment (100 μg/ml for 2.5 h at 37 °C), samples were treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml overnight at 37 °C). DNA was isolated by phenol extraction (16Dashwood R.H. Arbogast D.N. Fong A.T. Hendricks J.D. Bailey G.S. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 427-432Google Scholar) and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0); an aliquot was removed for DNA quantification (17Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Google Scholar). Samples were heated (75 °C for 8 h) to preferentially release 3- and 7-methylpurines from DNA (18Bianchini F. Montesano R. Shuker D.E. Cuzick J. Wild C.P. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1677-1682Google Scholar). The partially apurinic DNA was precipitated at 0 °C by adding 0.1 volume of 0.1 n HCl (9Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar). Supernatants were concentrated, resuspended in 110 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (25-cm Whatman SCX; 30-min linear gradient of 0–20% MeOH in 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.0) at 40 °C; 1 ml/min; detection, 273 nm and photodiode array). Adducts were quantified relative to a standard curve (linear from 20 to 150 pmol of adduct/injection) or by multicomponent analysis. The response of 7MeG was not affected by the amount of adenine in the sample. SCEs were analyzed as described previously (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar). For aberrations, cells were incubated in McCoy's 5A (Life Technologies, Inc.)-based ES medium supplemented with 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) following treatment. Slides were prepared as for SCEs (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar). For SCEs, 20 second division metaphase spreads were counted per data point. For chromosome aberrations, 50 first division metaphase spreads were counted per data point. Aberrations were scored blinded. Chromosome breaks were quantified by weighted scoring of each type of aberration as described previously (19Natarajan A.T. Obe G. Chromosoma. 1984; 90: 120-127Google Scholar), and the frequency of aberrations within a population of cells was calculated from the number of break events divided by the number of spreads examined. Following exposure to genotoxic agents, medium was reserved, cells were trypsinized, and trypsin was neutralized by replacing the reserved medium. Dispersed cells were pelleted, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in staining solution (10 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h prior to analysis. 104 cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Ortho) for relative DNA content. The apoptotic response was evaluated by three methods. (a) Sub-G1 cells were quantified by flow cytometry as described previously (20Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar). (b) A photometric enzyme immunoassay was used for in vitro determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, 3 × 106cells were treated with genotoxic agents and harvested by trypsinization, and 3 × 104 cells were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. (c) Apoptotic nuclei were identified by microscopy. Approximately 104 cells fixed in 70% ethanol were dried onto microscope slides. Cells were stained in Hoechst 33258 buffer (0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, 0.05% nonfat dried milk) for 20 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy. Each assay was repeated at least twice for each genotoxin, and representative graphs are shown. Cells were boiled for 15 min in 1.7% SDS, 17% glycerol, 0.1 m DTT, 83 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.001% bromphenol blue at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/μl before loading. Samples (3 × 105 cell equivalents/lane) were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with monoclonal p53 antibody (Pab 240) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Corp.). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Equal loading was determined by Ponceau S staining. To study the biological consequences of 3MeA, a synthetic compound was developed to target alkylation to the N3 position of adenine. Me-Lex is composed of an SN2 methyl donating domain and the multicyclic lexitropsin peptide, which equilibrium binds the minor groove at A:T rich regions in double-stranded DNA (Fig. 1) (14Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Google Scholar, 15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar). Specific minor groove binding at A:T base pairs limits alkylation to the minor groove atoms and enhances alkylation at the nucleophilic N3 position of adenines that are in the Lex binding site. After in vitro DNA alkylation with Me-Lex, about 90% of the adducted bases are 3MeA (15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar). This represents a dramatic change from DNA alkylation by the SN2 agent MMS, which produces about 80% 7MeG and only 10% 3MeA (9Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar). However, in vitro, at a high molar ratio of Me-Lex relative to DNA, the specificity for alkylation at adenines decreases, because A:T rich Lex binding sites become saturated (15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar). It was therefore important to measure the relative abundance of 3MeAversus 7MeG after treatment of cells in culture with Me-Lex to determine whether Me-Lex retains its specificity for adduction at N3-adenine in vivo. Aag −/− cells are devoid of 3MeA DNA glycosylase activity (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar). Aag −/− ES cells were exposed to 1 mmMe-Lex (far greater than the doses used for subsequent experiments). As a control, we exposed cells to 1.3 mm MMS because the proportions of DNA lesions produced by MMS are well established (9Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar). As expected, MMS induced a significant increase in both 3MeA and 7MeG lesions, at a ratio of ∼1:7 (after background correction) (Table I). However, although Me-Lex produced a dramatic increase in 3MeA lesions, it did not produce any measurable increase in 7MeG lesions (Table I). Similar results were observed in two independent experiments. 3J. D. Kelly and B. Gold, unpublished observations.Thus, Me-Lex clearly maintains its alkylation specificity when used to treat cells in culture. Because in vitro studies indicate that Me-Lex induces at least 1000-fold more 3MeA thanO 6MeG (15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar) and at least 75-fold more 3MeA than 3MeG3, we infer that 3MeAs make up the vast majority of alkylated DNA bases produced in mouse ES cells exposed to Me-Lex.Table IAlkylation of Aag −/− ES cells by Me-LexTreatment3MeA7MeGpmol/μmol DNAControl (no drug)ND1-aND, not detected.(n = 3)44.2 ± 7.9 (n = 3)1.0 mm Me-Lex369.3 ± 32.3 (n = 2)21.51-b7MeG levels were only detected in one of three samples.1.3 mm MMS12.9 ± 1.0 (n = 3)131.7 ± 27.7 (n = 4)1-a ND, not detected.1-b 7MeG levels were only detected in one of three samples. Open table in a new tab O 6MeG DNA lesions are known to induce SCEs (21Yagi T. Yarosh D.B. Day III, R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1984; 5: 593-600Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that 3MeA DNA lesions can also induce SCEs. 3MeA DNA glycosylase deficient Aag−/− cells are much more sensitive than wild type cells to SCEs induced by Me-Lex (Fig. 2 A).Aag −/− cells are also more sensitive to MMS-induced SCEs (Fig. 2 B), as expected (13Engelward B. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Google Scholar). In contrast, Aagstatus does not affect SCEs induced by UV (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the targeted Aag mutations do not produce a general defect resulting in increased SCEs induced by any type of DNA damage, but rather produce a sensitivity that is alkylation-specific. Furthermore, we infer that the SCEs observed in Me-Lex treatedAag −/− cells were induced by 3MeA DNA lesions. The concentration of Me-Lex required to induce one SCE per chromosome in the Aag −/− cells (0.04 mm) is significantly lower than the concentration of MMS required to give the same response (0.6 mm). This is consistent with the ability of Me-Lex to induce more 3MeA than MMS at approximately equimolar concentrations (Table I) and provides further evidence that 3MeA is the primary lesion responsible for SCE induction by Me-Lex. Moreover, becauseO 6MeG, 7MeG, and 3MeG are all produced at a lower relative frequency by Me-Lex compared with MMS (9Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Google Scholar, 15Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Google Scholar), then a higher concentration of Me-Lex relative to MMS would be required for O 6MeG, 7MeG, and 3MeG to induce SCE to the same level. The lower Me-Lex concentration relative to MMS required to induce a similar response was consistently observed for all end points studied (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). However, although it is clear that 3MeA is the lesion primarily responsible for SCE induction by Me-Lex, we acknowledge that there may be a minor contribution from other lesions. Alkylating agents are potent inducers of chromosome aberrations (22Bean C.L. Galloway S.M. Mutat. Res. 1993; 292: 3-16Google Scholar), but apart from O 6MeG, little is known about the specific types of DNA damage that trigger them. Cells lackingO 6MeG DNA methyltransferase are sensitive to chromosome aberrations following treatment with methylating agents, but methyltransferase overexpression does not completely suppress these aberrations (23Kaina B. Fritz G. Mitra S. Coquerelle T. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1857-1867Google Scholar), suggesting that lesions other thanO 6MeG induce chromosome aberrations. Here we show that 3MeA is a clastogenic DNA lesion. We first determined whether Aag status alters the time of peak aberration induction after exposure to alkylating agent. Chromosome aberrations in cells undergoing their first metaphase post-Me-Lex or MMS exposure peaked at around 14–16 h for bothAag +/+ and Aag −/− cells (Fig. 2, D and E). During the time course, or when cells were treated with a range of MMS or Me-Lex doses, Aag −/− cells were consistently more sensitive to aberration induction than Aag+/+ cells (Fig. 2, D–G). In contrast, Aag status had no influence on UV-induced chromosome aberrations (Fig. 2 H). Thus, 3MeAs are clearly clastogenic lesions. The average number of each type of aberration per cell was calculated from the combined data of 850 chromosome spreads of cells treated with Me-Lex or MMS and from 150 chromosome spreads of cells exposed to UV. Compared with wild type cells, Aag −/− cells are particularly sensitive to chromatid and chromosome breaks and gaps induced by Me-Lex and only modestly sensitive to other types of aberrations (Fig. 3 A). This bias was diminished for MMS-treated cells and absent for UV-treated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). MMS is known to induce an S phase arrest in mammalian cells (24Morris S.M. Domon O.E. McGarrity L.J. Kodell R.L. Casciano D.A. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1991; 18: 139-149Google Scholar), and here we show that 3MeA DNA lesions contribute to that arrest. Cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry according to DNA content. Untreated, exponentially growing, asynchronous Aag +/+ and Aag −/− cells had similar cell cycle distributions (Fig. 4, 0 Hrs), and estimates of the duration of G1, S, and G2/M agree with published reports (25Savatier P. Huang S. Szekely L. Wiman K.G. Samarut J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 809-818Google Scholar). 4J. M. Allan and L. D. Samson, unpublished observations. MMS and Me-Lex exposure caused wild type cells to accumulate in early S phase (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating a robust S phase arrest that was most pronounced at 10 h for MMS and 6 h for Me-Lex. The arrested Aag +/+ cells emerged from S phase by 20 h post-MMS treatment (Fig. 4 A) or 10 h post-Me-Lex treatment (Fig. 4 B). In stark contrast,Aag −/− cells suffer a much more prolonged S phase arrest; at 20 h post-MMS treatment (Fig. 4 A) and 14 h post-Me-Lex treatment (Fig. 4 B), a significant portion of cells remained arrested in the early stages of S phase. This delayed subpopulation of Aag −/− cells eventually moved through S phase, but at a significantly reduced rate relative to Aag+/+ cells. Taken together, these data indicate that DNA alkylation damage, and more specifically 3MeA DNA lesions, can elicit an S phase arrest. Ionizing radiation causes DNA damage of a kind that is not thought to be repaired by Aag. When cells were exposed to ionizing radiation, there was no significant difference in the cell cycle response of the Aag +/+ cells and Aag −/− cells (Fig. 4 C). To investigate whether simple alkylated bases can induce apoptosis, we compared MMS- and Me-Lex-induced apoptosis in Aag +/+ and Aag −/− mouse ES cells. The apoptotic response was measured by accumulation of DNA ends and histone-associated DNA fragments (Fig. 5 A), by the appearance of apoptotic nuclei by DNA fragmentation as measured by Hoechst staining (Fig. 5 B), and by sub-G1 DNA content by flow cytometry (Fig. 5 C). Aag −/− cells were consistently more susceptible to both MMS- and Me-Lex-induced apoptosis. Because there was no significant difference betweenAag +/+ and Aag −/− cells in their sensitivity to γ-ray-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5, A–C), we conclude that the sensitivity of Aag −/− cells to apoptosis is alkylation-specific. Moreover, we infer that 3MeA lesions can trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis can be induced by p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways (26Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Google Scholar), and so we determined whether the induction of apoptosis by a simple methylated base like 3MeA was accompanied by p53 induction.Aag +/+ and Aag −/− cells were exposed to MMS, Me-Lex, or ionizing radiation. For MMS and Me-Lex, there was a much greater induction of p53 in the Aag −/− cells than in the Aag +/+ cells (Fig. 6,A and B), indicating that alkylated DNA bases, including 3MeA, can signal p53 induction. In contrast, ionizing radiation induced similar amounts of p53 in both cell types (Fig. 6 C), indicating that Aag −/− cells do not have a general increase in their p53 induction response to DNA damage. To confirm that the observed effects of Me-Lex are due to its methylating activity, we determined whether the parent lexitropsin compound was able to induce any biological effects under the conditions used in our studies. Hydrolyzed Me-Lex (which can no longer alkylate DNA) did not result in significant levels of cell killing, SCE induction, chromosome aberrations, S phase arrest, or apoptosis. 5B. P. Engelward, A. J. Dreslin, and L. D. Samson, unpublished observations. We therefore conclude that the biological activity of Me-Lex is dependent upon its ability to produce 3MeA DNA lesions and is independent of the DNA binding properties of lexitropsin. 3MeA DNA lesions have long been considered replication-blocking lesions because a bacterial and a viral DNA polymerase were shown to terminate at adenine residues in a methylated DNA template in vitro (27Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Google Scholar). Although these studies were indirect, and although such studies have not yet been reported for any mammalian DNA polymerase, recent structural information on DNA polymerases provides a plausible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of 3MeA. For four DNA polymerases (namely mammalian polymerase β, Thermus aquaticus Taq polymerase, T7 bacteriophage DNA polymerase, and Escherichia coli polymerase I), contacts between key amino acid residues and the N3 atom of purines in the template strand have been established (28Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar, 29Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Google Scholar, 30Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 31Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13292-13297Google Scholar), and for polymerase β, this contact was shown to be crucial for catalytic activity (32Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Google Scholar). Our observations that 3MeAs specifically cause SCEs, S phase arrest, and chromosome aberrations are consistent with an inhibitory effect of 3MeA on mammalian DNA replication, as discussed below. SCEs are often regarded as the outcome of recombination between sister chromatids, and so one might infer from our results that 3MeA DNA lesions stimulate DNA recombination between sister chromatids. However, it has also been proposed that SCEs result from strand switching at stalled replication forks for the following reasons: (i) cells that sustain damage in G2 do not form SCEs, and (ii) DNA damage must be present during S phase to induce SCEs (33Wolff S. Bodycote J. Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1974; 25: 73-81Google Scholar, 34Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1980; 70: 337-341Google Scholar, 35Ishii Y. Bender M.A. Mutat. Res. 1980; 79: 19-32Google Scholar). Indeed, it was reported that the lowest dose of MMS that results in S phase arrest coincides with the lowest dose required for SCE induction (24Morris S.M. Domon O.E. McGarrity L.J. Kodell R.L. Casciano D.A. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1991; 18: 139-149Google Scholar). Our data support this model in that a more robust 3MeA-induced S phase arrest coincides with increased SCE induction. We therefore suggest that the ability of 3MeA to inhibit DNA replication is responsible for SCE induction. The induction of chromosome aberrations by 3MeA DNA lesions is mainly accounted for by increased chromatid and chromosome breaks/gaps, which are also thought to be stimulated by blocked replication forks (36Bender M.A. Griggs H.G. Walker P.L. Mutat. Res. 1973; 20: 387-402Google Scholar). If replication is blocked in one of the growing strands, a short unreplicated region could remain in that sister chromatid, and this region may or may not be converted to a DNA double strand break. The single-stranded DNA region (or the double strand DNA break) is thought to disrupt chromatin condensation so that a chromatid break/gap is visible at metaphase (36Bender M.A. Griggs H.G. Walker P.L. Mutat. Res. 1973; 20: 387-402Google Scholar). The mechanism by which breaks/gaps are simultaneously produced in both sister chromatids (chromosome breaks/gaps) is not yet known. It has been proposed that unreplicated regions arise when two forks are unable to meet each other because of intervening DNA lesions (37Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 145: 63-69Google Scholar). We propose that these unreplicated regions may segregate to each sister chromatid and appear as symmetric breaks/gaps in both sister chromatids. Our results support these models in that the increased S phase arrest induced by 3MeA lesions coincides with increased numbers of chromatid and chromosome breaks/gaps. Further, Me-Lex induction of chromosome aberrations shows induction kinetics that are typical of S phase-dependent clastogens (peaking 12–16 h post-treatment) (36Bender M.A. Griggs H.G. Walker P.L. Mutat. Res. 1973; 20: 387-402Google Scholar, 38Evans H.J. Scott D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1969; 173: 491-512Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the ability of 3MeA to inhibit DNA replication is responsible for the induction of chromosome aberrations. S phase arrest can be separated into two parts: inhibition of DNA chain elongation and inhibition of replicon firing (39Watanabe I. Radiat. Res. 1974; 58: 541-556Google Scholar, 40Painter R.B. Young B.R. Radiat. Res. 1975; 64: 648-656Google Scholar). The two components of S phase arrest are, to some extent, independent because low doses of ionizing radiation inhibit replicon firing without affecting chain elongation (41Larner J.M. Lee H. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1901-1908Google Scholar). In fact, such inhibition of replicon firing causes a subpopulation of cells to accumulate in early S phase, and with time, this cohort of cells can be seen to move as a bolus through S phase (42Lee H. Larner J.M. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 526-531Google Scholar). This pattern is reminiscent of the kind of S phase arrest we observed in response to 3MeA DNA lesions, raising the possibility that 3MeAs can inhibit replicon firing, in addition to chain elongation. Furthermore, it has been shown that several checkpoint genes are required for Saccharomyces cerevisiaeto experience an S phase delay during low level MMS exposure (43Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Google Scholar, 44Longhese M.P. Fraschini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3235-3244Google Scholar). Studies are currently under way to determine whether 3MeA-induced S phase arrest requires the participation of cell cycle checkpoint and other proteins. 3MeA is clearly a strong inhibitor of S phase progression. Further studies are necessary to determine whether this lesion also affects other cell cycle phases. The fact that many DNA-damaging agents induce apoptosis has led to the assumption that DNA damage per se elicits the initial inducing signal to trigger this programmed cell death pathway. However, for some agents, apoptosis can be induced in a DNA damage-independent manner (6Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Google Scholar, 45Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Google Scholar), and there is limited formal evidence to support the assumption that DNA lesions actually trigger the response (46Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2775-2784Google Scholar, 47Ljungman M. Zhang F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 823-831Google Scholar, 48Tominaga Y. Tsuzuki T. Shiraishi A. Kawate H. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 889-896Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies clearly demonstrate that certain DNA-damaging agents elicit signals at the cell membrane that trigger apoptosis (45Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Google Scholar) and that trigger the activation of transcription factors implicated in apoptosis (49Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Google Scholar, 50Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Google Scholar). It has also been assumed that DNA damage per se signals the stabilization of p53, thus inducing p53 levels (stabilization is thought to be achieved by the specific phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA-damaging agents). Again, apart from the case of double strand DNA breaks, there is little formal evidence to support the assumption that DNA lesions themselves elicit the signal to stabilize p53 or to induce apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that a particular damaged DNA base, 3MeA, can trigger both apoptosis and p53 induction, but exactly how this is achieved and whether p53 induction is required for the observed apoptosis are not yet clear. It has been suggested that the single strand DNA breaks that are inevitably generated during the excision repair of DNA damage could serve as the signal for p53 induction (3Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Google Scholar). However, our results provide strong evidence against this mechanism, because it is the cellslacking Aag-initiated base excision repair that experience increased p53 and apoptosis. Although we may eliminate the base excision repair pathway as being responsible for eliciting the damage response pathway, we cannot exclude nucleotide excision repair as having an effect. However, it seems likely that unrepaired 3MeA lesions are responsible for eliciting these responses in the Aag−/− cells. In summary, we have shown that unrepaired 3MeA DNA lesions have the potential to induce SCEs, chromosome aberrations, S phase arrest, p53 induction, and apoptosis. The importance of the N3 atom of the purine ring for stabilizing the contact between DNA polymerase and its template (28Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar, 29Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Google Scholar, 30Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

https://openalex.org/W2086457531,"To investigate the effects of the expression of Bcl-2 protein in bladder cancer on the apoptosis induced by cisplatin or adenoviral-mediated p53 gene (Ad5CMV-p53) transfer, we transfected the bcl-2 gene into KoTCC-1, a human bladder cancer cell line that does not express the Bcl-2 protein. The Bcl-2-transfected KoTCC-1 (KoTCC-1/B) exhibited significantly higher resistance to both cisplatin and Ad5CMV-p53 transfer than did either the parental KoTCC-1 (KoTCC-1/P) or the vector-only transfected cell line (KoTCC-1/C). The flow cytometric analysis of the propidium iodide-stained nuclei and DNA fragmentation analysis after cisplatin or Ad5CMV-p53 treatment revealed DNA degradation in both KoTCC-1/P and KoTCC-1/C, whereas KoTCC1/B showed a marked inhibition of DNA degradation. Following the treatment with cisplatin or Ad5CMV-p53, the accumulation of p53 protein was highly detectable for a long period in KoTCC-1/B compared to that in KoTTC-1/P and KoTCC-1/C. Furthermore, the cisplatin and Ad5CMV-p53 treatments each reduced the volume of the subcutaneous tumors established in nude mice formed by KoTCC-1/P or KoTCC-1/C; in contrast, their reductive effects on the tumors formed by KoTCC-1/B were significantly suppressed. The intraperitoneal tumor cell implantation model revealed that the prognoses of mice injected with KoTCC-1/B were significantly inferior to those of the mice injected with either KoTCC-1/P or KoTCC-1/C after treatment with cisplatin or Ad5CMV-p53. These findings suggest that the expression of Bcl-2 in bladder cancer cells interferes with the therapeutic effects of cisplatin and Ad5CMV-p53 through the inhibition of the apoptotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2128400434,"There is emerging evidence indicating that smooth muscle contraction and Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels are regulated by tyrosine kinases; however, the specific kinases involved are largely unknown. In rabbit colonic muscularis mucosae cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of ∼60 and 125 kDa were observed in immunoblots using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and were identified as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. FAK co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src, and the phosphorylation of the c-Src·FAK complex was markedly enhanced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB. The presence of activated c-Src in unstimulated cells was identified in cell lysates by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing the autophosphorylated site (P416Y). In whole-cell patch-clamp studies, intracellular dialysis of a Src substrate peptide and anti-c-Src and anti-FAK antibodies suppressed Ca2+ currents by 60, 62, and 43%, respectively. In contrast, intracellular dialysis of an anti-mouse IgG or anti-Kv1.5 antibody did not inhibit Ca2+ currents. Co-dialysis of anti-c-Src and anti-FAK antibodies inhibited Ca2+ currents (63%) equivalent to dialysis with the anti-c-Src antibody alone. PDGF-BB enhanced Ca2+ currents by 43%, which was abolished by the anti-c-Src and anti-FAK antibodies. Neither the MEK inhibitor PD 098059 nor an anti-Ras antibody inhibited basal Ca2+currents or PDGF-stimulated Ca2+ currents. The α1C subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel co-immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, indicating direct association of c-Src kinase with the Ca2+ channel. These data suggest that c-Src and FAK, but not the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, modulate basal Ca2+ channel activity and mediate the PDGF-induced enhancement of L-type Ca2+ currents in differentiated smooth muscle cells."

GIRK channels are distributed predominantly throughout the heart, brain, and pancreas. In recent years, GIRK channels have received a great deal of attention for their direct G-protein βγ (Gβγ) regulation. Native cardiac IKACh is composed of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (Krapivinsky, G., Gordon, E. A., Wickman, K. A., Velimirovic, B., Krapivinsky, L., and Clapham, D. E. (1995) Nature 374, 135–141). Here, we examine the quaternary structure of IKACh using a variety of complementary approaches. Complete cross-linking of purified atrial IKACh protein formed a single adduct with a total molecular weight that was most consistent with a tetramer. In addition, partial cross-linking of purified IKACh produced subsets of molecular weights consistent with monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Within the presumed protein dimers, GIRK1-GIRK1 and GIRK4-GIRK4 adducts were formed, indicating that the tetramer was composed of two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits.

Similar experimental results could potentially be obtained if GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits assembled randomly as 2:2 and equally sized populations of 3:1 and 1:3 tetramers.

Detailed structural information on K+-selective channels, however, has lagged considerably behind. Typically, K+-selective channels exist at low densities of 1–10 channels/μm2(4Soejima M. Noma A.

This has made purification, crystallization, and biochemical characterization difficult. To date, there is no crystal structure or high resolution electron micrographic image of a K+-selective channel. Of the K+-selective channels, the most structural information is known about the voltage-gated K+-selective channels (Kv). 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated K+-selective channel; GIRK, G-protein-regulated, inwardly rectifying K+ channel; DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate); DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; SSADP, sulfosuccinimidyl (4-azidophenyldithio)propionate; DMA, dimethyl adipimidate·2HCl; DMS, dimethyl suberimidate·2HCl; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Kir, inwardly rectifying K+-selective channel; IP, immunoprecipitation; Ab, antibody; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Kv channels have been proposed to be tetramers of four identical or highly homologous subunits, based on a wide variety of methods: toxin binding studies (10MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Google Scholar), covalently linked constructs (11Liman E. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Google Scholar), low resolution electron microscopic imaging (12Li M.

Each subunit is thought to consist of 6 transmembrane domains with a loop contributing to the pore (P-loop) region located between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains. Less is known about the inwardly rectifying K+-selective (Kir) channels. Kir channels are distantly related to the Kv channels and contain regions equivalent only to the fifth transmembrane domain, the P-loop, and the sixth transmembrane domains of the Kv channels. Despite these similarities, the regions critical for assembly are likely to differ between Kir and Kv channels . Although the N-terminal domain has been implicated in Kv assembly (14Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Google Scholar), the second transmembrane domain and the proximal C-terminal domains have been implicated in Kir channel assembly (15Tinker A. Jan Y. Jan L. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Google Scholar). Several groups have suggested that, like Kv channels, Kir channels are tetramers (16Yang J. Jan Y. Jan L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Google Scholar, 17Clement J. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Google Scholar, 18Pessia M. Tucker J. Lee K. Bond C. Adelman J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Google Scholar). We are interested in the unique subfamily of Kir channels that are ligand-gated by direct Gβγ binding (19Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Google Scholar, 20Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar), the G-protein-regulated, inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs). Using a combination of size exclusion chromatography and sucrose density gradients, it was originally proposed that GIRK1, in combination with an unknown subunit, contained three to five subunits of unknown stoichiometry (21Inanobe A. Ito H. Ito M. Hosoya Y. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1238-1244Google Scholar). Later, by studying the biophysical properties of concatenated subunits, Silverman et al. (22Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30524-30528Google Scholar) suggested that GIRK1 and GIRK4 formed a tetramer in a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, Silverman et al. were unable to determine a preferred subunit arrangement around the pore and suggested that more than one arrangement may be viable. Tucker et al.(23Tucker S.J. Pessia M. Adelman J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H379-H385Google Scholar) found that the GIRK1-GIRK4-GIRK1-GIRK4, rather than the GIRK1-GIRK1-GIRK4-GIRK4 arrangement, produced a higher ratio of agonist-induced to basal current. To date, all of the studies on the stoichiometry of Kir channels have relied upon the formation of multimeric concatemers. Briefly, a single protein is formed by the translation of a single mRNA encoding several artificially concatenated subunits. Several combinations of concatenated subunits are examined, and conclusions are drawn from their varying properties. These studies have an advantage in that they define the smallest functional unit, whereas biochemical studies can define only the smallest physically associating unit. However, concatemer-based studies assume that: 1) combinations of tandemly linked subunits that yield the most current are the most representative of the native channel configuration, 2) tandemly linked subunits do not coassemble with other tandemly linked subunits, and 3) tandemly linked subunits are completely translated and are not proteolytically cleaved between linked subunits. Unfortunately, there are instances in which each of these assumptions has been proven to be incorrect (18Pessia M. Tucker J. Lee K. Bond C. Adelman J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Google Scholar, 22Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30524-30528Google Scholar, 24McCormack K. Lin L. Iverson L. Tanouye M. Sigworth F. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1406-1411Google Scholar,25Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-73988Google Scholar). Silverman et al. (22Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30524-30528Google Scholar) were forced to assume that two trimeric constructs combine to form a functional channel to explain the high currents produced when only trimeric constructs were expressed. In addition, these studies have been complicated by the presence of endogenous oocyte subunits. Despite these drawbacks, in recent years, the use of tandemly linked subunits has dominated the field of channel stoichiometry and has remained virtually unchecked by other independent methods. Clearly, alternative means must be used to test the validity of this approach. In this report, we present the first purification of a native mammalian K+ channel to homogeneity, the first cross-linking study examining inwardly rectifying K+ channel quaternary structure and stoichiometry, and the first densitometry study examining GIRK stoichiometry. Using multiple independent methods, our data indicate that GIRK channels are tetramers. We hypothesize that native IKACh is composed of two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK4 subunits. Bovine atrial plasma membranes were isolated as described (26Slaughter R.S. Sutko J.L. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in 1.0% CHAPS-HEDN buffer, pH 7.5 (in mm: 10 HEPES, 1 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, and 100 NaCl). The protease inhibitors leupeptin (50 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), aprotinin (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), and pepstatin (2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) were used in all steps of the purification. Approximately 150 mg of solubilized atrial proteins were loaded onto a Toyopearl Red™ affinity column. Flow rates were 0.1 ml/min and 1 ml/min during the binding and elution steps, respectively. Bound protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 1m NaCl. Fractions were assayed for IKAChsubunit content by Western blot. Fractions containing both IKACh subunits were pooled and dialyzed against 400 mm NaCl containing 1.0% CHAPS-HEDN buffer (pH 7.5). The equilibrated fractions were concentrated in Centriprep-50™ (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) concentrators to <2.0 ml and loaded onto a HighLoad 16/60 Superdex™ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) size exclusion chromatography column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Pooled IKACh fractions were dialyzed against immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.5), loaded onto a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) affinity column, and eluted with 0.25 m N-acetylglucosamine. Finally, the eluate was immunoprecipitated for 150 min at 4 °C with anti-GIRK4 peptide antibody (anti-CIRN2 was generated against amino acids 19–32; Refs. 19Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Google Scholarand 27Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic K. Wickman B. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Google Scholar) and washed three times (1-ml amounts) for 1 min each, three times (1 ml) for 5 min each, and eluted with 1 mg/ml antigenic peptide three times (100 μl) for 30 min each at 22 °C. Plasma membrane proteins containing epitope-tagged GIRK1-AU5 and GIRK4-AU1 were isolated from COS7 cells as described previously (28Kennedy M. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Google Scholar). Samples were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The two-step purification consisted of sequential immunoprecipitations in which samples were first immunoprecipitated with anti-GIRK4 antibodies and were then immunoprecipitated with anti-GIRK1 antibodies. For the anti-GIRK4 IP, Protein A-Sepharose was preincubated with 3 μg of anti-CIRN2 (27Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic K. Wickman B. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Google Scholar,28Kennedy M. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Google Scholar). After a 30-min preincubation, solubilized proteins from a single 100-mm dish were added and incubated at 4 °C for 150 min. The Protein A-Sepharose-antibody (Ab)-GIRK complexes were washed five times (1-ml amounts) with IP buffer. The GIRK heteromultimers were eluted with 1 mg/ml CIRN2 antigenic peptide for 150 min at 22 °C with three eluate exchanges. For the anti-GIRK4 IP, the eluate was added to Protein A-Sepharose and a 1:50 dilution of ascites fluid containing AU5 monoclonal antibodies (BabCO, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) was incubated at 4 °C for 150 min. The Protein A-Sepharose-Ab-GIRK complexes were washed five times (1-ml amounts) with IP buffer. GIRK heteromultimers were eluted with 0.25 mg/ml AU5 antigenic peptide at 22 °C with three 100-μl eluate exchanges for 1 h each. Protein to be cross-linked was treated for 1 h on ice with 100 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed against 1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES, 400 mmNaCl, pH 8.5 (cross-linking buffer). To block free sulfhydryl groups, dialyzed aliquots were treated with 25 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) for 1 h on ice. Aliquots to be cross-linked via disulfides were not treated with iodoacetamide. Typical reaction volumes were 15 μl for the pure, atrial IKACh and 75 μl for the recombinant protein. Increasing the reaction volumes >10-fold had no effect on the adducts formed. Approximately 0.1 ng of pure IKACh, 10 μg of crude solubilized atrial protein, or 10 μg of solubilized COS-7 membrane protein was used in each reaction. For complete cross-linking, solutions containing 3 mmdithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP, Pierce), 1 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce), or 3 mm sulfosuccinimidyl (4-azidophenyldithio)propionate (SSADP, Pierce) were used. Immediately prior to use, cross-linking reagents were prepared as 10 × stock solutions in cross-linking buffer. The water-insoluble DSS was prepared as a 9 × stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Unless specified otherwise, the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice. Reactions were terminated for 30 min with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, or 15 mm iodoacetamide, when either H2O2 or iodine was used. The hetero-bifunctional SSADP was first used like the other reagents, and then the azide was photoactivated by a 1-min exposure in a CL-1000 ultraviolet cross-linker (UVP, Upland, CA). For partial cross-linking, dimethyl adipimidate·2HCl (DMA, Pierce) and dimethyl suberimidate·2HCl (DMS, Pierce) were also used. These reagents were used at 10 mm final concentrations in 100 mm HEPES containing cross-linking buffer. For DTSSP, SSADP, and iodine, a 10-fold dilution over what was used to completely cross-link the channel generally created a laddering pattern. When necessary, trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) precipitation was used to concentrate the samples prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Native IKAChor recombinant GIRK protein was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing either 50 mm dithiothreitol (reducing conditions) or 25 mm iodoacetamide (non-reducing conditions) for 30 min at 50 °C. 10% separating and 3% stacking, 3–10% separating and 3% stacking, and precast 2–15% (ISS) gels were all utilized. Samples were analyzed by fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Corp.), Gel Code™ silver staining (Pierce), or by immunoblotting with anti-GIRK1 antibodies and/or anti-GIRK4 antibodies. Transfer times for Western blot analysis were extended to >2 h at 15 V to ensure transfer of the larger cross-linked complexes. When sequential probing with antibodies was necessary, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 50 °C. When quantitation was required, X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) was preflashed (Sensitize™, Amersham Corp.) to 0.15 OD above background and exposed at −70 °C. A GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) was used to analyze the protein gels and immunoblots. Molecular weights were calculated using densitometry profiles from a combination of prestained high molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) and low and high molecular weight markers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). In a portion of the gels, thyrogloblin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to ensure linearity through at least 330 kDa. When lanes from several gels were presented together (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), the molecular weight markers corresponded to lanes 1 and 2. The remaining lanes were approximately aligned with the molecular weight markers. In addition, the molecular weights of all the adducts are presented in Tables I and II.Table IComplete cross-linking of GIRK channelsDTSSPDSSOxidationSSADPMeankDaNative IKACh234 ± 7235244 ± 2224 ± 3234 ± 8(n = 8)1-aMolecular weights are given in units of kDa as a mean ± standard deviation (n, number of trials).

The pure GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromultimers were divided into two aliquots, which were analyzed separately by SDS-PAGE. The first lane was fixed and exposed to film (Fig. 3 B), and the second lane was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and Western-blotted along with several lanes of decreasing quantities of solubilized atrial sarcolemma membranes (Fig. 3 A). Autoradiography (Fig. 3 B) revealed a GIRK1:GIRK4 band intensity ratio of 1.8:1.0 and 1.5:1.0 after a correction for the methionine content of each protein (see Equation 1). The intensity ratio represents the stoichiometry of the recombinant protein, but not necessarily the stoichiometry of the subunits in native atrial IKACh.Recombinant stoichiometry=GIRK1radiometric countsGIRK4radiometric counts×number of methionines in GIRK4number of methionines in GIRK1Equation 1 The aliquot of recombinant GIRK1-GIRK4 that had been Western-blotted was then analyzed by densitometry. The GIRK1:GIRK4 band intensity ratio was 8:1 and will be referred to as the Ab stoichiometry (apparent stoichiometry as detected by antibody). The Ab stoichiometry is measured from the ratio of the intensity of Western blot bands and is a product of the number of moles of each individual subunit and the number of Abs bound to each epitope. Dividing the recombinant stoichiometry by the Ab stoichiometry yields a useful term, which we will refer to as the Ab standardization factor (Equation 2).Ab standardization factor=recombinant stoichiometryAb stoichiometryEquation 2 In our case, the Ab standardization factor was 0.19 (0.19 = 1.5/8). The Ab standardization factor multiplied by the GIRK1:GIRK4 band intensity ratio of the Western-blotted native channel yields the true stoichiometry of the native channel (Equation 3).True stoichiometry of native IKACh=measured Ab stoichiometry×Ab standardization factorEquation 3 In our case, the true stoichiometry of native IKAChwas ∼1:1 (0.19 × 6 = 1.1). The above procedure assumes that there is a direct linear relationship between the Western blot intensity and the total amount of protein on the blot and that this relationship is maintained for both antibodies over the range of the protein concentrations to be tested. We found that our antibodies satisfied this criteria; the intensity of the lanes from Western-blotted atrial sarcolemma membrane varied in a direct and linear manner with the amount of protein. We have purified native bovine IKACh and recombinant GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromultimeric channels to near homogeneity. Both purification procedures were specifically designed to purify only heteromultimeric channels composed of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (Fig. 1). Potential homomultimeric channels, or dissociated monomers, were not purified with these procedures. Native IKACh was purified from isolated bovine atrial plasma membranes (Fig. 1 A). The membranes were solubilized in 1% CHAPS and subjected to the following purification steps: 1) Toyopearl Red™ affinity chromatography, 2) size exclusion chromatography, 3) WGA affinity chromatography, and 4) IP with anti-GIRK4 antibodies followed by elution with antigenic peptide. WGA affinity chromatography was specific for GIRK1, because GIRK4 is not glycosylated (39Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K.A. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of WGA affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with anti-GIRK4 antibodies ensured that no homomultimeric channels or dissociated monomers were purified. The final product, purified to greater than 95% homogeneity, was native bovine atrial IKACh. Aliquots of purified native IKACh were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (Fig. 2,lane 1) or immunoblotted with anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 2,lane 2) and then stripped and reimmunoblotted with anti-GIRK1 antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 3). The predominant bands in the silver-stained lane were also recognized by anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 antibodies when Western-blotted. The bands correspond to GIRK4 (48 kDa), GIRK1 (54 kDa), and glycosylated GIRK1 (56–76 kDa). Interestingly, the WGA affinity chromatography enhanced the proportion of glycosylated to unglycosylated GIRK1 when compared with unpurified channels, but did not completely eliminate unglycosylated GIRK1 (Fig. 2 A, 54-kDa band). Presumably, some proportion of the native IKAChheteromultimers contain both glycosylated and unglycosylated GIRK1 subunits. Recombinant GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromultimeric channels were purified from transiently transfected COS7 cells using sequential anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 immunoprecipitations (see Fig. 1 B and “Experimental Procedures”). The sequential immunoprecipitations assured that only heteromultimeric channels were purified. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by either Western blotting or autoradiography (Fig. 2 B). All of the protein bands that appeared on the autoradiogram were also recognized by anti-GIRK1 or anti-GIRK4 antibodies. Two independent methods based on densitometry were used to examine GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry. In the first method, silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels of purified native IKACh were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). The ratio of band intensities for GIRK1:GIRK4 was 1.2:1. When this ratio was corrected by multiplying it by the predicted unglycosylated molecular weight of GIRK4(47 kDa)-GIRK1(56 kDa), a molar ratio of 1:1 (n = 3) for GIRK1:GIRK4 was obtained. The advantage of this procedure is that it examines GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry as it exists in native atrial tissue. GIRK1 and GIRK4 share 57% overall amino acid identity, and the silver-stained bands representing GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins varied by less than 3-fold in intensity. These GIRK1 and GIRK4 similarities minimize the potential inaccuracies of protein quantification by silver staining. The second independent method used to examine GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry was based on the [35S]methionine labeling of purified recombinant COS7 GIRK1 and GIRK4 heteromultimers. Because the number of counts emitted by a radiolabeled subunit is directly proportional to its methionine content, this method more accurately quantifies GIRK1 and GIRK4. Ideally, we could determine the native atrial GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry by comparing 35S-labeled GIRK1 and GIRK4 (Fig. 2 B). However, the stoichiometry may vary with the amount of RNA injected into oocytes (29Slesinger P. Reuveny E. Jan Y. Jan L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 30Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Wischmeyer E. Spauschus A. Thomzig A. Veh R. Karschin A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 194-206Google Scholar). If the stoichiometry varied in COS-7 cells, as well, this approach would be inadequate for determining native stoichiometry. Indeed, we found that the GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry of heteromultimeric channels did vary directly with the ratio of GIRK1:GIRK4 DNA used to transfect the COS-7 cells (data not shown). We were unable to force the GIRK1:GIRK4 stoichiometry beyond 1:3 or 3:1 by varying the ratio of GIRK1:GIRK4 DNA transfected by 30-fold, supporting the conclusion that recombinant GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits form tetramers. Because the recombinant system does not necessarily reflect native stoichiometry, we developed a hybrid approach that combined the accurate qauntitation achievable with [35S]methionine labeling of recombinant proteins with the ability of our antibodies to detect native protein. This method involved standardizing the relative blotting sensitivities of our anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 antibodies with a known ratio of labeled recombinant protein. The standardized antibodies were then used to probe native atrial protein and the true native stoichiometry was computed as ∼1:1 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3). Previously, Huang et al. (31Huang D. Maero S. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 454-458Google Scholar) showed that the ratio of two antigens could be estimated with confidence using a similar antibody-blotting method. We extensively cross-linked native bovine IKACh (Fig. 4), recombinant GIRK1 homomultimers (Fig. 5), and recombinant GIRK4 homomultimers (Fig. 5) using a wide variety of cross-linking reagents. First, purified native IKACh was treated with the highly reactive, amine-specific,N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, DTSSP. This reaction produced a multimeric protein detected as a single 234 ± 7-kDa band (n = 8). This cross-linked product was recognized by both anti-GIRK1 (Fig. 4, lane 4) and anti-GIRK4 (Fig. 4,lane 3) antibodies, indicating that both GIRK1 and GIRK4 were cross-linked. The lipid-soluble NHS ester, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), yielded a nearly identical 235-kDa band (Fig. 4, lane 5). Finally, the entire complex was cross-linked through simple oxidation with iodine (Fig. 4, lane 6), and similar results were obtained.Figure 5Native IKACh heteromultimers and recombinant GIRK homomultimers form similar oligomeric structures.Despite the inability of GIRK1 subunits to produce functional channels alone, GIRK1 subunits form oligomeric structures similar to native IKACh heteromultimers and GIRK4 homomultimers.A, native IKACh and recombinant GIRK1 or GIRK4 homomultimers were chemically cross-linked. Cross-linked products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. The molecular weights of the cross-linked native IKACh, recombinant GIRK1, and recombinant GIRK4 homomultimers were all consistent with tetrameric complex formation.

Using a synthetic self-priming DNA, containing CAG and CTG repeats implicated in Huntington's disease and several other neurological disorders, we measure the equilibrium distribution of hairpin folding and generate triplet repeat expansions by polymerase-catalyzed extensions of the hairpin folds. Expansions occur by slippage in steps of two CAG triplets when the self-priming sequence (CTG)16(CAG)4 is extended with proofreading-defective Klenow fragment (KF exo−) fromEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Slippage by two triplets is 20 times more frequent than by one triplet, in accordance with our finding that hairpin loops with even numbers of triplets are 1–2 kcal/mol more stable than their odd-numbered counterparts. By measuring triplet repeat expansions as they evolve over time, individual rate constants for expansion from 4 to 18 CAG repeats are obtained. An empirical expression is derived from the data, enabling the prediction of slippage rates from the ratio of hairpin CTG/CTG interactions to CAG/CTG interactions. Slippage is initiated internally in the hairpin folds in preference to melting inward from the 3′ terminus. The same triplet expansions are obtained using proofreading-proficient KF exo+, provided 10–100-fold higher dNTP concentrations are present to counteract the effect of 3′-exonucleolytic proofreading.

The human genome has an abundance of simple sequence repetitions that are unstable and tend to expand in large numbers in some genetic loci. A prime example is the CAG/CTG class of triplet repeats whose large expansions occur in genes associated with Huntington's disease and six other neurological disorders (1Ashley Jr., C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 703-728Google Scholar). Such expansions represent a novel form of mutation whose cause is unknown. An attractive possibility under investigation is primer/template slippage during DNA replication or repair of tandemly repeated sequences (2Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Curr. Opin.

Evol. 1987; 4: 203-221Google Scholar). For example, in a region of CAG/CTG repeats, local separation creates single-strand loops of CAGs and CTGs whose repetitive character may allow the two strands to be displaced (i.e. slipped) by an integral number of triplets. Such slippage in the presence of DNA polymerases can result in the addition of integral numbers of triplets to give triplet repeat expansions (2Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Curr. Opin.

Gao X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4303-4311Google Scholar) have shown that single strands of CTG repeats form stable hairpin structures as a result of base pairing between antiparallel CTGs, yielding G·C and C·G base pairs alternating with T·T mispairs. Similar hairpins also form in strands of CAG repeats but are not as stable (14Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Google Scholar, 15Smith G.K. Jie J. Fox G.E. Gao X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4303-4311Google Scholar, 16Yu A. Dill J. Mitas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4055-4057Google Scholar), probably because A·A mispairs are bulkier and more destabilizing than T·T (17Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Google Scholar). Our thermal denaturation studies of strand folding (14Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Google Scholar) indicated that hairpin stability increases more slowly than expected with increasing numbers of repeats. A plausible explanation is that strands with more repeating triplets have more degrees of freedom and tend to form several shorter hairpin loops instead of one long one. For example, a strand with 10 triplet repeats may fold into a single hairpin structure, whereas a longer strand with 30 repeats may form a more complex structure with two or three hairpin folds of similar size (14Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Google Scholar).Evidence of strand slippage in CAG/CTG repeat regions during DNA polymerization has been obtained using various gel-based primer extension assays (5Schlotterer C. Tautz D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Google Scholar, 6Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. Hum. Mutat. 1994; 3: 19-24Google Scholar, 7Ji J. Clegg N.J. Peterson K.R. Jackson A.L. Laird C.D. Loeb L.A.

We engineered a DNA oligonucleotide of triplet repeats so that it is primed by intramolecular folding, rather than by intermolecular association. Being independent of concentration, the self-priming remains efficient at low DNA concentrations, unlike intermolecular priming that requires higher DNA concentrations. By using low concentrations, we avoid uncertainties arising from multimeric associations between DNA strands. Also, our starting primer 3′-end is fully complementary to template repeats, instead of partially complementary as in the only previous study of self-priming with triplet repeats (6Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. Hum. Mutat. 1994; 3: 19-24Google Scholar).In the present study we use a self-priming strand containing a large number of CTGs relative to CAGs, to measure the influence of CTG/CTG interactions on strand slippage in polymerase-catalyzed expansions of correctly paired (CAG/CTG) repetitions. This approach provides for the first time an opportunity to measure slippage and expansion rates as a function of the number of interacting triplets, for DNA polymerases with and without proofreading 3′-exonuclease activity.RESULTSThe self-priming sequence, A = (CTG)16(CAG)4, forms a series of hairpin loops (Fig. 1), to which integral numbers of CAG triplets can be added by polymerase-catalyzed reaction with appropriate dNTP substrates (N = C, A, G). In Fig. 1,A0 represents the most stable loop in the form of a blunt-ended hairpin; A1 corresponds to slippage of A0 by a single triplet;A2, slippage by two triplets; etc. Initially, there is an equilibrium distribution of loops reflecting their thermodynamic stability in the absence of polymerase. We verify that stable folds are formed by examining thermal denaturation profiles obtained by plotting UV absorbance (A260)versus temperature (Fig. 2).When DNA polymerase and dNTPs are added, the original loops are extended to blunt ends in a matter of seconds, so that the rates at which blunt-end hairpins rearrange by slippage and expand by triplet additions can be accurately measured over a period of minutes. To establish the equilibrium amounts of individual hairpins and their extension rates, we analyzed polymerase-catalyzed reaction products separated into discrete bands by electrophoresis on a denaturing, formamide-polyacrylamide gel. The products are first analyzed as a function of reaction time (t) at physiologically low (0.1 to 1 μm) dNTP concentration, using a proofreading-deficient DNA polymerase, Klenow fragment exo−. The results shown (Fig. 3) are obtained with 0.2 μm each of the three dNTP substrates (N = C, A, G). This concentration appears high enough to obtain near-maximum velocity of extension with a minimum of artifacts such as terminal transferase activity, seen at higher [dNTP] as an increase in background “pause” bands (data not shown).Thermal Denaturation ProfilesUpon heat denaturation (Fig. 2), the 60-mer (CTG)16(CAG)4 shows two sigmoidal transitions, with melting temperature Tm = 56 and 80 °C at low ionic strength. By comparison, the 30-mer (CTG)6(CAG)4, having 10 fewer CTG repeats, shows only the higher transition with Tm near 80 °C. The biphasic melting curve of the 60-mer is consistent with the kind of hairpin folding shown in Fig. 1, in which the 4 CAG triplets are correctly base-paired with 4 CTG repeats to give the more stable component melting at 80 °C, whereas the remaining 12 CTG triplets are more weakly paired to give the less stable component melting at 56 °C. The latter Tm value is close to that observed for hairpin folding of CTG triplets alone,e.g. (CTG)10 and (CTG)30, each withTm = 51 °C (14Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Google Scholar). However, the melting curve is unable to resolve the kinds of hairpin folds present. The various possible folds (Fig. 1) initially have the same strand length, but when extended with polymerase they acquire increasing lengths, which can be separated by electrophoresis on formamide-polyacrylamide gel.Initial Hairpin LoopsAs seen in Fig. 1, starting at the 5′-end marked by *, the 60-mer sequence A has a potential template of 16 CTG repeats followed by a primer of 4 CAG repeats. Upon hairpin folding, so that the CAGs align with CTGs in antiparallel fashion, the (CAG)4 primer can be correctly base-paired with any 4 successive antiparallel CTGs, shown as (GTC)4 in Fig. 1. The first loop, A0, is a blunt-ended structure with 3′- and 5′-ends juxtaposed. This is the most stable fold because it allows remaining CTGs to form the maximum number of base pairs with each other.The even-numbered loops A2,A4, … , A10belong in the same group as A0, because they each have the same kind of 4-base hairpin bend and an even number of overhanging triplets. The odd-numbered loops A1,A3, … , A11belong in a separate group, because they each have a 3-base bend and an odd number of overhanging triplets. The even-numbered loops are expected to be somewhat more stable than the odd-numbered (10Darlow J.M. Leach D.R.F. Genetics. 1995; 141: 825-832Google Scholar), because they each have one more base pair stabilizing the hairpin bend. For completeness, much less stable loops, A12 toA15, having fewer than 4 correctly paired CAG/CTG combinations, are also shown (Fig. 1).Being blunt-ended, A0 is not suitable for extension by DNA polymerases until it rearranges by strand slippage into one of the other possible forms with an overhanging 5′-template, (GTC)n* (Fig. 1). These forms, An(n = 1, 2, etc.), are easily extended to blunt-end products, An + (CAG)n, by the addition of (CAG)n opposite (GTC)n*. The products are resolved as a series of bands on a denaturing gel, with band intensityIn proportional to the amount of product, (An + (CAG)n). The 5′-end (*) is radiolabeled with 32P to obtain quantitative band intensity measurements with a PhosphorImager.Loop Resolution by Electrophoretic Analysis of Polymerase-catalyzed Extension ProductsUsing proofreading-deficient DNA polymerase KF exo−, we observed complete extension of initial loops within 0.5 min of reaction (Fig. 3). A 6-fold excess of polymerase is used to saturate all the self-primed loops originally present so that they can be completely extended to blunt ends in seconds, before appreciable primer/template slippage can occur. Also, we use a dNTP concentration low enough (0.2 μm) to avoid the formation of anomalous pause bands arising by base misinsertion or by blunt end addition of a single nucleotide (19Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Google Scholar).In Fig. 3 it is clear that the most intense bands correspond to additions of even numbers of CAG triplets. The bands formed by adding 0, 2, 4, etc. triplets are much more intense than those formed by adding 1, 3, etc. triplets. This striking result shows that even-numbered loops (Fig. 1) are significantly more abundant,i.e. more stable, than odd-numbered, in agreement with earlier observations (10Darlow J.M. Leach D.R.F. Genetics. 1995; 141: 825-832Google Scholar). The way the band intensitiesIn change with t, the time of reaction, indicates the rates at which the blunt-end loops, An+ (CAG)n, rearrange by slippage and expand by the addition of more CAGs.Measurement of Expansion Rates for Primer/Template Slippage in Polymerase KF exo− ReactionsBy examining the band patterns in Fig. 3, we find that as the original 60-mer band (0 triplets added) decays with t, each subsequent even-numbered band, representing addition of 2, 4, etc. CAG triplets, intensifies to a maximum before decaying. This is better illustrated in Fig. 4, where the band intensityIn, expressed as percent of total intensity in each lane, is shown plotted versus t for the first three even-numbered bands, n = 0, 2, and 4. Since odd-numbered bands (additions of 1, 3, etc. triplets) remain faint at all times, we see that slippage by two triplets is strongly favored over slippage by one triplet.Figure 4Plot of band intensities versusreaction time for the first three main bands representing extensions by 0, 2, and 4 CAG triplets. Band intensity I0indicates the amount of the original blunt-ended loopA0 (Fig. 1), and I2 and I4 indicate the amounts of the extension products, A2 + (CAG)2 andA4 + (CAG)4, respectively. Each band intensity is expressed as percent of total integrated band intensities in the corresponding lane (Fig. 3), measured by PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To describe how each band intensity In changes because of slippage by 2 triplets and subsequent expansion by (CAG)2, we use the kinetic scheme in Fig. 5. The rate constantskn with n = 0, 2, 4, etc. represent “macroscopic” rates for converting each even-numbered blunt-end loop (In) to the next (In+2) by 2-triplet slippage and expansion. For n = 0, the intensityI0 decreases exponentially with t(Fig. 4), and the exponential curve fitted by least squares yields the slippage rate constant, k0 = 0.81 min−1. By extrapolating to t = 0, we findI0(t → 0) = 61% as the initial amount of hairpin A0 (Table I). For n = 2, band intensity I2 rises rapidly until it reaches a maximum and then gradually declines (Fig. 4). By assumingk0 is the rate constant for convertingI0 to I2 by 2-triplet slippage, we obtain a good fit with the relationship, dI2/dt =k0 I0 −k2 I2, enabling us to determine k2 relative tok0. Also, by extrapolating to t= 0 we obtain I2(t → 0), the initial amount of hairpin A2 (Table I). Similarly, using dIn/dt =kn−2 In−2− kn In, we are able to evaluatekn relative to kn−2and by extrapolation to estimate the initial amounts of the even-numbered hairpins with n = 4–14, i.e. A4 to A14. In the case ofA14, the initial amount (0.5%) is barely above the minimum level of detection, and the rate constant for slippage is not determined (ND, Table I).Figure 5Kinetic scheme used to evaluate rate constants for slippage and expansion by two triplets. The rate constants kn (n = 0, 2, 4, etc.) indicate the rate at which band intensity In is converted to In2 as a result of 2-triplet slippage and polymerase-catalyzed expansion by 2 CAG triplets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because odd-numbered loops give much less intense bands, comparable to faint pause bands in the background, we can only evaluate initial amounts for A1, A3, andA5 (Table I). In the case ofA1, there is sufficient intensity to estimate a rate constant k1 for 2-triplet slippage (I1 → I3), assumingA0 contributes to A1(I0 → I1) with rate constant k0′ for 1-triplet slippage. In this case, dI1/dt =k0′I0 −k1 I1, when applied to our data, yields k0′ = 0.04 ± 0.02 min−1 and k1 = 0.7 ± 0.1 min−1 (Table I, in brackets).Relationship between Slippage Rate and Number of Interacting TripletsIn Table I (last column) we see that the slippage rate constant kn decreases with increasing number,n, of added CAGs. The rate constant is highest (0.8 min−1) for n = 0, the initial blunt-end hairpin A0 (Fig. 1), which has the highest number of CTG/CTG interactions relative to CAG/CTG interactions. As Fig. 1 shows, A0 has 4 strong CAG/CTG base pairing interactions and 5 weaker CTG/CTG interactions, so that (CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG) = 5/4. The longer blunt-end hairpins,An + (CAG)n, formed by adding nCAG triplets complementary to the template (GTC)n* (Fig. 1), gain n more CAG/CTG interactions while losing n/2 CTG/CTG interactions. Thus, while (CAG/CTG) = 4 + nincreases with n, both (CTG/CTG) = 5 − (n/2) and the ratio, (CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG) = (10 −n)/(8 + 2n), decrease with n.The kn value (on a logarithmic scale) shows a positive correlation with (CTG/CTG) = 5 − n/2 and a negative correlation with (CAG/CTG) = 4 + n (Fig. 6 A). In each case, the correlation is nonlinear for even values of n from 0 to 8. However, when log kn is plotted against the ratio, (CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG) = (10 − n)/(8 + 2n), the points fall close to a straight line (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, k1 obtained for 2-triplet slippage between odd-numbered loops (Table I, in brackets) also falls on this line, at the point corresponding to n = 1 (Fig. 6 B, open square).Figure 6Semi-log plot of rate constant values as a function of interacting triplets. A, plot of logkn (n = 0, 2, … , 10)versus the corresponding number of triplet interactions, (CAG/CTG) = 4 + n (upper scale) or CTG/CTG = 5 − (n/2) (lower scale). B, plot of log kn versus the relative number of CTG/CTG interactions to CAG/CTG interactions, i.e.(CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG) = (10 − n)/(8 + 2n). The straight line is a least squares fit tok0, k2, … ,k10 (solid squares) found for 2-triplet slippage in even-numbered loops; the open squareis the lone (k1) value found for 2-triplet slippage in odd-numbered loops (Table I, brackets).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The equation of the line fitted by least squares (Fig. 6 B) is log10 kn = 0.38x − 0.56, where x = (CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG). This equation can also be written as kn = αe βx, where α = 0.28 min−1 and β = 0.87. We can interpret α as the slippage rate constant for CAG/CTG interactions alone and e βx as the factor arising from the influence of (CTG/CTG) on the slippage of (CAG/CTG). This factor appears to hold as long as slippage by 2 triplets does not change the character of the hairpin bend made by CTGs.The even-numbered loops A0 toA10 (Fig. 1) have the same kind of 4-base bend made with two CTGs. However, in A12 the bend acquires a CAG in place of a CTG at the expense of a CAG/CTG base-pairing interaction, making it more difficult for A10 → A12 slippage to occur. As seen in Table I (last column), the slippage rate constant drops dramatically, from 0.28 min−1 for k8 (I8 →I10) to 0.08 min−1 for k10 (I10 →I12). This marked reduction in slippage rate is also evident in the accumulation of band intensityI10, corresponding to 10 CAG triplets added (Fig. 3). Subsequently, the slippage rate declines further to 0.06 min−1 for k12(I12 → I14) and to an even lower value for k14, undetermined (ND) in Table I.Effect of Proofreading Activity on Expansion RateWhen KF exo− is replaced by normal proofreading-proficient Klenow fragment, the 3′-exonuclease activity of proofreading markedly inhibits expansion at low dNTP concentrations (Fig. 7). At 0.2 μm dTNP, band intensities similar to those found initially with KF exo−are observed in the 1st min of reaction, but expansion by slippage is greatly reduced because of 3′-end degradation with increasing time (Fig. 7). As dNTP concentration is increased to counteract the degradation, the band patterns for expansion by slippage are recovered for longer times. At 1.0 μm dNTP, the same patterns of band intensities as in Fig. 3 are observed for the first 10 min, but some decreases in long expansions (notably I14and I12) are evident at longer times. At 10 μm, no significant decreases are evident for at least 60 min. Thus, to obtain the same degree of expansion in the presence of proofreading as in its absence, apparently 10 to 100 times as much dNTP is required.Figure 7Band patterns obtained by extension with proofreading-proficient DNA polymerase KF (exo+) at three different dNTP concentrations. Under incubation conditions like those used for proofreading-deficient KF exo− (Fig. 3), at low (0.2 μm) dNTP concentration, the self-priming sequence 32P(CTG)16(CAG)4 is extended to blunt-ended states in less than 1 min as before, but expansion by slippage is markedly reduced because of strand degradation by proofreading 3′-exonuclease activity. To counteract the degradation, much higher dNTP concentrations are needed. A 5-fold increase (1.0 μm) restores the pattern of expansion by slippage seen in Fig. 3 for the first 10 min; another 10-fold increase (10 μm) is needed to maintain the pattern for the full 60 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONSingle DNA strands containing tandemly repeated CTG or CAG triplets form hairpin structures which, although not as stable as normal DNA duplexes, are nonetheless remarkably stable (10Darlow J.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4303-4311Google Scholar, 20Mitas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2245-2253Google Scholar). To investigate the influence that such secondary structures have on strand slippage in polymerase-catalyzed repeat expansions, we have constructed a strand sequence, (CTG)16(CAG)4, forming a series of self-primed hairpins (Fig. 1) to which repeats of CAG triplets can be added by DNA polymerases. This sequence provides an opportunity to measure the influence of hairpin CTG/CTG interactions on primer/template slippage in repeating CAG/CTG regions. By using a DNA polymerase devoid of exonuclease activity (KF exo−), we find that initial hairpin loops (formed at equilibrium) are fully extended to blunt-ended forms in a matter of seconds, so that the rates at which blunt-end loops rearrange by slippage and add more repeats can be measured over a period of minutes to about 1 h (Fig. 3). With this construct, we observe triplet repeat expansions in a series of discrete slippage steps for which rate constants can be evaluated.Of the various hairpins formed initially (Fig. 1), those with an even number of bases in the bend appear most stable since they are found in the largest amounts (Table I). The series of even-numbered loops fromA0 to A10 account for over 90% of all folded structures. As expected, the most stable loop is the blunt-ended structure A0, whose initial amount is 61% of total structures at 37 °C. The next most stable loops are initially present in amounts of 5–7%, these being the five even-numbered loops, A2 toA10. Surprisingly, each of the latter is as abundant or more abundant than all the odd-numbered loops collectively. The abundance of even-numbered loops does not decrease fromA2 to A10 as might be expected but instead shows a minimum at A4(5%). Possibly the longer overhanging templates, shown simply as (GTC)n* in Fig. 1, form a second hairpin fold providing some additional stability.The initial amounts of loops formed at equilibrium, in the absence of polymerase, can be used to calculate relative loop stabilities in terms of standard free energy, ΔG o = −RTlnKeq. From the ratio of equilibrium amounts, Keq = 7/61, we findA2 is less stable than A0by RTln(61/7) = 1.3 kcal/mol at T = 37 °C or 310 K. Similarly, from Keq = 2/61,A1 is found to be 2.1 kcal/mol less stable thanA0 and thus 0.8 kcal/mol less stable thanA2. Finding A1 about 1 kcal/mol less stable than A2 is consistent with our observation (Table I, footnote) that slippage by 1 triplet, converting A0 to A1, is an order of magnitude slower than the rate for 2-triplet slippage converting A0 to A2.As shown in Fig. 6 B, the rate of slippage by 2 triplets may be simply related to the ratio of CTG/CTG interactions to CAG/CTG interactions involved in slippage. The logarithm of the slippage rate constant, when plotted against the ratio (CTG/CTG)/(CAG/CTG) in the blunt-ended hairpin undergoing slippage, shows a linear relationship with a positive slope. The slope indicates that slippage rate increases exponentially with the ratio. The implication is that hairpin CTG/CTG interactions promote slippage by 2 triplets and thereby provide a favorable way of propagating waves of expansion in CAG/CTG repeat regions.In the expansion of the blunt-ended loops in our system, there are several reasons to think that slippage begins internally with CTG/CTG interactions rather than at the primer 3′ terminus with CAG/CTG interactions. We observe (Fig. 2) that the CTG/CTG region has a melting temperature 24 °C lower than the CAG/CTG region, so that local melting needed to initiate slippage is much more likely to occur in the CTG/CTG region. To initiate slippage by 2 triplets, three CAG/CTG interactions need to be disrupted at the primer 3′-end, but only one next to the CTG/CTG region where two weaker CTG/CTG interactions are more easily disrupted. Slippage by 2 triplets is favored over slippage by 1 triplet, in accordance with even-numbered loops of CTGs being more stable than odd-numbered (Table I). The rate constant for 2-triplet slippage increases with CTG/CTG interactions but decreases with CAG/CTG interactions (Fig. 6 A), so that the rate constant increases exponentially with the ratio of CTG/CTG to CAG/CTG interactions, as seen by the linear plot of log(rate constant) versus this ratio (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, in the presence of 3′-exonucleolytic proofreading (Fig. 7), as long as there are CTG/CTG interactions present (n = 0–8) and slippage rates are 0.28 min−1 or higher (Table I), less than 1.0 μm dNTP concentrations are needed to restore normal slippage patterns, whereas 10 μm concentrations are needed when CTG/CTG interactions are absent (n = 12 and 14) and slippage rates fall to 0.08 min−1 or lower (Table I).Since our system is single-stranded and relatively short, it is no"

https://openalex.org/W1999282329,"The Wilms tumor gene, WT1, encodes a zinc-finger DNA binding protein which is thought to function as a tissue specific transcription factor, regulating cell growth and differentiation. High expression of WT1 has been detected in a range of acute leukemias. To elucidate a role for WT1 in leukemogenesis, we transfected the monoblastic cell line U937, which lacks detectable levels of endogenous WT1, with two isoforms of WT1. We showed that, in contrast to U937 control cells, cells constitutively expressing either of the isoforms, WT1(-KTS) or WT1(+KTS), did not respond to differentiation induction by retinoic acid or vitamin D3, as judged by the capacity to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium and morphology. Although U937 cells expressing WT1 were hampered in their ability to differentiate on incubation with retinoic acid and vitamin D3, the induced G1/G0-accumulation was similar to differentiating control cells treated with inducers. Furthermore, distinct effects on the maturation process were indicated by downregulation of the myeloid cell surface makers CD13 and CD15, while the upregulation of CD14 and CD11c on WT1 transfected cells was similar to control cells upon incubation with retinoic acid and vitamin D3. Taken together our results demonstrate that a constitutive expression of WT1 in the leukemic cell line U937 leads to impairment of differentiation responses, indicating that a high expression of WT1 can contribute to the differentiation block of acute leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W2087798525,"We have previously shown that a 20 amino acid peptide derived from the third ankyrin-like repeat of the p16CDKN2/INK4a (p16) tumour suppressor protein (residues 84 – 103 of the human p16 protein) can bind to cdk4 and cdk6 and inhibit cdk4-cyclin D1 kinase activity in vitro as well as block cell cycle progression through G1. Substitution of two valine residues corresponding to amino acids 95 and 96 (V95A and V96A) of the p16 peptide reduces the binding to cdk4 and cdk6 and increases its IC0.5 for kinase inhibition approximately threefold when linked to the Antennapedia homeodomain carrier sequence. The same mutations increase the IC0.5 approximately fivefold in the p16 protein. Substitution of aspartic acid 92 by alanine instead increases the binding of the peptide to cdk4 and cdk6 and the kinase inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide blocks S-phase entry in non-synchronized human HaCaT cells by approximately 90% at a 24 μM concentration. The V95A and V96A double substitution minimizes the cell cycle inhibitory capacity of the peptide whereas the D92A substitution increases its capacity to block cell cycle progression. A deletion series of the p16 derived peptide shows that a 10 residue peptide still retains cdk4-cyclin D1 kinase and cell cycle inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide inhibited S-phase entry in five cell lines tested, varying between 47 – 75%, but had only a limited (11%) inhibitory effect in the pRb negative Saos-2 cells at a concentration of 24 μM. Like the full length p16 protein, the p16 peptide does not inhibit cyclin E dependent cdk2 kinase activity in vitro. These data suggest that acute inhibition of CDK-cyclin D activity by a peptide derived from the INK4 family will stop cells in late G1 in a pRb dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2073404673,"Internalization and down-regulation of human muscarinic acetylcholine m2 receptors (hm2 receptors) and a hm2 receptor mutant lacking a central part of the third intracellular loop (I3-del m2 receptor) were examined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing these receptors and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). Agonist-induced internalization of up to 80–90% of hm2 receptors was demonstrated by measuring loss of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding sites from the cell surface, and transfer of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites from the plasma membrane into the light-vesicle fractions separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Additionally, translocation of hm2 receptors with endocytic vesicles were visualized by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Agonist-induced down-regulation of up to 60–70% of hm2 receptors was demonstrated by determining the loss of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in the cells. The half-time (t½) of internalization and down-regulation in the presence of 10−4m carbamylcholine was estimated to be 9.5 min and 2.3 h, respectively. The rates of both internalization and down-regulation of hm2 receptors in the presence of 10−6m or lower concentrations of carbamylcholine were markedly increased by coexpression of GRK2. Agonist-induced internalization of I3-del m2 receptors was barely detectable upon incubation of cells for 1 h, but agonist-induced down-regulation of up to 40–50% of I3-del m2 receptors occurred upon incubation with 10−4m carbamylcholine for 16 h. However, the rate of down-regulation was lower compared with wild type receptors (t½ = 9.9 versus2.3 h). These results indicate that rapid internalization of hm2 receptors is facilitated by their phosphorylation with GRK2 and does not occur in the absence of the third intracellular loop, but down-regulation of hm2 receptors may occur through both GRK2-facilitating pathway and third intracellular loop-independent pathways. Internalization and down-regulation of human muscarinic acetylcholine m2 receptors (hm2 receptors) and a hm2 receptor mutant lacking a central part of the third intracellular loop (I3-del m2 receptor) were examined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing these receptors and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2).

Loss of the cell's response to agonist acting at G protein-coupled receptors can occur in three phases: uncoupling from G proteins, sequestration/internalization, and down-regulation of the receptors. Many G protein-coupled receptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; hm2 receptor, human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m2 subtype; DN-GRK2, dominant negative form of GRK2; I3-loop, the third intracellular loop; I3-del m2 receptor, a hm2 receptor mutant that lacks a central part of the third intracellular loop; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; NMS,N-methylscopolamine; QNB, quinuclidinyl benzilate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. in an agonist-dependent manner as a major mechanism in receptor regulation (for review, see Refs. 1Haga T.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m2 subtypes have also been shown to be phosphorylated by GRK2 (β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1) (3Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Google Scholar, 4Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Moro O. Sadée W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 267-276Google Scholar) and other GRKs (5Kunapuli P. Onorato J.J. Hosey M.M.

In addition, phosphorylation of β2-adrenergic receptors by GRK2 may be involved in the uncoupling of β2-adrenergic receptors from G protein Gs (1Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 400-412Google Scholar, 2Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). The phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptors were reported to be uncoupled from G proteins because of their interaction with β-arrestin (1Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 400-412Google Scholar, 2Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar,7Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylation by GRKs has been reported to correlate with uncoupling for several G protein-coupled receptors including muscarinic m2 (8Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Google Scholar), α1B-adrenergic (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10143-10148Google Scholar). β-Arrestin and arrestin 3 (β-arrestin 2) were shown to interact with m2 muscarinic as well as with β2-adrenergic receptors (14Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Google Scholar, 15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Google Scholar). Sequestration/internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors seemed to be independent of phosphorylation by GRK2 on the basis of results with β2-adrenergic receptor mutants lacking phosphorylation sites or GRK-specific inhibitors (16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Blake A.D. Cheung A.H. Register R.B. Rands E. Zemcik B.A. Candelore M.R. Dixon R.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 855-863Google Scholar, 17Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. De Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Google Scholar). On the other hand, the agonist-induced sequestration of hm2 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells is hampered by deletion of the third intracellular loop (I3-loop) which includes the GRK2 phosphorylation sites (21Moro O. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar, 22Nakata H. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 29-36Google Scholar). Moreover, agonist-dependent phosphorylation and sequestration of m2 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells are facilitated by coexpression of GRK2 and attenuated by coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of GRK2 (DN-GRK2) that lacks kinase activity (23Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar). Recently, Ferguson et al. have reexamined the relationship between the phosphorylation by GRK2 and sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors, demonstrating that phosphorylation by GRK2 (24Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Google Scholar) or other GRKs (25Ménard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Bertrand L. Premont R.T. Colapietro A.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4155-4160Google Scholar) facilitates sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors. Phosphorylation facilitates β-arrestin binding to β2-adrenergic receptors (26Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar) and thereby appears to enhance sequestration, possibly interacting with clathrin (27Goodmann O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar), a major protein of coated pits. Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (8Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Google Scholar, 28Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Google Scholar) have provided results showing that the phosphorylation by GRK2 of m2 receptors is involved in their internalization as well as in their uncoupling from G proteins in HEK293 cells. These results suggest that the phosphorylation by GRK2 of m2 muscarinic and β2-adrenergic receptors may be involved in both internalization and uncoupling through facilitation of their interaction with β-arrestin/arrestin 3. No studies have been carried out on the relation between down-regulation and phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors, except that down-regulation of β2-adrenergic receptors has been reported to be independent of their phosphorylation by GRK2 (16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Blake A.D. Cheung A.H. Register R.B. Rands E. Zemcik B.A. Candelore M.R. Dixon R.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 855-863Google Scholar, 18Campbell P.T. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 192-198Google Scholar). It is also unclear whether the cellular pathway leading to down-regulation is distinct from that of internalization. If a portion of receptors in clathrin-coated vesicles translocates into lysosomes and is down-regulated, their phosphorylation with GRKs or the deletion of I3-loop should also affect down-regulation. However, if down-regulation occurs by a distinct pathway, receptor phosphorylation may not play a role. Alternatively, both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated receptors may enter the clathrin-dependent internalization pathway, albeit at different rates. Finally, receptor phosphorylation could affect the rate of translocation between endosomes and lysosomes, or recycling to the cell surface. Here, we provide evidence that down-regulation as well as internalization of hm2 receptors are facilitated by coexpression of GRK2. Moreover, deletion of I3-loop, which contains the GRK2 phosphorylation sites (22Nakata H. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 29-36Google Scholar), suppressed rapid internalization and markedly reduced the rate of down-regulation. [3H]NMS (specific activity of 71.3 Ci/mmol) and [3H]QNB (specific activity of 36.4 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products; restriction enzymes were from Toyobo Corp. and Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.; Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Jackson Laboratories. cDNA of GRK2 was kindly donated by Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz, mammalian expression vector for hygromycin-resistant gene (pSV-hygro) was from Dr. H. Okayama, and mammalian expression vector with neomycin-resistant gene (pEF-neo) and mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS were from Drs. S. Nagata and T. Shimizu. Hybridoma cells expressing 9E10 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection; Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 cells were from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. The construction of mammalian expression vectors for c-Myc epitope-tagged hm2 receptor (pEF-Myc-hm2) and GRK2 (pEF-GRK2) was described previously (23Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells (5 × 104cells) were transfected with 18 μg of expression vectors of pEF-Myc-hm2 and 2 μg of pEF-neo by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were subcloned by limiting dilution. Expression of receptors was detected by [3H]QNB binding. The [3H]QNB binding sites in these cells were estimated to be 165 fmol/mg of protein in total homogenate. The transfectants were cultured in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's) (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera International Inc.), 40 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji Seika, Kaisha Ltd.), 40 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Meiji Seika, Kaisha Ltd.), and 100 μg/ml Geneticin at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. One of the CHO cell clones expressing hm2 receptors was transfected with 18 μg of pEF-GRK2 and 2 μg of pSV-hygro, and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Boehringer Mannheim) and subcloned by limiting dilution. Expression of GRK2 was detected with use of Western blotting as described previously (23Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar). The [3H]QNB binding sites of these cells were estimated to be 330 fmol/mg of protein in total homogenate, and expressed amounts of GRK2 were estimated to be 300–600 fmol/mg of protein in the supernatant by immunostaining with anti-GRK2 antibodies. The transfectants were cultured in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 40 units/ml penicillin G, 40 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. A mammalian expression vector for a m2 receptor mutant that lacks a central part of the third intracellular loop (I3-del m2 receptor) was constructed by inserting the NheI-XhoI fragment of the pSG5/Hm2(d234–381) (21Moro O. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar) into the NheI/XhoI site of pEF-Myc-hm2. I3-del m2 receptors were stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells as described above, and the [3H]QNB binding sites of these cells were estimated to be 260 fmol/mg of protein in total homogenate. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was carried out as described by Hardenet al. (30Harden T.K. Petch L.A. Traynelis S.F. Waldo G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13060-13066Google Scholar). Semiconfluent CHO cells cultured in a 15-cm diameter dish were treated with 10−5mcarbamylcholine for 20 min and then washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5). Washed cells were incubated with 10 ml of serum-free F-12 medium containing 50 μg/ml concanavalin A for 20 min on ice, then washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer (1 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and hypotonically lysed by incubation in 10 ml of lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. After removing the lysis buffer, cells were collected in a small volume of lysis buffer with rubber policeman. The lysate (1 ml) was layered on top of a sucrose density gradient comprising 55, 50, 47.5, 45, 42.5, 40, 37.5, 35, 32.5, and 30% of sucrose solution (0.9 ml each) buffered with 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The gradient was centrifuged in a Hitachi SW 27 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected from bottom and then subjected to [3H]QNB binding assay. A portion of each fraction (0.1 ml) was mixed with 0.9 ml of HEN buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, 1 mm EDTA, 160 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.36 nm [3H]QNB, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation, membranes were trapped on a Whatman GF-B glass fiber filter, washed with 1 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) four times, and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. CHO cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated onto 12-well culture dishes. Forty to forty-eight hours after plating, various concentrations of carbamylcholine were added to culture media. After incubation with carbamylcholine for 15 min to 16 h, cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS/well and incubated with 1.2–1.6 nm [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB in Hepes-buffered saline (25 mmHepes, 113 mm NaCl, 6 mm glucose, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 1 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4; 0.5 ml/well) at 4 °C for 4 h. After incubation, cells were washed three times with 1 ml ice-cold PBS/well. After washing, cells were dissolved in 0.3 ml of 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), mixed with 4.5 ml of Triton-toluene mixture containing 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.01% 1,4-bis-2-(methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene, and the radioactivity measured. Quadruplicate samples were assayed for each point. In some experiments, cells were treated with carbamylcholine in the hypertonic medium containing 0.32 m sucrose besides normal constituents. Down-regulation in the hypertonic medium was examined for cells treated with carbamylcholine for 1–4 h, because the incubation for longer than 4 h in the hypertonic medium caused CHO cells to deteriorate. CHO cells expressing human c-Myc-tagged m2 receptors were grown overnight on plastic chamber slides (Nunc Inc.). Treatment with various concentrations of carbamylcholine was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. At the end of drug treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% fish gelatin, 0.04% saponin, and 0.05% NaN3. After permeabilization, cells were labeled with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) (31Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar) for 1 h, washed four times with PBS, incubated with Cy3 (indocarbocyamine)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and then washed four times with PBS and once with water. Slides were mounted using Fluoromount G (Fisher Scientific) containing a trace amount of phenylenediamine and stored at 4 °C. Samples were visualized using laser scanning confocal microscopy with a krypton-argon laser coupled with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal head attached to an Optiphot II Nikon microscope with a Plan Apo 60 × 1.4 NA objective lens with 1.4 numeric aperture. Cy3 emission was detected with a yellow high sensitivity filter block. CHO cells expressing hm2 receptors with or without GRK2 were treated with carbamylcholine for various times, and then [3H]NMS binding activity of intact cells was measured. Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of incubation time and concentrations of carbamylcholine on the sequestration of hm2 receptors, as assessed by loss of [3H]NMS binding activity from the cell surfaces. In the presence of 10−5m or higher concentrations of carbamylcholine, 70–80% of [3H]NMS binding sites were sequestered with a half-life of approximately 10 min. In the presence of 10−6m carbamylcholine, the rate of sequestration was slower, and less than 20% of [3H]NMS binding sites were sequestered in 60 min. Coexpression of GRK2 markedly increased the rate of sequestration in the presence of 10−6mcarbamylcholine but only slightly increased the extent of sequestration in the presence of 10−5m or higher concentrations of carbamylcholine (Fig. 1, A–C). Fig. 1 D shows the [3H]NMS binding sites remaining on the surface of cells pretreated with carbamylcholine for 60 min. Without GRK2 cotransfection, 10−6m or higher carbamylcholine concentrations were required to elicit sequestration, whereas, with GRK2 cotransfection, 10−7mcarbamylcholine was sufficient to detect sequestration. Apparent EC50 values of carbamylcholine were estimated to be 0.37 and 2.4 μm for cells with or without coexpression of GRK2. Similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells expressing m2 receptors, where GRK2 stimulated the sequestration of [3H]NMS binding sites in the presence of low, but not high, concentrations of carbamylcholine. In m2 receptors expressed in BHK-21 cells, the effect of GRK2 was observed in the presence of high concentrations of carbamylcholine, but the effect in the presence of low concentration of carbamylcholine was greater (21Moro O. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar). It should be noted that the portion of sequestered m2 receptors was higher for CHO cells (80%) than for COS-7 cells (40%) or BHK-21 cells (20–25%). Many membrane proteins including G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be internalized through coated vesicles (26Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar, 27Goodmann O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 32Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Google Scholar, 33Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernstr S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Google Scholar), whereas some receptors including m2 muscarinic receptors have also been reported to be internalized via caveolae (34Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Pinon D. Holicky E. Hadac E. Larkin J.M. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Google Scholar, 35Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Google Scholar). To determine which process is involved in the sequestration of hm2 receptors expressed in CHO cells, we have examined the effect of hypertonic medium on the sequestration, because the hypertonic medium is known to inhibit the internalization through clathrin-coated vesicles but not the internalization through caveolae (33Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Ernstr S.A. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 186-196Google Scholar, 34Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Pinon D. Holicky E. Hadac E. Larkin J.M. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Google Scholar, 36Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Google Scholar, 37Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Google Scholar). Sequestration of hm2 receptors in the presence of 10−4m or lower concentrations of carbamylcholine was completely suppressed in the hypertonic medium containing 0.32 m sucrose (Fig. 1 E), indicating that hm2 receptors are internalized through clathrin-coated vesicles. The inhibition of sequestration by the hypertonic medium was observed whether GRK2 was coexpressed or not, excluding the possibility that the coexpression of GRK2 facilitated the internalization of hm2 receptors through the pathway different from the coated vesicle-mediated pathway. Sequestration of muscarinic receptors as assessed by the loss of [3H]NMS binding sites from the cell surface is generally thought to represent internalization of receptors in the form of endocytosed vesicles. We confirmed internalization of hm2 receptors expressed in CHO cells with two different methods: sucrose density gradient centrifugation and confocal microscopy. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was carried out as described by Harden et al. (30Harden T.K. Petch L.A. Traynelis S.F. Waldo G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13060-13066Google Scholar). The carbamylcholine-treated cells were incubated with concanavalin A, hypotonically lysed, and then subjected to the centrifugation, which resulted in the separation of two fractions: a heavy membrane fraction containing cell surface membranes and a light fraction containing intracellular vesicles (endosomes). As shown in Fig. 2, the peak of [3H]QNB binding sites shifted from the heavy to light fraction by treatment of cells with 10−5m carbamylcholine for 20 min. This result is consistent with the interpretation that the sequestered [3H]NMS binding sites corresponding to approximately 50% of total hm2 receptors were transferred from cell membranes to light vesicle fractions. We have also followed internalization using laser scanning confocal microscopy. CHO cells expressing Myc-tagged hm2 receptors alone or Myc-tagged hm2 receptors together with GRK2 were labeled with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) as described previously by Tolbert and Lameh (32Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist, hm2 receptors can be observed only at the cell surface (Fig. 3, A and C). When the cells were treated with 10−6m carbamylcholine for 10 min, vesicles containing hm2 receptors were observed only in cells coexpressing GRK2 (Fig. 3 D). In the cells expressing only hm2 receptors, no intracellular vesicles containing hm2 receptors were observed after agonist treatment (Fig. 3 B). These results provide evidence that the sequestration/internalization observed as the loss of [3H]NMS binding sites and the transfer of [3H]QNB binding sites represents the translocation of hm2 receptors from plasma membranes into cytoplasmic vesicles. The down-regulation of hm2 receptors was assessed as the agonist-induced decrease in [3H]QNB binding sites, as the tertiary amine [3H]QNB can penetrate the cell membranes and label total hm2 receptors, whereas the quaternary amine [3H]NMS cannot penetrate the cell membrane and labels only surface hm2 receptors. As shown in Fig. 4, the [3H]QNB binding sites decreased with slower rates compared with the decrease in [3H]NMS binding sites from the cell surface, and the rate was dependent on the carbamylcholine concentration. In cells expressing hm2 receptors alone, [3H]QNB binding sites decreased by 60% upon incubation with 10−5m or higher concentration of carbamylcholine for 16 h. In cells expressing both hm2 receptors and GRK2, the loss of [3H]QNB binding site was similar initially, and enhanced down-regulation by 70% appeared only at 16 h pretreatment (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, down-regulation was undetectable in the presence of 10−6m carbamylcholine without GRK2, whereas significant down-regulation occurred with GRK2 coexpression (Fig. 4 A). Apparent EC50 values of carbamylcholine for the down-regulation of hm2 receptors after 16 h of treatment were estimated to be 0.7 and 6 μm for cells with or without coexpression of GRK2 (Fig. 4 D). These results provide the first evidence that the down-regulation of G protein-coupled receptors is facilitated by coexpression of GRK2 and suggest that phosphorylation by GRK2 of hm2 receptors is directly or indirectly linked to their down-regulation. Down-regulation of hm2 receptors, as well as their sequestration, was markedly inhibited in the hypertonic medium (Fig. 4 E). When cells were treated with 10−4m carbamylcholine for 4 h, the proportions of down-regulated receptors were 17–18% in the hypertonic medium, in contrast with 39–49% in the normal medium. The inhibition was observed irrespective of the coexpression of GRK2 or not. The finding that both sequestration and down-regulation were commonly inhibited in the hypertonic medium supports the idea that both sequestration and down-regulation involve the same event,e.g. the internalization through coated vesicles. We have stably expressed I3-del m2 receptors in CHO cells and examined changes in [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB binding sites on cells treated with different concentrations of carbamylcholine for various times. Phosphorylation sites by GRK2 in hm2 receptors are known to be in the I3-loop (22Nakata H. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 29-36Google Scholar), and I3-del m2 receptors are not phosphorylated by GRK2 (4Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Moro O. Sadée W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 267-276Google Scholar). I3-del m2 receptors transiently expressed in HEK293 cells have been shown to sequester much less than hm2 receptors (21Moro O. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar). Similarly, I3-del m2 receptors in CHO cells failed to sequester significantly upon treatment with carbamylcholine for 1 h (Fig. 5 A). The [3H]NMS binding sites were gradually decreased upon prolonged incubation with carbamylcholine, but the rate of loss was much lower for I3-del m2 receptors (t½ = 8.4 h) than for wild type hm2 receptors (t½ = 9.5 min) (Fig. 5 C). Fig. 5 B shows changes in [3H]QNB binding sites after incubation of cells expressing wild type and I3-del m2 receptors for 16 h with different concentrations of carbamylcholine. Unexpectedly, appreciable loss of [3H]QNB binding sites was observed even for I3-del m2 receptors, although the extent of loss was less for I3-del m2 receptors (44%) than for hm2 receptors (60%). The rate of loss was also much slower for I3-del m2 receptors than for hm2 receptors (t½ = 9.9 versus 2.3 h) (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the presence of the I3-loop is not required for agonist-induced down-regulation, although it may accelerate the rate of down-regulation. The loss of [3H]QNB binding sites in the presence of 10−4m carbamylcholine occurred in parallel with the loss of [3H]NMS binding sites for I3-del m2 receptors, (t½ = 9.9 and 8.4 h for the loss of [3H]QNB and [3H]NMS binding sites, respectively), in a sharp contrast to the rates for hm2 wild type receptors (t½ = 2.3 h and 9.5 min, respectively) (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the I3-del m2 receptors are down-regulated as soon as they are lost from the cell surface and that no appreciable amounts of I3-del m2 receptors exist in an internalized form, whereas 40–60% of hm2 receptors exist in an internalized form (Figs. 5 C and6). In previous studies (23Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar), we have shown that sequestration of m2 receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 and BHK-21 cells was facilitated by coexpression of GRK2, an effect of which was evident only at low concentrations of carbamylcholine. In the present study, a similar effect of coexpression of GRK2 was observed for the sequestration of hm2 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells. Furthermore, the sequestration assessed as the loss of [3H]NMS binding sites from the cell surface was confirmed to represent the internalization of hm2 receptors from plasma membranes into cytoplasmic vesicles by analyses involving sucrose density gradient centrifugation of membrane fractions and confocal microscopy. The fact that a similar effect was observed in three different cell lines suggests that facilitation by GRK of the internalization of hm2 receptors is a general phenomenon independent of cell species. On the other hand, Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (8Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Google Scholar) have argued against the involvement of GRK2 in the internalization of hm2 receptors, based on the finding that the level of sequestration was not affected by coexpression of GRK2 or a DN-GRK2 in a clone of HEK293. They measured the sequestration of hm2 receptors in cells treated with only a high concentration of carbamylcholine (1 mm), and therefore could have missed the effect of GRK2 coexpression. Very recently, these authors have shown that a hm2 receptor mutant with alanine residues in the place of serine/threonine residues in the GRK2 phosphorylation sites was sequestered by a lower extent compared with the wild type receptor, and concluded that sequestration of hm2 receptors was promoted by their phosphorylation (28Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Google Scholar). As for the effect of coexpression of DN-GRK2, we have also failed to detect any effect on the sequestration of m2 receptors in CHO cells and BHK-21 cells (23Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar), although the sequestration of m2 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells was significantly attenuated by coexpression of DN-GRK2. At present, we have not identified the species of endogenous GRKs or related kinases in these cells and do not know the reason why the expression of DN-GRK2 affect the sequestration of m2 receptors in some cells but not in other cells. In contrast to wild type hm2 receptors, I3-del m2 receptors (deletion 234–381), which lack phosphorylation sites by GRK2, failed to internalize rapidly. The simplest interpretation for this finding is that phosphorylation by GRK2 of serine or threonine residues in the I3-loop is a necessary step for rapid internalization. We cannot exclude, however, the possibility that the I3-loop may have other functions. Pals-Rylaasdam et al. reported that a hm2 mutant with a deletion (252–327) in the I3-loop was not phosphorylated by GRK2; yet 50% of the mutant stably expressed in HEK293 cells were sequestered by treatment with 10−3mcarbamylcholine for 2 h, although the sequestration of the mutant was less in its extent and slower in its rate as compared with the sequestration of wild type hm2 receptors. Possibly, internalization depends on phosphorylation-independent sites which were deleted from our mutant but not from the 252–327 deletion mutant. Ferguson et al. (24Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of β-arrestin rescues sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptor mutant lacking phosphorylation sites, and proposed that the interaction between β-arrestin and receptors is essential for internalization and that the internalization is facilitated by but does not require the phosphorylation by GRK2. Both phosphorylation sites and phosphorylation-independent sites in the I3-loop might be involved in the interaction with β-arrestin which accelerates internalization. We have found in the present study that the coexpression of GRK2 facilitates the down-regulation of hm2 receptors by reducing the effective concentrations of carbamylcholine. As the effects of GRK2 coexpression on internalization and down-regulation of hm2 receptors were similar to each other, it is tempting to speculate that both internalization and down-regulation involve the same event,e.g. the phosphorylation by GRKs of agonist-bound receptors. To our knowledge, a positive relationship between down-regulation and phosphorylation by GRK2 has not been reported for any G protein-coupled receptors. As for β2-adrenergic receptors, receptor mutants lacking phosphorylation sites for GRK2 have been shown to down-regulate normally (16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Blake A.D. Cheung A.H. Register R.B. Rands E. Zemcik B.A. Candelore M.R. Dixon R.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 855-863Google Scholar, 18Campbell P.T. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 192-198Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that these authors have not examined the effect of different concentrations of agonist, and therefore, the ability of GRK2 to reduce the effective concentration might not have been noticed. When hm2 receptor-expressing cells were treated with 10−4m of carbamylcholine, hm2 receptors were rapidly internalized with t½ of 9.5 min and slowly down-regulated with t½ of 2.3 h. Thus, approximately 60% of receptors were down-regulated, 30% were in an internalized form, and 10% remained in the cell surface after a 16-h incubation (see Fig. 5 C). In contrast, I3-del m2 receptors were lost from the cell surface and down-regulated with slower rates of t½ = 8.4 and 9.9 h, respectively, so that approximately 60% of receptors were down-regulated, no appreciable receptors were detectable in an internalized form, and 40% remained in the cell surface after a prolonged incubation (see Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that down-regulation may occur without the I3-loop. However, the I3-loop is necessary for rapid internalization and accumulation of internalized receptors. In Fig. 6, we have presented a tentative schema for the relationship between internalization and down-regulation of hm2 receptors. We assume in this schema that agonist-bound receptors are rapidly internalized and that internalized receptors are slowly down-regulated. This schema explains the present findings that both rapid internalization and down-regulation in the presence of low concentrations of carbamylcholine are accelerated in parallel by coexpression of GRK2; this explanation is based on the assumption that the amounts of phosphorylated hm2 receptors are increased by coexpression of GRK2, the rate of internalization is limited by the concentration of phosphorylated receptors, and the rate of down-regulation is limited by concentrations of internalized receptors. The finding that both sequestration and down-regulation are inhibited in the hypertonic medium supports the scheme and suggests that the rapid internalization occurs via coated vesicles. We, however, cannot exclude the possibility that the down-regulation occurs through multiple pathways. In contrast to hm2 receptors, the I3-del m2 receptors are lost from the cell surface and down-regulated with similar slow rates (see Fig. 5 C), indicating that no appreciable amounts of receptors exist in an internalized form. It is possible that hm2 receptors may down-regulate via two independent pathways, the I3-loop-requiring and I3-loop-independent pathways, which do and do not involve the rapid internalization, respectively. The I3-loop-requiring and I3-loop-independent pathways may represent the coated vesicle-mediated and coated vesicle-independent pathways, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with the results that the internalization of hm2 receptors caused by 10−4mcarbamylcholine was completely suppressed in the hypertonic medium but the down-regulation was only partly suppressed, and that the proportions of down-regulated hm2 receptors in the hypertonic medium were similar to those of down-regulated I3-del hm2 receptors in normal medium (compare Figs. 4 E and 5 C). Another interpretation is that down-regulation of hm2 receptors occurs through a single step involving internalized vesicles and that the internalization step proceeds rapidly for hm2 receptors with intact I3-loop but greatly slows down and becomes the rate-limiting step for down-regulation for I3-del hm2 receptors. At present, the question remains open whether down-regulation of hm2 receptors occurs through a single route via internalized receptors or through multiple independent pathways. In the present study, we have shown that both internalization and down-regulation of hm2 receptors are facilitated by coexpression of GRK2, and that the I3-loop is necessary for rapid internalization but not necessary for down-regulation, although the rate of down-regulation is reduced in its absence.

https://openalex.org/W2329729210,"Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are among the most common malignancies in the world. Typically, these neoplasms grow slowly and are comparatively indolent in their clinical behavior. The most frequent molecular alterations implicated in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms involve genes known to be regulators of cell death including p53, Ha-ras and bcl-2. In order to evaluate the significance cell death deregulation during skin carcinogenesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model (HK1.bcl-2) using the human keratin 1 promoter to target the expression of a human bcl-2 minigene to the epidermis. Transgenic HK1.bcl-2 protein was expressed at high levels specifically in the epidermis extending from the stratum basale through the stratum granulosum. The epidermis of HK1.bcl-2 mice exhibited multifocal hyperplasia without associated hyperkeratosis and aberrant expression of keratin 6. The rate of proliferation was similar in HK1.bcl-2 and control epidermis although suprabasal BrdUrd incorporating cells were present only in HK1.bcl-2 skin. Keratinocytes from the HK1.bcl-2 mice were significantly more resistant to cell death induction by U.V.-B, DMBA, and TPA, compared to control keratinocytes. Furthermore, papillomas developed at a significantly greater frequency and shorter latency in the HK1.bcl-2 mice compared to control littermates following initiation with DMBA and promotion with TPA. Together these results support a role for bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of NMSC."

Upon activation, cytosolic STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind DNA elements termed γ-interferon activation sequence (GAS). One target gene of STAT proteins is c-fos, which harbors a GAS-like DNA element, the Sis-inducible element (SIE), within its promoter. OSM is secreted as a 28-kDa polypeptide by mitogen-activated T cells and endotoxin-stimulated macrophages (8Brown T.J. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2977-2983Google Scholar).

Here, we examine OSM regulation of the −95 to +47 TIMP-1 promoter in HepG2 cells and characterize the participation of c-Fos in the binding of nuclear factors to an AP-1 site between −62 and −53 that is necessary for marked OSM (but not IL-6) up-regulation of promoter/CAT reporter gene expression.

Total RNA was prepared from HepG2 cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Subconfluent HepG2 cultures were washed and replenished in medium containing 2% FBS. Cytokines (at indicated concentrations) were then added, and cultures were incubated for the indicated times before RNA isolation. Northern blots were prepared by standard techniques and probed with human TIMP-1 cDNA (gift of Dr. A. J. P. Docherty, Celltech, Slough, United Kingdom) and rat c-Fos cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Tony Cruz, Mount Sinai, Toronto, Canada). The intensity of ethidium bromide-stained 18 S and 28 S bands on the blots was used to estimate loading of RNA. Deletions of the TIMP-1 promoter were carried out by generating truncated PCR products within −95 to +47. PCR reactions consisted of Vent polymerase (5 units; New England Biolabs), 100 ng of TIMP-1 −223 to +47/pBLCAT3 (27Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Google Scholar) template DNA, 150 μmsense and antisense oligonucleotide primers, 5 mm dNTPs, and 1 × Vent polymerase New England Biolabs buffer in a 50-μl final reaction volume. Reaction mixtures were overlaid with 30 μl of mineral oil and denatured for 1 min at 95 °C, followed by annealing of primers at 55 °C for 2 min and primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min in a Perkin-Elmer PCR thermal cycler for 35 cycles. Primers used to generate 5′ deletions of the TIMP-1 promoter included: −62/−38 for construct B, which contains AP-1 andEts sites (5′-GAGGCTAAGCTTGGATGAGTAATGCGTCCAGGAAGCC-3′); −52/−31 for construct C, which retains Ets site (5′-GAGGCTAAGCTTTGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTGGAGGC-3′); and −39/−16 for construct D (5′-GAGGCTAAGCTTCCTGGAGGCAGTGATTTCCCCGCC-3′). 3′ PCR primers (for constructs B–D) included a sequence 3′ to the pBLCAT3 multiple cloning site (+470/+447) (5′-CTGAAAATTCGCCAAGCTCCTCG-3′). For constructs E and F, 3′ primers were: +1/−18, containing wild type SP1 site (5′-TCGTACAGATCTGCGAAGGGCGGAGTTGGCG-3′) and +1/−18 with a mutated SP1 site (GC → TT, 5′-TCGTACAGATCTGCGAAGGTTGGAGTTGGCG-3′). Restriction sites for HindIII in 5′ primers (AGCTTT) and BglII in 3′ primers (AGATCT), as well as 6 nucleotide residues 5′ to each site (for efficient restriction enzyme digestion of DNA termini), were included in the designed primers. PCR products were purified from an 8% polyacrylamide gel, restriction-digested withHindIII/BglII, re-purified, and ligated into linearized pBLCAT3 vector (HindIII/BglII-digested). Colony hybridization (Colony/Plaque Screen, NEN Research Products) with end-labeled PCR primers as probes were then used to screen for DH5α bacterial transformants. DNA sequencing was used to verify the correct constructs. HepG2 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of CAT reporter plasmid DNA (co-transfected with 1.4 μg of pSV-βGal plasmid, Promega) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Cells were allowed to recover overnight and then replated into six-well tissue culture plates. Prior to cytokine stimulation, cells were serum-starved in serum-free α-minimal essential medium for 6 h. Cytokines were then added for 18 h. CAT assays were carried out using cell lysates according to standard protocols and 14C-labeled chloramphenicol products quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity in lysates (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were stimulated with the indicated cytokines for various time periods. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Andrews et al. (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Buffers A and C contained 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A, and nuclear proteins were extracted in 100 μl of buffer C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Nuclear extract (15 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 5 μg of calf thymus DNA in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, and 5% glycerol) for 15 min on ice. A total of 105 cpm of 32P-labeled probe was then added, and the binding reaction (20 μl) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (50–100-fold) was added to the reaction for competition assays. Following the reaction, samples were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels (40:1) containing 1.25% glycerol in 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE: 89 mm Tris borate, 2 mmEDTA) at 95 V for 3.5 h and dried prior to autoradiography. For supershift analysis, antibodies were added following the binding reaction for 1 h at 4 °C. Sequences of oligonucleotides used for mobility shift assays are shown in Table I, and their location in the TIMP-1 promoter is illustrated in Fig. 2. AP-1 and SP1 consensus oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in 100 mm MgCl2 and 400 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), followed by gradual cooling to 20 °C. TIMP-1 DNA probes were end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and the high affinity Sis-inducible element (hSIE) labeled by the fill-in reaction using [32P]dCTP and the Klenow enzyme. Probes were then gel-purified.Table IOligonucleotides used in EMSAProbe 1 SP1(−95/−66)5′-AGCTGCCCGCCCCTAGGCTTTGACTCCAGCGGTG-3′ 3′-CGGGCGGGGATCCGAAACTGAGGTCGCCACCTAG-5′Probe 2 AP1(−66/−52)5′-AGCTATGGTGGGTGGATGAGTAATGCA-3′ 3′-TACCACCCACCTACTCATTACGTCTAG-5′Probe 3 AP-1/Ets(−61/−34)5′-AGCTGATGAGTAATGCATCCAGGAAGCCTGGA-3′ 3′-CTACTCATTACGTAGGTCCTTCGGACCTCTAG-5′Probe 3A uAP-1/Ets(−61/−34)5′-AGCTGAGGAGTGATGCATCCAGGAAGCCTGGA-3′ 3′-CTACTCACTACGTAGGTCCTTCGGACCTCTAG-5′Probe 4 Ets(−59/−36)5′-AGCTGCATCCAGGAAGCCTGGAGGCCTG-3′ 3′-CGTAGGTCCTTCGGACCTCCGGACCTAG-5′Probe 4A Ets(−59/−36)5′-AGCTGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTGGAGGCCTG-3′ 3′-CGCAGGTCCTTCGGACCTCCGGACCTAG-5′Probe 5 TIMP-1(−34/−11)5′-AGCTAGGCAGTGATTTCCCCGCCAACTC-3′ 3′-TCCGTCACTAAAGGGGCGGTTGAGCTAG-5′Probe 6 SP1(−19/+2)5′-AGCTCGCCAACTCCGCCCTTCGCATG-3′ 3′-GCGGTTGAGGCGGGAAGCGTACCTAG-5′hSIE5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC-3′ 3′-GTAAAGGGCATTTAGCAGCT-5′AP-1 consensus5′-CGCTTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′3′-GCGAAACTACTGAGTCGGCCTT-5′SP1 consensus5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′3′-TAAGCTAGCCCCGCCCCGCTCG-5′ Open table in a new tab Nuclear extracts were electrophoresed on a 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel prior to transfer of proteins onto an Immobilon nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then blocked overnight in 1 × PBS and 5% milk. Following a 10-min incubation in wash buffer (1 × PBS, 0.5% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-c-Fos, anti-pan-Fos, anti-c-Jun, anti-JunB, or anti-JunD; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at a 1:2500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. To assess specificity of antibody binding, 2 μg of peptide was preincubated with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (as recommended by Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min each. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was added for an additional (1:7500 dilution) 1 h and Immobilon filters were developed by Enhanced Chemiluminescence Renaissance (NEN Life Science Products). We have found previously that OSM elevates TIMP-1 mRNA levels after overnight stimulation in a variety of cell types including HepG2 (26Richards C.D. Shoyab M. Brown T.J. Gauldie J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5596-5603Google Scholar). Examination of TIMP-1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells over a time course of OSM stimulation (Fig. 1) revealed a 5-fold increase in TIMP-1 message by 1 h, near maximal at 2 h (40-fold), and maximal mRNA levels at 6 h (60-fold). OSM also transiently stimulated mRNA levels of the AP-1 immediate-early gene c-fos (Fig. 1). As demonstrated previously in response to other stimuli (31Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129Google Scholar), the up-regulation of c-Fos mRNA occurred early (maximal induction at 30 min (20-fold)) and decreased thereafter. Thus, c-Fos mRNA levels peaked slightly before the marked increase in TIMP-1 mRNA. The proximal promoter of the TIMP-1 gene (−95/+47 sequence) can regulate downstream CAT gene expression in pBLCAT3 chimeric reporter constructs (27Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Google Scholar). When transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, the expression of −95/+47CAT could be elevated upon OSM (5.2-fold) or IL-6 (3.8-fold) stimulation (Fig. 2, construct A). Several putative DNA elements can be identified within −95 to +47 region of TIMP-1, including those for SP1, AP-1 (Fos/Jun), and Ets proteins. To examine the potential role of these sites in transcription, we generated 5′ deletions of this region and cotransfected HepG2 cells with constructs A–F (Fig. 2) and pSV-βGal to normalize for transfection efficiency. Basal levels of CAT transcription were reduced in the plasmid lacking −95 to −63 sequences (construct B), and further reduced in the plasmid that also lacked the −62 to −53 sequences, which contained the AP-1 site (construct C). The −62/+47CAT chimera (construct B) demonstrated maximal responsiveness to OSM with a 11.4-fold increase in CAT activity over unstimulated cells, whereas IL-6 induced 4.1-fold increases. Deletion of the AP-1 site within this region (construct C) markedly reduced responsiveness to OSM (from 11.4- to 2.7-fold), whereas responses to IL-6 decreased from 4.1- to 2-fold. Thus, a promoter region from −62 to −53 of TIMP-1, containing a putative AP-1 binding site (at −59/−53), contributes to basal transcription and to induction of transcription by OSM. Deletion of this sequence removed any significant difference between OSM and IL-6 activity in this assay. Interestingly, deletion of sequences from +1 to +47 (construct E versus B) dramatically abrogated the responsiveness to OSM (from 11.4- to 3.7-fold) and also reduced IL-6 responses (from 4.1- to 2.3-fold). Thus, sequences within +1/+47 may cooperate with the TIMP-1 AP-1 element within −62/−53 for maximal responsiveness to OSM. SP1 elements are common within TATA-less promoters and have been demonstrated to participate in basal transcription (32Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Google Scholar). A chimeric plasmid with mutation of the SP1 site (construct F) showed reduced basal transcription (4-fold) but was still inducible by OSM (construct E versus F). We have examined a variety of overlapping oligonucleotide probes (probes 1–6; location shown in Fig. 2) spanning −95 to +1 of the TIMP-1 promoter in EMSA analysis to identify elements that bind nuclear factors in HepG2 cells. A specific bandshift with either AP-1 or AP-1-Ets (probes 2 and 3) was seen in unstimulated cell nuclear extracts that we termed “complex 1” (Fig. 3, A and B). At 12 h of OSM treatment, much higher amounts of complex 1 are apparent. OSM induced the assembly of a second complex after 30 min of OSM stimulation with decreased mobility (“complex 2”) that persisted for several hours. The mobility of complex 2 appeared to increase following 2 h of OSM stimulation. Promoter sequences at −49 to −40 displayed an Ets core binding element as well as homology to STAT DNA binding sites (consensus TTCCNNNAA). Using a probe spanning this region (probe 4), a very weak binding activity was detected, which was not altered upon OSM stimulation (Fig. 3 C), and similar results were noted using the mouse TIMP-1 sequence (probe 4A), which differs by one base pair (data not shown). The mobility of this complex appeared similar to that of the AP-1-complex 1 and no other complexes were detectable. Nuclear factors binding to probe 4 were specifically competed by cold Ets probe but supershift experiments using an anti-Ets-1/Ets-2 polyclonal antibody reactive against a highly conserved DNA binding domain of Ets proteins did not identify Ets-1 or Ets-2 binding to this probe (data not shown). STAT-1 and 3 activation can be detected using the hSIE (33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar). Using the hSIE and the same HepG2 extracts as above, we noted that treatment with OSM resulted in rapid nuclear factor binding with gel shift mobilities consistent with those observed for homodimers of STAT3 or STAT1 and the heterodimer of STAT3 with STAT1 (Fig. 3 D). Each of these complexes were verified using antibodies to STAT3 or STAT1 in EMSA supershift assays (data not shown) as established previously (33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar). STAT1 was detected at early time points, whereas STAT3 persisted from 15 min to 12 h of OSM treatment. However, neither the AP-1-Ets or Ets sequences (probes 3 and 4) detected complexes with the same mobility and kinetics as compared with the hSIE in response to OSM. The TIMP-1 AP-1/Ets (probe 3) complexes and STAT mobility shifts were specifically competed by the 50-fold addition of unlabeled probe 3 or hSIE probe, respectively (Fig. 4). Neither AP-1 complexes 1 or 2 could be eliminated by competition with unlabeled hSIE probe (Fig. 4) or supershifted with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 (data not shown). EMSA analysis with probe 3A, containing mutation of nucleotides in the AP-1 site, dramatically reduced complexes 1 and 2, and other specific complexes were not detectable (Fig. 5) over the time course of OSM stimulation. Thus, we could not detect STAT nuclear factors associated with the AP-1 complexes 1 and 2, nor binding to sequences immediately flanking the TIMP-1 AP-1-like element that show partial homology to a STAT DNA binding site. Further downstream sequences showed weak homology to GAS (differing from the consensus GAS site by a two nucleotide insertion); however, probe 5 (−38/−15) elicited no early or late induced gels shifts similar to STAT complexes (data not shown). Thus, we could not detect STAT-1/3 nuclear protein binding to TIMP-1 promoter sequences in these cells.Figure 5Mutation of the AP-1 site in the AP-1-Ets EMSA probe. HepG2 cell nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated for 0, 0.25, 1, and 12 h were probed with either a wild type AP-1/Ets probe (probe 3) or mutAP-1/Ets probe containing mutations in the AP-1 site (probe 3A). The open circle (○) represents nonspecific binding. Mutation of the AP-1 site removed any detectable binding of OSM-inducible nuclear factors to this probe. STAT factor activation in nuclear extracts was confirmed using the hSIE probe at 0 and 0.25 h time points after OSM stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Supershift analysis of TIMP-1 AP-1 bands were carried out to identify Fos and Jun components of these complexes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells treated with OSM for 0, 1, and 12 h and incubated with polyclonal antibodies specific for AP-1 proteins prior to EMSA analysis. Using an antibody reactive against all Fos-related antigens (anti-pan-Fos), complex 1 was obliterated at 0, 1, and 12 h, and a Fos supershift was clearly visible at 1- and 12-h time points (Fig. 6 A). The anti-pan-Fos antibody also supershifted complex 2 from HepG2 cells treated with OSM for 1 h (Fig. 6 A). However, when an anti-c-Fos specific antibody was used, only complex 2 was supershifted and complex 1 remained unaffected, suggesting that c-Fos is a prerequisite for the OSM-stimulated assembly of complex 2. Of the anti-Jun antibodies used in EMSA binding reactions, anti-JunD and anti-JunB supershifted TIMP-1 AP-1 probe complexes (Fig. 6 B). JunD was detected at time 0, 1, and 12 h of OSM treatment. JunB could also be detected in these complexes, whereas c-Jun could not be detected at any time. Together, these data suggest that, whereas complex 1 consists of Fos and Jun, complex 2 specifically contains c-Fos, which likely complexes with JunD or JunB. Because sequences within −95 to +1 contained two putative SP1 binding sites, both of these were examined for the binding of HepG2 nuclear factors. Oligonucleotides spanning −95 to −66 (probe 1) or −19 to +2 (probe 6) constitutively bound two specific complexes, which remained unchanged in response to OSM treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). Both complexes were competed by cold SP1 probe (Fig. 7 A) and are consistent with the mobility of SP1 nuclear factor binding to a consensus SP1 DNA element (data not shown). Anti-SP1 antibody supershifted the slower migrating complex but did not appear to affect the faster migrating specific complex (Fig. 7 C). This may indicate the binding of other SP1 family members (34Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Guntram S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar). Binding of SP1 to the −95/−66 oligonucleotide was only detectable following a one week exposure of EMSA gels (data not shown), although weak binding to this probe may be due to insufficient sequence flanking the 5′ end of the SP1 site. Thus, SP1 nuclear factors constitutively occupy binding sites within the TIMP-1 promoter and OSM does not appear to affect the SP1 DNA binding. Given the overlapping biological functions of OSM and IL-6, these and other cytokines were examined together for their ability to induce DNA binding of complexes to the TIMP-1 AP-1 probes in EMSAs. Interestingly, OSM was the only cytokine examined that strongly induced complex 2 (Fig. 8 A), whereas both OSM and IL-6 markedly induced activation of STAT binding to the hSIE probe (Fig. 8 B). Thus, within the same assay, OSM and IL-6 utilize shared (STAT) and distinct (AP-1-complex 2) nuclear signaling pathways leading to protein-DNA interactions. PMA has been shown to activate AP-1 (34Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Guntram S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar) and stimulate TIMP-1 expression (24Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3079-3083Google Scholar). When tested in HepG2 cells, PMA potently stimulated complex 2 formation (AP-1 probe 2) and to a greater extent than OSM (Fig. 8 A). To examine the activity of PMA on transcription, we compared the effectiveness of PMA to OSM or IL-6 in st"
https://openalex.org/W2009390451,"The erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 is an obligate heterodimer composed of two different subunits (p45 and p18), each containing a basic region-leucine zipper DNA binding domain, and it plays a critical role in erythroid differentiation as an enhancer-binding protein for expression of the β-globingene. We show here that dimethyl sulfoxide treatment of wild-type murine erythroleukemia cells, but not a mutant clone of dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant cells, increases NF-E2 activity significantly, which involves both up-regulation of DNA binding and transactivation activities. Both activities were reduced markedly by treatment of cells with 2-aminopurine but not by genistein. Activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase signaling cascade increased NF-E2 activity significantly, but this was suppressed when MafK was overexpressed. Domain analysis revealed an activation domain in the NH2-terminal region of p45 and a suppression domain in the basic region-leucine zipper of MafK. These findings indicate that induction of NF-E2 activity is essential for erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells, and serine/threonine phosphorylation may be involved in this process. In addition, they also suggest that a MafK homodimer can suppress transcription, not only by competition for the DNA binding site, but also by direct inhibition of transcription.

Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar). Involvement of NF-E2 in erythroid cell differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells has been suggested by its role as an enhancer-binding protein for expression of the β-globin gene, by the lack of β-globin mRNA expression in a MEL cell line (CB3) devoid of NF-E2 protein as a result of integration of Friend viral sequences within the p45 NF-E2 gene locus (6Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Google Scholar), and by the restoration of β-globin mRNA by forced expression of p45 cDNA in these cells (6Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Google Scholar, 7Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Google Scholar). It has also been found that NF-E2·DNA binding increases during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells (8Mignotte V. Eleouet J.F. Raich N. Romeo P.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Google Scholar, 9Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Google Scholar, 10Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Google Scholar). These results suggest NF-E2 to be one of the key transcription factors that regulate erythroid differentiation of MEL cells. Unexpectedly, targeted disruption of the p45 gene in mice showed essentially no abnormality in erythropoiesis (11Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Google Scholar, 12Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Google Scholar). It is possible in these conditions, however, that p45-related b-zip factors, such as Nrf1 (13Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Google Scholar), or Nrf2 (14Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Google Scholar), may compensate for deficient NF-E2 activity. Previous studies showed that p45 can be phosphorylated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar) and that both DNA binding of NF-E2 and α-globin locus control region enhancer activity are diminished significantly in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient clone of MEL cells after hexamethylenebisacetamide treatment compared with wild-type cells (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar). These findings suggest that NF-E2 function may be regulated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase; however, the exact mechanism of NF-E2 regulation remains unclear. With this view in mind, we examined the possibility that NF-E2 activity may be regulated by a post-translational mechanism in MEL cell differentiation. Our results in this study show that dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) increased NF-E2·DNA complex formation in the wild-type MEL cells, in part by the induction of p45 gene expression, and that both DNA binding and transactivation activity of NF-E2 are regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation such as a Ras signaling cascade. Our findings also suggest that an MafK homodimer can suppress transcription not only by competition for the DNA binding site, but also by directly inhibiting transcription. Hence, MafK can be viewed as an active transcription repressor. A clone of dimethyl sulfoxide-sensitive (DS) MEL cells (DS-19) (16Ohta Y. Tanaka M. Terada M. Miller O.J. Bank A. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1232-1236Google Scholar) and a clone of dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant (DR) MEL cells (DR-1) (17Sassa S. Goldwasser E. Regulation of Hemoglobin Biosynthesis. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1983: 359-383Google Scholar, 18Fujita H. Yamamoto M. Yamagami T. Hayashi N. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17494-17502Google Scholar) were grown in suspension in modified Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), as described previously (18Fujita H. Yamamoto M. Yamagami T. Hayashi N. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17494-17502Google Scholar). DS cells undergo erythroid differentiation after treatment with Me2SO and express erythroid markers such as β-globin (19Eisen, H., Keppel-Ballinet, F., Georgopoulos, C. P., Sassa, S., Granick, J.

Chem. 1982; 257: 3650-3654Google Scholar). In contrast, DR cells fail to show terminal erythroid differentiation when treated with Me2SO, and they continue to grow as hemoglobin-free cells in culture (17Sassa S. Goldwasser E. Regulation of Hemoglobin Biosynthesis. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1983: 359-383Google Scholar). Both DS and DR cells were split every 3–4 days to maintain a logarithmic growth. cDNAs for mouse p45 and mafK were generated by polymerase chain reaction using cDNAs reverse transcribed from MEL cell RNA and a set of primers as described previously (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar). Human ribosomal DNA was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Tokyo, and used as an internal control. Total RNA from untreated and treated MEL cells was isolated using the acid guanidium thiocyanate- phenol chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). 20 μg of each RNA was loaded onto a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to a sheet of Zeta-Probe filter (Bio-Rad). The filters were hybridized overnight with appropriate RNA probes at 50 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 1.5 × SSPE (270 mmol/liter NaCl, 15 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mmol/liter EDTA), 1% SDS, 0.5% bovine lactotransfer optimizer (BLOTTO), 0.2 mg/ml yeast transfer RNA, and 0.5 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Hybridized filters were washed and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 films (Eastman Kodak). mRNA concentrations were quantified by LKB Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometry (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Experiments were performed two or three times using separate preparations of RNA, and representative results are shown in the figures. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1 × 107 cells according to the method described previously (26Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear extracts was separated electrophoretically using 10% polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as described previously (18Fujita H. Yamamoto M. Yamagami T. Hayashi N. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17494-17502Google Scholar). To evaluate the DNA binding activities of NF-E2, DNA gel mobility shift assays were performed using the oligomer 5′-GTGGTGCTGAGTCATAGGAGAAG-3′, which contains the 11-base pair NF-E2 consensus and its flanking sequences. 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 5′-end-labeled oligomers in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.8), 60 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% v/v glycerol, and 1.5 μg of an equimolar mixture of poly(dI-dC) and poly(dA-dT). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. In antibody-mediated competition assays, 1 μl of rabbit anti-mouse p45 serum was first incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 10 min and then incubated with the probes for an additional 10 min. For dephosphorylation, 5 μg of nuclear extracts from Me2SO-treated DS cells was incubated with 0.001–0.01 unit of calf intestine phosphatase for 15 min before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. The mixture was then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature. p45 and MafK expression vectors were described previously (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar, 5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar). FLAG epitope tags were introduced intop45 and MafK cDNA by polymerase chain reaction such that p45 and MafK are tagged at the NH2 termini. Resulting cDNAs were cloned in pEFBssHII, generating p45 FLAG and MafK FLAG expression vectors. GAL4 DNA binding domain fusions were constructed using pGBT9 (CLONTECH). the NcoI/HindIII fragment of pIKIII (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar) was cloned in the EcoRI site of pGBT9 after blunting of the end. Portions of p45 cDNAs were also inserted into pGBT9 using conventional restriction enzyme sites, resulting in G4-p45 fusion plasmids. Various portions of murine mafK cDNA (5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar) were isolated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned also in pGBT9, resulting in G4-MafK fusion plasmids. These fusion cDNAs were transfected into the BssHII site of pEFBssHII by isolating the HindIII fragment, resulting in G4-p45(1–272), -(1–83), -(1–36), -(39–83), -(86–272), G4-MF, G4MFΔN, and G4MFΔC. An expression plasmid for H-RasV12 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Nakafuku. A plasmid expressing dominant positive MAPKK (SESE-MAPKK) (27Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. Y. Gotoh and E. Nishida. pRBGP10 reporter plasmid was generated by inserting a single copy of the NF-E2 site derived from the chicken β-globin3′-enhancer into pRBGP3 (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar). pRBGP2 that contains three copies of NF-E2 site (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar), pRBGP10, or GAL4 × 5 luciferase plasmid was used as a reporter. Transfection of DNA into DS or DR cells was carried out using the transfection reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, a total of 5 × 105 cells was incubated with 2 μg of reporter and effector plasmids and 3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (as an internal control) in 1 ml of culture medium without serum for 7 h at 37 °C. Then 2 ml of fresh medium containing 10% bovine calf serum was added, and the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1.5% Me2SO or kinase inhibitors for another 8–72 h. Cell lysates were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega), respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. NIH3T3 and QT6 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation procedure as described previously. To examine the effect of H-RasV12 and MAPKK, cells were incubated in the presence of 0.25% fetal bovine serum for 36 h after transfection. To define the role of NF-E2 in erythroid differentiation, we first examined the effect of Me2SO on NF-E2·DNA complex formation in DS and DR cells using a gel mobility shift assay. In DS cells a band was detected which increased its intensity significantly after treatment of cells with Me2SO for 72 h (Fig. 1 A). This band was suppressed completely by the addition of anti-p45 antiserum, but not by preimmune serum, indicating that it is an NF-E2·DNA complex (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to DS cells, the corresponding band in DR cells did not increase after Me2SO treatment (Fig. 1 A). A band corresponding to an AP-1·DNA complex that migrated slightly slower than the NF-E2·DNA complex was not influenced by Me2SO treatment in either DS or DR cells (Fig. 1 A). To clarify whether the induction of NF-E2·DNA complex formation by Me2SO is caused by increased gene expression, we examined the mRNA levels for p45 and mafK by RNA blot analysis and their protein levels by immunoblot analysis. In DS cells, Me2SO treatment increased p45 mRNA levels significantly at 72 h (Fig. 2 A), consistent with the observed increase in NF-E2·DNA complex formation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, DR cells did not show any increase in p45 mRNA after Me2SO treatment.mafK mRNA levels were not influenced by Me2SO treatment in either DS or DR cells (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the induction of p45 mRNA in DS cells, p45 protein levels were also increased significantly after Me2SO treatment in DS cells but not in DR cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to p45 protein levels, which were readily detectable, MafK protein levels were below the detection level in both DS and DR cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that increased NF-E2·DNA complex formation by Me2SO treatment occurs only in DS cells, which subsequently undergo erythroid differentiation, and that this process involves p45 gene up-regulation. To examine whether the Me2SO-induced NF-E2 complex is active in transcription, we determined the activity of an NF-E2 binding site-luciferase fusion construct that was transfected into DS or DR cells. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 3. As shown in the figure, luciferase activity was increased by ∼4-fold in transfected DS cells when they were treated with Me2SO for 72 h compared with the level in untreated transfected cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to DS cells, Me2SO treatment did not increase luciferase activity in DR cells (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that NF-E2·DNA complex formation led to the up-regulation of NF-E2 site-dependent promoter activity during erythroid differentiation in DS cells by Me2SO treatment. They also suggest that the failure of DR cells in erythroid differentiation may be related to the lack of an increase in NF-E2·DNA complex formation and therefore to the lack of NF-E2-mediated enhancer activity. It should also be noted that induction of luciferase activity in DS cells was already observed at 12 h (∼7-fold) after Me2SO treatment (Fig. 3 B). It was earlier than an increase in the amount of NF-E2·DNA complex which was not yet detectable at 12 h (data not shown). Thus it is possible that Me2SO treatment may induce not only an increase in the amount of NF-E2·DNA complex but also transformation of the NF-E2 molecules to become functionally active. Because phosphorylation plays an important role in various signal cascades (28Lu S.J. Man S. Bani M.R. Adachi D. Hawley R.G. Kerbel R.S. Ben-David Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1139-1145Google Scholar) and because NF-E2 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar), we examined the effect of protein kinase inhibitors on NF-E2 DNA binding activity and cis-regulatory activity of the NF-E2 site. Combined treatment of DS cells with Me2SO and 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a broad specificity serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, resulted in a marked decrease in Me2SO-mediated induction of DNA binding activity of NF-E2 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to 2-AP treatment, treatment of DS cells with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had no effect on Me2SO-mediated induction of NF-E2 binding activity (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for Me2SO-mediated induction of NF-E2 activity. Consistent with this finding, preincubation of a nuclear extract of Me2SO-treated DS cells with calf intestine phosphatase decreased NF-E2 binding activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 B). This inhibition occurred in the absence of any change in the level of p45 protein in both cells and nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 C). However, this finding is in contrast to a previous report (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar) which found no significant effect by phosphatase treatment. The reason for the observed discrepancy is unclear, and it is not possible to trace it because no detail was provided in the previous report (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar). 2-AP treatment of cells also suppressed Me2SO-mediated induction of NF-E2 site-dependent promoter activity (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that serine/threonine phosphorylation may be involved in both the induction of NF-E2·DNA binding and the cis-regulatory activity of the NF-E2 site. Treatment of cells with genistein even increased NF-E2 site-dependent promoter activity (∼2-fold compared with Me2SO-treated cells), although the reason for this increase is not yet understood (Fig. 4 D). To examine the effect of inhibition of serine/threonine phosphorylation on erythroid differentiation, the effect of 2-AP on Me2SO-mediated induction of β-globin and ALAS-E mRNAs and heme content was examined. Combined treatment of cells with 2-AP and Me2SO for 48 h reduced the level of β-globin and ALAS-E mRNA levels to 13, and 75%, respectively, compared with Me2SO treatment (Fig. 5). Addition of 2-AP to cells that had been incubated with Me2SO for 48 h also decreased significantly an increase of these indices in the subsequent 6 h (Fig. 5). Heme contents in cells treated with Me2SO for 48 h were 21.36 ± 0.83 pmol of heme/106 cells (mean ± S.D., n = 6), whereas they were decreased to 15.74 ± 0.62 pmol of heme/106 cells in cells treated with both Me2SO and 2-AP for 48 h. These findings indicate that inhibition of serine/threonine phosphorylation plays a critical role in erythroid differentiation of MEL cells. Various cell surface receptors transmit proliferation and differentiation signals into cells through activation of signaling transduction cascades. The Ras-Raf-MAPKK cascade represents such an important signal transduction cascade which ultimately phosphorylates serine/threonine residues of effector molecules, including various transcription factors (28Lu S.J. Man S. Bani M.R. Adachi D. Hawley R.G. Kerbel R.S. Ben-David Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1139-1145Google Scholar). Thus we examined whether this cascade is involved in the regulation of NF-E2 function. Coexpression of p45 and MafK in NIH3T3 cells resulted in a small increase of the reporter gene activity (∼3-fold) which contained three copies of NF-E2 sites. When a plasmid expressing the oncogenic form of H-ras(H-RasV12) was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with p45 and MafK expression plasmids, however, there was a marked increase in the reporter gene activity (∼25-fold) (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, when a deletion construct of p45 (p45ΔN), which lacked the amino-terminal region thus defective in transcription (5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar), was cotransfected with a MafK expression plasmid, the reporter gene activity remained suppressed, even in the presence of the H-RasV12 expression plasmid (Fig. 6 A). Hence it can be concluded that the observed effect of H-RasV12 involved the functional NF-E2. The effect of a constitutively active form of MAPKK was also examined using a transactivation assay (Fig. 6 B). In this experiment, we utilized a reporter plasmid pRBGP10, which contained a single NF-E2 site in front of a minimal promoter. Expression of activated MAPKK itself had little effect on the reporter gene activity, indicating that under these experimental conditions, this reporter construct is not a suitable target for endogenous effectors such as AP-1. However, MAPKK increased the reporter gene activity in the presence of both p45 and MafK (∼50-fold). As with the activated Ras, MAPKK also required the amino-terminal region of p45 to achieve a high level of reporter gene expression (data not shown). The effect of H-RasV12 on the DNA binding activity of NF-E2 was also examined using a gel mobility shift assay. Although expression of p45 and MafK by themselves in NIH3T3 cells resulted in only weak DNA binding activity, coexpression with H-RasV12 resulted in a marked increase in p45-MafK heterodimer formation (Fig. 7). These results clearly show that the Ras cascade has a significant effect on the DNA binding activity of NF-E2. Because activation of this cascade is known to result in serine/threonine phosphorylation of an effector molecule, these findings are consistent with the results that serine/threonine phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of NF-E2 function. To examine whether these results were caused by changes in the level of expression of NF-E2 subunits, we determined the accumulation of NF-E2 subunit proteins in transfected cells, using FLAG epitope-tagged p45 or tagged MafK expression plasmids. These epitope-tagged proteins behaved in a manner similar to that of the wild-type proteins in transfection assays (data not shown). The levels of p45 were similar for p45 expression by itself (Fig. 8,fourth lane from left), and expressed together with MafK (Fig. 8, sixth lane). Similar results were also observed when exogenous H-RasV12 was expressed additionally (Fig. 8, fifth and seventh lanes). In contrast, the amount of MafK increased slightly in response to exogenous H-RasV12 in both the absence of p45 (Fig. 8,second and third lanes) and the presence of p45 expression plasmid (Fig. 8, sixth and seventh lanes). This change in MafK protein level, however, did not influence NF-E2 function (discussed below). These findings indicate that an effect of the Ras cascade on NF-E2 function is not caused by a change in the level of NF-E2 subunit expression. To understand the molecular mechanism of regulation of NF-E2 function, it is essential to define the function of each subunit with respect to its trans-regulation. To examine trans-regulatory function of p45 independent of DNA binding, we fused various regions of p45 to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and transfected their expression plasmids into cells together with a reporter gene plasmid. The results demonstrated that the NH2-terminal region of p45 contains a transcription activation domain (Fig. 9 A). When fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, 1–272 amino acids, or 1–83 amino acids of p45, showed marked transactivation of the reporter gene in DS cells. In contrast, G4-p45 (86–272 amino acids) showed a minimal luciferase activity. G4-p45 (39–83 amino acids) increased luciferase activity moderately, whereas G4-p45 (1–36 amino acids) had little effect (Fig. 9 A). These results indicate that the NH2-terminal 83-amino acid region is required for a full transactivation activity. Using transactivation assays of p45 fusion constructs with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, we investigated next whether this region contains the Ras-responsive activation domain. As shown in Fig. 9 B, expression of H-RasV12 augmented reporter gene activity markedly in the presence of p45 that contained the 83-amino acid NH2-terminal region, whereas it had little effect on reporter gene activity when a p45 fragment lacking the amino-terminal region was used (Fig. 9 B). These results indicate that the activity of the activation domain of p45 can be regulated by the Ras cascade. Hence, it can be concluded that the Ras cascade also has a direct stimulatory effect on p45 transactivation potential. Our previous studies demonstrated that MafK repressed the NF-E2 site-dependent promoter activity in the absence of p45 and that the presence of p45 reversed MafK transcription repression activity (5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar). Therefore we examined in this study the effect of MafK on NF-E2 activity stimulated by the Ras cascade. First, we titrated the effect of the MafK expression plasmid on reporter gene activity in the absence or the presence of MAPKK. As shown in Fig. 10 A, the reporter gene activity showed a biphasic response to an increasing amount of the MafK plasmid in the presence of a fixed amount of p45 expression plasmid. For example, MafK plasmid transfection strongly augmented reporter gene expression at low levels, whereas it suppressed at levels higher than 0.2 μg. This suppression can be accounted for by the fact that an excess amount of MafK homodimer is known to compete against p45-MafK heterodimers for binding at the NF-E2 site (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar, 5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that in the Ras-mediated regulation of NF-E2 activity, MafK exhibits in the presence of p45 a positive transcriptional effect at low levels of expression, whereas it represses transcription when expressed in excess. Because 0.2 μg of MafK expression plasmid was used in all of these experiments, it can be concluded that the induction of NF-E2 activity by the Ras cascade (Fig. 6) is not caused by an increase in the amount of MafK protein. Thus, the Ras signaling cascade stimulates NF-E2-dependent transcription by eliciting a qualitative, rather than a quantitative, change in the NF-E2 subunits. Domain analysis of MafK using fusion constructs with GAL4DBD revealed an additional mechanism for the repression of reporter activity by an excess amount of MafK. Namely, the G4DBD-MafK fusion protein repressed the reporter activity in QT6 fibroblasts (Fig. 10 B). Because such repression was observed with a GAL4 fusion product but not with wild-type MafK or with GAL4DBD, the results indicate that MafK possesses direct trans-repression activity, which does not involve competition for a binding site. MafK derivatives that lacked an NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal region also suppressed the reporter gene activity potently (Fig. 10 B), indicating that the trans-repression activity of MafK is confined to the b-zip domain. A similar experiment in MEL cells was not possible, however, because a basal reporter activity in these cells was too low. Nonetheless, these results taken together indicate that MafK exerts transcription repression not only by competition for its binding site but also by direct trans-repression. Previous studies using MEL cells suggested that NF-E2 may provide the major enhancer function for globin gene expression (6Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Google Scholar, 7Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Google Scholar). For example, the DNA binding activity of NF-E2 was shown to be increased during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells (8Mignotte V. Eleouet J.F. Raich N. Romeo P.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Google Scholar, 9Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Google Scholar, 10Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism of regulation of NF-E2 activity remained unclear. The level of p45 mRNA itself was reported either to increase (29Meguro K. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Fujita H. Sassa S. Blood. 1995; 86: 940-948Google Scholar) or not to change (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar) during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells. Our results in this study demonstrated that the levels of p45 mRNA, p45 protein, and the NF-E2·DNA complex were all clearly increased in DS cells during erythroid differentiation (Figs. 1and 2). The reason for this difference is unclear, but it may be related to different clones of MEL cells used in these studies. It should be noted that the clone of DS (DS-19) cells used in this study is one of the most efficiently differentiating MEL cell clones (16Ohta Y. Tanaka M. Terada M. Miller O.J. Bank A. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1232-1236Google Scholar). It is also known that there is a significant increase in p45 protein levels in erythroid differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells which precedes the expression of erythropoietin receptor (30Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Barberi T. Meccia E. Masella B. Pelosi E. Condorelli G.L. Testa U. Peschle C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2346-2358Google Scholar). These changes of NF-E2 activity were absent in DR cells, which also fail to undergo erythroid differentiation (Figs. 1 and 2). These findings suggest that the up-regulation of NF-E2 activity is an important regulatory event in erythroid differentiation. NF-E2 can be phosphorylated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro, and prolonged activation of this kinase increases the amount of NF-E2·DNA complex in MEL cells (15Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Google Scholar). Our findings in this study show that inhibition of serine/threonine phosphorylation results in marked reduction of Me2SO-mediated induction of a NF-E2·DNA complex as well as the enhancer activity of the NF-E2 site (Fig. 4, A and D), suggesting that NF-E2 activity may be regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation. Inhibition of serine/threonine phosphorylation by 2-AP was also accompanied by marked reduction in the levels of β-globin mRNA, ALAS-E mRNA (Fig. 5) and heme content. These findings suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation plays a critical role in the expression of erythroid genes in MEL cell differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation augmented the enhancer activity of the NF-E2 site, without influencing DNA binding activity of NF-E2 (Fig. 4, A and D). It is unclear at present why genistein increased the enhancer activity of the NF-E2 site, but it is possible that transactivation activity of the NF-E2 molecule might be inhibited directly or indirectly by tyrosine phosphorylation. It is also possible that other factors that can interact with the NF-E2 site might be activated by genistein. Consistent with such a hypothesis, our results demonstrated that the activity of NF-E2 reconstituted in fibroblasts is under the control of the Ras signaling cascade. Namely, a constitutively active form of Ras and MAPKK, a downstream protein kinase, potentiated DNA binding as well as transactivation of NF-E2 (Figs. 6 A and7). Transactivation assays using GAL4DBD-p45 fusion constructs also demonstrated that the active form of Ras stimulates the p45 transactivation domain (Figs. 7 B and 8 A). The amino-terminal transactivation domain of p45 also possesses two consensus sequences for phosphorylation by MAPK (31Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Google Scholar). The insertion of a 2-amino acid substitution into the consensus sequences, however, did not affect the reporter gene activity in transactivation assays (data not shown). These findings suggest that either coactivators essential for the activation domain of p45 may be modified by phosphorylation, or other phosphorylation sites of the p45 activation domain may be involved in such regulation. We showed previously that the small Maf family proteins can function as transcriptional repressors of NF-E2 site-dependent transcription in the absence of p45 (3Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Google Scholar, 5Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Google Scholar). Because MafK possesses an active transcription repression domain in its b-zip region (Fig. 10 B), it can exert effects not only by competition for binding sites but also by an active repression mechanism that might involve protein interaction with other factors such as corepressors. Furthermore, the fact that an excess amount of MafK repressed the MAPKK-, or Ras-induced cis-regulatory activity of the NF-E2 site even in the presence of p45 (Fig. 10 A) suggests that the amount of MafK homodimer may be crucial in determining the level of NF-E2 site-dependent gene expression. In other words, certain combinations of MafK and heterodimerizing partners may predispose cells to a particular response upon stimulation of the Ras cascade. To provide a hypothesis for further testing, a model for the role of the Ras signaling cascade in NF-E2 activation is presented in Fig. 11. This predicts that the Ras signaling cascade is activated during erythroid differentiation, resulting in the increase of the erythroid-specific gene expression, which is caused in part by an increase in NF-E2·DNA binding and in part by an increase in p45 transactivation activity. One feature is that MafK functions as both a signal transducer and a signal blocker, depending on its amount as well as on the presence of p45. The fact that DR cells show constitutive expression of mafK mRNA and no increase in p45 mRNA by Me2SO treatment is consistent with the view that signal transduction resulting in the activation of NF-E2 function by the Ras signaling cascade may be inhibited by an excess amount of MafK homodimer in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2056286573,"Plasminogen activators (PAs) play an important role in tumor cell invasion. We have analysed the expression of tissue-type PA (t-PA), urokinase-type PA (u-PA), and their respective receptors, annexin II and u-PAR, in normal and neoplastic cultures of pancreatic cells, as well as in pancreatic tissues, and have examined their role in tumor invasiveness in vitro. Using Northern blotting, Western blotting, and ELISA, t-PA is detected in cultured pancreas cancer cells displaying a well differentiated phenotype but it is undetectable in less differentiated cells and in normal pancreatic cultures. In contrast, u-PA transcripts, protein, and enzymatic activity are detected both in cancer cells and in normal cultures. Higher levels of u-PAR and annexin II are present in cancer cells than in normal cultures and, in SK-PC-1 cells, both receptors are localized in the basolateral membrane. In vitro invasion assays indicate that both t-PA and u-PA contribute to the invasiveness of SK-PC-1 cells through reconstituted extracellular matrix. To determine the relevance of these studies to pancreas cancer, immunohistochemical assays have been used to examine the expression of t-PA, u-PA, and their receptors in normal and neoplastic tissues. t-PA is absent from normal pancreas and from tumor associated pancreatitis, whereas it is detected in the majority of pancreas cancer tissues (16/17). Annexin II is also overexpressed in some tumors (5/13). u-PAR is overexpressed in most tumor samples examined (14/15), while u-PA is weakly detected in a low number of cases (3/14); both u-PAR and u-PA are overexpressed in areas of tumor associated pancreatitis. Indirect evidences indicate that K-ras and p53 mutated proteins can regulate the expression of PAs. In pancreatic cancer we have found an association between codon 12 K-ras mutations and t-PA expression (P=0.04). These results support the contention that, in the exocrine pancreas, activation of t-PA is more specifically associated to neoplastic transformation and to the invasive phenotype, whereas the induction of u-PA/u-PAR system might be more relevant to inflammatory or non-neoplastic events."
https://openalex.org/W2322785731,"A high prevalence of RET rearrangements is found in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) of children from Belarus after the Chernobyl reactor accident. The ELE/RET rearrangement (PTC3) is prevailing. Aberrant types of ELE/RET rearrangement have been found with a truncated ELE1 gene: As compared with the common form (PTC3r1) one aberrant type is shorter by one 144 bp exon (PTC3r2) (three cases); in the second atypic form (PTC3r3) the ELE1 part is 18 bp shorter than in PTC3r1. In agreement with the observation that the oncogenic RET is generated by a paracentric inversion at chromosome 10, we found not only ELE/RET, but also RET/ELE transcripts in these tumors. Sequencing of the breakpoint regions at the genomic DNA level revealed DNA modifications that might be relevant for illegitimate recombination after DNA doublestrand breaks. The high prevalence of ELE/RET rearrangements and various subtypes appears to be typical for radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas of children after the Chernobyl reactor accident."

In the present studies, macrosialin mRNA levels are shown to be markedly up-regulated during macrophage differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for regulation of macrosialin expression, we have isolated the macrosialin gene and performed an initial analysis of its transcriptional regulatory elements. The macrosialin promoter and 7.0 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking information direct high levels of reporter gene activity in monocyte/macrophage-like cells, but little or no expression in nonmyeloid cells.

Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8754-8758Google Scholar). Unlike other members of this family, which are constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, macrosialin is specifically expressed in macrophages, and to a lesser extent in dendritic cells (reviewed by Gordon et al. (5Gordon S. Clarke S. Greaves D. Doyle A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 24-33Google Scholar)) (6Smith M.J. Koch G.L. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 113-119Google Scholar, 7Rabinowitz S.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 827-836Google Scholar). CD68, the human homologue of macrosialin (8Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. Blood. 1993; 81: 1607-1613Google Scholar), is expressed very early during granulomonopoietic differentiation, with intracellular staining found in bone marrow progenitor cells that express CD34 and myeloperoxidase (9Strobl H. Scheinecker C. Csmarits B. Majdic O. Knapp W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 774-782Google Scholar). During further myeloid differentiation, CD68 remains strongly expressed in myeloperoxidase-positive, lactoferrin-negative, and CD14-negative cells. These cells represent myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and promonocytes. Interestingly, terminal differentiation toward the neutrophil/granulocyte lineage results in a marked decrease in CD68 expression, while continued differentiation toward the monocytic lineage is accompanied by further up-regulation of CD68 (9Strobl H. Scheinecker C. Csmarits B. Majdic O. Knapp W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 774-782Google Scholar). In contrast to macrosialin expression, CD68 expression also has been localized, although at much lower levels, in certain lymphocyte subsets, megakaryocytes, and malignant hematopoietic cells (9Strobl H. Scheinecker C. Csmarits B. Majdic O. Knapp W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 774-782Google Scholar, 10Athanasou N.A. Heryet A. Quinn J. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. McGee J.O. J.

This somewhat more extended pattern of expression may reflect differences in antibody specificities or slightly different functions between macrosialin and CD68 (7Rabinowitz S.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 827-836Google Scholar, 12Pulford K.A.F. Sipos A. Cordell J.L. Stross W.P. Mason D.Y. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 973-980Google Scholar). The biological functions of macrosialin and CD68 are not known. Although some studies have found CD68 to be exclusively localized in intracellular membrane compartments (13Saito N. Pulford K.A.F. Breton-Gorius J. Masse J-M. Mason D.Y. Cramer E.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1053-1059Google Scholar) in resting macrophages, more sensitive methods have detected a small fraction on the cell surface (9Strobl H. Scheinecker C. Csmarits B. Majdic O. Knapp W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 774-782Google Scholar). Because macrosialin and CD68 are highly expressed, this small percentage of surface expression may nevertheless be of functional significance. Macrosialin and CD68 possess unique mucin-like extracellular domains located at the N-terminal region. In response to inflammatory stimuli, these regions undergo complex alterations in their patterns of N- and O-linked glycosylation (7Rabinowitz S.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 827-836Google Scholar, 14Rabinowitz S. Gordon S. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 623-630Google Scholar) (reviewed by da Silva et al. (15da Silva R.P. Platt N. de Villiers J.S. Gordon S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 220-224Google Scholar)), and an increased fraction of macrosialin is found on the cell surface (16Ramprasad M.P. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Google Scholar). The glycosylated regions of macrosialin and CD68 may play a role in protecting these proteins from the harsh hydrolytic environment found in lysosomes and/or may act as ligands for cell adhesion molecules, such as selectins. Saitoh et al. (17Saitoh O. Wang W.C. Lotan R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5700-5711Google Scholar) have demonstrated that lamp-1 on leukemic cells can bind to E-selectin (17Saitoh O. Wang W.C. Lotan R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5700-5711Google Scholar). Because macrosialin and CD68 are strongly expressed in monocytes and undergo changes in cell surface expression during an inflammatory response, it has been postulated that they might play roles in phagocytosis, and cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions (1Holness C.L. da Silva R.P. Fawcett J. Gordon S. Simmons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9661-9666Google Scholar). Recently, macrosialin has been demonstrated to bind oxidized low density lipoproteins and account for 30–50% of its uptake by activated THP-1 cells in vitro(16Ramprasad M.P. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Google Scholar, 18Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9580-9584Google Scholar), suggesting that it may contribute to the development of macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Because expression of macrosialin is up-regulated during macrophage differentiation, it also provides a model for understanding mechanisms that control macrophage-specific gene expression. The development of macrophages from bone marrow progenitor cells is regulated by a myriad of cytokines and colony-stimulating factors that include M-CSF and GM-CSF (19Metcalf D. Nature. 1989; 339: 27-30Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in identifying components of the signal transduction pathways that are activated by M-CSF and GM-CSF, the mechanisms by which these factors act to regulate the transcription of specific target genes so as to coordinate the proliferation and development of the monocytic lineage remain poorly understood. To investigate molecular mechanisms that regulate early events in the program of macrophage differentiation, we have isolated the macrosialin gene, defined the exon structure, and performed an initial characterization of its promoter. The macrosialin promoter directs high levels of reporter gene expression in several monocyte/macrophage cell lines. Genomic sequences residing between −2.5 and −7 kb upstream of the translational start site contain cis-active elements that exhibit enhancer activities in monocyte/macrophage cells and silencer activities in nonmyeloid cells. Analysis of the proximal promoter suggests that combinatorial interactions between several classes of transcription factors are required for high levels of activity. Mutations or deletions of binding sites for PU.1/Spi-1 and AP-1 severely impair macrosialin promoter activity. Conversely, high levels of macrosialin promoter activity can be established in a nonmyeloid cell by co-expression of c-Jun and PU.1/Spi-1. These observations suggest that PU.1 and c-Jun functionally cooperate to regulate macrosialin expression during macrophage differentiation.

DOTAP was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Luciferin was purchased from Analytical Luminesence, and Galacto-Light was purchased from Tropix. Poly(dI·dC) and Ficoll-Hypaque were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. c-Jun and Jun-B antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Thioglycollate-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained from B6/D2 mice, and bone marrow cells were isolated and purified on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients as described previously (20Horvai A. Palinski W. Wu H. Moulton K.S. Kalla K. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5391-5395Google Scholar). After initial purification, the bone marrow progenitor cells (5.0 × 107 cells) were plated onto 150-mm tissue culture plates in 50 ml of bone marrow medium (21Kamps M.P. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 351-357Google Scholar). The cells were treated with either recombinant human M-CSF (20 ng/ml), recombinant murine GM-CSF (4 ng/ml), or recombinant murine IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) and assayed 24–72 h later. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate method (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biolgy: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 4.8.1-4.8.3Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (23Moulton K.S. Wu H. Barnett J. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8102-8106Google Scholar). The antisense RNA probe for macrosialin corresponded to nucleotides 787–1072. The antisense probe for rat β-actin corresponded to nucleotides 2452–2594. The probes were hybridized with 20 μg of total RNA or tRNA as a control, digested with RNase A (30 μg/ml), and analyzed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A mouse embryonic stem cell P1 library was screened using PCR oligonucleotides of sequence 5′-CTGATCTTGCTAGGACCGCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTCGTAGGGCTG-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 110–129 and 222–241 of the macrosialin cDNA, respectively. Three overlapping P1 clones were obtained. The PCR product generated with the two oligonucleotides was used to probe restriction fragments of one of these clones. An 8.5-kbBamHI fragment hybridizing to the PCR product was subcloned into Bluescript SK II, generating the plasmid JC59. Sequence analysis confirmed that this fragment contained the 5′ end of the macrosialin cDNA, but lacked the 3′ end of the macrosialin-coding sequences. Therefore oligonucleotides corresponding to the 3′ end of the macrosialin cDNA (5′-CAGAATTCATCTCTTCGAGAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GATGCTCAGAGGGGCTGGT-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 785–807 and 1058–1077, respectively) were used to amplify genomic macrosialin sequences. A 500-bp PCR product was generated and subcloned into pGEM T, JC67. Sequence confirmed that it contained the 3′ end of the macrosialin gene. A 180-bp fragment from JC67 was used to probe the P1 clone that had been digested with BamHI in a Southern blot. A 3.2-kb fragment was subcloned into Bluescript SK II and confirmed by sequencing to contain the 3′ end of genomic macrosialin and the flanking region generating plasmid, JC74. Sequence analysis was performed using an ABI automated DNA sequencer and the MacDNAsis program (Hitachi). The transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extension and RNase protection assays. In primer extension assays, antisense oligonucleotides (5′-CCAGCTAGGCTACACCAGTTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-AGGGAGAAGCTTGGCAGAGATGC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides −41 to −17 and −11 to +11, relative to the translation start site in the macrosialin gene were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed at 30 °C with 10 μg of total murine peritoneal macrophage RNA. Annealing conditions and subsequent procedures were carried out as described previously (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biolgy: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 4.8.1-4.8.3Google Scholar). For RNase protection studies plasmid JC59, containing the genomic fragment of the macrosialin 5′-flanking region, was linearized with NsiI, which is located 235 bp upstream of the translational start site. A32P-labeled antisense cRNA probe was generated from this plasmid using T7 RNA polymerase, and RNase protection assays were performed using 20 μg of total RNA as described above. Macrosialin-luciferase reporter genes were constructed by changing the translational start site ATG to aEcoRI site by PCR mutagenesis using an antisense oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-AGGGAGAATTCTGGCAGAGATGC-3′ and a sense primer of sequence 5′-CAAGCCTTTAATTCCCAGCAT-3′ corresponding to the sequence starting 664 bp upstream from the macrosialin translational start site in plasmid JC59. The 675-bp PCR product was sequenced and verified to be correct. The PCR product was digested with NheI and EcoRI and used to replaced the corresponding sequence within the wild type macrosialin gene and subcloned into Bluescript KS II (AL9). The −7.0 kb 5′-flanking region was excised with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into Δ5′PSV2 luciferase to generate Mac 7.0-luciferase. Deletions of the 5′-flanking region were created by restriction enzyme digestion using the following enzymes: NotI (−5.5 kb),HindIII (−2.5 kb), Spe I (−803 bp), NheI (−614 bp), and PvuII (−250 bp). Additional 5′ deletions were generated by PCR using an antisense primer 5′-AGGGAGAAGCTTGGCAGATGC-3′, replacing the ATG site with aHindIII site, and the following sense primers containingBamHI restriction sites: −1060, 5′-ATTTGCTGGATCCAATCTACAG-3′; −221, 5′-GAGGTAACGGATCCTTTGTAC-3′; −203, 5′-CGCCCGGATCCGAACGTCAC3-′; −133, 5′-GCTGAGGATCCTGAGTCAGGT-3′; −108, 5′-GTGGGATCCTTTTAGTTAAGG-3′; −77, 5′-GGCTTTGGATCCCCTCTTCCA-3′. The −31 to −1 construct was generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides of sequence 5′-GATCCTGTGTAGCCTAGCTGGTCTGAGCATCTCTGCCA-3′ and 5′- AGCTTGGCAGAGATGCTCAGACCAGCTAGGCTACACAG-3′ and subcloning these into the Δ5′ PSV2-luciferase reporter gene at the BamHI and HindIII sites. In addition, a 3′ deletion was generated, deleting a putative Ets binding site at −46, using an antisense oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-CCTCAAGCTTATCCCCTTTGCCTTCTC-3′ and the −221 sense oligonucleotide described above for PCR amplification. Similarly, mutations in the AP-1, PU.1/Spi-1, GC region and the CCAAT binding sites were generated by PCR using the −221 construct as a template. A general strategy for developing the mutations of these binding sites using overlapping PCR mutagenesis was employed. For example, the mutation of the AP-1 site at −132 was constructed by creating external primers containing BamHI and HindIII sites at −221 and −1 primers respectively as described above. The internal primers 5′-TGAGGTGTCCTCGAGAGGTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACCTCTCGAGGACACCTCA-3′ (reverse) introduced anXhoI restriction site into the AP-1 site. The two PCR products were digested with either BamHI and XhoI, or XhoI and HindIII, ligated together and subcloned into the luciferase expression vector atBamHI and HindIII sites. Mutations of the PU.1/Spi-1, GC region and CCAAT boxes were similarly done introducing aNotI restriction site into the PU.1/SPi-1 site (5′-TATTTTAGTGCGGCCGCGTGAGGCTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGCCTCACGCGGCCGCACTAAAATA-3′ (reverse)); anEcoRI restriction site into the GC region (5′-TAACGGATCCTTTGTAGAATTCACTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′TCAGTGAATTCTACAAAGGATCCGTTA-3′ (reverse)); and aBglII restriction site into the second CCAAT box (5′-TGTGAAAAGATCTGGCTTGAGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACTCAAGCCAGATCTTTTCACA-3′ (reverse)). For the 1st CCAAT box mutation, a PCR product was made using a primer containing aXbaI restriction site at the CCAAT box region (5′-TAACGGATCCTTTGTACCGCCCACTGAGAACGTCACTGTCTAGAACAGCCTAAT-3′) and the −1 antisense HindIII oligonucleotide primer. All constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Transient transfections using THP-1 (monocytic leukemia), U937 (histocytic leukemia), HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), Jurkat (T cells), and BaF/3 (murine pro-B cell) and BaF/3 cells expressing the murine GM-CSF α-receptor (gifts from A. D. D'Andrea) were performed by electroporation as described previously (24Pahl H.L. Burn T.C. Tenen D.G. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1038-1041Google Scholar) using 5–10 μg of total plasmid DNA. HeLa (cervical endothelial), P-19 (mouse embryonic carcinoma), and GC-3 (anterior pituitary) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (25Wu H. Moulton K. Horvai A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Google Scholar) using 2 μg of total plasmid DNA. MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and RAW 264.7 (murine monocyte) were transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA using DOTAP and Lipofectin, respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. The myeloid cell lines were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity 24 h after the time of transfection, whereas the nonmyeloid and the RAW 264.7 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminesence) as described previously (26de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galatosidase activity directed by a co-transfected plasmid containing the β-actin promoter linked to the β-galatosidase gene. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using Galacto-Light following the manufacturer's instructions and also measured in the Monolight 2010 luminometer. An equimolar amount of the β-actin luciferase construct was used as an external standard. U937 and BaF/3 cell lines were also treated with various cytokines and chemokines for 14–48 h prior to harvesting. After electroporation, the U937 cells were resuspended in 0.5% fetal bovine serum in RPMI prior to treatment. The BaF/3 cells were maintained in either RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% WEHI-3 conditioned medium or RPMI with 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 ng/ml murine IL-3. Prior to electroporation, the BaF/3 cells were cytokine-starved for 6 h and resuspended in 0.5–1.0% fetal bovine serum without cytokines in RPMI after electroporating the cells. The cells were treated with either TPA, 1 × 10−7m; LPS, 10 ng/ml; retinoic acid, 1 × 10−6m; recombinant human and murine GM-CSF, 4 ng/ml; recombinant human IFN-γ, 1000 units/ml; TNF-α, 100 ng/ml; and recombinant murine IL-3, 10 ng/ml. A β-actin/β-galatosidase construct was used as an internal control in the U937 cells and a SV40-β-galatosidase construct was used in the BaF/3 cells. Co-transfections of expression vectors into P-19 cells used 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid and either or both 100 ng of a CMV-PU.1 expression vector and 100 ng of a CMV-c-Jun expression vector. 50 ng of β-actin/β-galatosidase construct was also co-transfected and used as an internal standard. 100–200 ng of the empty vector, pcDNA-3, were used as a control. Salmon sperm DNA was used as a carrier to equalize the total amount of transfected DNA. All transfections were performed with triplicate points, at least three times. Nuclear extracts were prepared from TPA-treated THP-1 cells as described previously (27Dingham J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). To determine the binding of nuclear factors to regions within the macrosialin promoter, double-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′ overhangs were synthesized. The oligonucleotides were labeled either with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase or with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The sequences of the oligonucleotides corresponding to the macrosialin AP-1 element were 5′-gatccAGGTGTCTGAGTCAGGTTTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-gatctCCAAACCTGACTCAGACACCT-3′ (antisense), where lowercase letters denote non-native sequences added to facilitate cloning. The sequences of the sense and antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the macrosialin PU.1/Spi-1 element were 5′-gatccGTTAAGGGAAGTGA-3′ and 5′-gatctTCACTTCCCTTAAC-3′, respectively. Five micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 5–50-fold molar excess of specific or mutant unlabeled competitor (5′- TGAGGTGTCCTCGAGAGGTTT-3′ for the AP-1 mutation and 5′-TATTTTAGTGCGGCCGCGTGAGGCTTT-3′ for the PU.1/Spi-1 mutation) in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol for 30 min on ice. One microliter of probe (100,000 cpm) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another 30 min on ice. For supershift assay, 1–2 μl of antibody were added to the mixture and preincubated on ice for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were spun down at 4 °C and run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 300 V. Anti c-Jun monoclonal IgG raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 56–69 of the human c-Jun and anti-Jun-B polyclonal IgG raised against amino acids 45–61 of mouse Jun-B were used. Guinea pig anti-PU.1 antiserum was raised against a recombinant peptide, corresponding to amino acids 157–272, that is specific to the DNA binding domain. In vitro translated products of c-Jun and PU.1 were synthesized using the TNT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system following the manufacturer's instructions. To assess macrosialin expression during macrophage differentiation, RNase protection assays were performed. Bone marrow progenitor cells were enriched by purification through Ficoll gradients and cultured in the presence of M-CSF or GM-CSF to induce proliferation and differentiation. Macrosialin mRNA was detected in the bone marrow progenitor cells, consistent with the observation that CD68 is expressed in CD34+ cells (9Strobl H. Scheinecker C. Csmarits B. Majdic O. Knapp W. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 774-782Google Scholar). In addition, macrosialin mRNA levels were markedly up-regulated in response to both M-CSF and GM-CSF within 24 h, reaching maximal levels by 72 h in M-CSF-treated cells. Intriguingly IFN-γ, a potent regulator of numerous inflammatory responses in macrophages (28Young H.A. Hardy J.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 373-381Google Scholar), inhibited the induction of macrosialin mRNA in response to M-CSF by more than 50%. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages demonstrated the highest levels of macrosialin mRNA, which were approximately half as abundant as β-actin mRNA when corrected for the relative specific activities of the macrosialin and β-actin probes (Fig. 1). To investigate molecular mechanisms controlling macrosialin gene expression at the transcriptional level, genomic clones containing macrosialin regulatory elements and coding sequences were isolated from a mouse P1 clone (Fig. 2 A). Two adjacent BamHI fragments were subcloned that together contain 7.0 kb of 5′-flanking information, the macrosialin structural gene, and 1.35 kb of 3′-flanking information. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences indicate that the primary macrosialin transcript contains six exons. With the exception of the junction between exon 4 and exon 5, all of the assigned splice donor and acceptor sites exhibit close matches to consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. Exon 1, which is of variable length due to multiple transcriptional start sites, as described below, contains the translational start site and encodes the first 14 amino acids of the signal peptide. Exon 2, which is the largest exon (439 bp), encodes the remaining 7 amino acids of the signal peptide and the majority of serine and threonine residues thought to be substrates for O-linked glycosylation. In addition, exon 2 encodes five potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr), the so-called proline hinge, and the first of four cysteine residues that are conserved in members of the lamp family and are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds. Exon 3 contains the second conserved cysteine residue and one potential N-linked glycosylation site. Exon 4 contains a single potential N-linked glycosylation site, while exon 5 contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and the third conserved cysteine residue. Exon 6 contains the final conserved cysteine residue and encodes the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. The predicted cytoplasmic tail sequence is RRRQSTYQPL, which is similar to other members of the lamp family in containing three basic amino acids and a conserved tyrosine. Previous studies have suggested that an alternative form of macrosialin might be expressed with a truncated C-terminal tail of sequence RR*, due to either a second, highly related gene or an alternative exon (1Holness C.L. da Silva R.P. Fawcett J. Gordon S. Simmons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9661-9666Google Scholar). No evidence was found for an alternative exon that would encode a truncated cytoplasmic domain in the 1.35 kb of the further 3′-flanking sequence. As only one genomic P1 clone was characterized, the possibility of a second highly related gene cannot be excluded. However, Southern blotting experiments using probes to th"

Synthesis generated double-stranded DNA molecules containing a single replication fork with a linear duplex tail. A complex presumably consisting of T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 helicase/primase molecules was present at the fork together with a variable amount of single-stranded DNA sequestered by gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA binding protein. Analysis of the length distribution of Okazaki fragments formed at different helicase/primase concentrations was consistent with coupling of leading and lagging strand replication. Fifteen to forty percent of the templates engaged in replication have a DNA loop at the replication fork. The loops are fully double-stranded with an average length of ∼1 kilobase. Labeling with biotinylated dCTP showed that the loops consist of newly synthesized DNA, and synchronization experiments using a linear template with a G-less cassette demonstrated that the loops are formed by active displacement of the lagging strand. A long standing feature of models for coupled leading/lagging strand replication has been the presence of a DNA loop at the replication fork. This study provides the first direct demonstration of such loops.

A long standing feature of models for coupled leading/lagging strand replication has been the presence of a DNA loop at the replication fork. This study provides the first direct demonstration of such loops. Chromosomal replication in most complex organisms requires the coordination of events at the replication fork such that progress on the leading strand matches that of the lagging strand. One mechanism for accomplishing this coordination was proposed over twenty years ago by Alberts and colleagues (1Alberts B. Morris C.F. Mace D. Sinha N. Bittner M. Moran L. Goulian M. Hanawalt P. Fox C.F. DNA Synthesis and Its Regulation. W. A. Benjamin, Menlo Park, California1975: 241-269Google Scholar, 2Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Google Scholar) for bacteriophage T4 replication and is known as the “trombone” model. In this model the lagging strand loops back at the fork and engages a second molecule of DNA polymerase. This loop increases in size as the synthesis of each Okazaki fragment progresses, until synthesis of the Okazaki fragment abuts the 5′ end of the previous fragment at which time the loop is released and a new cycle of lagging strand synthesis begins. This model was based on mechanistic considerations and data suggesting a coupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 5Nossal N.G. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1994: 43-53Google Scholar). It was further assumed that the proteins involved in lagging strand synthesis are recycled from the end of a completed Okazaki fragment to the next primer and that primer synthesis occurs exclusively at the fork. The original trombone model suggested that the lagging strand polymerase remains at the fork through a direct linkage to the leading strand polymerase. Looping then allows both polymerases to synthesize in the same direction and remain in contact with the primase-helicase. Thus, both strands are synthesized at the same rate by the dimeric polymerase. In more recent variants of the trombone model, the lagging strand polymerase is allowed to replicate at a faster rate until it reaches the end of the previous fragment and then pauses while the leading strand polymerase covers the same distance (6Nossal N.G. Alberts B.M. Matthews C.K. Kutter E.M. Mosig G. Berget P.B. Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1983: 71-81Google Scholar). A diagram illustrating the looping of the lagging strand is presented in Fig. 1 A. Kinetic data and the effects of reaction conditions on the size of Okazaki fragments has provided evidence for a coordination of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in the Escherichia coli (7Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Google Scholar, 8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Formosa T. Jongeneel C.V. Kruezer K.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 655-668Google Scholar). The presence of two DNA polymerase III cores within one holoenzyme particle provides a basis for coupling leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in the E. coli system (11Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Hughes A.J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4064-4073Google Scholar, 12Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13384-13391Google Scholar, 13Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Google Scholar). Indeed, both DNA polymerases within the complex can function simultaneously (13Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Google Scholar). The coupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis has been demonstrated by gel electrophoretic analyses of the amount and average length distribution of lagging strand fragments upon dilution of the polymerase or the helicase-primase. If lagging strand synthesis is carried out by a polymerase-primase complex that is not associated with the leading strand complex then dilution of either protein should result in an increase in the average length of lagging strand fragments since a greater amount of leading strand synthesis will occur between priming events. If, on the other hand, the synthesis of the two strands are coordinated by a single complex, then reducing the free polymerase or primase concentration will not affect the average length of each lagging strand fragment; each new fragment will be initiated by the same primase-polymerase complex used to synthesize the previous fragment. Thus the average length distribution of Okazaki fragments as a function of decreasing concentration of helicase-primase is often used as a measure of whether leading and lagging strand synthesis is coupled.

Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar), and E. coli proteins (7Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Google Scholar) in which the size of Okazaki fragments was measured after dilution of replicating complexes, have generally been supportive of the model of a single replisome coordinating the synthesis of both strands. The T7 system offers a simple powerful tool for studies of DNA-protein interactions at the replication fork. The fundamental reactions occurring at a T7 DNA replication fork can be reconstituted using four proteins, three encoded by T7, the products of genes 2.5, 4, and 5, and one protein, thioredoxin, which is encoded by E. coli (16Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Google Scholar). T7 gene 5 protein is a DNA polymerase that becomes highly processive when complexed with thioredoxin (17Modrich P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5508-5514Google Scholar, 18Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Google Scholar, 19Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Google Scholar). Gene 4 encodes two polypeptides of 56 and 63 kDa, in which the 56-kDa polypeptide is translated from an internal initiation codon that is in frame with the coding sequence of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein (20Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar). Both forms of gene 4 protein have helicase activity. They bind to single-stranded (ss) 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; EM, electron microscopy; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); bio-dCTP, biotinylated dCTP; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; EM, electron microscopy; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); bio-dCTP, biotinylated dCTP; kb, kilobase(s).

Upon encountering double-stranded (ds) DNA, they unwind the DNA processively (24Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Google Scholar). The 63-residue amino-terminal domain unique to the 63-kDa gene 4 protein contains a zinc motif that enables this form of gene 4 protein to function as a primase (25Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Google Scholar, 26Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Google Scholar, 27Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13066-13073Google Scholar). It synthesizes tetraribonucleotides at specific recognition sequences, and T7 DNA polymerase uses these primers to initiate lagging strand DNA synthesis (22Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The active form of gene 4 protein, like other homologous helicases, is a hexamer (29Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Google Scholar, 30Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Google Scholar). Mutants of T7 gene 4 protein have been identified that have reduced ability to form hexamers, to hydrolyze TTP, and consequently to catalyze helicase activity (29Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Google Scholar). The T7 gene 2.5 protein is a 26-kDa ssDNA binding protein that removes secondary structure in ssDNA (35Scherzinger E. Litfin F. Jost E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 123: 247-262Google Scholar, 36Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Google Scholar) and also facilitates homologous pairing reactions (37Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Google Scholar).In vitro studies using the T7 replication proteins have shown that the basic mechanism of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis is fundamentally similar to that of other procaryotic and eucaryotic systems (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar, 16Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Google Scholar, 38Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Cancer Cells. 1988; 6: 11-17Google Scholar). In studies making use of a preformed replication fork on a duplex circular molecule, Debyseret al. (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar) showed that leading and lagging strand synthesis was resistant to dilution of the T7 DNA polymerase and the T7 helicase-primase, and that the average size of Okazaki fragments was independent of the concentration of either protein. Our current model is that a single hexamer of T7 gene 4 protein is responsible for both the helicase activity that catalyzes leading strand DNA synthesis and the primase activity that catalyzes lagging strand DNA synthesis. Two DNA polymerase molecules are coupled to the helicase-primase complex; one catalyzes leading strand DNA synthesis, whereas the other catalyzes lagging strand DNA synthesis. Whereas kinetic and physical analysis of the replication systems described above support the coupling of leading and lagging strands, there has been no direct demonstration to date in any system of the essential DNA loop that must occur as a consequence of this coordination. In this study we have used electron microscopy (EM) to examine the architecture of the DNA and DNA-protein intermediates involved in replication reactions employing the T7 replication proteins. Analysis of these replicating molecules provide direct evidence for looping of the lagging strand at the replication fork. The following proteins and DNA were purified as described: T7 gene 5 protein complexed with thioredoxin (19Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Google Scholar); wild type and D485G mutant gene 4 protein (31Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Auerbach J. Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3215-3227Google Scholar). All proteins were stored at −20 °C and diluted to a working concentration prior to use with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Circular dsDNA templates containing a preformed replication fork (44Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Google Scholar) were constructed as described by Debyser et al. (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar). In brief, synthetic 52 nucleotide (nt) primers were synthesized and annealed to either M13 mp6 ssDNA (at map positions 6225–6243) or to M13 mp19 ssDNA (at positions 5489–5507). The first 19 nucleotides from the 3′ end of each primer were complementary to M13 sequences, whereas the 33 nucleotides at the 5′ end were heterologous. The annealed primer was extended using T7 DNA polymerase at 30 °C for 20 min. Incomplete primer extension products and ssDNA were removed by sedimentation through a 5–25% sucrose gradient containing 1 m NaCl at 40,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 7 h at 15 °C. The linear template containing a G-less cassette was prepared as follows. A 392-bp G-less cassette (45Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Google Scholar) fused to the adeno major late promoter (−50 to +10) that had been cloned into pUC13 between the SmaI and SstI (SacI) sites was removed as a 463-bp fragment using BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and cloned into M13mp18 between the BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate the construct M13mp18GL. The DNA was transfected into E. coli HB101 cells, and the phage and ssDNA were prepared using standard procedures (46Register J.C. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 624-628Google Scholar). The orientation of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. A 52-nucleotide primer (5′-TAAAACCTCTACAAATGTGGTATGGCTGATTATCCCCTCCATACCCTTCCTC-3′) was synthesized such that the nineteen 3′ terminal nucleotides are complementary to the sequences just inside the G-less cassette in M13mp18GL (+) ssDNA. The primer was annealed to the template and then extended using T7 DNA polymerase at 30 °C for 20 min. Incomplete primer extension products and ssDNA were removed by sucrose sedimentation as above. The purified circular DNA was cleaved at a single site 747 bp from the beginning of the G-less cassette usingBglII. Replication reactions were as follows. The dsDNA template was diluted to 17.5 μg/ml (3.5 nm) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, with 0.3 mm ATP and CTP, and 0.6 mm of the 4 dNTPs. To slow the rate of synthesis in some reactions, the concentration of dCTP was decreased to 6 μm. When present, T7 gene 5, 4, and 2.5 proteins were added to 88 nm, 88 nm, and 1.5 μmeach (8, 5.5, and 40 μg/ml, respectively). The 63-kDa form of either the wild-type gene 4 protein or the D485G mutant was used unless otherwise noted. The reaction mixtures (25 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 2.5 min with the wild-type gene 4 protein and 3 min with the D485G gene 4 protein. The reactions were terminated by adding EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 20 mm. To label the newly synthesized strand with biotin, replication reactions were carried out as above for 2.5 min at 30° with 60 nm dCTP and 15 nm biotinylated dCTP (ENZO Diagnostics), followed by treatment with 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The glutaraldehyde was quenched with a molar excess of Tris buffer, and streptavidin was then added (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at 21 °C prior to dilution of the sample 10-fold in buffer and preparation for EM. To visualize ssDNA tracts on the DNA replication intermediates, aliquots were removed from the replication reactions, and EDTA and NaCl were added to 20 mm and 1m, respectively, to release the proteins. Circular M13mp19 ssDNA was added to 5 μg/ml to provide a measure of the compaction of the ssDNA tracts, and the mixture was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2 mm EDTA. E. coli SSB was then added to 1 μg/ml for 2 min at 21 °C, and the samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde and prepared for EM as described below. The length of SSB-covered ssDNA segments was converted to an equivalent length of duplex DNA by comparing its length to that of fully SSB-covered M13mp19 ssDNA circles in the field, which in turn were related to the length of duplex M13 dsDNA circles in the same preparation. In general, the length of ssDNA bound by SSB is one-fourth the length of an equivalent number of base pairs of dsDNA. DNA-protein complexes were prepared for EM as described in Ref. 47Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Google Scholar. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were fixed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.6% for 5 min at 21 °C and then either diluted to 0.5 μg/ml (DNA concentration) or chromatographed through Biogel A5M to remove unbound proteins and fixatives. The samples were mixed with a buffer containing 2 mm spermidine and directly adsorbed to glow-charged thin carbon foils for 1 min and then washed in a water-ethanol series, air-dried, and rotary shadowcast with tungsten at 1 × 10−6 torr. Samples were examined in a Philips EM400 or CM12 instrument at 40 kV. Length measurements were made by projecting images on the micrographs onto a Summagraphics digitizing tablet coupled to a McIntosh Quadra 650 computer programmed with software developed in the laboratory of Jack D. Griffith. An examination of the pattern of ds and ss segments along the rolling circle tails of deproteinized replicative intermediates should provide information about the progress of replication and the nature of the intermediates. The potential types of molecules generated are illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Incubations were carried out with the circular DNA template containing a preformed fork and the T7 replication proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Aliquots were removed from the incubations, the T7 proteins were released with high salt, and the ssDNA segments bound by E. coli SSB prior to preparation for EM. SSB extends and coats ssDNA making it easily distinguished from dsDNA (48Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Google Scholar). We compared the replication intermediates in reactions with wild-type gene 4 protein to those generated using a mutant of gene 4 protein containing a single amino acid residue change at position 485 from Asp to Gly. The D485G mutant, being less efficient as a helicase, facilitated the control of the rate of leading strand DNA synthesis. Examination of fields of molecules taken from 2- to 3-min incubations employing either gene 4 protein revealed ∼30% of the circular M13 dsDNAs with linear tails attached (replicative intermediates) (Fig. 2, A–C). In some cases (Fig. 2 A) the tails measured >4 times the length of the monomer circle, and frequently several alternating tracts of dsDNA and thick SSB-covered ssDNA segments were present. When the 56-kDa gene 4 protein (D485G) was used, which lacks the primase activity present in the 63-kDa form, the tails were fully ss (Fig. 2 C) since priming is required to initiate Okazaki fragments. Reactions using the 63-kDa gene 4 protein were carried out in parallel with or without gene 2.5 protein, and fields scored for molecules with tails that contained 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more ssDNA tracts. In nearly every case the first ss tract was at the junction of the circle and DNA tail; the very rare exceptions were not scored. Adding gene 2.5 protein reduced significantly the percentage of molecules with two ssDNA tracts; 31% of the molecules scored fall in this class in the absence of gene 2.5 protein, compared with 9% in the presence of gene 2.5 protein (Table I; n = ∼1000). Since a molecule with two ssDNA tracts contains a replication fork in which the Okazaki fragment is still being synthesized, this suggests that gene 2.5 protein increases the rate of lagging strand synthesis. Lagging strand elongation appears to be rate-limiting in the absence of gene 2.5 protein; in its presence 68% of the replicating molecules were “caught” with one ssDNA gap at the junction of the template and tail (Table I). In these molecules, synthesis of the previous Okazaki fragment was complete, and synthesis of a new fragment had not yet started. These molecules may be in the process of recycling in which the lagging strand DNA polymerase has to slide back to a new RNA primer. Alternatively, these complexes may reflect the pausing of the lagging strand polymerase until a new primase recognition site is encountered on the displaced leading strand, and a new RNA primer is synthesized.Table IEffect of T7 single-strand DNA binding protein (gene 2.5 protein) on coupling of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis# of ss gapsThree or moreNoneOneTwoWith gene 2.5 protein (%)176895Without gene 2.5 protein (%)1550314 Open table in a new tab Debyser et al. (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar) observed that the distribution of Okazaki fragment lengths was independent of the concentration of the helicase-primase in these reactions. To verify that this relation held for these experiments and to provide an additional confirmation, replication reactions were carried out with a fixed concentration of T7 gene 5/thioredoxin and varying concentrations of gene 4 protein either in the presence or absence of gene 2.5 protein. The molar ratio of T7 DNA polymerase to template in these experiments was 4:1 and the molar ratio of gene 4 protein hexamers to template varied from 4:1 to 0.4:1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mixtures were incubated for 2.5 min at 30 °C and the samples were prepared for EM as described above. Micrographs of fields of molecules were taken that allowed at least 100 Okazaki fragments to be measured for each concentration of gene 4 protein. For this analysis, an Okazaki fragment was defined as beginning at the start of a duplex segment on the replication tail, continuing toward the distal end of the tail through the duplex segment, and ending at the far end of the adjoining ss gap (Fig. 1 B). This definition is based on the assumption that continued synthesis would have filled in the ss gap. EM analysis (Fig. 3 A) revealed that in the presence of gene 2.5 protein, the Okazaki fragment length distributions peak near 2300 nt independent of gene 4 protein concentration. Omission of gene 2.5 protein (Fig. 3 B) generates Okazaki length distributions that peak at a similar value (2100 nt). However, there were ∼2-fold more Okazaki fragments having lengths less than 1000 nt as contrasted to the distributions generated in the presence of gene 2.5 protein. These experiments were repeated using the D485G mutant gene 4 protein. Very similar distributions were obtained over the 10-fold range of D485G gene 4 protein concentration with peaks between 1700 and 1600 nt in the presence or absence of gene 2.5 protein respectively, with a higher number of shorter Okazaki fragments seen in the absence of gene 2.5 protein (data not shown). As discussed below (see “Discussion”) these observations support but do not conclusively prove coupling in this system. To visualize the replicative intermediates with the T7 proteins bound, aliquots from the reactions were treated with glutaraldehyde and prepared for EM (see “Experimental Procedures”). Examination by EM revealed that ∼50% of the M13 dsDNA circles contained a single large complex (replication complex). Of these, 10–25% had a long dsDNA tail extending from the replication complex (Fig. 4). The frequency of such forms was not altered significantly by omission of gene 2.5 protein. Occasionally much smaller protein complexes were observed along the dsDNA tails, most commonly in reactions carried out with the mutant D485G gene 4 protein in the absence of gene 2.5 protein (not shown). The replication complexes were of varied sizes and shapes (Fig. 4). In addition to two copies of gene 5 protein/thioredoxin and at least one gene 4 protein hexamer as suggested in Debyser et al. (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar), these complexes must also contain a variable amount of ssDNA complexed by gene 2.5 protein since, as shown above, ∼70% of the replicative intermediates contain a ssDNA segment joining the tail to the circle. When gene 2.5 protein was omitted, replication complexes with associated dsDNA tails were still seen and at roughly the same frequency. Qualitatively, however, these complexes were not as large, and small protein complexes were more frequently observed along the dsDNA tails, likely reflecting polymerase molecules engaged in completing Okazaki fragment synthesis. Thus it would appear that in the presence of gene 2.5 protein the ssDNA segments on the lagging strand are condensed rather than stretched out into extended ssDNA-protein filaments. The possible significance of this is discussed below (see “Discussion”). Examination of the replicating circles (dsDNA circle with a replication complex and dsDNA tail) revealed that a dsDNA loop was frequently associated with the replication complex (Fig. 4). The fraction of replicating circles containing a dsDNA loop depended on the form of gene 4 protein used and whether gene 2.5 was present. In the absence of gene 2.5 protein, 17% of the replicating circles contained a dsDNA loop with either form of gene 4 protein, whereas in the presence of gene 2.5 protein, 27% and 40% of the replicating circles contained a dsDNA loop when either wild-type or the D485G mutant form of gene 4 protein was used, respectively. These values were determined from at least three separate experiments each, and from analysis of >200 replicating molecules each. It will be shown below that looping occurs only during active displacement of the lagging strand; hence use of a less efficient helicase would be expected to result in a larger fraction of molecules with loops. The length of the loops varied from 250 bp to 4 kb with a peak near 0.5 kb and mean length close to 1 kb (Fig. 5). Loops were not observed along the dsDNA tails suggesting that looping reflects events at the replication fork. To directly establish that the loops contain newly synthesized DNA, a biotin labeling approach was used and is presented in the next section. To localize the newly synthesized DNA in the replicating circles, biotinylated dCTP (bio-dCTP) was added to the replication reactions (see “Experimen"

https://openalex.org/W2015756326,"Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation by treatment with retinoic acid (RA, 10 microM, 1-5 days). The steady-state level of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA decreased during the RA-induced differentiation. There was also decrease in the level of total cellular nucleophosmin/B23 protein during the RA-induced differentiation. Stabilization and nuclear run-on assays indicate that the decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA in RA-treated HL-60 cells was transcriptionally regulated. Unlike c-myc mRNA, there was virtually no decline of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA during the growth arrest by serum-starvation. The decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA expression in HL-60 cells subsequent to retinoic acid treatment can thus be attributed to cellular differentiation rather than the growth arrest induced by RA. Nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer treatment significantly potentiated RA-induced cellular differentiation. Results of this study suggest that nucleophosmin/B23 is one of the key elements in the down-regulation of nucleolar function for cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2005087488,"Survival signalling by ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell viability and apoptosis in multicellular organisms. To identify receptor domains and pathways involved in survival signalling, the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA was expressed in Rat-1/MycERTM fibroblasts. We demonstrate that wt-TrkA receptor delays c-Myc-, U.V.- and Cycloheximide-induced apoptosis and activates targets such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk2 and the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, both of which have been implicated in survival signalling. TrkA mutated within its SHC binding site (Y490F) delays c-Myc-induced apoptosis without activating endogenous Akt/PKB. In contrast, the TrkA Y490F mutant receptor does not delay U.V.-induced apoptosis whilst TrkA mutated at its PLC-γ binding site (Y785F) is capable of protecting from apoptosis induced by c-Myc or U.V. treatment. The double mutant TrkA YY490/785FF fails to block either of these two apoptotic stimuli. While PI3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin competely block survival signalling following U.V. treatment, neither drug affects the ability of TrkA to block c-Myc-induced apoptosis. We show that the Akt/PKB pathway is essential for NGF stimulated TrkA survival signalling in the case of U.V.-induced apoptosis, but that apoptosis induced by c-Myc is also blocked by a novel, Akt/PKB-independent, pathway. These observations suggest that TrkA can activate different survival signalling pathways, which can interfere with specific apoptotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2044523536,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has a complex spatial and temporal pattern of expression and is essential for the normal development of a diverse set of tissues. Recently, mutations have been identified in FGFR3 that result in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and cause a number of different human skeletal disorders. To examine the regulatory mechanisms governing FGFR3 expression, the promoter for the FGFR3 gene was identified and characterized. It resides in a CpG island, which encompasses the 5′ end of the FGFR3 gene and lacks classical cis-regulatory motifs. As little as 100 base pairs of sequence 5′ to the initiation site can confer a 20–40-fold increase in transcriptional activity upon a promoter-less vector. The transcriptional activity of thesecis-regulatory sequences is further stimulated by elements found within the first intron. Mapping of the enhancer activity found within intron I identified two purine-rich sequence motifs between +340 and +395. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that sequences within this region bind members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors. In a background lacking Sp1-like activity, we demonstrate that Sp1 can enhance transcription of the minimal promoter (which contains five classical Sp1 sites), whereas both Sp1 and Sp3 can enhance transcription through the elements found in intron I. Although these transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed, we demonstrate that the sequences between −220 and +609 of the FGFR3 gene are sufficient to promote the tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice.

Cellular differentiation requires the proper interpretation of external stimuli. Although many types of stimuli influence cell fate, a target cell must express the appropriate complement of receptors to perceive, interpret, and respond to environmental signals. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; luc, luciferase; i, intron; UTR, untranslated region; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EGFR, epidermal growth factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); β-gal, β-galactosidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; InR, initiator region.1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; luc, luciferase; i, intron; UTR, untranslated region; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EGFR, epidermal growth factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); β-gal, β-galactosidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; InR, initiator region. are small molecular mass polypeptides (18–27 kDa), which have been implicated in many developmentally regulated events such as mesoderm induction, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, malignant transformation, and neuronal differentiation (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Google Scholar, 2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar). To date, 15 FGF ligands have been described (3Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Google Scholar,4McWhirter J.R. Goulding M. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Murre C. Development. 1997; 124: 3221-3232Google Scholar). These FGFs all have unique patterns of expression as well as a high affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs have been shown to regulate the biological activity of many FGFs and serve as an essential cofactor required for FGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation (5Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Google Scholar). Because HSPGs are a major component of the extracellular matrix, they have been implicated in limiting the diffusion of FGFs from their site of production (6Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1651-1659Google Scholar). Thus, the spatial and temporal regulation of expression of FGFs provides one mechanism through which FGF-mediated signaling can be regulated during development.The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family consists of four genes, each of which encodes a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptor (3Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Google Scholar, 7Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar). Recently, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the FGFRs have revealed unique roles for these receptors during development (8Muenke M. Schell U. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 308-313Google Scholar, 9Skaer H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R238-R241Google Scholar, 10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat.

Specifically, point mutations in FGFR3 have been genetically linked to achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and hypochondroplasia (8Muenke M. Schell U. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 308-313Google Scholar); all are diseases where bones fail to grow to normal lengths. These skeletal disorders result from defects in the epiphyseal growth plate, a place where FGFR3 is known to be highly expressed (14Peters K. Ornitz D.M. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Google Scholar). When the mutations corresponding to those of achondroplasia (G380R) and thanatophoric dysplasia (R248C and K650E) are introduced into the murine FGFR3 cDNA, ligand-independent activation of the receptor is observed (15Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Google Scholar, 16Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Google Scholar). The constitutive activity of this receptor is thought to disrupt normal development by initiating intracellular signals in the absence of ligand. In contrast, loss-of-function alleles of FGFR3 lead to the overgrowth of long bones (10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Google Scholar, 12Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Google Scholar), as well as deafness due to defects in the development of the organ of Corti (10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Google Scholar). Although redundancy in the FGFR family may compensate for the loss of FGFR3 activity in some tissues, these results demonstrate that both the regulation of FGFR3 expression and kinase-mediated signaling activity are required for proper development.To understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of FGFR3, we have identified and characterized the FGFR3 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that sequences derived from the CpG island found at the 5′ end of the murine FGFR3 gene are capable of promoting transcription in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, the activity of these sequences can be further stimulated by sequences found within the first intron. Localization of the intron enhancer element identified binding sites for the Sp1 family of transcription factors. Characterization of the trans-acting factors demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 could promote transcriptional activity through these elements in the Drosophila SL2 cell line. Although Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed, the defined minimal promoter and intron enhancer are sufficient to promote the tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice.DISCUSSIONThe promoter for the FGFR3 gene resides in a CpG island that lacks the classical CAAT box and TATA box motifs found in many eukaryotic promoters. Sequence analysis of the FGFR3 promoter revealed a number of transcription factor binding sites, including five classical Sp1 sites, within the first 200 bp 5′ of the transcription start site. The positioning of the basal transcriptional machinery in a TATA-less promoter can occur independent of InR sequences when Sp1 binding sites are present (44Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Google Scholar, 45Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2252-2257Google Scholar, 46Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Google Scholar). In such instances, Sp1 is capable of stabilizing transcriptional initiation complexes approximately 50 bp downstream from an Sp1 binding site (45Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2252-2257Google Scholar). Mapping of the start site of transcription was achieved through RNase protection, and it was shown that transcriptional initiation occurs 22 bp 5′ from the end of the longest published mouse FGFR3 cDNA (GenBank accession no. M81342) and 57 bp 3′ of the most proximal Sp1 binding site. Our start site differs by only two nucleotides from that previously described by Perez-Castro et al. (47Perez-Castro A.V. Wilson J. Altherr M.R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 10-16Google Scholar) and both start sites are positioned such that Sp1 could facilitate organization of the transcription initiation complex.Through comparison to the published mouse FGFR3 cDNA, it was also determined that sequences encoding for the 5′-UTR are divided by a 376-bp intron. Our placement of the 5′ splice donor site 26 bp 5′ to that determined by Perez-Castro et al. (47Perez-Castro A.V. Wilson J. Altherr M.R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 10-16Google Scholar) is consistent with the 5′-UTR sequences of the published mouse FGFR3 cDNA. Alternative splicing or the use of a cryptic splice donor site could account for the differences between these two studies. The utilization of alternative splice donor and splice acceptor sites is known to occur in many of the FGFR genes (48Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.T. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202Google Scholar, 49Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Google Scholar).cis-Regulatory sequences found within the CpG island were analyzed for transcriptional activity. Luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into four different cell lines, and the activity of the reporter gene examined. Constructs with as little as 100 bp (−126/−27) of 5′ cis-regulatory sequence still brought about a 20–40-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Within the CpG-rich sequence found between −126 and −27, there are two classical Sp1 binding sites. Deletions that remove the distal-most Sp1 site result in a 34–43% reduction in transcriptional activity, depending upon the cell line examined. Neighboring Sp1 sites frequently act synergistically (50Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Google Scholar, 51Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Google Scholar). However, the data presented here, in conjunction with the known requirement of Sp1 for the formation of a transcription initiation complex in a TATA-less promoter, suggests that the sequence context of the FGFR3 promoter simply provides for additive effects mediated by Sp1. Although the transcriptional activity is dependent upon the 5′ proximal sequence, this activity is independent of cellular background in that it fails to mimic the expression profile of the endogenous FGFR3 gene. Finally, it should also be noted that binding sites for transcription factors not yet identified may also regulate FGFR3 promoter function through the −126/−27 promoter fragment. A detailed linker scanning analysis will be needed to identify such sites.In an attempt to find transcriptional enhancers, it was determined that addition of the FGFR3 UTR and intervening intron sequences could promote an 8–10-fold increase in transcriptional activity. To rule out the role of initiator region (InR) effects on the efficiency of transcriptional initiation, constructs that contained the endogenous initiation site were compared with the previously defined promoter constructs. These experiments showed that addition of the −26 to +10 FGFR3 sequence failed to affect transcriptional activity. To localize this enhancer activity, additional constructs were analyzed. Constructs that contained the 5′-UTR sequences but lacked intron I failed to result in significant transcriptional enhancement, whereas placement of the intron alone 3′ relative to the FGFR3 promoter sequences afforded the same transcriptional enhancement seen with the UTR/intron combination. These results demonstrated that the enhancer-like activity resides in intron I.Mapping of the intron enhancer activity to sequences between +340 and +395 identified two polypurine direct repeat sequence motifs. The sequence and organization of these motifs is similar to a motif previously identified in the EGFR promoter. From the studies of Johnsonet al. (42Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Google Scholar), it was determined that this site was capable of enhancing the transcription of the EGFR promoter in vitro. Through their studies, they also showed that these elements were sensitive to S1 nuclease and bound the Sp1 transcription factor. Although this site in the FGFR3 promoter is not sensitive to S1 nuclease, 3D. G. McEwen and D. M. Ornitz, unpublished observations. it does interact with Sp1-like DNA binding activity as shown through gel shift analysis. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated through competition with the classical Sp1 (GC box) binding site and a non-classical Sp1 binding site derived from the promoter for the human EGFR. The classical Sp1 element is unrelated to the polypurine stretch; however, it was capable of competing for the DNA binding activity found in all but one of the resulting DNA-protein complexes. Furthermore, transfection studies in SL2 cells demonstrated that Sp1 could promote transcriptional activity through either the basal promoter alone or the promoter/enhancer combination whereas co-transfection studies demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 can enhance transcription through the intron enhancer element. Together, these data suggest that binding sites for members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors, both proximal and distal to the start site of transcription, can work together to enhance transcription of the FGFR3 gene.The ability of proximal and distal Sp1 binding sites to synergistically regulate transcription has been observed by others (50Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Google Scholar, 52Su W. Jackson S. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Google Scholar, 53Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Google Scholar). Through these studies, it has been shown that Sp1-Sp1 protein interactions can induce looping of the interveningcis-regulatory sequences. These proximal-distal interactions are hypothesized to regulate gene transcription by increasing the local concentration of Sp1 glutamine-rich activation domains near the start site. Such a model would explain the synergistic ability of the intron enhancer to regulate the transcriptional activity of the FGFR3 basal promoter.Although Sp3 has usually been shown to serve a negative regulatory role by competing for Sp1 binding sites, at least two other studies have demonstrated that SP3 can promote transcriptional activity (54Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Google Scholar, 55Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11792-11797Google Scholar). This transcription-promoting ability of Sp3 in our experiments may reflect the sequence-specific context of the binding site, as evidenced by the ability of Sp3 to transactivate the B fragment. Additional experiments will be required to demonstrate the in vivo role of Sp3 in FGFR3 promoter regulation.Transient transfection assays demonstrated that promoter activity resides in the CpG island found at the 5′ end of the FGFR3 gene, whereas an enhancer element was located in the first intron. However, this activity failed to parallel the cell-type specific expression of the endogenous FGFR3 gene. To assess whether or not the minimal promoter sequences defined above were capable of promoting cell-type specific expression in vivo, various lengths of regulatory sequences were used to generate transgenic animals. Surprisingly, analysis of the transgene expression in 13 independent transgenic lines demonstrated that the sequences between −220 and +609 provide the proper regulatory elements required for the expression of a reporter gene in a subset of the tissues that normally express the endogenous FGFR3 gene, whereas these same elements fail to limit the cell-specific expression pattern of the endogenous FGFR3 gene in vitro. These data suggest that other undefined mechanisms exist to regulate the expression of the FGFR3 minimal promoter in vivo.Due to the increased mutability associated with 5-methylcytosine, the conservation of the CpG island at the 5′ end of the FGFR3 gene suggests that it plays some important regulatory role in vivo. One possible way in which these sequences might regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner is through the methylation of any of the 83 CpG dinucleotides found within the −220 to +609 region. The establishment of methylation patterns during development (56Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Google Scholar) is required for embryo viability, and has been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of many genes by either directly interfering with the binding of transcription factors to their DNA cognates (57Watt F. Molloy P.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1136-1143Google Scholar, 58Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 612-619Google Scholar, 59Iannello R.C. Young J. Sumarsono S. Tymms M.J. Dahl H.H. Gould J. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Google Scholar) or by recruiting methyl binding transcriptional repressor proteins (60Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Google Scholar, 61Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Google Scholar). Unlike the hypomethylated state of most CpG islands, preliminary studies3 in which we examined the methylation status of the FGFR3 CpG island in numerous tissues, as well as the transcriptional activity of in vitro methylated reporter constructs, suggested that methylation may be a contributing factor to the tissue specificity exhibited by the FGFR3 minimal promoter in vivo. Cellular differentiation requires the proper interpretation of external stimuli. Although many types of stimuli influence cell fate, a target cell must express the appropriate complement of receptors to perceive, interpret, and respond to environmental signals. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; luc, luciferase; i, intron; UTR, untranslated region; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EGFR, epidermal growth factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); β-gal, β-galactosidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; InR, initiator region.1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; luc, luciferase; i, intron; UTR, untranslated region; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; EGFR, epidermal growth factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); β-gal, β-galactosidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; InR, initiator region. are small molecular mass polypeptides (18–27 kDa), which have been implicated in many developmentally regulated events such as mesoderm induction, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, malignant transformation, and neuronal differentiation (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Google Scholar, 2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar). To date, 15 FGF ligands have been described (3Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Google Scholar,4McWhirter J.R. Goulding M. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Murre C. Development. 1997; 124: 3221-3232Google Scholar). These FGFs all have unique patterns of expression as well as a high affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs have been shown to regulate the biological activity of many FGFs and serve as an essential cofactor required for FGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation (5Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Google Scholar). Because HSPGs are a major component of the extracellular matrix, they have been implicated in limiting the diffusion of FGFs from their site of production (6Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1651-1659Google Scholar). Thus, the spatial and temporal regulation of expression of FGFs provides one mechanism through which FGF-mediated signaling can be regulated during development. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family consists of four genes, each of which encodes a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptor (3Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Google Scholar, 7Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar). Recently, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the FGFRs have revealed unique roles for these receptors during development (8Muenke M. Schell U. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 308-313Google Scholar, 9Skaer H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R238-R241Google Scholar, 10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Google Scholar, 11Deng C.X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M. Daugherty C. Ornitz D.M. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3045-3057Google Scholar, 12Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi T.P. Harpal K. Henkemeyer M. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3032-3044Google Scholar). Specifically, point mutations in FGFR3 have been genetically linked to achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and hypochondroplasia (8Muenke M. Schell U. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 308-313Google Scholar); all are diseases where bones fail to grow to normal lengths. These skeletal disorders result from defects in the epiphyseal growth plate, a place where FGFR3 is known to be highly expressed (14Peters K. Ornitz D.M. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Google Scholar). When the mutations corresponding to those of achondroplasia (G380R) and thanatophoric dysplasia (R248C and K650E) are introduced into the murine FGFR3 cDNA, ligand-independent activation of the receptor is observed (15Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Google Scholar, 16Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Google Scholar). The constitutive activity of this receptor is thought to disrupt normal development by initiating intracellular signals in the absence of ligand. In contrast, loss-of-function alleles of FGFR3 lead to the overgrowth of long bones (10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Google Scholar, 12Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Google Scholar), as well as deafness due to defects in the development of the organ of Corti (10Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Google Scholar). Although redundancy in the FGFR family may compensate for the loss of FGFR3 activity in some tissues, these results demonstrate that both the regulation of FGFR3 expression and kinase-mediated signaling activity are required for proper development. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of FGFR3, we have identified and characterized the FGFR3 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that sequences derived from the CpG island found at the 5′ end of the murine FGFR3 gene are capable of promoting transcription in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, the activity of these sequences can be further stimulated by sequences found within the first intron. Localization of the intron enhancer element identified binding sites for the Sp1 family of transcription factors. Characterization of the trans-acting factors demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 could promote transcriptional activity through these elements in the Drosophila SL2 cell line. Although Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed, the defined minimal promoter and intron enhancer are sufficient to promote the tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. DISCUSSIONThe promoter for the FGFR3 gene resides in a CpG island that lacks the classical CAAT box and TATA box motifs found in many eukaryotic promoters. Sequence analysis of the FGFR3 promoter revealed a number of transcription factor binding sites, including five classical Sp1 sites, within the first 200 bp 5′ of the transcription start site. The positioning of the basal transcriptional machinery in a TATA-less promoter can occur independent of InR sequences when Sp1 binding sites are present (44Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Google Scholar, 45Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2252-2257Google Scholar, 46Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Google Scholar). In such instances, Sp1 is capable of stabilizing transcriptional initiation complexes approximately 50 bp downstream from an Sp1 binding site (45Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2252-2257Google Scholar). Mapping of the start site of transcription was achieved through RNase protection, and it was shown that transcriptional initiation occurs 22 bp 5′ from the end of the longest published mouse FGFR3 cDNA (GenBank accession no. M81342) and 57 bp 3′ of the most proximal Sp1 binding site. Our start site differs by only two nucleotides from that previously described by Perez-Castro et al. (47Perez-Castro A.V. Wilson J. Altherr M.R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 10-16Google Scholar) and both start sites are positioned such that Sp1 could facilitate organization of the transcription initiation complex.Through comparison to the published mouse FGFR3 cDNA, it was also determined that sequences encoding for the 5′-UTR are divided by a 376-bp intron. Our placement of the 5′ splice donor site 26 bp 5′ to that determined by Perez-Castro et al. (47Perez-Castro A.V. Wilson J. Altherr M.R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 10-16Google Scholar) is consistent with the 5′-UTR sequences of the published mouse FGFR3 cDNA. Alternative splicing or the use of a cryptic splice donor site could account for the differences between these two studies. The utilization of alternative splice donor and splice acceptor sites is known to occur in many of the FGFR genes (48Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.T. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202Google Scholar, 49Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Google Scholar).cis-Regulatory sequences found within the CpG island were analyzed for transcriptional activity. Luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into four different cell lines, and the activity of the reporter gene examined. Constructs with as little as 100 bp (−126/−27) of 5′ cis-regulatory sequence still brought about a 20–40-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Within the CpG-rich sequence found between −126 and −27, there are two classical Sp1 binding sites. Deletions that remove the distal-most Sp1 site result in a 34–43% reduction in transcriptional activity, depending upon the cell line examined. Neighboring Sp1 sites frequently act synergistically (50Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Google Scholar, 51Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Google Scholar). However, the data presented here, in conjunction with the known requirement of Sp1 for the formation of a transcription initiation complex in a TATA-less promoter, suggests that the sequence context of the FGFR3 promoter simply provides for additive effects mediated by Sp1. Although the transcriptional activity is dependent upon the 5′ proximal sequence, this activity is independent of cellular background in that it fails to mimic the expression profile of the endogenous FGFR3 gene. Finally, it should also be noted that binding sites for transcription factors not yet identified may also regulate FGFR3 promoter function through the −126/−27 promoter fragment. A detailed linker scanning analysis will be needed to identify such sites.In an attempt to find transcriptional enhancers, it was determined that addition of the FGFR3 UTR and intervening intron sequences could promote an 8–10-fold increase in transcriptional activity. To rule out the role of initiator region (InR) effects on the efficiency of transcriptional initiation, constructs that contained the endogenous initiation site were compared with the previously defined promoter constructs. These experiments showed that addition of the −26 to +10 FGFR3 sequence failed to affect transcriptional activity. To localize this enhancer activity, additional constructs were analyzed. Constructs that contained the 5′-UTR sequences but lacked intron I failed to result in significant transcriptional enhancement, whereas placement of the intron alone 3′ relative to the FGFR3 promoter sequences afforded the same transcriptional enhancement seen with the UTR/intron combination. These results demonstrated that the enhancer-like activity resides in intron I.Mapping of the intron enhancer activity to sequences between +340 and +395 identified two polypurine direct repeat sequence motifs. The sequence and organization of these motifs is similar to a motif previously identified in the EGFR promoter. From the studies of Johnsonet al. (42Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Google Scholar), it was determined that this site was capable of enhancing the transcription of the EGFR promoter in vitro. Through their studies, they also showed that these elements were sensitive to S1 nuclease and bound the Sp1 transcription factor. Although this site in the FGFR3 promoter is not sensitive to S1 nuclease, 3D. G. McEwen and D. M. Ornitz, unpublished observations. it does interact with Sp1-like DNA binding activity as shown through gel shift analysis. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated through competition with the classical Sp1 (GC box) binding site and a non-classical Sp1 binding site derived from the promoter for the human EGFR. The classical Sp1 element is unrelated to the polypurine stretch; however, it was capable of competing for the DNA binding activity found in all but one of the resulting DNA-protein complexes. Furthermore, transfection studies in SL2 cells demonstrated that Sp1 could promote transcriptional activity through either the basal promoter alone or the promoter/enhancer combination whereas co-transfection studies demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 can enhance transcription through the intron enhancer element. Together, these data suggest that binding sites for members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors, both proximal and distal to the start site of transcription, can work together to enhance transcription of the FGFR3 gene.The ability of proximal and distal Sp1 binding sites to synergistically regulate transcription has been observed by others (50Courey A.J.

De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Google Scholar, 55Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11792-11797Google Scholar). This transcription-promoting ability of Sp3 in our experiments may reflect the sequence-specific context of the binding site, as evidenced by the ability of Sp3 to transactivate the B fragment. Additional experiments will be required to demonstrate the in vivo role of Sp3 in FGFR3 promoter regulation. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that promoter activity resides in the CpG island found at the 5′ end of the FGFR3 gene, whereas an enhancer element was located in the first intron. However, this activity failed to parallel the cell-type specific expression of the endogenous FGFR3 gene. To assess whether or not the minimal promoter sequences defined above were capable of promoting cell-type specific expression in vivo, various lengths of regulatory sequences were used to generate transgenic animals. Surprisingly, analysis of the transgene expression in 13 independent transgenic lines demonstrated that the sequences between −220 and +609 provide the proper regulatory elements required for the expression of a reporter gene in a subset of the tissues that normally express the endogenous FGFR3 gene, whereas these same elements fail to limit the cell-specific expression pattern of the endogenous FGFR3 gene in vitro. These data suggest that other undefined mechanisms exist to regulate the expression of the FGFR3 minimal promoter in vivo. Due to the increased mutability associated with 5-methylcytosine, the conservation of the CpG island at the 5′ end of the FGFR3 gene suggests that it plays some important regulatory role in vivo. One possible way in which these sequences might regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner is through the methylation of any of the 83 CpG dinucleotides found within the −220 to +609 region. The establishment of methylation patterns during development (56Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Google Scholar) is required for embryo viability, and has been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of many genes by either directly interfering with the binding of transcription factors to their DNA cognates (57Watt F. Molloy P.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1136-1143Google Scholar, 58Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 612-619Google Scholar, 59Iannello R.C. Young J. Sumarsono S. Tymms M.J. Dahl H.H. Gould J. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Google Scholar) or by recruiting methyl binding transcriptional repressor proteins (60Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Google Scholar, 61Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Google Scholar). Unlike the hypomethylated state of most CpG islands, preliminary studies3 in which we examined the methylation status of the FGFR3 CpG island in numerous tissues, as well as the transcriptional activity of in vitro methylated reporter constructs, suggested that methylation may be a contributing factor to the tissue specificity exhibited by the FGFR3 minimal promoter in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2315285543,"A limited number of previous studies have indicated a low frequency of chromosome 10 allele losses and deletions in bladder cancers. We investigated the involvement of chromosome 10 in advanced bladder cancers. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was analysed in 19 microsatellite loci in 20 grade III invasive transitional cell carcinomas. Nine (45%) of the 20 tumors had at least one allele loss on the long arm of chromosome 10. The short arm of chromosome 10 was not affected. The most frequent LOH occurred at D10S215, where four (29%) of 14 of the informative cases had an allele loss. The minimal region with allele losses was located between the centromeric marker D10S1644 and the telomeric marker D10S541, which are separated by 2.52 cM. The results strongly suggest the existence within that region of a tumor suppressor gene or genes for advanced bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2060317977,"The vesicle docking protein p115 was found to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle-specific manner; it was found phosphorylated in interphase but not in mitotic cells. During interphase, however, two forms of p115 were detected in the cells; the phosphorylated form was found exclusively in cytosol, whereas the unphosphorylated form was associated with membranes, mostly of the Golgi complex. The latter form was released from the membranes upon phosphorylation. Mutational analysis revealed that the phosphorylation site of p115 was the Ser942 residue in the C-terminal acidic domain. A mutant with a single substitution of Ser942 → Ala markedly increased its association with the Golgi membrane. Another mutant with Ser942 → Asp was able to associate with the membrane, although at a decreased level, indicating that the dissociation of p115 from the membrane is not simply due to the negative charge of phosphorylated Ser942. Taken together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser942 at the C-terminal acidic domain regulates the interaction of p115 with the Golgi membrane, possibly taking part in the regulatory mechanism of vesicular transport.

Taken together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser942 at the C-terminal acidic domain regulates the interaction of p115 with the Golgi membrane, possibly taking part in the regulatory mechanism of vesicular transport. Vesicular transport of proteins is carried out by the formation of coated vesicles from a donor compartment, followed by their uncoating and subsequent docking and fusion of the vesicles with a target compartment membrane, in which a number of soluble and membrane proteins are involved (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar). The docking of vesicles to target membranes is accomplished through the specific interaction between membrane proteins named v- and t-SNAREs (vesicle and target SNAP receptors) (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar,2Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Google Scholar). This is followed by binding of SNAPs (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, which lead to membrane fusion. Vesicle docking is also controlled by interactions of SNAREs with other proteins including Rab proteins (3Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Google Scholar). p115, a peripheral membrane protein localized to the Golgi apparatus and also present in the cytoplasm, was first identified as a component required for intra-Golgi transport (4Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Google Scholar) and found to be identical to the transcytosis-associated protein TAP (5Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Google Scholar). Structural analysis also indicates that it is a homolog to Uso1p, a yeast protein required for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (6Nakajima H. Hirata A. Yonehara T. Yoneda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Google Scholar). p115/TAP exits as a parallel homodimer with two globular heads followed by a rod-like domain containing a C-terminal acidic tail (5Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Google Scholar, 7Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Google Scholar). p115/TAP and Uso1p have been shown to function in a docking step prior to membrane fusion (8Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Google Scholar). Recently, Warren and his colleagues (9Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Google Scholar) demonstrated that p115 binds to Golgi membranes with high affinity during interphase but not during mitosis. In addition, GM130, a peripheral protein tightly associated with the cis-Golgi membrane (10Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Google Scholar), was identified as the binding site for p115 on the Golgi membrane (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). GM130 was modified by phosphorylation only during mitosis, resulting in no binding of GM130 to p115. The mechanism of membrane binding inhibition by p115 during mitosis would provide a molecular explanation for the blocking of vesicular transport and for the vesicle-mediated fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (12Featherstone C. Griffiths G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2036-2046Google Scholar). During the interphase of cell cycle, however, p115 must recycle between membranes and cytosol to maintain vesicular transport. Because GM130 is stably associated with membranes and able to bind to p115 during interphase (9Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Google Scholar, 11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar), the recycling of p115 should be regulated by its own modification or by other factors. In the present study, we demonstrate that the membrane interaction of p115 is indeed regulated by phosphorylation, i.e. when not phosphorylated, p115 associates with the Golgi membrane but dissociates from the membrane upon its phosphorylation. The full-length cDNA for human p115 was isolated from a liver cDNA library using a rat p115 cDNA fragment as a probe (5Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Google Scholar, 13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Google Scholar). The cDNA (3.9 kilobase pairs) was found to encode a protein of 962 amino acids (108 kDa) that shows 95.3 and 91.9% identity with p115 of bovine and rat, respectively (5Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Google Scholar, 7Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Google Scholar). Two chimeric proteins of p115 fragments (amino acid numbers 644–730 or 744–855) fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase were constructed in the expression vector pGEX3X (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed in and purified from bacteria and injected into rabbits to raise anti-p115 antibodies as described previously (13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Google Scholar). A cDNA covering the entire coding region of human p115 was inserted into the EcoRI site of pSG5 expression vector and designated pSG5/p115. The FLAG™ sequence encoding the amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDK was ligated in-frame into the BalI site of pSG5/p115 that had been introduced at 11 bases upstream from the N-terminal ATG codon. Constructs of truncated p115 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis; the termination codon TAG was introduced into the Lys928 codon (AAG) for truncation of the C-terminal acidic tail domain (designated ΔAD) and also into the Gln647 codon (CAG) for truncation of both the rod-like coiled-coil domain and the acidic domain (designated ΔRAD). A construct lacking the N-terminal head domain was generated by in-frame ligation of the BglII-XhoI cDNA fragment of pSG5/p115 downstream of the FLAG sequence (designated ΔHD). Mutants with the following substitutions were also prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5/p115; Ser942 (TCT) → Ala (GCT), Ser952(AGT) → Ala (GCT), and Ser942 → Ala/Ser952 → Ala. All the constructs prepared by site-directed mutagenesis were verified by sequencing. Each plasmid (20 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells as described (13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Google Scholar). HeLa cells (4 × 106cells/dish) or transfected COS-1 cells (5 × 106cells/dish) were labeled at 37 °C for 5 h with [35S]methionine (4 MBq/dish) or with [32P]orthophosphate (20 MBq/dish). When indicated, interphasic and mitotic cells that had been prepared according to Suprynowicz and Gerace (15Suprynowicz F.A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2073-2081Google Scholar) were also labeled as above. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-p115, anti-human GM130, or monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Eastman-Kodak, New Heaven, CT). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (7% gels) and fluorography (16Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Google Scholar). A postnuclear fraction was prepared from HeLa cells or transfected COS-1 cells and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h into membrane and cytosol fractions as described previously (13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Google Scholar). A Golgi-enriched fraction was prepared by flotation of the postnuclear fraction in a sucrose gradient as described by Balch et al. (17Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Google Scholar). The samples, when indicated, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or the absence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (50 units/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7% gels) or by isoelectric focusing (18Ames G.F.-L. Nikaido K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 616-623Google Scholar, 19Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (at dilution 1:1000 of each antibody). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL kit (20Haruta T. Takami N. Ohmura M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 455-463Google Scholar). In some experiments the immunoblotts were scanned with a GT-8500 scanner (Epson, Inc., Tokyo) and analyzed by Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Photosystems, Columbia, MD) and NIH Image software (20Haruta T. Takami N. Ohmura M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 455-463Google Scholar). A cytosol fraction was prepared from the postnuclear fraction of HeLa S3 cells by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h. An aliquot of the cytosol (100 μl of 5 mg protein/ml) was incubated with Sepharose CL-4B beads coupled with anti-p115 IgG at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. After spinning the beads down, the supernatant was adjusted to contain 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (19Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Google Scholar) and used as the p115-depleted cytosol. The Golgi membrane (60 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 400 μg of the control or p115-depleted cytosol, 50 μm Mg-ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (3.7 MBq). At the end of incubation, an equal volume of × 2 concentrated lysis buffer (16Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Google Scholar) was added into the reaction mixture, followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described above. Total cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells that had been labeled with [35S]methionine or32Pi were immunoprecipitated with anti-p115 antibodies. The immunoprecipitate contained a single32P-labeled protein with the same mobility in SDS-PAGE as35S-labeled p115 (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating that p115 is phosphorylated. The protein was found to be phosphorylated in all mammalian cells tested (Fig. 1 B). We then examined whether the phosphorylation of p115 was regulated by the cell cycle. When interphasic and mitotic cells were prepared and incubated with32Pi, labeled p115 was found in the interphasic cells but not in the mitotic cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblot analysis showed that the same amount of p115 was present in the interphasic and mitotic preparations (lanes 3 and 4). This is in contrast to the incorporation of 32Pi into GM130, which occurred only in the mitotic phase (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5 and 6), as reported previously (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). The primary and secondary structures of p115 predict that the protein consists of an N-terminal head domain, a coiled-coil rod-like dimerization domain, and a C-terminal acidic domain (6Nakajima H. Hirata A. Yonehara T. Yoneda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Google Scholar, 7Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Google Scholar). To determine the approximate location of the phosphorylated site in p115, we constructed deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged p115, each of which lacked one of the domains (Fig. 2 A). The constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells, and the mutant proteins were examined after metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. Each [35S]methionine-labeled mutant protein was identified as a molecule with the expected molecular size (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–5). When the transfected cells were incubated with 32Pi, only the mutant containing the C-terminal acidic domain, but not the other mutants, was heavily labeled (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–10). The result indicates that the phosphorylation site(s) of p115 is contained in the C-terminal acidic domain. The C-terminal acidic domain of human p115 contains no Tyr and Thr residues but contains two Ser residues at positions 942 and 952 (Fig. 2 C). The possible phosphorylation of the Ser residues in the domain was examined by substitution of Ser → Ala in each position. The band labeled with 32Pi was dramatically reduced in intensity in the mutant containing Ser942 → Ala alone and was undetectable in the double mutant (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, a substitution Ser952 → Ala alone caused no significant effect on the phosphorylation of p115 (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). The results indicate that the Ser942 residue is the predominant site of phosphorylation. In fact, the Ser942 but not the Ser952 is conserved in p115 from other species (Fig. 2 C), which was also found to be phosphorylated as shown in Fig. 1 B. When a postnuclear fraction prepared from32Pi-labeled cells was separated into membrane and cytosol fractions, more than 90% of the 32P-labeled p115 was recovered in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblot analysis, however, showed that the membrane fraction contained approximately one-third of the total p115 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). The membrane-associated and cytosolic forms were found to have a different pI when analyzed by isoelectric focusing, and the more acidic cytosolic form was converted to a form with the same mobility as the membrane form by alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). These results indicate that the cytosolic p115 is the phosphorylated form, whereas the membrane-associated protein is the unphosphorylated one. We then examined whether p115 is released from the Golgi membrane upon its phosphorylation in vitro. When the Golgi membrane was incubated with [32P]ATP, p115 was phosphorylated equally in the presence or the absence of the p115-depleted cytosol (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that phosphorylation of p115 requires no cytosolic factor. When the reaction mixture was separated by centrifugation into a supernatant and a membrane pellet, all the 32P-labeled protein was recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that the protein is released from the membrane upon its phosphorylation. We further examined the effect of mutations of the phosphorylation site Ser942 on the membrane association of p115. The wild-type p115 and mutants with a substitution of Ser942 → Ala or Ser942 → Asp were transfected into COS-1 cells, from which postnuclear and Golgi-enriched fractions were prepared. Immunoblot analysis of p115 in the postnuclear fraction demonstrated that all the wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed at a similar level in the transfected cells (Fig. 3 C, lane 1, 3, and 5.). Recovery of the mutants in the Golgi membrane was increased approximately 180% for the mutant with Ser942 → Ala, whereas the mutant with Ser942 → Asp was decreased by 50%, compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 3 D). The value obtained for the wild-type protein may reflect a steady state of its membrane association, possibly regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Lack of phosphorylation of the mutant with a Ser942 → Ala substitution could prevent its dissociation from the membrane, resulting in a 2-fold increase of the association, which may reflect a saturated level on the membrane. The results also suggest that the functional role of the phosphorylated Ser942 is not completely compensated by the negatively charged residue Asp. In the present study we demonstrated that p115 is phosphorylated in interphase cells but not in mitotic cells. This is in contrast to the phosphorylation of GM130 that takes place only during mitosis (9Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Google Scholar,11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). What is the functional significance of such a differential phosphorylation response of the two proteins in vesicular transport? Available evidence indicates that the N-terminal 73-residue domain of GM130 binds p115, whereas the C-terminal half is involved in binding to the Golgi membrane (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). The binding of GM130 to the Golgi membrane is unlikely to be regulated, because mitotic phosphorylation both in vivo (9Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Google Scholar) and in vitro (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar) does not release GM130 from the membrane. Mitotic phosphorylation of GM130 at the N-terminal domain, however, prevents its association with p115 that mediates docking of transport vesicles to the membrane. This may explain why vesicular transport is blocked during mitosis and the Golgi membranes are concurrently fragmented (12Featherstone C. Griffiths G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2036-2046Google Scholar, 21Lucocq J.M. Pryde J.G. Berger E.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 865-874Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of GM130 and its inhibitory effect on the binding to p115 are blocked by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). In fact, the N-terminal domain of GM130 contains two putative cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar). The presence of p115 both in the cytosol and Golgi membrane suggests that p115, involved in the docking of vesicles to the membrane, is released from the membrane into the cytosol. The recycling of p115 may be essential to maintain active vesicular transport during interphase. Because GM130 is not phosphorylated during interphase and stably binds to p115, the recycling of p115 occurring during interphase cannot be regulated by GM130 itself. The data presented here support the idea that the interphase recycling of p115 is regulated by its own phosphorylation. p115, which primarily exists as a phosphorylated form in the cytosol, associates with the Golgi membrane when it is dephosphorylated, whereas the protein dissociates from the membrane upon its phosphorylation. The p115-binding protein on the Golgi membrane may be GM130 as suggested by Nakamura et al. (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar), although we have not directly identified it. Thus, it is likely that during interphase the dephosphorylation of GM130 is a prerequisite for the initial binding of p115 to the Golgi membrane, which is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of p115 itself. In contrast, during mitosis the phosphorylation of GM130 prevents the binding of p115 to the membrane (11Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Google Scholar) even when p115 is dephosphorylated. p115 was phosphorylated predominantly at the Ser942 residue in the C-terminal acidic domain. The amino acid sequence surrounding Ser942, however, does not correspond to any of the known phosphorylation consensus motifs (22Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling R. Baltleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Catley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Google Scholar). The lack of a requirement for cytosol during phosphorylation suggests that p115 is phosphorylated by a membrane-associated protein kinase, which is clearly different from that involved in phosphorylation of GM130. Further studies are required for the characterization of kinases and phosphatases for p115 and GM130, which may shed light on the regulatory mechanism of vesicular transport. We thank Dr. J. L.

https://openalex.org/W2087838991,"The 9E3/CEF4 gene codes for a chemokine that is highly homologous to human interleukin-8 and melanoma growth-stimulating activity/groα. These chemokines belong to a family of molecular mediators that are importantly involved in inflammation, wound healing, tumor development, and viral entry into cells. On the chorioallantoic membrane the 9E3 protein is chemotactic for monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes and is angiogenic. In cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts, which have many of the properties of wound fibroblasts, the gene is stimulated by a variety of agents including oncogenes, growth factors, phorbol esters, and thrombin. The strong stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin in culture correlates well with the observation that in young chicks this gene is stimulated to very high levels in fibroblasts upon wounding and remains high throughout wound repair. Activation of 9E3 by thrombin: (i) occurs very rapidly, one minute exposure to thrombin is sufficient to initiate the signals necessary for gene activation; (ii) is independent of mitogenesis; (iii) operates through the proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin; (iv) is mediated by tyrosine kinases, including c-src and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, rather than Ser/Thr kinases such as protein kinase C and protein kinase A. Inhibition of either c-src or the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits the stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin. We show here for the first time that activation of the EGF receptor through a cell-surface receptor that does not have tyrosine kinase activity can lead to expression of an immediate early response gene which encodes for a secreted protein, a chemokine. This rapidly activated tyrosine kinase pathway may be a general stress response by which in vivo a localized cell population reacts to emergency situations such as viral infection, wounding, or tumor growth.

This rapidly activated tyrosine kinase pathway may be a general stress response by which in vivo a localized cell population reacts to emergency situations such as viral infection, wounding, or tumor growth. The avian gene 9E3/CEF4 encodes a secreted protein that is a member of the chemokine superfamily (1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev.

Of all the members of this superfamily, the 9E3 protein shows the highest homology to interleukin-8 and also is highly homologous to MGSA 1The abbreviations used are: MGSA, melanoma growth-stimulating activity; CEF, chicken embryo fibroblast; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; qcCEF, quiescent confluent CEF; tCEF, transformed CEF; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; TRDP, thrombin receptor-derived peptide./groα. This gene is constitutively overexpressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, but its expression in normal quiescent cells is tightly regulated (5Sugano S. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1987; 49: 321-328Google Scholar, 6Bedard P.-A. Alcorta D. Simmons D.L. Luk K.-C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biemann H.P. Erickson E. Jones S.W. Maller J.L. Martins T.J. Simmons D.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 143-151Google Scholar). In addition to serum, a wide variety of oncogenes, growth factors, and inflammatory agents also stimulate 9E3 expression in normal quiescent CEFs (5Sugano S. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1987; 49: 321-328Google Scholar, 6Bedard P.-A. Alcorta D. Simmons D.L. Luk K.-C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6715-6719Google Scholar, 8Martins-Green M. Tilley C.

In vivo, the 9E3 gene is expressed at very low levels in connective tissue, tendon, and bone, but it is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of young blood vessels (10Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Google Scholar, 11Martins-Green M. Aotaki-Keen A. Hjelmeland L. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 701-707Google Scholar, 12Martins-Green M. Feugate J.E. Cytokine. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, this gene is rapidly overexpressed upon wounding, remains very highly elevated during the inflammatory phase of healing, and 36 h after wounding declines to a plateau of elevated expression that remains constant throughout granulation tissue formation (10Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Google Scholar). The 9E3 protein is chemotactic for monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes (12Martins-Green M. Feugate J.E. Cytokine. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 13Barker K.A. Hampe A. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3528-3533Google Scholar); the high levels of expression shortly after wounding could be responsible for this function. In addition, this protein is angiogenic in vivo(12Martins-Green M. Feugate J.E. Cytokine. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), which might occur in response to the steady expression of the 9E3 gene during granulation tissue formation. The observations in vivo and in vitro combined with the biochemical properties of the molecule (14Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Google Scholar) indicate that this gene could play an important role in the inflammatory response and healing of wounds. We have found that of the growth factors, inflammatory agents, and other molecules released upon wounding, thrombin is the most potent natural activator of 9E3 expression (14Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Google Scholar, 15Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 52Google Scholar). Thrombin is a serine protease that is generated at sites of vascular injury and is known to regulate hemostasis and thrombosis via its serine protease activity by inducing platelet aggregation and clot formation. However, many other actions of thrombin are independent of its thrombogenic activity and suggest that this protease is also important directly or indirectly during the inflammatory response and in the proliferative phase of wound healing (16Schuman M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 228-239Google Scholar, 17Coughlin S.R. Scarborough R.M. Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 149-154Google Scholar, 18Coughlin S.R. Thromb.

In these situations, thrombin is known to be chemotactic for monocytes and mitogenic for lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (20Chen L.B. Buchanan J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 131-135Google Scholar, 21Chen L.B. Teng N.N.H. Buchanan J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 101: 41-46Google Scholar, 22McNamara C.A. Sarembok I.J. Gimple L.W. Fenton J.W. Coughlin S.R. Owens G.K.

Furthermore, thrombin stimulates endothelial cells to express the neutrophil adhesion protein GMP-140 (24Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 349-368Google Scholar, 25Zimmerman B.J. Paulson J.C. Arrhenius T.S. Gaeta F.C. Granger D.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1049-H1053Google Scholar, 26Hattori R. Hamilton K.K. Fugate R.D. McEver R.P. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7768-7771Google Scholar) and to produce platelet-derived growth factor that stimulates smooth muscle cells to grow (27Daniel T.Y.O. Gibbs V.C. Milfay D.F. Garavoy M.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9579-9582Google Scholar, 28Molloy C.J. Parolowski J.E. Taylor D.S. Turner C.E. Weber H. Peluso M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1173-1183Google Scholar). Most of our understanding of signal transduction pathways turned on by thrombin comes from work with platelets (29Lapetina E.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 400-404Google Scholar, 30Hallak H. Muszbek L. Laposata M. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Raj S. Manning D.R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8483-8487Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (33Carveth H.J. Shaddy R.E. Whatley R.E. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1992; 18: 126-134Google Scholar). In these systems, upon binding to its seven transmembrane domain receptor, thrombin cleaves part of the N terminus of the receptor, exposing a new peptide that then binds to one of the external loops of the receptor (34Vu T.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar). This proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin causes activation of Gi or Gq,11 that turn on mitogenic and nonmitogenic events (18Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 66: 184-187Google Scholar). Gi inhibits adenylyl cyclase and cAMP and reduces the levels of PKA (35Hung T.D. Wong Y.H. Vu T.K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Google Scholar), whereas Gq,11activates phosphatidylinositol turnover, PKC, Na+/H+ antiport, and induces c-fos and c-myc (19Stiernberg J. Redin W.R. Warner W.S. Carney D.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 158-162Google Scholar, 36Carney D.H. Scott D.L. Gordon E.A. LaBelle E.F. Cell. 1985; 42: 479-488Google Scholar, 37Stiernberg J. Carney D.H. Fenton J.W. LaBelle E.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 289-295Google Scholar, 38Kim D.W. Carney D.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (abstr.): 16Google Scholar). In platelets, the Gq,11can also activate phospholipase A2 with the subsequent generation of arachidonate-derived metabolites (29Lapetina E.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 400-404Google Scholar). These lipids, known as eicosanoids, include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, which are often involved in the inflammatory process. More recently, a new proteinase-activated receptor 2 was identified that has 30% homology to proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin but for which the signaling events are not yet worked out (39Lerner D.J. Chen M. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13943-13947Google Scholar). The signaling events activated by thrombin, which are described above, are mediated by Ser/Thr kinases stimulated shortly after receptor activation. However, more recently tyrosine phosphorylation has also been implicated in the signaling events triggered upon thrombin receptor activation. It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets occurs independently of the activation of PKC (40Falet H. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 87-91Google Scholar) and that cells that do not undergo mitogenesis in response to thrombin stimulation require tyrosine kinase signals initiated by EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (41Kim D.W. Wang F. Ramakrishnan S. Scott D.L. Hensler T.M. Thompson W.C. Carney D.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 573-584Google Scholar) to trigger cell division. In growth-responsive Chinese hamster fibroblasts, thrombin activates the c-src and fyn tyrosine kinases, which provide a link between the thrombin receptor and the downstream events leading to activation of ras and the mitogenic kinase cascade (42Chen Y.-H. Pouysségur J. Courtneidge S.A. van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Google Scholar). It is now abundantly clear that thrombin is a multifunctional molecule. The fact that thrombin and chemokines are important in the inflammatory response and granulation tissue formation, and the demonstration that thrombin stimulates the expression of chemokines such as MGSA/groα (43Wen D. Rowland A. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1761-1766Google Scholar, 44Derynck R. Balentien E. Han J.H. Thomas H.G. Wen D. Samantha A.K. Zachariae C.O. Griffin P.R. Brachmann R. Wong W.L. Matsushima K. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10225-10233Google Scholar), 9E3 (14Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Google Scholar, 15Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 52Google Scholar, 45Vaingankar S. Martins-Green M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (abstr.): 85Google Scholar), and interleukin-8 (46Ueno A. Murakami K. Yamanouchi K. Watanabe M. Kondo T. Immunology. 1996; 88: 76-81Google Scholar) may indicate that these chemokines could be the mediators of some of thrombin's effects on healing. Identification and understanding of the signal transduction pathways generated by thrombin leading to activation of chemokines can give insight into ways of manipulating the function of this latter class of molecules. Because the 9E3 gene is stimulated to high levels shortly after wounding and because thrombin is the most potent natural activator of this gene, we are investigating the signal transduction mechanisms by which thrombin activates 9E3 expression. To perform these studies we use primary cell cultures of CEFs. This culture system allows us to make inferences to the situationin vivo because the properties of the fibroblasts in wounded tissue and in granulation tissue resemble those of embryonic fibroblasts (47Clark R.A.F. Henson P.M. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York and London1996Google Scholar). Our results show that the Ser/Thr kinases PKC and PKA are not directly involved in the stimulation of this gene by thrombin, but instead we find that tyrosine phosphorylation is a key event that occurs when CEFs are activated by thrombin to produce 9E3. We show here that the EGF receptor and c-src are two of the tyrosine kinases importantly involved in this process. Concentrations of activators and inhibitors of signal transduction cited here were selected for efficacy from a wider range of concentrations initially tested. A23187 (1 μm), arachidonic acid (100 μm), and bovine thrombin (9 units/ml) were obtained from Sigma. Calphostin C (200 nm), cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), genistein (1–25 μm), H-7 (200 nm), HA 1004-HCl (20 μm), H89 (100 nm), herbimycin A (1 μm), ionomycin (1 ng/ml), lavendustin A analogue RG 14355 (100–200 nm), pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), staurosporine (200 nm), and tyrphostin AG1478 (500 nm) came from Calbiochem. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (300 μm) was obtained from Serdary Research Laboratories, London, Ontario, and human recombinant TGFα (10 ng/ml) and EGF (10 and 100 ng/ml) were obtained from Intergen. 100% Me2SO was used as a solvent when appropriate. Anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 was purchased from Transduction Labs and 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. ECL reagents and antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham. TRDP (200 μm) is a thrombin receptor-derived peptide with the following sequence: H-Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Pro-Asn-Asp-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Phe-OH (Bachem). Primary cultures of CEFs were prepared from 10-day-old chicken embryos as described previously (48Bissell M.J. Farson D. Tung A.S.-C. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 6: 1-12Google Scholar). On the fourth day, secondary cultures were prepared by trypsinizing and plating the primary cells in 199 medium containing 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth and 2% donor calf serum at a density of 1.2 × 106/60-mm plate. Transformed CEFs (tCEF) were obtained by infecting these cells with Rous sarcoma virus XD-2 (an engineered form of Schmidt-Ruppin strain A) as described previously (49Cross F.R. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1983; 34: 597-607Google Scholar). To study the effects of thrombin on 9E3 expression and the effects of known activators and inhibitors of signal transduction, we used quiescent confluent CEF (qcCEF) cultures and incubated them in serum-free 199 medium containing the specific treatment at various concentrations and for varying times. After the initial experiments, the inhibitors and activators were used at the doses shown above and incubated for 1 h; thrombin was added for another hour and then the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for up to 18 h. At the end of the incubation period the supernatant was collected, protease inhibitors were added, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Because qcCEFs are primary cells rather than a cell line, there are small variations in the basal levels of 9E3 expression from batch to batch of cells. Therefore, for each experiment and/or treatment of a different batch of cells we used internal positive (thrombin-treated cells) and negative (untreated cells) controls. Volumes of the cell culture supernatant corresponding to equal amounts of protein in the cells extracts were loaded on 20% polyacrylamide-glycerol gels and electrophoresed at 16 mA for about 4 h. The concentration of the protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC-protein kit. Transfer was performed using a semidry transfer apparatus (Millipore). After transfer, to check for evenness of protein loading, the upper part of the gel was cut and stained with silver staining for a protein that is ∼35 kDa. This protein is present in the supernatant of qcCEFs, and its concentration does not vary with treatment of the cells. The efficiency and evenness of transfer of the 9E3 protein was monitored by silver staining the gel after the transfer. The 9E3 protein was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit (14Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham). CEFs were homogenized and total RNA was prepared using TRIzolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (20 μg each) were denatured in formamide-formaldehyde buffer containing ethidium bromide and separated on formaldehyde-agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to MagnaGraph nylon membrane (MSI Inc.) that were photographed to visualize the quality of the rRNA and confirm equal loading and even transfer. The RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane for 2 min and baked at 60 °C for 2 h. Prehybridization was performed for 6–9 h, and hybridization was carried out for 36 h following the procedures described in Ref. 10Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Google Scholar. Microdensitometry analysis was performed by laser densitometric scanning in a LKB microdensitometer. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in boiling 2 × Laemmeli buffer and shearing by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times, followed by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad) and Towbin's buffer for 13 h at 30 V or 5 h at 60 V. The blots were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% thimerasol (TBST-BSA) and then incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20 at 1:2500 and 4G10 at 1:1000 dilutions) in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. The excess antibodies were washed 3 times for 5 min each, plus a longer 20-min wash with TBST. A second blocking step was done for 1 h with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk. This was followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. The washings were performed as described for the immunoblots. The antibody detection was done using ECL reagents (Amersham). Addition of serum to CEFs in culture stimulates 9E3 expression as cells enter the cell cycle (5Sugano S. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1987; 49: 321-328Google Scholar, 6Bedard P.-A. Alcorta D. Simmons D.L. Luk K.-C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6715-6719Google Scholar, 8Martins-Green M. Tilley C. Schwarz R. Hatier C. Bissell M.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 739-752Google Scholar, 9Gonneville L. Martins T.J. Bedard P.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1825-1833Google Scholar). Because thrombin is mitogenic for fibroblasts, we expected that stimulation of the 9E3 protein by thrombin occurs via the same mitogenic pathway. To test this possibility, we plated CEFs in serum-free medium, added thrombin at 10 units/ml, and fed them with serum-free medium plus 10 units/ml of thrombin every 24 h for a period of 4 days. Parallel cultures were treated with medium containing 5% donor calf serum and 1% chicken serum. At the end of this period the numbers of cells were counted and the 9E3 protein present in the supernatant for the final 24 h was analyzed by immunoblot with an antibody specific for the 9E3 protein (14Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Google Scholar). The results showed that although the total number of cells was approximately the same for both treatments (Fig. 1 A), the amount of protein secreted into the supernatant was at least 15-fold higher in the cells treated with thrombin (Fig. 1 B). For the same period of time, the amount of 9E3 protein produced by the CEFs treated with thrombin was similar to that produced by Rous sarcoma virus transformed CEFs (tCEFs), which express the 9E3 gene constitutively (Fig. 1 B). Our observations at the protein level were confirmed by analysis of the mRNA under the same conditions (Fig. 1 C); the level of the protein in cells with the various treatments correlates well with levels of mRNA under the same conditions. To determine if the stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin is via the proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin receptor, we treated qcCEFs, which do not express 9E3, with the humanthrombin receptor derivedpeptide (TRDP), which can activate proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin much like thrombin (50Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ihii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Naneviczz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Google Scholar). We found that this peptide could stimulate qcCEFs to express 9E3 to the same level as those stimulated by thrombin itself (Fig. 1 D). To further determine if the stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin is specific, we performed a dose-dependent study by treating qcCEFs with serum-free medium containing increasing doses of thrombin for a period of 24 h. We found maximum accumulation of the protein in the supernatant with a treatment of 9 units/ml or more of thrombin (Fig. 2 A). Using a dose of 9 units, we determined that the levels of the 9E3 protein present in the supernatant of treated cells increased with time up to 18 h with saturated levels after this time (Fig. 2 B). The lack of detection of 9E3 early in the time course study (Fig. 2 B) could simply be the result of the lack of time to accumulate detectable levels of the protein at the early time point. To determine the time span required for thrombin activation of 9E3, we treated qcCEFs with thrombin (9 units/ml) for shorter periods of time, then washed and incubated the cells with serum-free medium for 18 h to allow accumulation of the protein in the supernatant. We found that 1 min exposure of the cells to thrombin was sufficient to turn on the events leading to production of the 9E3 protein (Fig. 2 C). Our observation that activation of 9E3 by thrombin is independent of mitogenesis, coupled with a previous determination that activation of 9E3 by v-src is via a mitogenic pathway (51Spangler R. Joseph C. Qureshi S.A. Berg K.L. Foster D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7017-7021Google Scholar) raised the possibility that thrombin and the oncogene might activate 9E3 via different signal transduction pathways. If so, when added together, they should stimulate an additive effect on the expression of 9E3. To test this possibility, we treated tCEFs with thrombin and analyzed them for both protein (Fig. 3 A) and mRNA (Fig. 3 B) and observed that thrombin and v-src have additive effects. These results suggest that thrombin activates 9E3 by a pathway independent of that turned on by v-src (which involves activation of PKC by the v-src oncogene) (51Spangler R. Joseph C. Qureshi S.A. Berg K.L. Foster D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7017-7021Google Scholar) but do not preclude the possibility that it could be a superactivation of the same pathway involving PKC. Thrombin is known to stimulate several signal transduction pathways resulting in activation of a variety of genes and leading to many different biological responses. The pathway stimulated by thrombin that activates PKC involves activation of Gq,11which activates phospholipase Cβ that, in turn, cleaves phosphatidylinositol phosphate into IP3 and diacylglycerol. The latter activates PKC by interacting directly with this kinase, whereas IP3interacts with its receptor, present in the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in intracellular Ca2+ release. To determine if PKC is involved in the stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin, we treated qcCEFs with OAG (oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol), an analogue of diacylglycerol that activates PKC directly (52Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Google Scholar), and found that OAG did not stimulate the production of the 9E3 protein (Fig. 4 A). To further these studies, we treated qcCEFs with calphostin C (Fig. 4 B), a specific inhibitor of PKC (53Iorio P. Gresele P. Stasi M. Nucciarelli F. Vezza R. Nenci G.G. Goracci G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 244-248Google Scholar) and found that this treatment did not inhibit stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin but instead it potentiated thrombin stimulation. Furthermore, when we treated qcCEFs with the broad spectrum Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors H7 and staurosporine (53Iorio P. Gresele P. Stasi M. Nucciarelli F. Vezza R. Nenci G.G. Goracci G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 244-248Google Scholar, 54Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Martin H.A. Kramer L.B. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Grant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8275-8284Google Scholar), we found that both inhibitors potentiated the stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin and that staurosporine by itself stimulated 9E3 expression (Fig. 4 B). In addition, we also found that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ by treatment with the ionophores ionomycin and A23187 (Fig. 4 C) had little effect on the levels of the 9E3 protein and did not enhance that stimulated by thrombin. These results suggest that the signaling pathways activated by Gq,11, and in particular the activation of PKC, do not play a major role in stimulation of 9E3 by thrombin. Thrombin is also known to interact with its receptor and activate Gi or Gs, and more recently it has also been shown to activate tyrosine phosphorylation (55Grabham P. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 583-591Google Scholar). We treated qcCEFs with thrombin in the presence of inhibitors or activators of the key players involved in these signaling pathways. Activation of the Gipathway leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decrease in cAMP production, and therefore lack of activation of PKA. To test if Gi is involved, we used pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates this G-protein, inhibiting it permanently (56Hewlett E.L. Roberts C.O. Wolff J. Manclark C.R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 137-144Google Scholar, 57Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of Gi by pertussis toxin failed to inhibit, and in fact potentiated, the stimulation of 9E3 expression by thrombin (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of cells with HA1004 and H89, inhibitors of PKA and other Ser/Thr kinases (58Crowley M.R. Fineman J.R. Soifer S.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 23: 806-813Google Scholar, 59Findik"
https://openalex.org/W2061970288,"In this paper, we show that the 36–45 surface-exposed sequence WYKAELNGKD of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) N-SH3 domain inhibits the interaction between Grb2 and a 97-kDa protein identified as dynamin. Moreover, the peptide GPPPQVPSRPNR from dynamin also blocks the binding of dynamin to the proline-rich recognition platform of Grb2. Mutations in the 36–45 motif show that Glu-40 is critical for dynamin recognition. These observations were confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, carried out using ER 22 cells. It was also observed that the proline-rich peptide from dynamin was unable to dissociate the Grb2·Sos complex, whereas the proline-rich peptide from Son of sevenless (Sos) inhibited Grb2·dynamin interaction. A time-dependent stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressing clone 22 (ER 22) cells by epidermal growth factor resulted in an immediate increase of the Grb2·Sos complex and a concomitant decrease in Grb2·dynamin. This suggests that the recruitment of Grb2·Sos to the membrane, triggered by epidermal growth factor stimulation, activates the Ras-dependent signaling and simultaneously enhances free dynamin levels, leading to both receptor internalization and endocytotic processes.

Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), 1The abbreviations used are: Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Sos, Son of sevenless; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ER22, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressing clone 22.1The abbreviations used are: Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Sos, Son of sevenless; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ER22, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressing clone 22. constituted by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains surrounding one SH2 domain, is an example of adaptors transferring information between extracellular messages monitored by membrane-bound receptors and intracellular transducers (1Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Google Scholar). By its SH2 domain, Grb2 recognizes phosphotyrosine residues of stimulated growth factor receptors, such as the EGF receptor, either directly or through additional adaptors such as SH2 domain containing adaptor protein (Shc) (2Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Google Scholar), whereas by its SH3 domains, Grb2 interacts with several cytosolic proteins such as Sos (Son of sevenless) the exchange factor of Ras (3Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed on stimulated and unstimulated cells have shown that Grb2·Sos exists as a preformed complex (4Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Google Scholar). Recruited to the cell membrane upon stimulation, the Grb2·Sos complex promotes Ras-GTP formation, which in turn is able to bind Raf and thus to induce the activation of transcription factors such as fos, jun, or myc, through a cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinase stimulation (5Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Google Scholar, 6Lowe P.N. Skinner R.H. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 109-123Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown the importance of Grb2 SH3 domains, since mutations P49L and G203R localized in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, were shown to block the DNA synthesis induced by activation of the Ras pathway (7Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar, 8Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of the Ras-activated pathway, triggered by stimulation of the receptor, remain unclear. It has been shown that the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases promotes Sos phosphorylation, which in turn could uncouple the mitogenic signal through dissociation of either Grb2·Sos or Grb2·receptor complexes (9Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Google Scholar, 10Buday L. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331Google Scholar, 11Waters S.B. Holt H. Ross S.E.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426Google Scholar). The regulation of the activation and inactivation of the Ras-dependent signaling pathway could also occur directly by changes in the levels of the complexes formed between Grb2 and Sos or other ligands. Indeed, through its SH3 domains, Grb2 was reported to interact with different proteins such as dynamin, a GTPase protein involved in the endocytosis process (13Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Google Scholar, 14Van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmidt S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether multiple interactions involving Grb2 proceed as concomitant or successive events in the interruption of the mitogenic signal. The Grb2 N-SH3 domain has been shown (15Goudreau N. Cornille F. Duchesne M. Parker F. Tocqué B. Garbay C. Roques B.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 898-907Google Scholar, 16Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Tsuchiya S. Ogura K. Nagata K. Ishii S. Mandiyan V. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 891-897Google Scholar, 17Wittekind M. Mapelli C. Farmer B.T., II Suen K.L. Goldfarb V. Tsao J. Lavoie T. Barbacid M. Meyers C.A. Mueller L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13531-13539Google Scholar) to interact with VPPPVPPRRR, a proline-rich peptide of the C-terminal part of Sos, which has the highest measured affinity for Grb2 (8Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 18Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Google Scholar). In this complex, the side chains of Pro-2 and Val-5 in VPPPVPPRRR interact with aromatic residues that constitute a hydrophobic recognition platform, highly conserved in all the SH3 domains known to bind proline-rich peptides (19Musacchio A. Gibson T. Lehto V.P. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 55-61Google Scholar). In contrast, this aromatic hydrophobic platform has been shown by NMR to be lacking in the structure of the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar), a GTPase-activating protein that behaves as a negative regulator (21Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A.F. Schaber M.D. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Google Scholar) or as an effector (22Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocqué B. Science. 1993; 259: 525-528Google Scholar) of Ras. Accordingly, no proline-rich peptide has yet been found to interact with GAP SH3. However, in this SH3 domain, the peptide sequence 317–326 (WMWVTNLRTD), exposed at the surface (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar), was shown to play a critical role in the binding of the GAP SH3-binding protein (23Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Google Scholar). Based on these results, the potential occurrence of two different binding sites on SH3 domains had been proposed (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar), an hypothesis, supported by mutational analyses carried out on the SH3 domain of Src (24Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Google Scholar). Accordingly, Schumacher et al. (25Schumacher T.N.M. Minor Jr., D.L. Mihollen M.A. Burgess M.W. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1854-1857Google Scholar) have recently shown that the Src SH3 domain interacts with a cyclic peptide through a binding process involving both the hydrophobic platform and other exposed amino acids such as Trp-119 and Leu-120, which belong to the corresponding region on the 317–326 peptide in GAP-SH3. A similar recognition mode, involving a motif corresponding to the 317–326 sequence of GAP, seems to occur for the binding of the Vav C-SH3 domain with the protein Ku 70 (26Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Google Scholar). All these binding motifs are located on a β-strand exposed at the surface of the SH3 domains. This is also the case for the sequences 36–45 of Grb2 N-SH3 (WYKAELNGKD) and 194–203 (WWGACHNGQT) of Grb2 C-SH3 domains. Interestingly, whereas the 36–45 peptide is accessible, the 194–203 fragment of Grb2 was shown by crystallographic analysis to interact with the N-terminal SH3 domain (27Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Fromage N. Arnoux B. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Google Scholar). All these results prompted us to investigate the possible existence of a protein target interacting with the sequence 36–45 (WYKAELNGKD) of the Grb2 N-SH3 domain. We show in this paper that this peptide is able to block the interaction of Grb2 with a p97 protein, identified as dynamin, whereas the analog, where Glu is replaced by Thr, cannot block this interaction, illustrating its selectivity. Moreover, competition experiments using extracts from ER 22 cells overexpressing the EGF receptor showed that a proline-rich sequence derived from Sos displaces the Grb2·dynamin complex, whereas the proline-rich sequence of dynamin, shown to interact with Grb2, is unable to displace the Grb2·Sos complex. These results and those obtained from the stimulation of ER 22 cells by EGF suggest that the formation of the Grb2·Sos complex might occur at the membrane at the expense of the Grb2-dynamin pool. The free dynamin thus generated might interact with other SH3 domain containing proteins, such as amphiphysin, which has been shown to be involved in neuronal receptor endocytosis (28Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. de Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Google Scholar). The anti-Sos (Sos 1 and Sos 2, IgG3 mAb) and anti-dynamin (IgG1 mAb) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Hybridolab Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). The polyclonal anti-Grb2 used for immunoprecipitation studies was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA sequences corresponding to Grb2 (residues 1–210) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector pGEX2T at BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Bacteria transformed with the recombinant plasmids were grown, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and disrupted by sonication (29Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Google Scholar). The GST-SH3 fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography onto glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) followed by elution with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis. The protected peptide chains were assembled according to the stepwise solid phase method of Merrifield (45Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2152Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer with hydroxybenzotriazole/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as coupling reagents. Synthetic peptides corresponding to WYKAELNGKD, WYKATLNGKD, WMWVTNLRTD, GPPPQVPSRPNR, and VPPPVPPRRR were synthesized using 10 eq of amino acids, whereas SH3 domains were synthesized using 20 eq, as described previously (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a C4 (for Grb2 N-SH3 domain) or a C8 (for deca- and dodecapeptides) Vydac 5-mm column diameter (220 × 10 mm) and a linear gradient of B (where A is trifluoroacetic acid 0.1% and B is CH3CN 70%, trifluoroacetic acid 0.09%) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with detection at 214 nm. The identity of the peptides was checked by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Adherent ER 22 cells (hamster fibroblasts overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor, a kind gift from Dr. J. Pouyssegur, France) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing the antibiotic G418 (200 μg/ml) and 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (23Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence and were serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 9.6 mmNa2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and then scraped from the plate in 1 ml of HNTG lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad microassay). Cells were grown to confluence and then serum-starved for 24 h. They were then stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 1, 5, 15, or 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, at room temperature (30Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Google Scholar), and immediately washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and lysed as described above. Glutathione-agarose beads (150 μl containing 60 μg of GST fusion protein) were mixed with lysates (5 mg of cellular proteins), with or without inhibitor peptide, and rocked at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed 4 times with HNG (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2% of Triton X-100. Affinity precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and revealed either by far Western blot or by immunoblotting experiments. Whole cell lysates (3 mg) were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Grb2 was then immunoprecipitated by incubation of the supernatant with 4 μg of a Grb2 polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C, in the presence or absence of the peptide (1.5 mm). The resultant immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with HNTG, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The immune complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were then subjected to Western blot as described above. Dynamin was purified from rat brains by a novel purification procedure (31Montiel J.L. Cussac D. Cornille F. Vidal M. Garbay C. Roques B.P. Protein Pept. Lett. 1997; 38: 1389-1392Google Scholar). 10 mg of the Grb2 N-SH3 domain (15Goudreau N. Cornille F. Duchesne M. Parker F. Tocqué B. Garbay C. Roques B.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 898-907Google Scholar) were coupled to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), according to Hermanson et al. (32Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Smith P.K. Immobilized Affinity Ligand Techniques. Academic Press Inc., New York1992: 53-56Google Scholar) (coupling yield, 92%). 30 μl of Grb2 N-SH3 beads were then preincubated, in the presence or absence of inhibitory peptides, overnight at 4 °C in 300 μl of PBS buffer. 3 μg of purified dynamin were then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with PBS. Affinity precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling SDS sample buffer for 5 min. After SDS-PAGE separation and transfer, protein was detected by an anti-dynamin Western blot. As already described (23Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Google Scholar) precipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Nonspecific binding to the filters was blocked by adding 2% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were then incubated with GST-Grb2 proteins in blocking buffer for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 bound proteins were detected by successive incubations with the anti-GST mAb (0.25 μg/ml), peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and revealed by the ECL method (Amersham Corp.). Precipitated proteins were separated and transferred onto PVDF membrane as described for far Western analysis. After blocking, the membrane was incubated with mAb antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h. After successive washes in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, bound proteins were detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and revealed as described above by the ECL method. Band intensity was quantified using a Bio-Profil V6.0 Vilber-Lourmat (Marne la Vallée, France). Data are the mean values (± S.E.) of three independent assays. In the case of immunoprecipitation, the Western blot against Grb2 was carried out using an anti-mouse Fc antibody to avoid possible cross-reaction with the low chain of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. In all experiments, Grb2 amounts were constant (data not shown). To investigate the hypothesis of the presence of a second binding site on N-SH3 Grb2, the 36–45 peptide (WYKAELNGKD) corresponding to the 317–326 sequence of GAP was synthesized and tested for its ability to inhibit potential interactions between Grb2 and putative target proteins. The lysates of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ER 22 cells) were used for this purpose. To avoid SH2 interactions, lysates of cells in the G0 phase were incubated with GST-Grb2 loaded onto agarose-glutathione beads, in the presence or absence of the 36–45 peptide at a final concentration of 500 μm. The proteins complexed with Grb2 were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and revealed by a far Western blot with GST-Grb2 as probe. Lane 1 of Fig. 1 A shows different bands corresponding to protein ligands of Grb2 in ER 22 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lane 2), peptide-(36–45) from the Grb2 N-SH3 domain significantly reduced the interaction of Grb2 with only one protein with a mass of 97 kDa. Among the target proteins of the SH3 domains of Grb2, Vav (33Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Schweighoffer F. Bismuth G. Camonis J. Tortorelo M. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669Google Scholar) and dynamin (34Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Google Scholar) have molecular masses ranging from 95 to 100 kDa. Since Vav is exclusively present in hematopoietic cells and dynamin is ubiquitous, the proteins complexed to Grb2 in ER 22 cells lysate were analyzed using an anti-dynamin antibody as a probe. Western blots (Fig. 1 B) showed that the band at 97 kDa (lane 1) corresponds mainly to dynamin. Moreover, peptide-(36–45) from Grb2 N-SH3 at 500 μm strongly inhibited the interaction between dynamin and Grb2 (lane 4), whereas neither the peptide-(317–326) from the GAP SH3 domain (lane 3) nor the mutated E40T peptide-(36–45) (lane 5) were able to modify the level of the Grb2·dynamin complex. The same quantity of GST-Grb2, evaluated by Western blot using an anti-GST antibody, was used in both of these experiments. Therefore, the decreased intensity of the p97 signal following addition of peptide-(36–45) from Grb2 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2 or Fig. 1 B, lane 4) can be attributed to the inhibition of dynamin binding to Grb2 SH3 domains. Until now, the formation of these complexes has been essentially attributed to the binding of proline-rich motifs with the hydrophobic recognition platform of SH3 domains (34Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Google Scholar, 35Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Google Scholar). The present results show that dynamin interacts with Grb2 through a dual recognition process also involving the 36–45 region of the N-SH3 domain. The C-terminal region of Sos contains four conserved proline-rich motifs among which VPPPVPPRRR, corresponding to amino acids 1149–1158, was shown to have the highest affinity for Grb2 and in particular for its N-SH3 domain (8Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 18Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Google Scholar). Similarly, in the C-terminal domain of dynamin, the peptide GPPPQVPSRPNR (amino acids 827–838) was reported to bind Grb2 SH3 domains (34Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Google Scholar, 36Scaife R. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Margolis R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2574-2582Google Scholar). The two proline-rich peptides were therefore tested as competitors for the interactions involving Grb2 and either Sos or dynamin on the ER 22 cells lysate. The complexes were revealed by Western blots using anti-Sos and anti-dynamin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 1, GST-Grb2, loaded onto glutathione-agarose beads, binds Sos and dynamin. Peptide GPPPQVPSRPNR from dynamin, at 500 μm, prevented the interaction between Grb2 and dynamin and very weakly (less than 10%) the interaction between Grb2 and Sos (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). In contrast, at the same concentration, the peptide VPPPVPPRRR from Sos completely inhibited the formation of the complexes formed between Grb2 and either Sos or dynamin (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Moreover, the peptide-(36–45) from Grb2 N-SH3 reduced the Grb2·dynamin interaction without modifying the Grb2·Sos binding (lane 4). The easier displacement of dynamin from its complex with GST-Grb2 by VPPPVPPRRR is in agreement with the stronger affinity of this proline-rich peptide for Grb2 N-SH3 (Kd = 4 μm), as compared with that of GPPPQVPSRPNR (Kd ∼300 μm), measured by fluorescence (data not shown). These results are also in favor of an additional role for the region of Grb2 N-SH3 encompassing the sequence 36–45 in the specific recognition with dynamin. This was confirmed by the dose-dependent selective blockade of the formation of the Grb2·dynamin complex by the 36–45 peptide (Fig. 2 B). To confirm the dual recognition mode of Grb2 N-SH3 with dynamin, similar experiments were performed using purified dynamin. The synthetic N-SH3 domain was loaded onto CNBr-Sepharose beads, which were further incubated in PBS buffer with purified dynamin, in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitory peptides. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both the proline-rich peptide from dynamin and the 36–45 peptide from Grb2 were able to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, the Grb2 N-SH3·dynamin interaction. The occurrence of two different binding components on Grb2 N-SH3 for dynamin recognition was confirmed by competition experiments with 300 μm Grb2 36–45 peptide (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) or 100 μm GPPPQVPSRPNR from dynamin (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) (two sub-effective doses, compared with the control lane 1). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 B, lane 4, the association of the two peptides produced a clear synergistic inhibition of the complex. To confirm the existence of a dual recognition process between Grb2 N-SH3 and dynamin at the cellular level, competition experiments were performed on ER 22 cells. Cellular lysates in G0 phase were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Grb2 antibody, in the presence or absence of inhibitory peptides at 1.5 mm. Immunoprecipitated proteins were revealed by Western blotting, using anti-Sos or anti-dynamin antibodies (Fig. 4). In the absence of competitor peptides, Grb2 clearly co-immunoprecipitated with both Sos and dynamin (lane 1). In the presence of the 36–45 peptide (lane 3), only Grb2·dynamin immunoprecipitation was partially inhibited (50% as compared with controls). As shown in lane 2, the 36–45 peptide containing the E40T mutation was unable to modify Grb2·dynamin interactions. This is in accordance with results showing that the E40T mutated N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 does not recognize dynamin with a high affinity. 2N. Goudreau, E. Gincel, M. Vidal, D. Cussac, F. Cornille, B.-P. Roques, and C. Garbay, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, the proline-rich peptide derived from dynamin GPPPQVPSRPNR inhibited the Grb2·dynamin complexation but only very slightly the Grb2·Sos interaction (lane 4), whereas VPPPVPPRRR from Sos totally inhibited both Grb2-Sos and Grb2·dynamin interactions (lane 5). The demonstration that the proline-rich peptide from Sos blocks the formation of the Grb2·dynamin complex, whereas the proline-rich peptide from dynamin is unable to inhibit the Grb2·Sos recognition process at the cellular level (Figs. 2 and 4), raises the question of the biological relevance of these results. Indeed, dynamin seems to play a crucial role in endocytosis and is involved in membrane-bound receptor internalization, through formation of clathrin-coated pits (37Liu J.P. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607Google Scholar), thus constituting a possible Ras signaling regulatory pathway. In the ER 22 cells used in this study, preformed complexes between Grb2 and dynamin were easily demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation with Grb2 antibodies (Figs. 4and 5). Such preformed complexes have already been observed in unstimulated Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the insulin receptor (38Ando A. Yonezawa K. Gout I. Nakata T. Ueda H. Hara K. Kitamura Y. Noda Y. Takenawa T. Hirokawa N. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3033-3038Google Scholar) but not in unstimulated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing the EGF receptor (39Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Google Scholar). These complexes were reported to constitute potential storage forms of Grb2 (1Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Google Scholar). Grb2 immunoprecipitation experiments on ER 22 cells at different EGF stimulation times were therefore performed (Fig. 5). Interestingly, after 1 min of EGF stimulation, a large increase in the levels of the Grb2·Sos complex was observed, with a concomitant decrease of the Grb2·dynamin complex of approximately 40% (Fig. 5, A and B). A slow restoration of the initial complexes appeared to occur after 30 min of EGF stimulation. These results suggest a displacement of the Grb2·dynamin complex by Sos in vivo and concomitantly a release of free dynamin. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of protein target(s) able to recognize the 36–45 peptide from the Grb2 N-SH3 domain, which is located at the surface of the protein (15Goudreau N. Cornille F. Duchesne M. Parker F. Tocqué B. Garbay C. Roques B.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 898-907Google Scholar, 27Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Fromage N. Arnoux B. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Google Scholar) as are the corresponding motifs in other SH3 domains such as GAP (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar) or Src (40Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Google Scholar). We clearly show here, in addition to the hydrophobic proline-rich recognition platform, that the 36–45 sequence of Grb2 N-SH3 (WYKAELNGKD) plays a critical role in the interaction with dynamin. Indeed the 36–45 peptide alone was able to inhibit dose-dependently the formation of complexes between dynamin and Grb2 or its N-terminal SH3 domain. Furthermore, illustrating the specificity of the interaction, the nature of the peptide sequence also seems to be important, since the replacement of the aspartic acid in position 40 by a threonine resulted in a peptide unable to compete for the Grb2·dynamin complex. In accordance, Grb2 N-SH3 domain mutated as E40T, while keeping similar capacity to bind Sos, shows a strongly decreased capacity to recognize dynamin.2 Moreover, recent results obtained in our laboratory by using plasmon surface resonance have shown that while Grb2 or its mutant P206L in the C-terminal SH3 have similar affinities for dynamin (Kd values of 20 nm), the P49L mutant, characterized by a disruption of the β-barrel structure of the N-terminal SH3 domain, has lost its affinity for dynamin.2 These data support the essential role played by the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 in the binding to dynamin. Thus, the capacity of WYKAELNGKD from Grb2 or the proline-rich peptide from dynamin to inhibit the Grb2·dynamin interaction and the synergistic effect of these two peptides (Fig. 3 B) demonstrate that they constitute two essential structural parameters in the Grb2·dynamin recognition. In addition, it is noteworthy that regions corresponding to the peptide-(36–45) from Grb2 in GAP, Src, and Vav SH3 domains seem also to be involved in protein recognition (20Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Fromage N. Tocqué B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Google Scholar, 25Schumacher T.N.M. Minor Jr., D.L. Mihollen M.A. Burgess M.W. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1854-1857Google Scholar, 26Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Google Scholar). These results suggest that this accessible sequence located at the S4 β-strand of SH3 domains might constitute a potential second binding component involved in their recognition with some targets. Small proline-rich peptides have already been shown to have lower affinities than the corresponding entire proteins for SH3 domains. This is the case for the VPPPVPPRRR peptide from Sos, which has an affinity of around 4 μm for Grb2 (18Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Google Scholar), whereas the Grb2·Sos affinity has been reported to be in the nanomolar range (18Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Google Scholar). This difference was essentially attributed to thermodynamically unfavorable factors encountered during the binding processes of small flexible ligands (41Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J.R. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Google Scholar). In our case, the affinity of the proline-rich peptide derived from dynamin (GPPPQVPSRPNR), which had been shown to be selectively involved in the interaction with Grb2, is low (∼300 μm) as measured by fluorescence. Nevertheless, this peptide is able to inhibit the interaction of dynamin with the whole Grb2 protein or its N-SH3 domain. Thus, the existence of complementary interactions involving the 36–45 peptide is undoubtedly important to justify the 20 nm affinity that we have measured between dynamin and Grb2.2 The importance of such additional interactions has also been proposed, from thermodynamic measurements, to account for the binding affinity of the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase with the SH3 domain of Fyn (41Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J.R. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Google Scholar). Another interesting point is the demonstration that the proline-rich peptide from Sos blocks the formation of the Grb2·dynamin complex, while the proline-rich peptide from dynamin is unable to inhibit the Grb2·Sos recognition (Figs. 2 and 4), suggesting that an increasing concentration of Sos might locally displace the Grb2·dynamin complex in cells containing such a preformed complex (34Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Google Scholar, 38Ando A. Yonezawa K. Gout I. Nakata T. Ueda H. Hara K. Kitamura Y. Noda Y. Takenawa T. Hirokawa N. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3033-3038Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the kinetics of the evolution of the Grb2·Sos and Grb2·dynamin complexes, observed by EGF stimulation for ER 22 cells, as shown in Fig. 5. Indeed, it is conceivable that the increase of Grb2·Sos, concomitant with the decrease of Grb2·dynamin, might result, at least for a part, from the displacement of dynamin by an increase of Sos concentration, although the affinity of both Grb2·Sos and Grb2·dynamin are of the same order. Freeing dynamin from its complex with Grb2 might decrease its GTPase activity (13Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Google Scholar) and thus promote, as was already proposed (42Kelly R.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 116-117Google Scholar, 43Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. de Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-189Google Scholar), its accumulation under GTP-bound form around the neck of endocytotic vesicle budding, an early phase of the coated pit formation in receptor internalization. It is clear that, to prove such an assumption, it would be necessary to analyze more precisely the subcellular concentrations of these complexes and of the free proteins. Moreover, comparative immunofluorescence kinetic analyses of dynamin Grb2 and EGF receptor on ER 22 cells under EGF stimulation could be performed to dissect further the biology of their interactions. Nonetheless, these results provide evidence of an interconnection between both activation and deactivation of Ras pathways. Otherwise, several results suggest that dynamin might interact with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin, in connection with its role in endocytosis (28Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. de Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Google Scholar). Thus, it would be interesting to analyze whether in ER 22 cells an amphiphysin-like protein might be able to trap dynamin near the membrane and promote the receptor endocytosis (44Leprince C. Romero F. Cussac D. Vayssiere B. Berger R. Tavitian A. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15101-15105Google Scholar) or whether the Grb2·dynamin complex is directly involved in endocytosis as proposed by Wang and Moran (39Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Google Scholar). We thank Dr. D. Hutcheson and Dr. A. Beaumont for stylistic revision of the manuscript and C. Dupuis for expert manuscript drafting.

https://openalex.org/W2316574060,"The middle tumor antigen (middle-T) of mouse polyomavirus is responsible for the transforming potential of this virus. Middle-T has been shown to interact with a variety of cellular proteins known to mediate mitogenic signaling, like phosphatase-2A, Src family kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), the adapter protein SHC, phospholipase Cγ-1 and 14-3-3 family proteins. Association with SHC and PI 3-kinase, respectively, stimulates two independent signaling pathways that are indispensible for viral oncogenicity. SHC activates the Ras/MAPK pathway via Grb2/SOS resulting in changes in early gene expression. The downstream targets of PI 3-kinase are less well studied but seem to impinge on serum response factor (SRF) which is also involved in regulating early gene expression. Recently, the protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) has been identified as a target of PI 3-kinase in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Here we show that PKB/Akt is a target of wild type middle-T, but not of mutants unable to activate PI 3-kinase. These data were confirmed using inhibitors of PI 3-kinase as well as dominant-negative alleles of the catalytic subunit of this lipid kinase. In addition, mutants of PKB/Akt lacking a pleckstrin homology domain and therefore unable to bind to D3 phospatidylinositides were not activated by middle-T. Taken together these data suggest that middle-T activates PKB/Akt in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, direct association with D3 phosphatidylinositides seems to be essential for activation of PKB/Akt."

https://openalex.org/W2039076738,"The rat pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) genomic structure was characterized in this study. Northern blot analysis showed that PTTG mRNA is highly expressed in testicular cell lines. Transfection of testicular cell lines with fusion constructs containing various portions of PTTG5′-flanking sequences linked to luciferase showed that at least 745 base-pair (bp(s)) 5′-flanking sequences are required for PTTGtranscriptional activation. DNaseI footprinting assays indicated that nuclear protein(s) from testicular cell lines interacts withPTTG 5′-flanking sequence between −509 and −624 bp, including two consensus Sp1 binding sites. Western and Southwestern blot analysis showed that three nuclear proteins in addition to Sp1 protein specifically interact with this DNA sequence and that two of these proteins are testicular cell-specific. Deletion of this 115-bp sequence from PTTG promoter resulted in complete loss of promoter function. Site-directed mutagenesis within the Sp1 consensus sequences indicated that the Sp1 binding sites are not critical components of the enhancer sequence for PTTG trancriptional activation in testicular cell lines. Finally, the 115-bp enhancer sequence was shown to be able to activate transcription from a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that PTTGtranscriptional activation in testicular cell lines involves interactions of multiple nuclear factors with the PTTG 5′ enhancer sequence.

Recently, we have isolated and characterized a pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) 1The abbreviations used are: PTTG, pituitary tumor-transforming gene; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TK, thymidine kinase; AP, activation protein; EGR, early growth response. from rat pituitary tumor cell lines (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar). PTTG encodes a novel protein of 199 amino acids and does not contain any known functional motifs. Overexpression of PTTG protein in 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in cell transformation in vitro, and injection of transfected 3T3 cells into nude mice resulted in tumor formation, indicating that PTTG is a transforming gene (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar). In addition to pituitary tumor cell lines, rat PTTG mRNA is also expressed in a variety of tumor cell lines, including lung carcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and HeLa cell lines. 2L. Pei, unpublished data. However, among adult rat tissues, PTTG mRNA is only expressed in testis (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar), suggesting that PTTG may play a role in testicular biological functions. PTTG transcript in testis is shorter than that of tumor cells, indicating that PTTG mRNA is either differentially spliced or it is using an alternate promoter or an alternative polyadenylation signal. The pattern of expression exhibited by PTTG is similar to proto-oncogene c-mos and c-abl. Both also exhibit testis-specific transcripts (2Propst F. Rosenberg M.P. Oskarsson M.K. Russell L.B. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Nadeau J. Copeland N.G. Vande Would G.F. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 227-233Google Scholar). To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulatePTTG expression in testis and tumor cells, I have focused on characterizing the rat PTTG gene. I report here the isolation and structural characterization of the entire ratPTTG gene and its expression in different testicular cell lines. By transient transfection of fusion constructs containing various portions of the PTTG 5′-flanking region and luciferase gene into testicular cell lines, I have identified a potential enhancer sequence between −462 and −745 bp. I show by DNaseI footprint assays that nuclear protein(s) from testicular cells interacts with DNA sequences between −509 and −642 bp of PTTG gene. Using Western and Southwestern analysis, I show that four nuclear proteins, including Sp1 protein, specifically interact with this DNA sequence and that two of these proteins are specific to testicular cells. I demonstrate by mutagenesis studies that deletion of this binding site for multiple testicular proteins results in loss of PTTG transcriptional activation, whereas point mutations within the Sp1 binding sites do not reduce transcription remarkably. Finally, I show that the sequence between −509 and −624 bp is able to confer transcriptional activation to a heterologous promoter. These results indicate that the sequence between −509 and −624 bp constitutes the core enhancer that is responsible for PTTG transcriptional activation in testicular cell lines. A rat genomic library (using genomic DNA from Sprague-Dawley rat testis) in λDASH™vector (Stratagene) was screened using the rat PTTG cDNA (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar) as a probe. Southern blot analysis identified two SstI fragments that contain the entire PTTG gene and were subcloned into PGEM3Z (Promega) for further characterization. Dideoxy-DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Both strands of DNA were sequenced using either internal primers or sequencing subcloned fragments. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Phage DNA was isolated using the Qiagen lambda phage DNA isolation kit.

PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and were sequenced using PCR Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from rat testis (Leydig, germ, and Sertoli) and pituitary GH4 cell lines, using RNAeasy isolation kit (Qiagen), following manufacturer's instructions. Rat testis poly(A)+RNA was purchased from CLONTECH. A 533-bp fragment spinning +72 to −461 bp was synthesized by PCR and subcloned into TA vector (Invitrogen). The antisense probe was synthesized from T7 promoter using the MAXIscript™ kit (Ambion). RNA protection assays were performed with 20 μg of total RNA or 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and 105 cpm of the probe, using the RPA II™ ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion). A φX174 HinfI DNA marker was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. The RNase protection assay products were analysis on 6% sequencing gel alongside the labeled DNA marker and a DNA sequencing ladder. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA from each of the three testis cell lines was fractionated on 1% agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked. The membrane was hybridized with full-length PTTG cDNA probe in the Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) for 1 h at the 68 °C and washed according to manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 16 h. To construct promoter and reporter fusion constructs, different portions of the PTTG5′-flanking sequences were synthesized by PCR using conditions described above.

The PCR products were cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen). ASstI-XhoI fragment was isolated from the plasmid and cloned at the corresponding sites in the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). To clone the PTTG enhancer sequence in front of a heterologous promoter, the enhancer sequence was amplified by PCR using the following primers: P1, 5′-TCCGGGAGGGGGCGGTGGTTGAAAACTTCC-3′; P2, 5′-TCACCCAAGACTACGCCACCAACGACC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into TA vector, and the insert was excised by digesting the plasmid with SstI and EcoRV. The insert was clone at the SstI/SmaI site of the thymidine kinase (TK)-luciferase vector. Mouse testis germ GC2 and rat Leydig cell line were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.11 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of fusion construct DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (3Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation, cells were assayed for luciferase and CAT activities. Each construct was transfected using triplicate plates for each experiment, and each construct was tested in at least three independent experiments. In all experiments, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of TKCAT (thymidine kinase promoter and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase fusion gene) to monitor transfection efficiency. A negative control plasmid containing a promoterless luciferase gene (pGL3) and a positive control plasmid containing Rous sarcoma virus 3′ long terminal repeat promoter fused to luciferase were included in all experiments. Cell lysates were prepared by freezing and thawing cells in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8. Protein concentration was determined using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity were determined by adding 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) to the cell lysate (50 μg of protein) in assay buffer (4 mm ATP, 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Light emission was integrated over 15 s using a luminometer (Autolumat LB953). For CAT assays, 50 μg of cell lysate were incubated with 20 μl of 4 mmacetyl-CoA, 1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 90 min. CAT activity was determined by ascending chromatography on TLC plates and quantified using an Ambis Radioanalytic Imaging System (Ambis). Nuclear extracts were prepared from GC2 cells as described by Dignam et al. (4Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Emzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Google Scholar). The probe used in DNase I footprinting assays is the 366-bp PTTG5′-flanking sequence from −379 to −745 bp. To generate the probe, primer 5′-CAGTAGATTGGTGCCTCTGACT-3′ was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and was then used in PCR with downstream primer 5′-TCAGCAGCGATTTCGTACTTGGATTTTTTG-3′ and −745LUC as the template. 10,000 cpm of the probe was used in each reaction. Binding reactions were performed in 25 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) with 50 ng of purified Sp1 protein (Promega) or with increasing amounts of GC2 cell nuclear extracts. Competitor DNA was mixed with the probe before receptor addition. Binding was for 30 min at room temperature. DNase I digestion was carried out at room temperature for 1 min using 1–10 units of DNase I (Ambion), depending upon protein concentrations. Reactions were terminated by adding 30 μl of 2 × stop buffer containing 15 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Nucleic acids were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1), ethanol-precipitated, and electrophoresed on 6% sequencing gels alongside of a G+A DNA sequencing ladder. Cell nuclear extracts (50 μg) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel alongside a protein standards (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). The protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For the Western blot, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, and incubated with a affinity-purified polyclonal antibody corresponding to residues 520–538 of the human Sp1 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After incubating with the secondary antibody and washing, the signal was detected using ECL detection system (Amersham). For the Southwestern blot, the membrane was treated with decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.1875m) and prebound in 10 mmNa2(PO4), pH 7.4, 5% nonfat milk, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. Binding was performed at 4 °C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. 106cpm/ml of the above probe used for footprinting analysis was used. The membrane was washed twice for 30 min in the binding buffer less single-stranded DNA at 4 °C and exposed to x-ray films for 2 h. The deletion mutant of the PTTGpromoter was generated using Exsite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR primers include the upstream primer, 5′-GGAAAAAAAAAAGCTTAGTAGTAGAGACCAACAT-3′ and the downstream primer, 5′-GGTGGCGTAGTCTTGGGTGAGTTTTAGCTGCGA-3′. The point mutations in the two consensus Sp1 binding sites were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenesis primers include Sp1MI5′, 5′-TTCCGGGATGGGGTCGTGGTTGAAAACTTCCG-3′; Sp1 MI3′, 5′-CGGAAGTTTTCAACCACGACCCCATCCCGGAA-3′; Sp1MII 5′, 5′-GACACTAGGCCCATCCCCCCATCGGATGGACC-3′; Sp1MII3′, 5′-GGTCCATCCGATGGGGGGATGGGCCTAGTGTC-3′. The double Sp1 mutant was generated using plasmid containing the first Sp1 site mutations as template and primers containing the second Sp1 site mutations in the PCR reaction. All mutants were sequenced to confirm the desired mutations. The ratPTTG gene was isolated from a genomic library. The exon-intron boundaries and the size of introns were determined by PCR, using primers derived from PTTG cDNA sequence (see “Materials and Methods”) to synthesize DNA from phage DNA. The size of the introns were determined by subtracting exon sequences from each PCR fragment (Fig. 1). The exon-intron boundaries were sequenced, and all the exon/intron splice junctions of PTTG gene showed the characteristic splice site consensus sequence GTAG (Fig. 1). These results together with results from Southern blot analysis and restriction mapping indicated that the PTTG gene contains five exons separated by four introns ranging from 640 bp to 1.8 kilobase pairs. Fig. 2 depicts the genomic structure of the rat PTTG gene.Figure 2Schematic structure of the ratPTTG gene. On the top line, the ratPTTG gene is represented, with exons indicated asboxes. Selected restriction sites are also shown. On the lower line, the rat PTTG cDNA is shown for comparison. The coding region is darkly shaded, and the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions are not shaded. The position for the probe used in RNase protection assay is also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To map the transcription start site of the PTTG gene, a 533-bp fragment containing part of exon 1 was used to generate an antisense probe (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, hybridization of this probe to RNA derived from rat testis, testis Leydig, and pituitary GH4 cell lines results in a protected band of 71 bp (adjusted to reflect the mobility difference between RNA and DNA) in size, whereas no protected band was apparent when the probe was hybridized to yeast RNA. When the protection assay was performed alongside a sequencing ladder, the transcription start site was mapped to a thymidine residue, 44 bp upstream from the ATG initiation codon (Fig. 4).Figure 4Sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the the rat PTTG gene. The transcription start site is designated +1 and is shown in bold and double-underlined. The ATG initiation codon is boldly italicized and underlined. The potential TATA sequence is shown in a box. A overlapping binding site for AP-2 and EGR-1 is underlined by a dashed line. The consensus Sp1 binding sites are italicized and underlined. Three half-sites for nuclear receptors areunderlined, and a sequence resembling serum response element is double-underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequencing of about 2 kilobases of DNA sequences upstream from the transcription start revealed a potential TATA box sequence at −62 bp (Fig. 4). Potential binding sites for nuclear factors Sp1, AP-2, EGR-1, and nuclear receptor half sites were also present in this region (Fig. 4). Because testis is the only adult rat tissue that expressesPTTG mRNA, the expression of PTTG mRNA was examined in cell lines representing its three major cell types. Fig. 5 shows that all three cell lines, including Leydig, Sertoli, and germ (GC2) cells expressedPTTG mRNA to high levels. These cell lines provide a convenient tool to study transcriptional regulation of PTTGin the testicular cell culture system. To identify the DNA sequences involved in transcriptional regulation of the PTTG gene in testicular cells, various portions of the PTTG 5′-flanking region were cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into testis germ GC2 and Leydig cells. Constructs beginning at −1779, −1530, −1315, −1054, −745, −462, and −194 bp relative to the transcription start site were tested. The downstream boundary of each construct was located at +43 bp relative to the start site of transcription. As shown in Fig. 6, constructs containing up to 462 bp of PTTG upstream sequences were not able to induce luciferase activity significantly over a promoterless control in GC2 cells (germ cells). However, construct containing 745 bp of the PTTG 5′-flanking region induced luciferase activity approximately 43-fold over control. The luciferase activity reached maximal (79-fold over control) with the construct containing 1,054 bp of the PTTG 5′ sequences. Inclusion of more upstream sequences resulted in a slight reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. 6, constructs −1315LUC, −1530LUC, and −1779LUC). Similar results were obtained when these fusion constructs were transfected into Leydig cells (Fig. 6), although the overall induction of luciferase activity was lower than that of the GC2 cells. These results indicate that a minimal 745 bp of the 5′-flanking sequences are required for transcriptional activation of PTTG in testicular germ and Leydig cells and that a transcriptional enhancer sequence is present between −462 and −745 bp. The above cell transfection data indicates that a potential transcriptional enhancer sequence is present between −462 and −745 bp of the PTTG 5′-flanking region. To determine whether any testicular cell nuclear proteins specifically interact with the DNA sequences in this region, DNaseI footprinting assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 7, panel A (plus strand), a footprint between −509 and −624 bp on the plus strand was present when GC2 nuclear extracts was added. The protection from DNaseI became more evident with increasing amounts of GC2 nuclear extracts, and the protection was competed by the unlabeled homologous DNA fragment. When purified Sp1 protein was used in the assay, the footprints were confined to the two consensus Sp1 binding sequences between −638 and −624 bp and between −572 and −551 bp (Fig. 7, panel A). Similar results were observed when the minus strand DNA was labeled (Fig. 7, panel B). These results suggest that GC2 cell nuclear protein(s), in addition to Sp1, specifically binds to PTTG 5′-flanking region between −509 and −624 bp and that the interaction between these proteins and the DNA sequence may result in transcriptional activation of PTTG gene in testis germ cells. To characterize these proteins further, Western and Southwestern blot analysis were performed using GC2 cell nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 8, panel A, anti-human Sp1 antibody detected a single protein of about 95 kDa in GC2 nuclear extracts, corresponding to the Sp1 protein in these cells. When the membrane was incubated with the DNA probe for footprint analysis, four proteins were detected (Fig. 8, panel B, lane 3). The largest protein (about 95 kDa) corresponds to Sp1 protein; three other proteins of about 35, 46, and 60 kDa were also detected by this probe, and the signal of these proteins was stronger than that of Sp1 (Fig. 8,panel B, lane 3). To determine whether any of these three proteins are testicular cell-specific, nuclear extracts from fibroblast and epithelial cell lines were used in Southwestern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, the probe detected three proteins from these cell lines (Fig. 8, panel B, lanes 1 and 2). Two of these proteins corresponded to Sp1 and the 35 kDa protein, and the third protein was about 50 kDa. These results indicate that at least four nuclear proteins in the GC2 cell interact with PTTG 5′-flanking sequences between −509 and −624 bp and that the 46 and 60 kDa proteins are specific to GC2 cells. To determine whether the binding site for multiple testicular nuclear proteins is responsible for PTTG transcriptional activation, the DNA sequence between −509 and −624 bp was deleted from the fusion construct −745LUC. As shown in Fig. 9, when transiently transfected into GC2 cells, the luciferase activity of the deletion mutant was reduced to background level, suggesting that the sequence between −509 and −624 bp constitutes the core enhancer sequence that is critical for PTTG transcriptional activation in testicular cell lines. To determine the role of Sp1 protein in PTTG transactivation, point mutations were made within the two consensus Sp1 binding sites in the core enhancer sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 9 shows that mutations within each individual Sp1 site resulted in a 20–40% reduction in luciferase activity. When both Sp1 sites were mutagenized, luciferase activity decreased to about 50% that of the wild type level (Fig. 9). However, the luciferase activity of the double Sp1 mutant was still 34-fold over the construct, in which the entire 115-bp core enhancer sequence was deleted. These results suggest that the Sp1 binding sites do not play a crucial role in PTTG transcriptional activation. To determine whether the 115-bp sequence in the PTTG 5′-flanking region is able to confer transcriptional activation to a heterologous promoter, this sequence was cloned in front of a minimal TK promoter linked to luciferase reporter gene (TKLUC) in both orientations. When transfected into GC2 cell, the enhancer sequence in either orientation induced a 10-fold increase in TK transcription (Fig. 10), suggesting that the PTTG enhancer was able to confer transcriptional activation to a heterologous promoter. The structural organization of the entire rat PTTG gene was characterized in this study. Previous study showed that PTTG transcript in testis is different in size from that of tumor cells (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar). In this study, the same transcription start site was observed in both normal testis and in testicular and pituitary cell lines, suggesting that the different transcript size in testis is not a result of using alternative promoters. Whether the different transcript size is a result of differential splicing or using an alternative polyadenylation site needs to be clarified in future studies. The testis commonly gives rise to transcripts that are differentially processed or are derived from alternate promoters, compared with somatic tissues (5Wolgemuth D.J. Engelmyer E. Duggal R.N.

Biol. 1989; 9: 4381-4389Google Scholar). For example, alternative transcriptional initiation gives rise to a different transcript encoding proopiomelanocortin in testis, whereas alternative splicing is responsible for the generation of testis-specific transcripts of prodynorphin and proenkephalin (13Garrett J.E. Collard M.W. Douglass J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4381-4389Google Scholar). The original PTTG cDNA was isolated from a rat pituitary somatotroph tumor cell line (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PTTG transcript is also present in many other immortalized and malignant cell lines I have examined, regardless of cell lineage (e.g. lymphoid, myeloid, mesenchymal, and epithelial). However, in rat adult tissues, PTTG displays a very selective pattern of expression. PTTG transcript is present only in testis but not in most adult tissues we have analyzed (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Google Scholar). This distinct expression pattern of PTTG mRNA is similar to several other genes including proto-oncogenes c-mos and c-abl (2Propst F. Rosenberg M.P. Oskarsson M.K. Russell L.B. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Nadeau J. Copeland N.G. Vande Would G.F. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 227-233Google Scholar) and PEM, a homeobox gene (14Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 451-455Google Scholar). Testis consists of multiple cell types, and PTTG mRNA is expressed to high levels in both germ (GC2) and supporting Sertoli and Leydig cell lines. Whether this expression pattern represents PTTG mRNA expression in intact testis will be determined by in situ hybridization in future studies. Transient transfection of testicular cell lines showed that PTTG transcriptional activation requires at least 745 bp of the 5′-flanking sequences. Although a TATA box-like sequence is present near the transcription start site, it is not sufficient for transcriptional activation of PTTG gene; sequences further upstream (i.e. 5′ of −462 bp) are required. Several transcription activator binding sites including AP-2 (15Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Google Scholar, 16Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar) and EGR-1 (17Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Google Scholar, 18Herschman H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 455-458Google Scholar) are present in this region. Both AP-2 and EGR-1 are inducible enhancers. AP-2 mediates transcriptional activation by cAMP and phorbol esters (16Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar). EGR-1 can be induced by a variety of stimuli and activates transcription of target genes whose products are required for mitogenesis and differentiation (17Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Google Scholar, 18Herschman H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 455-458Google Scholar, 19Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell.

Although neither AP-2 nor EGR-1 site seems to be involved in basal promoter activity of PTTG gene, their roles in hormonal or growth factor-induced transactivation will be investigated in the future. Results from transient transfection studies also indicated that a potent transcriptional enhancer is present between −462 and −745 bp of the PTTG. There are two consensus Sp1 binding sites in this region. Sp1 is an ubiquitously expressed transactivator that binds to GC box sequence and regulates basal transcription of a variety of housekeeping genes (21Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Google Scholar). Sp1 also plays a role in directing tissue-specific, hormonal, and developmental regulation of gene expression. Sp1 has been shown to regulate expression of erythroid (22Yu C.Y. Motamed K. Chen J. Bailey A.D. Chen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8907-8915Google Scholar)-, lymphocyte (23Spanopoulo E. Giguere V. Grosveld F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2216-2228Google Scholar)-, and monocyte (24Zhang D. Hetherington C.J. Tan S. Dziennis S.E. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Google Scholar)-specific genes and as a modulator of the retinoic acid/cAMP-dependent transcription of the tissue-plasminogen activator gene (25Darrow A.L. Rickles R.J. Pecorino L.T. Strickland S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5883-5893Google Scholar). DNaseI footprinting assays demonstrated that although purified Sp1 protein binds to its consensus binding sequence in this region, the region protected by testicular cell nuclear extracts is much larger, indicating that additional proteins in testicular cells other than Sp1 may interact with the DNA sequence. Western and Southwestern blot analysis showed that in addition to Sp1 protein, three distinct proteins of 35-, 46-, and 60-kDa also interacted with this DNA sequence and that the 46- and 60- kDa proteins were testicular cell-specific. These results support the observation from DNaseI footprint assays that multiple nuclear proteins interact with PTTG enhancer sequence and that the two testicular cell-specific proteins may play a role in testis-specific expression of the PTTG gene. Deletion of this multiple protein binding site completely abolished PTTG transcriptional activation in testicular cells, indicating that the DNA sequence between −509 and −624 bp constitutes the core enhancer sequence that interacts with multiple proteins to activate PTTG transcription. That this 115-bp sequence is a true enhancer was demonstrated further by its ability to activate transcription from a heterologous promoter in an orientation-independent manner. Regulation of gene expression by Sp1 through its interactions with transcription factors bound to adjacent cis-acting elements has been demonstrated. Sp1 has been found to interact with nuclear factor-kB (26Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Google Scholar), Ets (27Dittmer J. Gegonne A. Gitlin S.D. Ghysdael J. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21428-21434Google Scholar), and steroid receptors (28Schule R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Google Scholar, 29Muller M. Baniahmad C. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1498-1503Google Scholar). My results showed that point mutations within each individual or both Sp1 consensus sequences in the enhancer sequence did not have a remarkable effect on PTTG transcription, suggesting that the Sp1 binding sites are not critical for PTTG transcriptional activation; binding sites for other testicular nuclear proteins within the enhancer sequence are required. In summary, I have isolated and characterized the structure of the rat PTTG gene. I have also identified an enhancer element in the PTTG 5′-flanking region that is the binding site for multiple testicular nuclear proteins. The interaction of these proteins with PTTG promoter may activate its transcription in testicular cells. The author would like to thank Dr. Shlomo Melmed for his support."
https://openalex.org/W1994073412,"FRA3B at human chromosomal band 3p14.2 is the most active common fragile site in the human genome. The molecular mechanism of fragility at this region remains unknown but does not involve expansion of a trinucleotide or minisatellite repeat as has been observed for several of the cloned rare fragile sites. Deletions and rearrangements at FRA3B have been observed in a number of distinct tumors. The recently identified putative tumor suppressor gene FHIT spans FRA3B, and various groups have reported identifying deletions in this gene in different tumors. Using a high density of PCR amplifiable markers within FRA3B searching for deletions in the FRA3B region, we have analysed 21 tumor cell lines derived from renal cell, pancreatic, and ovarian carcinomas. We found a commonly deleted region in the renal cell and ovarian carcinoma cell lines located in the middle of an HPV16 viral integration site. Despite the presence of deletions in the FRA3B region in most of the cell lines, we did not detect alterations in FHIT exons in any of the cell lines examined. Thus, deletions of 3p14.2 in these carcinoma cell lines may simply reflect instability of the FRA3B region during tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2325425462,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a multifunctional factor that stimulates epithelial cell mitogenesis, motility, invasion, and morphogenesis. Its receptor is encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Several studies have suggested a role for MET as a dominant oncogene in tumor development and progression. Conversely, MET is located at a region on chromosome 7q31 frequently deleted in carcinomas, suggesting that recessive mutations in MET may exist in certain cancers. To facilitate a search for mutations in MET, we have obtained the intron-exon structure of the human MET gene. We present the genomic structure of the first member of the Met receptor family to be characterized. Interestingly, MET contains a large second exon of 1214 nucleotides. We show that this exon, containing the AUG for the Met receptor, is frequently skipped in normal human tissues and cell lines, and corresponds to a ubiquitously expressed 7 kb Met transcript. This transcript yields no detectable protein product in vivo. Thus, unlike other genes, in which alternative splicing often gives rise to proteins with distinct activities, exon-skipping of MET exon 2 is predicted to decrease the abundance of a Met mRNA encoding a functional Met receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2329549794,"A recent study has revealed that germline mutations of the down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) gene are a likely cause of a recessive intestinal absorption defect, congenital chloride diarrhea. This finding was in accordance with previous works showing that DRA encodes a sodium independent transporter for sulfate and oxalate. Although DRA was originally reported as a candidate tumor suppressor, these studies have questioned the relevance of DRA in cancer. To evaluate whether further studies on the role of DRA in tumorigenesis are still of interest, we examined whether individuals carrying germline DRA mutations have an excess of intestinal cancer. Cancer status of 229 members of 36 Finnish congenital chloride diarrhea families (44 homozygous patients, 70 heterozygous parents, and 115 grandparents at 50% risk of being a DRA mutation carrier) was checked at the Finnish Cancer Registry and the risk of intestinal cancer was found slightly elevated (standardized incidence ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.4 – 7.0, P<0.05). While this result does not unambiguously demonstrate an increased intestinal cancer risk in DRA mutation carriers, it should promote further studies to determine the possible role of DRA in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2330728275,"Exposure to ultraviolet radiation of solar light is responsible for inflammation, premature skin aging and is the main cause of human skin carcinogenesis. While the noxious consequences of U.V. exposure are known, the molecular events triggered by this radiation are poorly understood. We observed that U.V.-A and U.V.-B irradiation of human keratinocytes induces the activation of tyrosine kinase pathways leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. We also observed a stimulation of the Stress Activated Protein kinases (SAPKs), p38 and JNK, and an activation of the transcription factors AP-1 in response to U.V.-A and U.V.-B radiation. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrated that physiological U.V. doses are able to activate the Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, which could explain the activation of the Ternary Complex Factor. Thus, in human keratinocytes, solar U.V. light activates multiple signalling pathways that could be involved in skin inflammation following U.V.-induced skin injury or in U.V.-induced skin carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2326103497,"We replaced the transmembrane domain of the wild type murine PDGF beta receptor with that of p185neu*, the oncogenic form of p185neu, thereby generating a constitutively activated chimeric receptor PR/neu*. Unlike the wild type PDGF beta receptor or a chimeric receptor containing the transmembrane domain of wild type p185neu (PR/neu), PR/neu* induced morphologic transformation, focus formation, and tumorigenicity in mouse C127 fibroblasts. Expression of PR/neu* in mouse Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells, which normally depend on IL-3 for survival and sustained proliferation, induced proliferation in the absence of IL-3. The PR/neu chimera conferred limited IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. Only PR/neu* and not PR/neu displayed significantly increased levels of phosphotyrosine compared to the wild type PDGF receptor in C127 and Ba/F3 cells. In addition, PR/neu* immune complexes displayed increased levels of kinase activity in vitro compared to immune complexes of the wild type receptor. Furthermore, novel tyrosine phosphorylated proteins of approximately 60 kDa appeared to specifically complex with PR/neu*, suggesting that PR/neu* may activate distinct signaling pathways. We speculate that the p185neu* transmembrane domain in the context of the PDGF beta receptor facilitates receptor homodimerization, thereby inducing tyrosine autophosphorylation followed by association with important signaling substrates and transforming activity. Thus, PR/neu* should be a useful reagent for further characterizing activation and signaling mechanisms of the PDGF beta receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2092672528,"The MEN gene (also calledELL) encodes an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that has been implicated in t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) translocation in myeloid leukemias. The function of another elongation factor, elongin, is known to be inhibited by VHL tumor suppressor protein in vitro, suggesting the possible relationship of aberrant transcriptional elongation to oncogenesis. We overexpressed the MEN protein in Rat1 fibroblasts to evaluate its transforming activity. MEN-overexpressing cells acquired the capacity for anchorage-independent growth. In addition, the growth factor requirement was decreased in these cells. However, cells expressing a deletion mutant of MEN lacking the lysine-rich region did not exhibit such biological abilities. c-Fos protein expression and AP-1 activity were elevated in the MEN-expressing cells, which might be part of the mechanism responsible for the transformation. The c-fos mRNA, the expression of which is known to be regulated partly at the stage of transcriptional elongation, appeared earlier in the MEN-expressing cells than in cells transfected with an empty vector or the deletion mutant lacking the lysine-rich region after stimulation with epidermal growth factor. The RNA polymerase II elongation factor MEN may play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2163846483,"The HIV-1 inducer of short transcripts (IST) is an unusual promoter element that activates the synthesis of short transcripts from the HIV-1 promoter as well as from heterologous promoters. While the DNA sequences constituting IST have been characterized in some detail, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms underlying IST activity. Here, we describe a cell-free transcription assay that faithfully reproduces the synthesis of IST-dependent HIV-1 short transcripts. As in vivo, formation of these short transcripts requires a functional IST element and is repressed in the presence of the viraltrans-activator Tat. Short transcript and full-length transcript synthesis respond differently to variations in several reaction parameters, suggesting that the short and full-length transcripts are synthesized by transcription complexes with distinct biochemical properties. In particular, short transcript synthesis is resistant to the action of 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-benzimidazole, an inhibitor of transcript elongation. Formation of transcription complexes directed by the IST element may, therefore, not require the activity of a factor inhibited by 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-benzimidazole, such as the TFIIH-associated or pTEFb kinases.

The HIV-1 promoter directs the synthesis of two classes of RNAs that are initiated at the same transcription start site: full-length transcripts extending to the 3′-end of the transcription unit, and short, nonpolyadenylated RNAs of approximately 55–65 nucleotides in length. The relative levels of these two classes of transcripts are modulated by the viral transcriptional activator Tat, which activates synthesis of the full-length transcripts but down-regulates synthesis of the short transcripts (1Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Google Scholar, 2Ratnasabapathy R. Sheldon M. Johal L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2061-2074Google Scholar, 3Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 910-917Google Scholar). While full-length transcripts are probably synthesized by elongation-competent transcription complexes capable of traversing the entire transcription unit, short transcripts have been hypothesized to result from a separate class of transcription complexes incapable of efficient transcript elongation (2Ratnasabapathy R. Sheldon M. Johal L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2061-2074Google Scholar, 4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar). The biochemical nature of these putative elongation-incompetent transcription complexes is unknown, although the observation that mutations in the TATA box-binding protein have similar effects on the synthesis of short and full-length transcripts suggests that elongation-competent and elongation-incompetent transcription complexes do not differ in their use of TATA box-binding protein (5Pendergrast P.S. Morrison D. Tansey W.P. Hernandez N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5025-5034Google Scholar). In vivo, formation of the short transcripts depends on an unusual promoter element termed the inducer of short transcripts (IST) 1The abbreviations used are: IST, inducer of short transcripts; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-benzimidazole; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide. (2Ratnasabapathy R. Sheldon M. Johal L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2061-2074Google Scholar). Mutations in IST preferentially diminish the synthesis of the short transcripts but have a much lesser effect on the synthesis of the full-length transcripts. IST is a bipartite DNA element located predominantly downstream of the start site of transcription. Its major determinants are contained within positions −5 to +26, while sequences between +40 and +66 further augment its activity (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar, 6Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Google Scholar). Whereas the cis-acting sequences involved in IST function have thus been characterized in some detail, nothing is known about the mechanism of IST action. Here, we describe the establishment of a cell-free transcription assay that faithfully reproduces the synthesis of IST-directed HIV-1 short transcripts, as judged by the following two criteria: their synthesis (i) depends on an intact IST element, and (ii) is reduced upon the addition of the Tat protein. We show that synthesis of the short transcripts is inhibited by low concentrations of α-amanitin, indicating that they are the products of RNA polymerase II. Unlike formation of the full-length transcripts, formation of the short transcripts is resistant to addition of the nucleoside analog DRB, an inhibitor of various cellular protein kinases, suggesting that the short and long transcripts are synthesized by different RNA polymerase II transcription complexes. Plasmid pU3RIII/pUC119 (generously provided by M. Laspia, Dartmouth Medical School) contains HIV-1 sequences from −642 to +82 fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and is identical to pU3RIII (7Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 732-746Google Scholar) except that the vector backbone is derived from pUC119. The plasmids used in the cell-free transcription assays, pHIV-1/R/ML and derivatives, were constructed as follows. In the first step, the construct pU3RIII/pUC119, which contains twoHindIII sites, was subjected to a partial digestion withHindIII, the ends were filled-in with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, linear molecules were isolated on a gel and religated. A clone containing a singleHindIII site at position +78 relative to the HIV-1 transcription start site was isolated and named pU3RIII/pUC119/HindIII−. In the second step, the construct pU3RIII/pUC119/HindIII−, which contains two ScaI site and a unique HindIII site, was subjected to partial digestion with ScaI, followed by complete digestion with HindIII and phosphatase treatment. Linear molecules cleaved at the ScaI site at position −141 relative to the HIV-1 transcription start site and at the HindIII site at position +78 relative to the HIV-1 transcription start site were isolated. This vector was ligated with a fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction from the pHIV-1/R template (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar) and extending from the ScaI site at position −141 to the HindIII site at position +78. The resulting construct, pHIV-1/R/ML, was similar to the pU3RIII/pUC119 construct, except that the HIV-1 sequences contained an engineered XhoI site at position −10, and a point mutation at position +77 that disrupts the polyadenylation signal. This construct contains uniqueXhoI and AflII sites at positions −10 and +64, respectively, relative to the HIV-1 transcription start site. The derivatives of pHIV-1/R/ML were generated by replacing the XhoI-AflII fragment extending from −10 to +64 by the corresponding XhoI-AflII fragments derived from the various pHIV-1/R derivatives. Template plasmids for the synthesis of antisense riboprobes were constructed as follows. pHIV-1/R was digested with HindIII, which cleaves just proximal to a bacteriophage T3 promoter oriented in an antisense direction relative to the HIV-1 promoter, and the ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The linear plasmid was then digested withXhoI, which cuts at position −9 with respect to the HIV-1 transcription start site. Plasmids pHIV-1/R/ML or ABC/ML were cleaved with EcoRI at position +329 in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequences and the ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Subsequent digestion withXhoI liberated a 334-base pair fragment which was ligated into the XhoI/HindIII cut pHIV-1/R described above, resulting in plasmids pHIV-1/ML/T3/ΔEco and pABC/ML/T3/ΔEco. Fig. 1 B depicts maps of the above constructs and the position of the antisense RNA probe with respect to the HIV-1 transcription unit. Plasmid templates were linearized at the NcoI site at position +630 with respect to the HIV-1 transcription start site, phenol and phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in deionized sterile water at a concentration of 250 ng/μl. Unless otherwise indicated, transcription reactions (20 μl) contained 250 ng of linearized plasmid, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 3.75 mm creatine phosphate, 250 ng of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), 250 μm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 7.5 μm UTP, 10 μCi (165 nm) of [α-32P]UTP (1 μl of 3000 Ci/mmol in 50 mmTricine, pH 7.6, NEN Research Products), and 10 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract (80–120 μg of protein). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60–75 min with no preincubation or presynthesis. Transcription was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of stop buffer (330 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/100 μl of total yeast RNA, 50 μg/100 μl of proteinase K), and, after a further incubation of 10 min at room temperature, nucleic acids were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Precipitated nucleic acids were then redissolved in formamide loading buffer, resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat AR) for 2–24 h. In some experiments, α-amanitin or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-benzimidazole (DRB) were added to transcription reactions before the initiation of RNA synthesis, at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. When indicated, 0.5 μl of a buffer containing 250 ng/μl Tat protein, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol was added at the beginning of the transcription reaction (kindly provided by M. Laspia, Dartmouth School of Medicine). DRB was kept at −20 °C as a 1.6 mm solution in 10% ethanol, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9). Immediately prior to use, an aliquot was placed in a 65 °C water bath until it was completely dissolved and then kept in a 37 °C water bath to prevent precipitation. Two μl was added to the transcription reaction prior to the addition of template, resulting in a final concentration of 160 μm. The Ad2 VAI gene was transcribed as described previously (8Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1029-1040Google Scholar). Unlabeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) as follows. Template plasmids pHIV-1/ML/T3/ΔEco or pABC/ML/T3/ΔEco were linearized at the Asp-718 restriction site at position −146 with respect to the HIV-1 transcription start site, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and redissolved in sterile deionized water. Two μg of template were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 40 μl of in vitro RNA synthesis reaction containing 40 units of bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase, 4 mm each nucleotide triphosphate, 26 mm MgCl2, 40 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega). The resulting unlabeled RNAs were phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. RNA bands of the expected electrophoretic mobility were visualized by UV shadowing, excised from the gel, and eluted into a buffer containing 330 mm NaCl and 0.5% SDS by shaking overnight at 37 °C. They were then phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and redissolved in sterile deionized water at a concentration of 250 ng/μl. Phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated nucleic acids from a cell-free transcription reaction were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a buffer containing 50 mm NaAc (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 units of RNasin (Amersham), and 5 units of DNase I to remove the template DNA. The reaction was then phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, redissolved in 40 μl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 400 mm NaCl, 40 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 6.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 250 ng of unlabeled antisense riboprobe, and the nucleic acids were then hybridized at 46 °C overnight. RNase T1 digestion was performed by addition of 300 μl of a buffer containing 330 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 3000 units of RNase T1 and subsequent incubation at 30 °C for 60 min. The RNase was then inactivated by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% and 60 μg of proteinase K, and incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and protected RNAs were resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Plasmids pET7/R and pET7/ABC contain sequences from +1 to +82 of either pHIV-1/R or msABC (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar), respectively, cloned downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter into the StuI site of plasmid pET7 (9Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). Internally labeled short transcripts carrying wild-type HIV-1 sequences from +1 to +68 or the same sequence segment containing the ABC mutations were synthesized as follows. The template plasmids were linearized at the AflII site at position +64 of the HIV-1 insert, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and redissolved in sterile deionized water at a concentration of 250 ng/μl. 250 ng of template were then used in a standard bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in vitro RNA synthesis reaction according to the recommendations of the manufacturer, except that the reaction contained 6.25 μm [α-32P]CTP (NEN Research Products, 800 Ci/mmol) and 100 μm unlabeled CTP. The resulting transcripts were purified as described above, quantitated by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter, and redissolved in sterile deionized water at a concentration of 20,000 counts/μl. 40,000 counts of radiolabeled wild-type or ABC short transcripts were then added to reactions that were identical to a standard cell-free transcription reaction except that they did not contain [α-32P]UTP. We have previously characterized mutations within the HIV-1 promoter region that affect preferentially the synthesis of short transcripts, full-length transcripts, or both (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar). To determine whether we could obtain short transcript synthesisin vitro, we compared the RNA products generated by a battery of such mutants in a cell-free system. However, we detected only weak transcriptional signals when a HeLa cell nuclear extract was programmed with the constructs we had used before in our in vivo studies (pHIV-1/R and its mutant derivatives, data not shown). We therefore subcloned HIV-1 sequences containing the wild-type or mutant IST sequences (from −141 to +78) into an HIV-1 construct that had been used successfully for in vitro transcription studies (7Laspia M.F. Wendel P. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 732-746Google Scholar), thus creating the construct pHIV-1/R/ML and its derivatives, whose sequences in the −30 to +92 region are shown in Fig. 1 A. These constructs contain HIV-1 sequences from −642 to +82 relative to the transcription start site fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequences. The polyadenylation signal starting at position +74, which is not used in the 5′-long terminal repeat in vivo, was inactivated by a point mutation at position +77 (underlinedin Fig. 1 A) to avoid the possibility of artifactual polyadenylation of transcripts in vitro. A schematic of pHIV-1/R/ML is depicted in Fig. 1 B. The pHIV-1/R/ML plasmid and mutant derivatives were linearized withNcoI at position +630 downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site, and were then used to program a HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of radiolabeled uridine triphosphate. The RNA products were fractionated on a sequencing gel, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. As typically observed with this type of assay, a number of background bands resulting from transcription initiation at cryptic promoters within vector sequences and from end labeling of endogenous RNAs found in the nuclear extract were detected (e.g. bands around the 110 and 67 nucleotide markers). In addition, we detected two classes of specific transcripts: transcripts of about 630 nt, the length expected for full-length run-off transcripts, and short transcripts of about 83 and 85 nt in length (Fig. 2, lane 3, bands labeled FL and st, respectively. Note that only the sections of the gel containing the bands of interest are shown; a full gel is shown in Fig. 5 A.) The appearance of these transcripts depended on the presence of an intact HIV-1 TATA box, because they were not present when the TATA4/ML construct, in which the HIV-1 TATA box is debilitated by point mutations (see Fig. 1 A), was used as a template (data not shown but see Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2). This suggests that these two classes of transcripts correspond to RNAs correctly initiated at the HIV-1 promoter.Figure 5IST-dependent transcription represents a significant fraction of the total transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro. A, the templates indicated above the lanes were linearized withNcoI and used to program a HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of radiolabeled [α-32P]UTP. The transcription reactions were identical to those described in Fig. 2, except that poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) was added to a concentration of 750 ng/μl, and poly(I)·poly(C) to 175 ng/μl. In lanes 2 and 4, 125 ng of Tat (recombinant protein purified from E. coli, generously provided by M. Laspia, Dartmouth School of Medicine) were added to the reactions. In lanes 1–4, the resulting RNAs were then hybridized to an excess of unlabeled riboprobe hybridizing to the −146 to +329 HIV-1 region, single-stranded RNA was digested with RNase T1, and the protected RNA fragments were resolved on a sequencing gel. in lanes 5 and 6, the radiolabeled RNAs producedin vitro were directly fractionated on the same sequencing gel. In lanes 5 and 6, the bands labeledFL have the expected length for full-length run off RNAs initiated at the HIV-1 promoter. In lanes 1–4, the bands labeled FL have the expected length for transcripts protected from position +1 to position +329, where the complementarity to the antisense riboprobe ends. The bands labeled stcorrespond to short transcripts. The sizes of the DNA markers are indicated on the right. B, quantitative analysis of promoter-proximal and full-length transcription detected in A. The bands corresponding to full-length transcripts or to transcripts shorter than 95 nt in lanes 1 and 3of panel A were quantitated with a Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager. The numbers were normalized with respect to the number of U residues present in each type of RNA molecules. In addition, we corrected the short transcript signal obtained for lane 3 for the negative effect of the ABC mutations on general transcription by multiplying it by the ratio of full-length transcripts observed with the wild-type construct (lane 1)versus full-length transcripts obtained with the IST mutant construct (lane 3). The amount of transcripts shorter than 95 nt obtained with the wild-type IST construct (lane 1 of A) was then set at 100%. The relative amount of full-length transcripts (329 nt in length) obtained with the same construct is shown, as well as the approximate contribution of the activity of IST to promoter-proximal transcription (cross-hatched portion of the bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7The synthesis of short, but not full-length, transcripts is resistant to DRB. The templates indicatedabove the lanes were linearized with NcoI and used to program a HeLa cell nuclear extract either in the absence (lanes 1–4) or presence (lanes 5–8) of 160 μm DRB. The bands are labeled as in Fig. 2. The location of DNA markers is indicated on the right. Only the top and bottom portions of the gel, which contain the bands of interest, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the 83- and 85-nt long transcripts corresponded to IST-dependent short transcripts, we transcribed several promoter constructs carrying mutations that had been characterized for short transcript synthesis activity in vivo (3Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 910-917Google Scholar, 4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar). The short transcript activity of these constructs in vivo is summarized in Fig. 1 A. In vitro, the short transcript doublet was present with mutants ms5/ML, ms4/ML, ms3/ML, and ms2/ML (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7), none of which exhibit selective deficits in short transcript synthesis in vivo, but not with mutants ms1/ML, pIST−/ML, msABC/ML, and msAB/ML, which do not direct the formation of short transcripts in vivo(lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10). Significantly, the msBC/ML mutant, which directs low but detectable levels of short transcripts in vivo (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar), also directed low levels of short transcripts in vitro (lane 11). Furthermore, the pIST/ML construct, in which 11 base pairs of transcribed sequence between the two IST half-elements are deleted (Fig. 1 A) and which directs the formation of correspondingly shorter short transcripts in vivo (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar), also directed the formation of shorter short transcripts in vitro (lane 12, bands labeled sst). The different abilities of these constructs to direct the formation of short transcripts did not reflect a general defect in transcription, because all constructs directed the synthesis of significant levels of full-length transcripts (lanes 1–12, band labeled FL). Thus, the extensive correlation between the ability of the various mutants to support the synthesis of short transcripts in vivo and the synthesis of the 83–85-nucleotide doublet in vitro suggests that synthesis of this doublet reflects the activity of the IST element. To allow for efficient internal labeling of the transcripts, the cell-free transcription assay contained a much lower concentration of UTP (7.5 μm unlabeled, 165 nm radiolabeled) than of the other three nucleotides (250 μm each). Thus, it was necessary to ascertain that the short transcripts did not result from artifactual pausing or termination by the RNA polymerase due to a rate-limiting UTP concentration. We therefore varied the concentration of UTP in the transcription reaction from 1.0 to 250 μmby increasing the amounts of non-radiolabeled UTP, and determined the amounts of short transcripts and full-length transcripts generated by the wild-type template pHIV-1/R/ML at each UTP concentration. Fig. 3 A shows the results of this experiment, and Fig. 3 B the percentage of maximum amounts of short and full-length transcripts obtained at each UTP concentration. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the radiolabeled signal corresponding to both short and long transcripts decreased as the ratio of unlabeled UTP to radiolabeled UTP ([UTP]/[*UTP], see top of figure) increased, as expected. However, as shown in Fig. 3 B, actual synthesis of both the short and full-length transcripts increased steadily as a function of total UTP concentration and approached saturation at 250 μm UTP, as determined after quantitation of the signals with a PhosphorImager and correction for the increase in the unlabeled to radiolabeled UTP ratio. Remarkably, the synthesis curves of short and full-length transcripts as a function of UTP concentration were nearly superimposable, except for a slight predominance of the full-length transcripts at the lowest UTP concentrations (Fig. 3 B). Indeed, the ratio of short transcripts to full-length transcripts was nearly identical at each UTP concentration, with the exception of the lowest concentrations of UTP, where it was slightly lower (see of st/FL, top of Fig. 3 A: compare lane 13 to lanes 1–3). If limiting UTP concentration contributed significantly to short transcript formation, the opposite would be expected, i.e.the ratio of short to long transcripts would be higher at the lowest concentrations of UTP. Thus, in this assay, short transcript formation does not result from RNA polymerase pausing or termination due to low UTP concentrations. This is consistent with the observation that the short transcripts are not observed when the various IST−mutants are transcribed, which should be equally susceptible to such artifactual pausing or termination. The ABC mutation changes sequences downstream of the transcription start site that are part of the short transcripts. These sequence changes maintain the predicted secondary structure of the short transcripts. Moreover, in nuclear run-on assays in vivo, which measure the rate of RNA synthesis during a time period believed to be too short to allow for significant RNA turnover, the ABC mutant does not support the accumulation of short transcripts, suggesting that the defect is caused by reduced transcription rather than by a decreased stability of the short transcripts (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the possibility remained that,in vitro, we failed to detect short transcripts derived from the msABC/ML construct because of decreased stability. Therefore, we compared the relative stabilities of wild-type short transcripts and short transcripts carrying the ABC mutation in the in vitrotranscription reaction. Internally [α-32P]CTP-labeled short transcripts extending from +1 to +68 were synthesized in vitro with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Equal amounts of either wild-type or ABC short transcripts were then added to reactions identical to the cell-free transcription assay except for the absence of the [α-32P]UTP label. One-microliter aliquots were taken at various time points and resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The bands corresponding to the short transcripts were then quantitated with a PhosphorImager and the signals were plotted as depicted in Fig. 4. Both wild-type and ABC short transcripts were degraded in the reactions with nearly identical half-lives of approximately 80 min. This suggests that the lack of short transcript accumulation observed with the msABC/ML construct results indeed from a transcription defect rather than from increased RNA turn-over. Consistent with this observation, the addition of RNasin, an inhibitor of common eukaryotic ribonucleases (10Blackburn P. Moore S. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar), had no effect on the accumulation of the short transcripts in the in vitro transcription assay (data not shown). High levels of background bands around the 65-nt marker made it difficult to interpret the lower part of the gels used to resolve the in vitro transcripts. To determine whether additional IST-dependent short transcripts might be located in this region of the gel, and to map the short and long transcripts more accurately, we analyzed the products of an in vitrotranscription reaction by an RNase protection assay with unlabeled antisense riboprobes (see “Experimental Procedures”). As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, in a run-off assay the pHIV-1/R/ML and the msABC/ML constructs gave the expected full-length transcripts (lanes 5 and 6). As determined by quantitation of the bands with a PhosphorImager, the amounts of full-length transcripts synthesized by the msABC/ML mutant represented about 60% the amounts of full-length transcripts synthesized by the wild-type construct. A similar moderate reduction of full-length transcripts is observed with this mutant in vivo, presumably because, in addition to inactivating the DNA sequences required for activation of short transcript synthesis, the ABC mutations also compromise sequences that contribute to basal transcription (4Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Google Scholar). As expected, the pHIV-1/R/ML wild-type construct, but not the msABC/ML construct, which contains a debilitated IST, produced the short transcript doublet (lanes 5 and 6, bands labeled st). In addition, the pHIV-1/R/ML construct gave stronger signals in the 65-nt r"
https://openalex.org/W2324855400,"p53 triple mutants (120N/121G/277H, 120H/121G/277H, 120S/121G/277H and 120H/121G/277Y) have altered sequence specificity in bandshift assays in vitro and transcription assays in vivo. These mutants activate transcription from the site TTT CATG AAA but not from wild type sites. The triple mutants activate more strongly than p53 with a single 277Y mutation. The TTT site matches the wild type p53 consensus at only 4/10 positions and is not recognised by wild type p53. 277Y mutations have been described in human tumours, and Ewing tumour cells expressing this mutant from the endogenous p53 locus selectively activate transcription from transfected luciferase reporters regulated by TTT-mutant p53 binding sites. p53 mutants with altered sequence specificity have potential advantages for cancer gene therapy: if used to activate transcription of conditionally toxic genes they would allow tumour-targeting by p53, which acts as a sensor for the malignant state, but place control over cell killing in the hands of the clinician. Rare tumours expressing such mutants from the endogenous p53 locus could be targeted directly with p53-regulated suicide vectors, but for most tumours both the p53 mutant and the reporter would need to be encoded by the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2312463413,"GDNFR-alpha is a glycosyl-phosphotidylinositol-linked receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF binds to GDNFR-alpha and this complex, in turn, is believed to interact with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase to effect downstream signalling. GDNFR-alpha belongs to a novel gene family without strong homology to known genes. Thus, little information has been available to help predict genomic structure or location of this gene. In this study, the genomic organization of human GDNFR-alpha was delineated through a combination of PAC clone characterization, long distance PCR and sequence analyses. Exon-intron boundaries were defined by comparing the size and sequence of the genomic PCR products to those predicted by the cDNA sequence. The human GDNFR-alpha gene comprises 9 exons. GDNFR-alpha PAC clones were used for FISH analysis to map this gene to 10q26."

https://openalex.org/W2328206945,"The T1 gene gives rise to two transcripts encoding a 62 kDa membrane-bound and a 37 kDa secreted protein with similarity to the type I IL-1 receptor. It is weakly expressed in proliferating but not in resting fibroblasts and is strongly induced during the entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle. Here we show that the T1 gene is also transcriptionally activated in response to the treatment of fibroblasts with cycloheximide and anisomycin. These protein synthesis inhibitors are known to stimulate the JNK and p38/RK signal transduction pathways. We provide evidence that anisomycin triggers T1 gene induction through the stimulation of the p38/RK MAP kinase. This observation is in line with our finding that physiological activators of the p38/RK pathway, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNFα, stimulate T1 gene expression efficiently. Growth factor mediated T1 gene induction is a delayed early event, requiring ongoing protein synthesis. In contrast, anisomycin induces T1 gene expression at concentrations which block translation completely. Thus, transcriptional induction of the T1 gene via the p38/RK pathway is an immediate early event not requiring de novo protein synthesis. The T1 gene is strongly induced by various mitogens in quiescent NIH3T3 fibroblasts but not in ras transformed NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, all of the three tested agent which activate the p38/RK pathway, IL-1, TNFα, and anisomycin led to strong T1 gene expression in normal and ras transformed NIH3T3 cells alike. Thus, the T1 gene can be induced through the activation of at least two MAP kinase pathways: signaling through the ERK pathway can occcur in normal but not in ras transformed NIH3T3 cells, whereas the signaling through the p38/RK pathway is not affected by ras transformation."
