https://openalex.org/W1569885738,"Glycoproteins were isolated from the blood sera of the Antarctic fishes Trematomus borchgrevinki and Dissostichus mawsoni. Some of these glycoproteins have the unique property of depressing the freezing point of water more than expected on the basis of the number of particles present in solution and are termed active glycoproteins. These freezing point-depressing glycoproteins depress the freezing point of water to the same extent as NaCl on a weight basis. They are composed primarily of threonine (16%), alanine (23%), N-acetylgalactosamine (29%), and galactose (28%). Compared with the active glycoproteins, the inactive ones (which form ideal solutions) have approximately the same composition except that proline is present. The active glycoproteins have been separated into three distinct groups, based on results from ion exchange chromatography and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three active glycoproteins occur in equal amounts in the blood sera, have identical compositions on a weight basis, but differ in molecular weights (10,500,17,000 and 21,500 g). Studies of viscosity and circular dichroism and dialysis experiments indicate that the active glycoproteins are expanded molecules, a property which undoubtedly is of importance to their function."

https://openalex.org/W1552110367,"Abstract The structure and properties of the freezing point-depressing glycoproteins from a cold-adapted Antarctic fish, Trematomus borchgrevinki, were examined by means of chemical modifications and enzymatic and chemical degradations. Trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, almond emulsin, β-galactosidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase A did not hydrolyze the freezing point-depressing glycoproteins and had no effect on their activity. Subtilisin or fungal protease, however, destroyed the freezing point-depressing activity of the glycoproteins by cleavage of relatively few peptide bonds. Periodate oxidation of 80% of the galactose residues, β elimination of carbohydrate with 0.5 n NaOH, or acetylation of 35% of the carbohydrate hydroxyls with acetic anhydride in pyridine likewise destroyed the activity. Deacylation of the inactive acetyl glycoproteins with hydroxylamine resulted in complete restoration of the freezing point-depressing activity. β elimination with 0.5 n NaOH at 20° for 6 hours indicated that the reducing ends of the carbohydrate groups are linked O-glycosidically to the β carbon of threonine. As a result of β elimination, all of the threonines were converted to 2-amino-2-butenoic acid, and an equivalent amount of reducing groups appeared. Formation of the 2-amino-2-butenoic acid residues during β elimination was confirmed by converting the residues to α-aminobutyric acid or to 3-methylcysteic acid. Sequential periodate oxidation revealed that galactose is in the external position and that N-acetylgalactosamine is linked to threonine. Preliminary evidence indicated that the linkage of galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine is 1,4 or 1,3, rather than 1,6. The freezing point-depressing glycoproteins appear to have a peptide backbone of alanine and threonine, with di- or trisaccharides linked O-glycosidically to every threonine molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1547102481,"Abstract We have proposed that the accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA, which occurs when a deficiency of B12 coenzyme exists, may lead to its incorporation into fatty acids in place of malonyl-CoA. This lead to the production of fatty acids, which are not usually produced and which may be physiologically undesirable. As a first step in the test of this hypothesis, we have examined the effect of methylmalonyl-CoA on fatty acid synthesis in vitro, in rat liver supernatant fractions. It was shown that methylmalonyl-CoA inhibits fatty acid synthesis and is incorporated into fatty acids."

Established lymphocytoblasts from a normal donor were used in the one-way mixed leukocyte culture test and were found to stimulate the peripheral lymphocytes of that donor. These lymphocytoblasts were also capable of stimulating allogeneic lymphocyte populations.
https://openalex.org/W1517596022,"Abstract Active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester) hydrolysis and transfer reactions catalyzed by transglutaminase have been studied at pH 7.5 and 0° in the presence of 50 mm Ca++. The initial velocities of appearance of two products of the reactions, p-nitrophenol and N-acylamines, were found to be consistent with a ping pong mechanism in which acyl-enzyme formed from active ester may react with water (hydrolysis) or with primary amine (transfer). This finding, in conjunction with previous evidence that the hydrolysis and transfer of transglutaminase-catalyzed glutamine substrate conform to this mechanism, gives strong support for an acyl-enzyme theory of transglutaminase action. The d and l antipodes of several active ester and amide (first) substrates and the d and l forms of the amine (second) substrate, alanine ethyl ester, have been employed as a means of detecting stereochemical dissymmetry within the active site of transglutaminase. Notable differences in the kinetic parameters of the reactions of the d and l antipodes of benzyloxycarbonyl(Z)-alanine p-nitrophenyl ester and those of Z-α-glutamyl(γ-p-nitrophenyl ester)glycine point up dissymmetric arrangements of groupings within the active center of the activated native enzyme. The differences in reactivities of d- and l-alanine ethyl esters in the transglutaminase-catalyzed transfer reaction of various first substrates, both ester and amide, indicate variation in the spatial arrangement of groupings within the amine site of the different acyl-enzymes. This is manifest as an acyl-enzyme-dependent preference for one antipode over the other. The almost absolute stereospecificity of transglutaminase toward glutamine substrate is evident in its strong preference for the l form of Z-glutaminylglycine. However, the enzyme displays substantial activity toward both d and l isomers of Z-α-aminoadipamylglycine (Z-homoglutaminylglycine). These findings provide a preliminary approach to an understanding of the spatial relationships between the substrate and the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W45956271,"Abstract The metabolism of progesterone-1,2-3H has been studied in the estrogen-primed pullet. Following the intravenous administration of the hormone, radioactivity was recovered within 5 min in oviduct magnum, and at all time intervals up to 1 hour approximately one-fourth of the magnum radioactivity was localized within the nuclei of this tissue. Although the metabolism of progesterone-3H to a variety of metabolites is rapid in all tissues studied, progesterone itself and its 5α-reduced derivative allopregnanedione are the principal compounds identified in magnum cytoplasm and the only labeled steroids recovered from oviduct nuclei. The conversion of progesterone to allopregnanedione was shown to take place in magnum nuclei, and this metabolite of progesterone was recovered in significant amounts only in the magnum and shell gland of the oviduct, the comb, and the brain following the intravenous administration of progesterone-1,2-3H. At all times studied progesterone itself is the predominant species (80% or greater) bound to nuclei obtained from the magnum, whereas allopregnanedione is the principal radioactive steroid bound to nuclei in the shell gland of the oviduct."

https://openalex.org/W1573791991,"Abstract The cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate bound through an aldimine linkage to lysine residues of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase is very stable to irradiation with light of 420 nm. The catalytic function of the enzyme exposed to light absorbed by the cofactor remains unaffected, indicating that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is not an efficient active site photosensitizer for this aminotransferase. The irradiation of the apoprotein in the presence of lumichrome leads to irreversible loss of catalytic activity which follows first order kinetics. Photoinactivation of the apoprotein occurs at low concentrations of lumichrome (molar ratio of lumichrome to apoenzyme, 15:1), even though lumichrome is not bound to acceptor sites of the protein as demonstrated by spectrophotometric and fluorometric titrations. It is postulated that the mechanism underlying the photodynamic action of lumichrome must be operative over large distances. Transfer of excitation energy from the excited state (singlet or triplet) of the sensitizer lumichrome to corresponding excited states in the protein is extremely unlikely. An analysis of the photoinactivation results indicates that singlet excited oxygen, generated by energy transfer from the lowest triplet of lumichrome to oxygen, may act as the oxidizing agent of the histidine residues of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2064837594,GROSS has shown that the decreasing ability of a collagen gel to pass back into solution when the pH or the temperature is lowered represents an ageing effect in in vitro collagen gels1. These alterations in physical properties may be a result of the formation of covalent cross linkages between oxidized lysine residues in one tropo-collagen molecule and free lysine ε-amino groups in adjacent ones2. We have shown that similar changes in physical properties and alterations in the enzyme susceptibility of the precipitated collagen are caused by the application of cyclical mechanical stress to the collagen during the period of precipitation.
