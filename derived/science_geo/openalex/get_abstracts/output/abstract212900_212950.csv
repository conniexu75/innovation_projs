https://openalex.org/W2087737282,"When two clonal lines of mouse fibroblasts, each containing a drug-resistant marker, are grown together for 4 days, hybrid cells can be detected by selective conditions. These hybrid cells are presumed to be the result of mating. By the same method evidence can be obtained which suggests that mating may be followed by segregation."

https://openalex.org/W1986002885,"THE only pigment known to be produced by wild-type strains of V. albo-atrum is of a dark melanoid type1. In an investigation involving the production of biochemical mutants in this fungus (using a strain originally isolated from wilted lucerne, 1962), an orange pigmented colony, which had a partial requirement for biotin, developed on plates of complete medium spread with conidia irradiated with ultra-violet at a dosage allowing for approximately 5 per cent survival. The irradiation was carried out using a sterile distilled water suspension of conidia in an open Petri dish at a distance of 20 cm from a 2537 A ‘Hanovia’ bactericidal tube model 11 (with ozone reducing filter). The close resemblance of this colony (designated M.5) in morphological details to wild-type led us to conclude that it is a mutant rather than a chance contaminant. The results of a preliminary extraction of M.5 suggested that several different carotenoids were present, and from further work, reported here, we have been able to identify some of these pigments."
https://openalex.org/W2016932855,"IN comparative experiments in mice with ovarian grafts into the spleen, or into the kidney and liver, it has been shown that the tumours originating in the latter are microtumours as compared to the macrotumours in the spleen. The difference is not due to influences from the site itself: when grafting one ovary into the spleen and the other into the kidney (or liver) of the same animal (‘combined’ grafts) in both the intrasplenic and intrarenal (or intrahepatic) grafts no more than microtumours appear1,2 (Fig. 1)."
