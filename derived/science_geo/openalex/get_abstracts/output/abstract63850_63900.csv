https://openalex.org/W2066804398,"Measurements of the brain's magnetic field, called magnetoencephalograms (MEG's), have been taken with a superconducting magnetometer in a heavily shielded room. This magnetometer has been adjusted to a much higher sensitivity than was previously attainable, and as a result MEG's can, for the first time, be taken directly, without noise averaging. MEG's are shown, simultaneously with the electroencephalogram (EEG), of the alpha rhythm of a normal subject and of the slow waves from an abnormal subject. The normal MEG shows the alpha rhythm, as does the EEG, when the subject's eyes are closed; however, this MEG also shows that higher detector sensitivity, by a factor of 3, would be necessary in order to clearly show the smaller brain events when the eyes are open. The abnormal MEG, including a measurenment of the direct-current component, suggests that the MEG may yield some information which is new and different from that provided by the EEG."
https://openalex.org/W1583024484,"Abstract The polyene antibiotic filipin has been shown previously to mediate changes in membrane permeability in natural and artificial biological membranes. The concept has emerged that the interaction of filipin is dependent upon the presence of sterol, preferably cholesterol. The present report provides strong evidence that filipin can interact with sterol in a stereochemically and stoichiometrically defined manner to produce a filipin-sterol complex or adduct. Filipin (F) has a characteristic ultraviolet absorption spectrum with 4 maxima. The ratio of absorbance of Peak 3, λ = 320 nm, to Peak 1, λ = 356 nm, is 0.7 in organic solvents and 0.8 in aqueous solution. Addition of cholesterol (C) causes a striking spectral change in only the aqueous solutions of filipin so that, although the absorption maxima do not shift, the ratio of absorbance of Peak 3 to Peak 1 becomes approximately 2.5. The formation of the filipin complex, as defined by the spectral change, is specific for stereols. No significant effect on either the formation or breakdown of the filipin-cholesterol complex (F-C) was evident by addition of bovine serum albumin, sucrose, galactose, lecithin, cetyl alcohol, 4 m NaCl, or 4 m urea, or variation of pH from 2 to 9. Addition of the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, or organic solvents miscible with H2O, broke the F-C complex, whereas heating to 80–90° and cooling caused a reversible breaking and reforming of the F-C complex. The spectral change also occurs when filipin is added to preparations of egg lecithin-cholesterol liposomes (84:16 to 50:50 mole %). A study of the sterol structural requirements necessary for optimal interaction indicates that with the free steroid in H2O, the interaction is primarily hydrophobic, with the presence of a cholestane ring structure and Δ22 double bond producing the most favorable interaction. But in the liposomal system there is an additional requirement for a 3β-OH on the steroid nucleus. The same structural requirements are also necessary for optimal interaction of filipin with mixed lecithin-sterol monolayers. A quantitative evaluation of the spectral change mediated by cholesterol indicated that the filipin interacted identically with both the free and liposomally bound sterol from 10-6 to 10-4 m antibiotic, such that a defined number of cholesterols were combined with 1 filipin molecule. The spectral change was also evident in red cell ghost membranes and in cells and membranes obtained from Mycoplasma laidlawii grown in the presence of cholesterol. No spectral change was evident in cells or membranes obtained from M. laidlawii grown in the absence of a sterol or in the presence of epi-(3α-hydroxyl)-cholesterol. Analysis of a suspension of synthetic lecithin (L), lecithin-cholesterol (L-C), or L-C-filipin dispersions (L-C-F) by differential scanning calorimetry indicates that addition of C to L (L-C) abolishes the sharp phase transition characteristic of the conversion of lecithin from the crystalline (Lα) to liquidcrystalline (Lβ) form. Addition of F to L (L-F) has no effect on the lecithin phase transition; but addition of F to L-C (L-C-F) causes the phase transition of the lecithin to quantitatively reappear. These results suggest that filipin can interact stoichiometrically with cholesterol and that in membrane systems this interaction is capable of altering some of the physical properties of the membrane, thus providing a basis for filipin-induced changes in membrane permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1826289931,"Abstract The structural and metabolic integrity of isolated rat liver cells was verified by the high percentage of trypan blue exclusion, a low degree of lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium, a constant rate of gluconeogenesis from l(+)-lactate, and increased oxygen consumption following the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Palmitic acid, incubated in an albumin-bound form with isolated liver cells, was esterified to form phospholipids, triglycerides, diglycerides, and cholesterol esters and was oxidized to CO2 and ketone bodies. In liver cells from fed rats, the major portion of palmitate was esterified, an intermediate quantity was oxidized to ketone bodies, and a smaller amount was oxidized to CO2. The partition of palmitic acid between esterification and ketogenesis was inversed by fasting, whereas oxidation to CO2 and the total rate of palmitate utilization were unaltered. Greater esterification of [14C]palmitate in cells from fed rats was not a result of carbon recycling via chain elongation or de novo synthesis. Liver cells from fasted rats derived more energy from fatty acid oxidation than cells from fed rats. The results indicate that citric acid cycle flux and endogenous lipolysis were unaffected by fasting. These observations signify that altered partition of free fatty acids between the pathways of oxidation and esterification in the liver is a major causative factor in the increased ketogenesis in the fasting state. An increase in [1-14C]palmitate concentration augmented palmitate uptake, ketogenesis, and esterification, whereas 14CO2 production was only slightly affected. The estimated citric acid cycle flux and the acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate ratio were diminished. Increased ketogenesis in response to sequential elevation of the palmitate concentration could not be accounted for by diminished citric acid cycle flux and therefore resulted from increased β oxidation. Ketone body specific activity approached a constant value at v of 3 to 4. Results indicate intracellular mixing of free fatty acids derived from endogenous lipolysis and from the medium, prior to β oxidation. Phospholipid was the predominant esterification product at low concentrations of added palmitate, but, as phospholipid formation approached saturation, a sigmoid increase in diglyceride and triglyceride formation occurred. Fructose and glycerol each decreased ketogenesis from added palmitate. Fructose, glycerol, and, to a lesser extent, glucose increased palmitate esterification in liver cells isolated from fasting rats. This effect was characterized by increased conversion of added palmitate to diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids and decreased conversion to cholesterol esters. These substrates did not alter the rate of fatty acid uptake. Fructose, glycerol, and, to a lesser extent, glucose elevated 14CO2 production from [1-14C]palmitate. At higher fructose concentrations the elevated 14CO2 production was reversed. Results suggest that substrates which enter glycolysis beyond fructose 1,6-diphosphate decrease ketogenesis by competition with fatty acid oxidation and enhance esterification by the resulting increased availability of long chain free fatty acids and by a separate preferential stimulation of glycerolipid formation. Results indicate that decreased availability of non-fatty acid substrates and, thereby, decreased competitive oxidation of these substrates is a participating causative factor in the increased oxidation, and the decreased esterification, of long chain fatty acids in the liver in the fasting state."
https://openalex.org/W1612151898,"Information has been obtained in regard to the carbohydrate units of human and calf thyroglobulin through a study of the glycopeptides obtained after extensive Pronase digestion of these proteins. Human thyroglobulin was shown to contain, as has been previously reported for the calf protein, carbohydrate units consisting only of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (unit A) as well as more complex units consisting of mannose, Nacetylglucosamine, galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and fucose (unit B). The units A of the human and calf thyroglobulin were similar, consisting on an average of 8 to 9 residues of mannose and 2 of N-acetylglucosamine. There were 7 to 8 units of this type in the human protein and 5 to 6 in the calf. Chromatography of human and calf unit A glycopeptides on Dowex 50-X2 revealed extensive microheterogeneity, with the mannose content varying from 5 to 11 residues per unit, but with the glucosamine content remaining constant at 2 residues in each. The average unit B of the human thyroglobulin was found to consist of 3 mannose, 4 N-acetylglucosamine, 2 to 3 galactose, 1 fucose, and 1 sialic acid residues. It differed from that previously reported for the calf in containing fewer residues of sialic acid, galactose, and glucosamine. There were found to be 22 units of the B type in the human thyroglobulin compared with 13 to 14 of these units in the calf protein. The human unit B was also found to exhibit pronounced microheterogeneity, as was revealed by fractionation of its glycopeptides on DEAE-cellulose. The variation was primarily evident in the sialic acid, galactose, and glucosamine residues, with the mannose of the core portion remaining constant at 3 residues. The galactosamine residues of the human thyroglobulin were shown, by density gradient centrifugation, to be an integral part of this protein and to occur in units distinct from carbohydrate units A and B, which have been designated as unit C. Alkaline sulfite treatment of glycopeptides containing galactosamine suggested that the C type of unit is linked to serine and threonine residues by O-glycosidic bonds, in contrast to the glycosylamine type of linkage to asparagine which attaches units A and B to the peptide chain. During Pronase digestion, some of the glycopeptide bonds linking unit A were split, yielding neutral oligosaccharides containing 7 to 8 mannose and 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues, with 1 of the latter in a reducing terminal position."
https://openalex.org/W1490235288,"Abstract In a continuation of our studies of the sequential fragmentation of the respiratory chain, we have worked out a method of isolating cytochrome c1 from succinate cytochrome c reductase. The purified cytochrome c1 was stable in neutral solution and soluble in aqueous media. It contained 25 nmoles of heme per mg of protein and a small amount of carbohydrate. The absorption spectrum of the reduced cytochrome c1 possessed maxima at 552.5, 530, 522.5, 512, 417, 317, and 276 nm, and the oxidized at 558, 522, 411, 355, and 276 nm. Neither carbon monoxide nor oxygen affected its spectral behavior. At -160°, the α-band of reduced cytochrome c1 split into at least three bands and the β-band into nine. The low temperatures intensified the α- and β-bands by 6- to 7-fold but did not cause any significant shift of the positions of the maxima. The extinction coefficient at 23° for Ared552.5 — Ared540 was found to be 17.5 mm-1 cm-1 from the total iron assay and 18.5 by titration with DPNH in the presence of phenazine methosulfate. The cytochrome c1 can be used as an electron donor or acceptor in interaction with the electron transfer system in submitochondrial particles of bovine heart."
https://openalex.org/W1572545031,"Abstract Based in part on observations made in blood-mixing experiments with intact and 70 and 90% hepatectomized rats, a mixture of chemicals has been devised that induces nuclear DNA formation and mitosis in the parenchymal liver cells of the unoperated animal. The mixture (TAGH solution) contains 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (triiodothyronine), amino acids, glucagon, and heparin. Each component of the stimulatory solution contributes to the enhancement in DNA synthesis but triiodothyronine is the single most important constituent. Given with the AGH solution (amino acids, glucagon, and heparin), as little as 2 µg of the hormone has a detectable effect and 10 µg is about two-thirds as effective as 100 µg or 2 mg. The time curve of the response of unoperated rats to the TAGH solution is the same as after 70% hepatectomy. With both stimuli, liver DNA formation begins at 14 hours. Unoperated rats can be initially treated with triiodothyronine, however, so that DNA synthesis is already high at 10 hours from the start of the infusion of the AGH solution. Several pieces of evidence are given to show that the TAGH solution does not induce DNA replication by damaging some of the cells of the intact liver. The TAGH solution, just as 70% hepatectomy, causes in the liver an increase in the rate of ribosome formation, an accumulation of glycerides, and changes in fatty acid composition. Unlike partial hepatectomy, however, the solution does not produce rises in the rates of synthesis of serum albumin or of total hepatic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1515029606,"Abstract Progesterone, when forming a complex with a specific protein receptor molecule, interacts in vitro with intact chick oviduct chromatin. In the present study, a series of experiments was performed to elucidate the nature of the chromatin sites of oviduct responsible for binding the progesterone receptor. The proteins of chromatin from various chick tissues were dissociated from DNA and reconstituted back to the DNA of either the same or different tissue. The chemical analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrate that the histones are quantitatively reintegrated into the chromatin without detectable degradation when protease inhibitors are present during the reconstitution. Comparison of the chemical composition and immunochemical analysis of the untreated and reconstituted chromatins indicates that non-histone (acidic) proteins also can be switched from oviduct chromatin to the DNA of other tissues to form chromatins. The transfer of the acidic proteins from the chromatin of one tissue to that of another results in a corresponding exchange of the template capacity so that the hybrid chromatin resembles the chromatin serving as the source of the acidic proteins. These data suggest that the acidic proteins are involved in maintaining open template. Reconstituted chick oviduct chromatin maintains the capacity to bind the progesterone-receptor complex. This tissue-specific binding is transferred to chromatins of non-target organs by exchanging the acidic chromatin proteins during reconstitution. Moreover, quantitative microcomplement fixation assays using antisera specific for the oviduct DNA-acidic protein complex indicate that the conformation of acidic proteins following transfer is similar to that found in the native oviduct chromatin. A subfraction of the acidic proteins of oviduct chromatin has been found to contain the acceptor molecules which are responsible for the binding with the progesterone-receptor complex. These tissue-specific acceptor proteins thus appear to be the molecules responsible for the binding of progesterone-receptor complex to oviduct chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1517900928,"Abstract Properties of thymidine kinase, partially purified from human fetal liver, have been compared with properties of human adult thymidine kinase. Fetal thymidine kinase differs from the adult form in electrophoretic properties, pH optima, heat stability, inhibition by dCTP, and ability to utilize nucleotides other than ATP as phosphate donors. We observe that human fetal thymidine kinase resembles thymidine kinase present in at least two permanent human tumor cell lines and also has properties similar to the enzyme found by other workers in a variety of animal and human tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601303605,"Abstract Partial hepatectomy causes a large rise in the activity of liver alkaline phosphatase that takes place exclusively in the plasma membrane. The activity of the membrane phosphatase can be raised in the livers of unoperated rats by infusing the animals with glycine, heparin, phosphorylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, or cortisol. The effects of glycine and heparin are additive. l-Serine is as effective as glycine but none of the other amino acids tested has activity. Any of several compounds that are known to increase the supply of fatty acids to the liver can substitute for heparin. The increase in phosphatase activity is accompanied by rises in the rates of excretion of choline and phosphatidylcholine into the bile. Folate blocks the increases in the phosphatase activity and in the excretion of choline that are ordinarily produced by a mixture of glycine and heparin or by cortisol. Neither phosphorylcholine nor alkaline phosphatase activity is detectable in samples of freshly collected rat bile. The membrane phosphatase is able to hydrolyze phosphorylcholine. Taken together, these observations have suggested that at least one of the functions of the alkaline phosphatase of the liver membrane is to hydrolyze phosphorylcholine so that choline can be transported across the bile canalicular membrane. The level of the enzyme activity appears to be controlled by the quantity of phosphorylcholine that is available for excretion into the bile. Partial hepatectomy leads to alterations in 1-carbon and phospholipid metabolism that result in increases in liver phosphorylcholine and in the activity of the membrane phosphatase. The rise in alkaline phosphatase activity is not essential for the entry of the liver cell into the period of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1525888411,"Abstract Both rat liver cholesterol synthesis and the primary controlling enzyme in this synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.34) are known to exhibit a circadian rhythm of activity. Rats fed ad libitum and housed under normal conditions (i.e. lights on at 6 a.m. and off at 6 p.m.) showed a maximum activity of HMG-CoA reductase at midnight and a minimum activity at noon. Changing the lighting conditions such that there was still a 12-hour light-dark cycle per day affected the timing but not the amplitude of the rhythm. The maximum reductase activity always occurred 6 hours after the onset of the dark period. Cycloheximide (1.3 µg per g body weight) caused an exponential decay of liver microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity for a 9-hour period following the injection. On a normal lighting schedule this decay rate was the same when measured from 9 a.m., 9 p.m., or 2 a.m. The half-life (t½) of the enzyme was calculated to be approximately 4.2 hours. The rate of decay of enzyme activity measured from 2 a.m. was the same for untreated control rats fed ad libitum and for rats treated with cycloheximide. Consequently, the circadian rhythm can be explained as due solely to changes in the rate of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1965096500,"The activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in unfertilized mouse ova and in mouse embryos at the two-cell stage is proportional to the number of X chromosomes present during oogenesis. This indicates that the enzyme is X-linked in the mouse and that inactivation of the X chromosome does not occur during oogenesis. However, the genetic dosage effect of the X chromosomes is not present after the increase in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in the late morula and the blastocyst stages. These results indicate that the X-linked enzyme lacuts is expressed sometimne after fertilization but before the morula stage."
https://openalex.org/W1556195711,"System 1 particles were prepared from lettuce chloroplasts by the addition of digitonin and differential centrifugation as described previously (Nelson, N., Dreschler, Z., and Neumann, J. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 143), but higher detergent concentrations were used. A cytochrome b6-f particle was isolated from System 1 particles by the addition of protamine sulfate and centrifugation. The particle was purified by Bio-Gel and DEAE-column chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The presence of detergents during purification was required in order to prevent aggregation of the cytochromes. The ratio of cytochrome b6 to cytochrome f in the purified particle was close to 2. The particle contained non-heme iron and phospholipids. It was devoid of chlorophyll but contained carotenes. The calculated minimum molecular weight of the particle was 103,000 per 1 heme c. The molar extinction coefficient of the cytochromes in the particle was determined by measuring the absorbance of the pyridine hemochrome complexes. For cytochrome b6 the molar extinction coefficients obtained were as follows: reduced minus oxidized at 563 nm minus 575 nm, 24,400; and at 563 nm minus 542 nm, 20,700. For cytochrome f the molar extinction coefficients obtained were as follows: reduced minus oxidized at 554 nm minus 538 nm, 20,600; and at 554 nm minus 565 nm 23,000. The E0 of cytochrome f in the particle is +330 mvolts and that of cytochrome b6 is -100 mvolts. The cytochrome b6-f particle from chloroplasts shows similarities with the cytochrome b-c1 complex (Complex III) from mitochondria. Some implications of the present findings for the operation of photosynthetic electron transport pathways are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1558203936,"Specific inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase have been prepared and attached to Sepharose. When crude preparations of the enzyme are chromatographed on the affinity gel, the enzyme is selectively retained and may be eluted by a salt gradient. Conditions have been defined under which enzyme is purified some 20-fold in one step to a homogeneous and apparently pure species. An essential factor appears to be the distance the inhibitor is extended from the gel matrix by a chain of bridging atoms which form an attachment arm. A careful series of protein determinations was carried out to establish the ultraviolet extinction coefficient of the purified enzyme. Inherent differences among the protein values determined by various techniques appear to exist. They may in part account for discrepancies in values reported previously for the specific activity of homogeneous enzyme. With the use of an e1%280 nm = 18.0, a specific activity of 610 mmoles of acetylcholine hydrolyzed per hour per mg of protein was observed for the most highly purified enzyme. Active site titration measurements revealed 3.3 active sites per enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1517172699,"Abstract The enzymatic properties of Erwinia carotovora l-asparaginase have been investigated and the Km and Vmax values for a number of substrates determined. l-Asparaginase has a Km of ∼10-5 and a Vmax of 0.9 µmole of ammonia released per min per unit of enzyme for l-asparagine. All other substrates have much higher Km values and less than 25% of the Vmax of l-asparagine. From a study of substrate analogues, it has been established that Erwinia l-asparaginase requires a carboxyl group on the substrate two or three carbon atoms from the carboxamide group which is hydrolyzed. An amino group alpha to the free carboxyl group and in the l-configuration increases the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex but is not essential for catalysis. Small peptides with carboxyl-terminal asparagine residues are deamidated but amino-terminal or internal asparagine residues and large peptides with carboxyl-terminal asparagine residues such as insulin or insulin A chain derivatives are not deamidated. Likewise, glutamine peptides are not deamidated. β-Aspartoalkylamides have been prepared and tested as substrates. Compounds with straight chain alkyl substituents were hydrolyzed, whereas compounds with branched alkyl groups were not hydrolyzed. In addition, β-aspartamidoglycopeptides were not hydrolyzed. Erwinia l-asparaginase catalyzed the exchange of 18O between water and aspartic acid and the hydroxylaminolysis of asparagine and aspartic acid by hydroxylamine."
https://openalex.org/W1562590055,Abstract The cleavage of human fibrinogen in 70% formic acid with CNBr has been studied. A fragment containing the NH2-terminal portions of the three chains has been obtained from the reaction mixture. After reduction and alkylation the NH2-terminal fragments of the α(A) and α(AP) chains have been isolated in essentially pure form by gel filtration and chromatography. The amino acid sequence of these fragments has been determined. Evidence is presented for the occurrence in the α(A) and α(AP) chain preparations of the chain variants α(AY) and α(AYP). The relation between structure and function of fibrinogen is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1538470427,"Abstract The selectivity in vitro of microsomal acyl-CoA:monoacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases was shown to be variable depending upon the incubation conditions. The availability of the phospholipid substrate can play an important role in regulating the observed selectivity of the enzymes giving higher selectivity at lower monoacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate concentrations. Kinetic considerations support an idea that different catalytic sites may be involved when 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is being acylated with different acyl-CoA's by rat liver microsomes. Thus, when the acylation occurred at very low 1-acyl-GP concentrations, palmitate and arachidonate tended to be excluded, although to a different degree, from the 2-position of diacyl-GP, whereas relatively nonselective acylation occurs at high 1-acyl-GP concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1524783585,"Abstract On the basis of initial velocity and product inhibition studies a nonclassical Ping Pong Bi Bi Uni Uni mechanism has been proposed for pyruvate carboxylase from chicken liver. The nonclassical feature of this mechanism is the proposal that each active site on the enzyme is composed of two separate and functionally distinct catalytic sites, i.e., a separate catalytic site exists for the reactants of each partial reaction. The two catalytic sites are presumably linked by the biotinyl residue which functions as the carboxyl carrier. The Bi Bi partial reaction, in which MgATP2-, MgADP-, HCO3-, and phosphate are the substrates, is proposed to utilize a rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi mechanism which includes the formation of two abortive complexes, E-HCO3--Pi and E-HCO3--MgADP-. A rate equation has been developed for the proposed mechanism by employing a combination of rapid equilibrium and steady state methodology. The proposed mechanism is directly analogous to the modified Ping-Pong Bi Bi mechanism previously described for the biotin-enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA transcarboxylase (D. B. Northrop (1969) J. Biol. Chem., 244, 5808)."

They can be interconverted both by treatment with dithiothreitol and by exposure to oxidative conditions, indicating that they represent different states of the same protein rather than genuinely dissimilar protein species as claimed in another report (Yoshida, A., and Carter, N.

https://openalex.org/W1513811221,"Abstract At pH 7.0, 20°, both in the absence and presence of phosphates, the time course of n-butyl isocyanide binding to deoxyhemoglobin is biphasic, and the two kinetic phases can be isolated spectrally and identified with the properties of the α and β chains. Under all conditions at this pH, both the association and dissociation rate constants of the β chains are at least 10 times larger than the corresponding α chain rate constants, which indicates that the β heme site is much more accessible to this isocyanide than the α heme site. However, the spectral and functional heterogeneity observed in the kinetic and equilibrium data at pH 7.0 is absent at pH 9.1. This would appear to indicate that the chains possess similar ligand-binding properties at alkaline pH. For stripped hemoglobin in 0.05 m 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)2,2',2''-nitriloethanol (bis-tris), pH 7.0, 20°, the affinities of the chains within deoxyhemoglobin (defined by the reaction Hb4 + X ⇌ Hb4X) are roughly equivalent, the affinity of the deoxy α chains being slightly greater than that of the β chains. For unstripped hemoglobin in 0.1 m Pi, pH 7.0, the affinity of the deoxy α chains appears to be slightly lower than that of the β chains. At pH 7.0, the addition 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate to samples of stripped hemoglobin allows the generation of populations of partially saturated intermediates which contain n-butyl isocyanide bound preferentially to β heme sites. Thus, the most striking effect of phosphates is a lowering of the ligand affinity of the α chains relative to that of the β chains within the deoxy tetramer. A detailed analysis has been performed on both equilibrium and kinetic data obtained with stripped hemoglobin in 0.05 m bis-tris, pH 7.0. In order to fit both types of data with a single set of rate constants, the tetramer had to be considered as the minimum unit of function, and within this unit, the structural transition from deoxy-like to oxy-like hemoglobin was postulated to occur only after three ligand molecules had been bound. From the resultant values assigned to this set of rate constants, the total free energy of interaction per binding site was calculated to be ∼2.0 kcal per mole which is 0.3 kcal per mole smaller than the value which has been reported for the oxygen reaction. This result, coupled with the remarkable effects of phosphates and pH on the manifestation of chain differences, suggests the need for caution not only in comparing results obtained under different experimental conditions but also in using results obtained with one ligand to predict the behavior of hemoglobin with another."
https://openalex.org/W1501194271,"Smooth endoplasmic reticulum was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and the protein components were fractionated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative rates of amino acid incorporation into the fractionated protein bands following various drug treatments were measured. The drugs used were phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene, representative of two classes of drugs which induce a variety of microsomal drug-metabolizing activities, and hematin, which causes a decrease in the activities of enzymes associated with drug metabolism. Each of the three compounds produced distinctive changes in amino acid incorporation into the protein components of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In each case the greatest change in amino acid incorporation was in a major protein band in the 50,000 molecular weight region of the gel. Cytochrome P-420, the solubilized form of cytochrome P-450, was purified and shown to migrate as a protein with a molecular weight of 50,000, indicating that this protein is contained in the 50,000 molecular weight band. Amino acid incorporation into isolated cytochrome P-420 showed that this protein is responsible for at least part of the drug-mediated changes in amino acid incorporation observed for the 50,000 molecular weight protein band."
https://openalex.org/W1511651884,"Abstract The H-D exchange in aqueous solutions of defatted human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated by the infrared spectroscopic technique. Data on the exchange rates are presented as plots of the fraction of unexchanged peptide hydrogen atoms (X) at a given time (t) versus log(k0t), where k0 is the pH dependent exchange rate constant of solvent exposed peptide groups. When no changes in the stability of a protein takes place as a function of pH, this presentation of the exchange, measured at a series of values of pH, gives a complete of the protein. If it is assumed that the motility of the protein is so high that the exchange mechanism is of the so-called EX2 type, the relaxation spectrum may be taken as an illustration of the distribution of changes in free energy, ΔG, of the transitions of the protein, exposing the peptide groups to the solvent. In the case of HSA at 25° the plot of X versus log(k0t) is a discontinuous function of pH, illustrating the changes in the stability of the conformation of the protein which are provoked by changes in pH. Only a fragment of the relaxation spectrum can be obtained at any given value of pH, but from the relative displacement of the fragments, estimates can be made of changes in the above mentioned values of ΔG. The pH of maximum stability of defatted HSA at 25° is found at pH ∼ 7. At this pH less than 20% of the peptide groups are protected from solvent exposure by conformations stabilized by values of ΔG larger than 8 kcal mole-1; for half of the peptide groups ΔG is smaller than 5 kcal mole-1. Experiments made at pH 6.2 and at different temperatures indicate that the temperature of maximum stability of the protein at this pH is below 5°. A decrease in the exchange rates in the presence of palmitate is observed at pH 7.6."
https://openalex.org/W1560743136,"Abstract Monoacylglycerophosphate is the major product formed when sn-glycerol-3-P is esterified by rat liver microsomes, palmitoyl-CoA, and albumin at pH 6.5. The effect of two hypolipidemic agents, chlorophenoxyisobutyrate and β-benzalbutyrate, on monoacylglycerophosphate synthesis was studied. Both agents (0.5 to 1.0 mm) inhibited monoacylglycerophosphate synthesis by 10 to 20%. Removal of albumin from the incubation mixture produced an effect similar to the addition of chlorophenoxyisobutyrate and β-benzalbutyrate. Palmitoyl-CoA is bound by albumin and microsomal protein. Addition of both drugs decreased binding of palmitoyl-CoA by albumin and increased microsomal-bound palmitoyl-CoA, without increasing the free palmitoyl-CoA. An increase in microsomal-bound palmitoyl-CoA above 20 nmoles per mg of protein resulted in reduced monoacylglycerophosphate formation. Therefore, both agents reduced monoacylglycerophosphate formation in part by raising the concentration of microsomal-bound palmitoyl-CoA. However, both agents inhibited the reaction in the absence of albumin and under conditions in which microsomal-bound palmitoyl-CoA was held constant. These agents had no effect on several other enzymes in the pathway of glycerolipid synthesis. Therefore, chlorophenoxyisobutyrate and β-benzalbutyrate appear to be direct inhibitors of monoacylglycerophosphate formation. This inhibition may explain their early hypolipidemic effect in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1584566482,"Abstract The substrate requirements of Aeromonas aminopeptidase toward NH2-terminal residues were determined by use of amides representing all classes of amino acids, and the effects of the adjacent residue on hydrolysis were assessed by use of leucyl dipeptides in which the identity of the COOH-terminal residue was varied. The enzyme was specific for substrates possessing bulky, hydrophobic residues in the NH2 terminus; of 20 amides tested, measurable rates of hydrolysis were found only for leucinamide, norleucinamide, norvalinamide, isoleucinamide, valinamide, methioninamide, and phenylalaninamide. Of these, leucinamide showed the highest ratio of κcat:Km(app). Among the dipeptides, Leu-Met had the highest κcat:Km(app) ratio and the leucyl peptides with arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine in the COOH terminus exhibited successively lower ratios. The selectivity of the aminopeptidase for large hydrophobic residues in the penultimate position was emphasized by the fact that low κcat:Km(app) ratios were exhibited toward Leu-Ala, Leu-Gly, and Leu-OMe."
https://openalex.org/W1486995366,"The enzyme uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase was purified to a final specific activity of approximately 1200 units per mg from etiolated Sorghum vulgare seedlings. The purified enzyme was highly specific for both UTP and UDP-glucose. The divalent cation requirement was most readily satisfied by magnesium, but manganese and cobalt were also effective. The enzyme was characterized kinetically with regard to the mechanism of catalysis. Product inhibition studies indicate an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism in which the nucleotide substrate adds first and is released last as product. Evidence was obtained supporting mechanisms in which either free magnesium ion activates catalysis of UDP-glucose synthesis by forming a complex with enzyme in addition to its role in formation of MgUTP2-, or UTP4- inhibits the reaction. In contrast, magnesium ion had no effect on the rate of pyrophosphorolysis beyond its role in formation of MgPPi2-. Michaelis constants for each substrate and dissociation (inhibition) constants for nucleotides combining with enzyme were determined in the presence of excess or limiting concentrations of free magnesium ion. The influence of these mechanisms on the regulation of carbohydrate flow in higher plants is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1506837896,"Abstract The liganded derivatives of hemoglobins G Georgia (α295Leu (G2) β2) and Rampa (α295Ser (G2) β2) were found by sedimentation velocity, viscosity, and diffusion measurements to be extensively dissociated into dimers in 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7.2 to 7.4 and 25°. The deoxygenated derivatives of both hemoglobin variants are tetramers under the same conditions. The deoxyhemoglobins also retain a predominantly tetrameric structure in NaCl solutions of increasing concentration up to 2 m, and in dilute alkaline buffers, at least to pH 9.8. In addition, association-dissociation in oxy- or cyanferrihemoglobin Rampa is both pH- and temperature-dependent. The liganded Rampa molecule is primarily a tetramer at 4° in the pH range 6 to 7, whereas liganded hemoglobin G Georgia shows only slightly increased tetramer formation under identical conditions. Both hemoglobin G Georgia and hemoglobin Rampa have decreased heme-heme interactions and increased oxygen affinities."
https://openalex.org/W1516617098,"Abstract 1. Crude extracts prepared by sonicating Candida bogoriensis cells contained glucosyltransferases catalyzing the transfer of glucose from UDP-[14C]glucose to 13-hydroxydocosanoic acid (HDA) (transferase 1) and methyl 13-glucopyranosyloxydocosanoate (methyl GlcHDA) (transferase 2) when these lipids were added as acceptors. The enzymatic products were characterized by thin layer chromatographic and gas-liquid chromatographic comparison to derivatives of GlcHDA and 13-glucopyranosylglucopyranosyloxydocosanoate (Glc2HDA) prepared from cultures of C. bogoriensis. 2. The transferases were purified 20- and 30-fold, respectively, with no separation of the two activities and with a constant ratio of the two activities obtained in successive peak fractions from a DEAE-Sephadex column, a hydroxyl-apatite column, a gel filtration column, and a disc gel electrophoresis fractionation. 3. Both transferases were specific for UDP-glucose, showing apparent Km values of 104 and 88 µm, respectively, for this compound. 4. Glucosyltransferase 1 showed 4- to 5-fold greater activity with HDA than with its methyl ester. A series of hydroxystearate isomers also showed acceptor activity. The activity with 9-hydroxystearate was 60% of that with HDA, whereas the acceptor activity decreased as the hydroxyl group was moved toward either the methyl or carboxyl end of the fatty acid chain. 5. Glucosyltransferase 2 exhibited severe substrate inhibition with GlcHDA as acceptor and a much higher reaction velocity when the methyl ester of GlcHDA was utilized as acceptor. 6. Crude extracts of C. bogoriensis also contained acetyltransferase(s) catalyzing incorporation of [14C]acetate from [14C]acetyl coenzyme A into Ac2Glc2HDA (the diacetate of Glc2HDA) characterized by thin layer chromatographic comparison with the glycolipid isolated from C. bogoriensis cultures. 7. Acetone extraction of the lyophilized extracts, followed by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, freed the acetyl-transferase(s) of endogenous acceptor, making activity dependent upon added methyl Glc2HDA or its monoacetate as acceptor. Methyl GlcHDA was a poor acceptor for the acetyl groups. 8. In fermentor cultures the peak of glucosyltransferase 1 and 2 activities was reached in 1½ days and the peak of acetyltransferase activity was reached in 3 days. This time course is consistent with involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of extracellular Ac2Glc2HDA, and with the tentative conclusion that extracellular AcGlc2HDA and Glc2HDA were formed by deacetylation of Ac2Glc2HDA."
https://openalex.org/W1569155973,"(20R)-20-t-Butyl-5-pregnene-3β,20-diol, an analog of 20α-hydroxycholesterol, has been synthesized and its metabolism studied. Since C-22 in this synthetic compound is completely substituted, this position is unavailable for biological oxygenation. When injected intravenously into a rabbit, the t-butyl analog is metabolized to urinary pregnanediol. When incubated with sonicated mitochondria from bovine adrenal glands, it is converted into pregnenolone. Two mechanisms consistent with these findings are proposed; both predict the involvement of reactive, transient, intermediate complexes which are represented simply either as radical or ionic species. However, the actual mechanism may best be imagined to be some hybrid of these two extreme processes. These and other results form the basis of a new hypothesis for the pathways used for the biosynthesis of pregnenolone from cholesterol. In this scheme, the traditional side chain-hydroxylated compounds are not obligatory intermediates; rather, they are considered to be by-products resulting from competitive reactions of short lived, reactive species."
https://openalex.org/W1587504420,"Abstract Free ribosomes and membrane-bound ribosomes were prepared from cerebral cortex of 2-week-old rats using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation technique. Analysis of protein, RNA, and phospholipid contents of these ribosomes, as well as experiments in which radioactively labeled and unlabeled ribosomes were mixed together and separated, showed that there was no more than 5% cross-contamination between free and membrane-bound ribosomes. The requirements for in vitro incorporation of amino acids were similar for the two ribosomal preparations, but the membrane-bound ribosomes showed higher incorporation activity during brief incubation periods. Our results show that a higher proportion of polysomes or heavy ribosomal aggregates in the membrane-bound ribosomes could be one of the reasons for this activity. During prolonged incubation, the capacity of membrane-bound ribosomes to incorporate amino acids declined. This was accompanied by an accumulation of undetermined heat-labile and heat-stable inhibitors into the reaction medium. A larger proportion of polypeptides was completed and released by membrane-bound ribosomes as compared to free ribosomes. The pattern of labeling of ribosomal aggregates in vivo after intracerebral injection of [3H]leucine showed that, during the period immediately following the injection, polypeptides were synthesized mainly in the heavy aggregates of both free ribosomes and membrane-bound ribosomes. Subsequently, the radioactivity was progressively transferred from the heavy aggregates to the light aggregates, and this change occurred more rapidly in the free ribosomes than in the membrane-bound ribosomes. It is suggested that, in the course of polysome turnover in vivo in the cerebral cortex, the larger aggregates could be degraded to smaller aggregates and that membrane-bound ribosomes could be less susceptible than free ribosomes to this degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1505515713,"Abstract The time courses of degradation of 131I-insulins, with average incorporations of 0.5 to 6.0 atoms of iodine per molecule (molecular weight 6000), by supernatant fractions of rat liver homogenates were investigated. Degradation of 131I-insulin was determined by precipitability of 131I radioactivity in the incubation mixtures with 10% trichloroacetic acid and by isolation and quantitation of 131I-insulin and 131I-labeled degradation products through the use of electrophoresis on paper. As determined by both methods, the rate and extent of degradation of the 131I-insulins studied were inversely proportional to the amount of iodine attached to the hormone; but by the electrophoretic method, the differences among the iodoinsulins were more sharply defined. The degradation of 131I-insulin containing less than 1 atom of iodine per molecule was shown to proceed rapidly to completion by the electrophoretic method. However, as measured by the trichloroacetic acid method, degradation appeared to level off when approximately 60% of the 131I-insulin had been degraded. This was due to the fact that a portion of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products, such as iodotyrosines, was carried down with the protein which was precipitated in the incubation mixtures by trichloroacetic acid. 131I-Labeled degradation products migrated as a major peak toward the cathode at a slower rate than 131I-insulin. The major degradation product of a 131I-insulin preparation containing 0.8 atom of iodine per molecule was shown to have a mobility on Sephadex G-25 and an Rf value on paper chromatography characteristic of [131I]monoiodotyrosine. Tests for correspondence to a single reaction order revealed that all of the iodoinsulins studied by the electrophoretic method approximated second order kinetic behavior. The rate constants of the iodoinsulins containing less than 1 atom of iodine per molecule were almost 10-fold greater than the rate constant of iodoinsulin containing 6 atoms of iodine per molecule. No correspondence to any specific reaction order could be shown for any of the iodoinsulins by the trichloroacetic acid method. The decrease in reaction rate constant paralleled the decrease in biological activity resulting from increasing the average number of iodine atoms incorporated into the insulin molecule. The results indicate that 131I-insulins are rapidly degraded by proteolysis to simple amino acid constituents by the liver. Since neither labeled A nor B chains were identified at any time during degradation, the results neither confirm nor deny that reductive cleavage of interchain —S—S— bonds of insulins is an initial step in the degradation of insulin. The results also indicate that the trichloroacetic acid method has serious limitations when used for studying 131I-insulin degradation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1542037738,"Abstract A 100-fold purified preparation of Aspergillus niger α-mannosidase free of α- and β-galactosidases, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and 1,2-α-mannosidase has been obtained. Unlike many other mannosidases it is quite stable and hydrolyzes specific intersugar linkages involving nonreducing terminal mannose residues in large as well as small molecules. The enzyme hydrolyzes specifically 1,4-α- and 1,6-αmannosidic bonds to the adjoining mannose or N-acetylglucosamine residues. Therefore, 4-O-α- and 6-O-α-mannobioses and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-α- and 6-O-α-glucoses are readily hydrolyzed. The β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase-treated desialyzed glycoproteins or glycopeptides of α1 acid glycoprotein, fetuin, and human chorionic gonadotropin liberate mannose when digested with the enzyme. The enzyme, unlike other mannosidases, hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside very slowly. It is inhibited strongly by d-mannono-(1→5)-lactone but does not appear to be Zn++-dependent or inactivated by various chelating agents. The pH optimum for the enzyme is 4.2. It has Km and Vmax values of 1.2 x 10-3 and 8.2 x 10-3 m, and 12.3 and 41.3 µmoles per mg per hour for p-nitrophenylα-d-mannopyranoside and methyl 4-O-α-mannopyranosyl-α-d-mannopyranoside as substrates, respectively."

Three types of steroid protein complex corresponding to Peaks 1, 2, and 2a were eluted with an ionic gradient consisting of 0 to 0.8 m NaCl in Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetate buffer, pH 7.0. All three receptor peaks were present in vitro but only Peaks 2 and 2a were recovered in vivo. Under in vitro and in vivo conditions Peak 2 was confined to the cytosol fraction and Peak 2a to the nuclei fraction while the anomalous in vitro Peak 1 was found in cytosol and nuclei. A study of the in vitro binding of [1,2-3H]5α-dihydrotestosterone to nuclei yielded an association constant of 3.5 x 107 m-1 measured by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. Castration caused a decrease in binding of [1,2-3H]5α-dihydrotestosterone to nuclei and an increase in the binding to cytosol. No corresponding changes occurred in the binding of [1,2-3H]testosterone to these fractions. When the in vivo transfer of androgen from cytoplasm to nuclei was studied with pulse-chase methods, it was found that cytosol Peak 2 and nuclear Peak 2a proteins were labeled in sequence and that the amounts of radioactive androgen lost from one peak and gained by the second were almost equal. Moreover, the composition of the peaks with respect to testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone was virtually identical. Together this evidence indicates that the Peak 2 and Peak 2a proteins are important in promoting the intracellular transport of androgens in vivo."

The amount of d-glucose taken up and metabolized by the membrane preparation as well as the time course observed indicate that this uptake process represents transport into membrane-lined vesicles rather than binding to membrane fragments. Kinetic analyses in the presence and absence of sodium revealed that the uptake of d-glucose was mediated by two distinct systems: one with a high affinity and low capacity for glucose and a requirement for sodium ions; a second with low affinity and high capacity for glucose and no sodium requirement. Additional evidence for these two systems was obtained from experiments with other unlabeled sugars which showed qualitative and quantitative differences in inhibition of d-[14C]glucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1524085736,"The unusual fluorescence behavior of the pyridoxal-P coenzyme of phosphorylase b, which shows on excitation at 330 nm a maximal fluorescence emission at 535 nm, could be mimicked by model compounds of pyridoxal-P and various amines in hydrophobic solvents. Study of the model compounds indicated that the pyridoxal-P and the amine initially form a carbinol amine which, upon activation, yields a Schiff base. We conclude from these experiments that phosphorylase contains a similar carbinol amine structure in which the pyridoxal-P is bound, in addition to the e-amino group of a lysine, to a second group with nucleophilic character. This carbinol amine is split by light to form a Schiff base in the excited state which re-emits at its normal maximum of 535 nm. After falling from the excited state to the ground state, the original binding of the coenzyme may be restored. Difference spectra of phosphorylase b, upon addition of substrates, activators, and inhibitors, have been compared with difference spectra of pyridoxamine phosphate in dioxane and dioxane-water mixtures, and suggest that changes in the environment of the cofactor can affect the pK of the phenolic hydroxyl group and cause a broadening of the absorption spectrum."

The disaccharide has been synthesized by the condensation of α-acetobromomannose with 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-d-mannose followed by deacetylation of the resulting product. The enzyme shows a pH optimum of 4.8 and is stable in the pH range of 5.0 to 8.0. The Km and Vmax values for the enzyme are 2 mm and 1.3 µmoles per mg per min, respectively. The enzyme does not seem to be Zn++-dependent and is inhibited only weakly by d-mannono-(1→5)-lactone. The enzyme is highly specific for 1,2-α-d-mannosidic bonds and therefore readily hydrolyzes 2-O-α-mannobiose and 2-O-α-mannotriose. It does not hydrolyze 3-O-α-, 4-O-α-, and 6-O-α-mannobioses.

https://openalex.org/W1498025030,"Abstract The titration curves of the human hemoglobins A2 and F, the slow and fast components of horse hemoglobin, and bovine hemoglobin B have been analyzed, mainly to obtain information about the titration behavior of the histidines in these hemoglobins. The results were also compared with earlier data concerning human hemoglobin A and bovine hemoglobin A. In both hemoglobin A2 and F, 18 titratable histidines were found, two less than in hemoglobin A. Assuming that those histidyl residues which in the three-dimensional model occupy the same sites will show similar titration behavior, we reached the conclusion that in human hemoglobin histidine G19 and histidine H21 are titratable and that histidine G18 is not titratable. Both the slow and fast components of horse hemoglobin were found to contain 22 titratable histidines and 70 titratable carboxyl groups. Combining these results with the known number of amides in the α chain we calculated that the β chain should contain 11 amides. It appeared that in bovine hemoglobin B the histidines at B1(18)β, which are absent in bovine hemoglobin A, are titratable. The pK of these histidines, as estimated from the difference titration curve, is about 7.8, both in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. This high pK is probably caused by the formation of a saltbridge with the carboxyl group of aspartic acid B3(20)β in the same chain. Both hemoglobins contain 72 titratable carboxyl groups. Comparing the human, horse, and bovine hemoglobins, assuming again similar titration behavior for structurally identical histidines, we were able to correlate the titration results of human and horse hemoglobin. The human and bovine hemoglobins failed to show an equally good correlation, although the discrepancy was small."

The tryptophanase molecule dissociates in the presence of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride or 8 m urea, plus thiols, to produce four monomers homogeneous by the criterion of weight. The subunit molecular weight was also estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis following performic acid oxidation of the enzyme, borohydride reduction after incubation with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and treatment with 1 m hydroxylamine at pH 10. The apparent monomer molecular weight was calculated to be 50,500 ± 1800. Ultracentrifugal studies with the apoenzyme indicate that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate stabilizes the tetrameric form of the enzyme. Reversible dissociation of the apoenzyme is effected by lowering the protein concentration below 3 mg per ml or by raising the pH above 6. Tryptic peptide maps support the hypothesis that there are four identical monomer units, which may in turn contain a high degree of internal sequence homology."

More extensive electron microscopic study has revealed the presence of large quantities of these fibers at the periphery of intact cells. The majority of the fibers were found to remain associated with the ghosts isolated from Bacillus PP. Treatment of the ghosts at pH 11 resulted in release of the fibers, which were isolated and analyzed by chemical and physical methods. Disc gel electrophoresis in two systems and gel filtration indicate that the fibers are composed of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 31,000 to 33,000. The purity of the fibers was confirmed by amino acid analysis and by fingerprint analysis after tryptic digestion. Electron microscopic examination, physical and chemical analysis, and immunological studies showed that these fibers are unrelated to the flagella of Bacillus PP. Detailed electron microscopic studies revealed that the fibers were composed of bundles of fibrils having a diameter of 30 to 40 A and a regular wavelike structure. Under certain conditions these fibrils dissociated into single filaments 12 to 15 A in diameter. The function of these fibers and the nature of their association with the cytoplasmic membrane is unknown."
