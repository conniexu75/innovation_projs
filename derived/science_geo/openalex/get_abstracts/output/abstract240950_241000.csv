Their functions are well characterized and are central to maintaining cellular homeostasis and in promoting cell survival in response to stressful cellular conditions. However, several studies provide evidence that specific members of the HSP family might be secreted via an unidentified exocytotic pathway. Here we show that exosomes, small membrane vesicles that are secreted by numerous cell types, contribute to the release of HSP70 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both basal and stress-induced (heat shock at 40 or 43 °C for 1 h) states. HSP70 release from PBMCs is independent of the common secretory pathway because Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the classical protein transport pathway, did not block HSP70 release. Furthermore, we show that HSP70 release from PBMCs does not occur via a lipid raft-dependent pathway, because treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a raft-disrupting drug, had no affect on HSP70 release. To examine whether exosomes contributed to HSP70 release from PBMCs, exosomes were purified from PBMC cultures, and exosomal number and HSP70 content were determined. We demonstrate that although heat shock does not influence the exosomal secretory rate, the HSP70 content of exosomes isolated from heat shocked PBMCs is significantly higher than control. These data identify a novel secretory pathway by which HSP70 can be actively released from cells in both the basal and stress-induced state.

(s)) are a family of quintes-sentially intracellular proteins found in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes. HSP families include both constitutive and stress-inducible members whose primary function is to interact with naïve and denatured proteins to prevent the aggregation of aberrantly folded proteins, facilitate the folding of naïve proteins, facilitate the refolding of denatured proteins, and to aid intracellular protein trafficking (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Although these functions underscore the importance of intracellular HSPs in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and in promoting cell survival in response to stressful cellular conditions, accumulating evidence suggests that HSPs are actively secreted and have important extracellular functions. The concept that specific HSPs can be actively secreted was suggested ∼15 years ago following the demonstration that heat-shocked rat embryo cells rapidly released HSP70 and HSP110 (2Hightower L.E. Guidon Jr., P.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Importantly, several studies have confirmed these earlier findings, demonstrating that HSP70 is secreted from a variety of cell types in response to cellular stress (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G.

Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2004; 29: 1142-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The HSP70 protein lacks a secretory signal sequence, and, concordantly, cellular HSP70 release is unaffected by inhibitors of the common secretory pathway (2Hightower L.E. Guidon Jr., P.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that cellular HSP70 release may be the result of nonspecific processes, such as cell lysis, several lines of evidence argue against this notion (2Hightower L.E.

Physiol. 2002; 544: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two recent studies have provided evidence that specialized membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts, may play a role in HSP70 exocytosis (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G.

Given the critical intracellular roles played by HSPs it may appear counterintuitive that a secretory pathway exists allowing cells to release HSPs both basally and in response to cellular stress. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific members of the HSP family possess potent immunoregulatory functions (8Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J.

Recombinant human HSP70 stimulates the production of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-12 and promotes the up-regulation of co-stimulatory (CD86) and antigen presenting major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules in monocytes and dendritic cells (11Asea A.

Furthermore, cell surface-bound HSP70 renders tumor cells more sensitive to natural killer cell-mediated cytolytic attack (14Gross C. Koelch W. DeMaio A. Arispe N. Multhoff G. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 4341-4350PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have led to the hypothesis that extracellular HSPs, released either as a result of cellular necrosis or via a stress-induced exocytotic pathway, may act as a potent danger signal to the immune system (9Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. Ghose S. Kirschning C.J. Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-15112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 16Campisi J.L. Leem T.H. Fleshner M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments were aimed at determining whether heat shock at physiological/pathophysiological temperatures, i.e. during febrile states, stimulated the release of HSPs. Interestingly, in the course of conducting these studies, we were unable to confirm a role for lipid rafts in either heat shock-induced or basal HSP70 release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Almost 10 years ago, Multhoff and Hightower (17Multhoff G. Hightower L.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that exosomes, 60–80-nm vesicles secreted following the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane, may provide a secretory pathway allowing cells to actively release specific HSPs. The concept of the exosome was initially formed following the observation that maturing reticulocytes “shed” transferrin receptors. Although MVBs have a well established role in the degradation of proteins via fusion with the lysosome, further studies in reticulocytes demonstrated that small vesicles within MVBs could be secreted into the extracellular environment via fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane (18Fevrier B. Raposo G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, recent research has identified many proteins associated with exosomes, including several molecules with crucial roles in the initiation of immune responses (19Zitvogel L. Regnault A. Lozier A. Wolfers J. Flament C. Tenza D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify exosomes as mediators of basal and stress-induced HSP70 secretion from PBMCs. These data identify a novel secretory pathway by which PBMCs are able to actively release HSP70. Reagents, Media, and Antibodies—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose), α minimal essential medium, RPMI 1640 cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Invitrogen. Dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, acetylthiocholine, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), Brefeldin A (BFA), and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBC) were obtained from Sigma. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) viability assay was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Cholesterol concentrations were determined using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit from Molecular Probes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Human insulin was obtained from Novonordisk (Bagsværd, DK). Bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were from Pierce Biotechnology. The antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents, BC, Canada) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The HSP70 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were from Stressgen Bioreagents. Cell Culture—PBMCs were isolated from freshly drawn peripheral venous blood obtained from healthy volunteers using the Ficoll-Paque separation technique. Briefly, whole blood was diluted in PBS and layered over 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque. Following centrifugation at 1400 × g for 30–40 min, the interphase (mononuclear cells) layer was collected and washed in PBS. Following centrifugation at 1200 × g for 10 min the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended and washed in PBS. Following a final centrifugation at 900 × g the supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 2–3 ml of cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were then counted on a hemocytometer and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells·ml-1 before being added to either 6- or 24-well tissue culture plates. L6 myoblasts and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to 70–80% confluence in 75 cm2 flasks then seeded into 6-cm plates. Myoblasts were grown in α minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and differentiated into myotubes at ∼80% confluence in media containing 2% horse serum (3–4 days). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) with 10% fetal calf serum and were differentiated into adipocytes 2 days postconfluence with the addition of 5% serum, insulin (0.5 milliunits·ml-1), dexamethasone (0.1 μg·ml-1), and isobutylmethylxanthine (25 μg·ml-1) for 2 nights, followed by a further 2 nights in medium containing only serum and insulin, after which most cells had accumulated lipid droplets. Insulin was then removed for 48 h, upon which time cells were ready for experimentation. Heat Shock—Cells were exposed to heat shock, either 40 or 43 °C, or control conditions (37 °C) for 60 min in humidified incubators. Cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h to allow for the synthesis and release of HSPs. Exosome Isolation—Fetal bovine serum contains endogenous exosomes; therefore, prior to experiments in which exosomes were to be examined cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) was centrifuged overnight at 110,000 × g to remove endogenous exosomes. Exosomes were isolated according to the protocol of Savina et al. (20Savina A. Furlan M. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20083-20090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Briefly, exosomes were collected from 6 ml of PBMC medium (6 × 106 cells) cultured over 2–6 h. The culture media were collected on ice and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to pellet any cellular debris. Exosomes were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 15 h. The exosomal pellet was washed once in PBS and then resuspended in 200 μl of PBS (exosome fraction). Exosome Quantification—To quantify the amount of exosomes released we assessed the activity of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that is specific to these vesicles (21Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylcholinesterase activity was assessed as described by Savina et al. (20Savina A. Furlan M. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20083-20090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of the exosome fraction was suspended in 110 μl of PBS. 37.5 μl of this PBS-diluted exosome fraction was then added to individual wells on a 96-well flat bottomed microplate. 1.25 mm acetylthiocholine and 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were then added to exosome fractions in a final volume of 300 μl, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored every 5 min. The data presented represent acetylcholinesterase enzymatic activity after 30 min of incubation. Protein Determination—Cell pellets (intracellular), cell culture media (extracellular) and exosome fractions were collected following various treatment conditions. Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were then spun at 16,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C), and protein concentrations were determined. For Western blotting, 40 μg of sample was then added to 4× Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 85 °C, and the proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE along with a molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% skim milk, and probed overnight with an antibody against HSP70 (anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody diluted to 1:1000) followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody diluted to 1:2000. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate, and the protein bands were imaged and quantified on a Chemidoc EQ system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). To determine the intracellular and extracellular (exosomal and cell culture supernatant) concentrations of HSP70 from control and heat-shocked cells, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were determined using commercially available reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perturbations in Intracellular Protein Trafficking—Cells (1 × 106) were pretreated with BFA (10 μg·ml-1) for 1 h, after which they were exposed to heat shock or control conditions followed by a 4-h recovery period, i.e. cells were exposed to BFA for the duration of the experiment (6 h). The efficacy of the BFA treatment in inhibiting protein secretion via the classical protein transport pathway was confirmed by analyzing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α and IFN-γ in supernatants obtained from PBMCs stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide, or phorbol 12-myeistate 13-acetate and ionomycin. Cholesterol Depletion—To deplete cellular cholesterol, cells (1 × 106) were pretreated with MBC (5 or 10 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed, centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g, and resuspended in MBC-free medium for the duration of the experiment. The cell pellets were collected, and the intracellular cholesterol concentrations were determined using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. LDH—LDH was determined on a microplate reader at 492 nm using a commercial kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were performed using the paired samples Student's t test or repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) where appropriate. Where a significant F ratio was found (RM ANOVA) differences between means were inspected with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post-hoc test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Temperature-induced Cellular Stress Increases Intra- and Extracellular HSP70 in Multiple Cell Types—To examine the cellular ubiquity of HSP70 release, we examined whether heat shock (40 or 43 °C for 1 h followed by recovery at 37 °C for 4 h) induced the active release of HSP70 compared with control conditions (37 °C for 5 h). As expected, heat shock (43 °C) resulted in a marked accumulation of intracellular HSP70 compared with control in L6 myotubes (Fig. 1A), 3T3 L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1C), and PBMCs (Fig. 1E). In response to control conditions, HSP70 was detectable in the extracellular media obtained from 3T3 L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1D) and PBMCs (Fig. 1F). Concordant with previous work (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we observed a marked increase in the extracellular concentration of HSP70 following heat shock (43 °C) in each of the cell types examined (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). Furthermore, heat shock at 40 °C (a temperature typically reached during febrile states) induced the release of HSP70 from PBMCs (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, this increase was observed despite no apparent increase in the intracellular concentration of HSP70 (Fig. 1E). To determine whether heat shock had any cytotoxic affects, the LDH concentration in the cell culture media was determined. Crucially, heat shock (40 or 43 °C) had no effect on LDH release (data not shown) compared with control (37 °C). In addition, we performed trypan blue exclusion analysis. Cell viability was always greater than 90%, and we did not observe any differences between heat shock (40 or 43 °C) and control (37 °C) conditions. These data demonstrate that heat shock induces the release of HSP70 from a variety of cell types and that this release is independent of cell death. HSP70 Release Is Unaffected by Inhibition of the Common Secretory Pathway or the Disruption of Lipid Rafts—To examine the involvement of the common secretory pathway in HSP70 release PBMCs were pretreated for 1 h with BFA (a fungal metabolite that inhibits protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi) and then exposed to either heat shock or control conditions as described above (BFA remained in the cell culture medium for the duration of the experiment). Treatment with BFA had no affect on the intracellular HSP70 concentration (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, HSP70 release was unaffected by BFA treatment following control (37°) or heat shock (40 or 43 °C) conditions (Fig. 2B). BFA treatment had no effect on LDH release (data not shown). These data support previous findings (2Hightower L.E. Guidon Jr., P.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that in PBMCs the common secretory pathway does not play a role in either basal or heat shock-induced HSP70 release. It has recently been shown that lipid rafts play a role in heat shock-induced HSP70 release from epithelial cells (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is the major lipid component of lipid rafts and is required for maintaining raft stability. MBC is a pharmacological agent that specifically depletes cellular cholesterol and consequently causes a disruption to raft functioning (22Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether lipid rafts were involved in HSP70 release from PBMCs, PBMCs were treated with MBC (5 or 10 mm for 1 h) and then exposed to either heat shock or control conditions as described above (following 1 h of MBC treatment, PBMCs were resuspended in MBC-free cell culture medium for the duration of the experiment). MBC treatment had little affect on intracellular HSP70 at 37 or 40 °C; however, PBMCs exposed to 43 °C for 1 h in the presence of either 5 or 10 mm MBC had a significantly attenuated intracellular HSP70 response (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we observed no affect of MBC treatment on the release of HSP70 following either control (37 °C) or heat (40 °C) shock conditions (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, despite the marked attenuation of intracellular HSP70 accumulation at 43 °C by MBC treatment, no affect of MBC was observed on HSP70 release following heat shock at 43 °C (Fig. 2D). To confirm the efficacy of our MBC treatment regimen, we determined the cellular cholesterol concentration in PBMCs treated with either 5 or 10 mm MBC for 1 h or that were untreated (control). MBC treatment was highly effective in removing cholesterol with 5 and 10 mm MBC causing a reduction in cellular cholesterol content by 35 and 65% respectively, compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 2E). These data do not support a role for lipid rafts in either basal or heat shock-induced HSP70 release from PBMCs. Interestingly, treatment of PBMCs with 10 mm MBC for 1 h resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in LDH release compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2F). In the study by Broquet et al. (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), Caco-2 epithelial cells were treated with 10 mm MBC for 6 h. To examine the possibility that the inhibitory effects of MBC treatment on HSP70 release observed by Broquet et al. (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) may be the result of nonspecific, cytotoxic effects, PBMCs were pre-incubated with 10 mm MBC for 1 h and then exposed to either heat shock or control conditions (1 h at 37 or 43 °C followed by recovery at 37 °C for 4 h). As in the study by Broquet et al. (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with MBC for the duration of the experiment (6 h). As expected, exposure of PBMCs to 10 mm MBC for 6 h resulted in a marked increase in the release of LDH (∼6-fold compared with untreated cells), suggesting that this treatment was highly cytotoxic (Fig. 3C). Consistent with our previous data, heat shock (43 °C) resulted in an increase in both the intracellular and extracellular HSP70 concentrations compared with 37 °C (Fig. 3, A and B, Control). Interestingly, although treatment of PBMCs with 10 mm MBC for 6 h resulted in a total ablation of intracellular HSP70, the extracellular HSP70 concentration was increased, relative to control PBMCs, in both 37 and 43 °C conditions (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that exposure of PBMCs to cytotoxic levels of MBC results in an increase in the extracellular HSP70 concentration, most likely because of the MBC-induced degradation in plasma membrane integrity and subsequent “leaking” of HSP70 into the extracellular environment. An Exosome-dependent Pathway Contributes to the Release of HSP70 from PBMCs in Both Basal and Stress-induced Conditions—It has been hypothesized previously that exosomes may provide a vehicle by which cells can actively release HSP70 (17Multhoff G. Hightower L.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether exosomes play a role in HSP70 secretion in both the basal and stress-induced state, we exposed PBMCs to heat shock (1 h at 43 °C followed by 4 h at 37 °C) or control (5 h at 37 °C) conditions. Exosomes were purified according to the method of Savina et al. (20Savina A. Furlan M. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20083-20090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and exosomal HSP70 content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To confirm the validity of the exosome isolation procedure, a series of exosome standards were created. FBS contains endogenous exosomes; therefore, FBS was diluted in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium to obtain final FBS concentrations of 20, 10, 5, 2.5, and 0%. Exosomes were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the number of exosomes purified from the standards was quantified via the determination of exosomal acetylcholinesterase activity, an enzyme specific to exosomes (Fig. 4A). Exosomes are released in the basal state; therefore, to further validate our exosome isolation procedure we purified exosomes from PBMCs cultured for 1, 3, or 5 h. As expected, the greater the duration of the PBMC culture period, the greater the acetylcholinesterase activity we observed, i.e. the greater the number of exosomes secreted (Fig. 4B). A number of proteins are found in exosomes (23Hegmans J.P. Bard M.P. Hemmes A. Luider T.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Prins J.B. Zitvogel L. Burgers S.A. Hoogsteden H.C. Lambrecht B.N. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1807-1815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) including several HSPs, i.e. HSP90, HSP90α, and HSC70. To examine whether HSP70 is also expressed in exosomes, purified exosomes from PBMCs cultured for 1, 3, or 5 h were probed with an anti-HSP70 antibody. HSP70 was robustly detectable in exosomes isolated at each time point (Fig. 4C). To examine whether exosomes play a role in the release of HSP70 from stressed cells, PBMCs were exposed to heat shock (40 or 43 °C for 1 h followed by a 4-h recovery at 37 °C) or control (37 °C for 5 h) conditions and exosomes were purified as described previously. We hypothesized that heat shock may influence HSP70 release via exosomes in three ways, 1) heat shock may augment the exosome secretory rate, 2) heat shock may augment HSP70 content per exosome, and 3) heat shock may augment HSP70 release via a combination of these processes. Although we observed no significant differences in the number of exosomes secreted in response to heat shock (Fig. 4D), the amount of HSP70 within isolated exosomes was significantly greater in heat-shocked PBMCs compared with control (Fig. 4E). In the current series of experiments we have demonstrated a novel secretory pathway for HSP70 cellular export. Our data show that HSP70 is expressed within exosomes and that exosomes contribute to the release of HSP70 from PBMCs in both the basal and stress-induced state. Although heat shock had no effect on the exosome secretory rate, exosomal HSP70 content was increased in heat-shocked cells. In addition, our data do not support a role for either the common cellular secretory pathway or lipid rafts in the etiology of stress protein export from PBMCs into the extracellular environment. Consistent with previous data (2Hightower L.E. Guidon Jr., P.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we found that the release of HSP70 from PBMCs occurs by a mechanism other than the common secretory pathway, because BFA, an inhibitor of protein transport via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi, did not influence HSP70 release. However, and in contrast to previous work (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), our results do not support a role for lipid rafts in HSP70 release from PBMCs. In previous studies (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 5Hunter-Lavin C. Davies E.L. Bacelar M.M. Marshall M.J. Andrew S.M. Williams J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the involvement of lipid rafts in HSP70 secretion has been examined by treating cells with the lipid raft-disrupting drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The efficacy of MBC in disrupting lipid raft integrity is dependent on its ability to remove cellular cholesterol, an integral component of lipid rafts essential to the maintenance of raft stability. In our experiments, treatment of PBMCs with MBC, at concentrations that potently remove cellular cholesterol, had no effect on HSP70 release in either the basal or stress-induced state. Treatment of PBMCs with MBC at 10 mm for 6 h (an identical concentration and exposure period to that used in the study by Broquet et al. (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)) was cytotoxic. Therefore, we hypothesized that the previously observed inhibitory effect of MBC on HSP70 release (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) may be a consequence of MBC cytotoxicity. However, our results clearly demonstrate that HSP70 release from PBMCs treated with 10 mm MBC for 6 h was greater than in untreated control cells. It is likely that this increase in HSP70 release is as a consequence of the MBC-induced degradation in plasma membrane integrity, resulting in the subsequent leaking of HSP70 from the cytosol into the extracellular environment. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that MBC inhibited the secretion of HSP70 from PBMCs, and, therefore, it was suggested that lipid rafts are involved in this process (5Hunter-Lavin C. Davies E.L. Bacelar M.M. Marshall M.J. Andrew S.M. Williams J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The concentrations of MBC typically used to disrupt lipid raft function, i.e. remove cellular cholesterol, are 3–10 mm. Indeed, in preliminary experiments, we have demonstrated that 1 mm MBC treatment results in a very small (∼5%) decrease in PBMC cholesterol levels. Given that the lipid raft-disrupting effects of MBC are as a consequence of the depletion of cellular cholesterol and that the concentration of MBC used in the study by Hunter-Lavin et al. (5Hunter-Lavin C. Davies E.L. Bacelar M.M. Marshall M.J. Andrew S.M. Williams J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was ∼0.02 mm (cellular cholesterol levels were not determined in this study), the conclusion that lipid rafts play a role in HSP70 release from PBMCs is, based on these data, unsubstantiated. Based on our findings, and those of Broquet et al. (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), it would therefore appear that distinct exocytotic processes operate in different cell types to facilitate the release of HSP70. Indeed, it is known that exosomes are secreted from several hematopoietic cells, e.g. T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and platelets (24Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the cellular ubiquity of HSP70 release, PBMCs, epithelial cells (3Broquet A.H. Thomas G. Masliah J. Trugnan G. Bachelet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), myotubes, adipocytes, and glia (4Guzhova I. Kislyakova K. Moskaliova O. Fridlanskaya I. Tytell M. Cheetham M. Margulis B. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) have all been shown to release HSP70, future studies will be required to confirm the involvement of specific exocytotic pathways in HSP70 release from different cell types. Although heat shock at 40 °C for 1 h resulted in a moderate increase (∼75%) in HSP70 release, heat shock at 43 °C for 1 h resulted in a marked increase (∼400%) in HSP70 release, compared with control (37 °C) (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, although we observed a large increase in exosomal HSP70 content at 40 °C, compared with 37 °C, heat shock at 43 °C resulted in a relatively small further increase in exosomal HSP70 content compared with heat shock at 40 °C (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these data suggest that although exosomes contribute to the release of HSP70 in the basal (37 °C) and stress-induced (40 and 43 °C) state, an additional mechanism is likely to play a role in HSP70 release at 43 °C. In the present series of studies we have assessed LDH release to quantify the rate of cell death. Our data clearly show that heat shock per se does not influence LDH release. However, it is important to note that cell death does occur in a low percentage of cells over the duration of the culture period. We hypothesize that the large increase in HSP70 release from PBMCs exposed to 43 °C for 1 h may be related, in part, to the marked increase in the intracellular HSP70 level and the subsequent leaking of HSP70 into the extracellular milieu via a simple mass-action effect. Future studies will be required to examine this hypothesis. Our studies do not identify the functional consequence of HSP70 release via exosomes. However, recent studies suggest an important role for exosomes in the modulation of immune responses. Specifically, exosomes purified from B-lymphocytes (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) and dendritic cells (19Zitvogel L. Regnault A. Lozier A. Wolfers J. Flament C. Tenza D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar) are enriched in MHCI and MHCII molecules and T-cell co-stimulatory molecules and stimulate T-lymphocytes. These data have led to the suggestion that secreted exosomes expressing relevant peptide-MHC complexes may play a role in the generation of immune responses in vivo (26Thery C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the treatment of dendritic cells with HSP70 up-regulates the expression of MHCII and T-lymphocyte co-stimulatory molecules (11Asea A. Rehli M. Kabingu E. Boch J.A. Bare O. Auron P.E. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar) and induces potent, T-lymphocyte-mediated, anti-tumor immunity (27Feng H. Zeng Y. Graner M.W. Likhacheva A. Katsanis E. Blood. 2003; 101: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Given that 1) HSP70 and purified exosomes have a considerable degree of functional homology, and 2) HSP70 is abundantly expressed within secreted exosomes, we suggest that the immunogenicity of secreted exosomes may, in part, be because of the presence of HSP70. An intriguing aspect of the present work is how is HSP70 targeted to exosomes? MVBs, the organelles from which exosomes are derived, are generated from the fusion of early endosomes and have a well established role in the degradation of proteins internalized from the cell surface via fusion with lysosomes (18Fevrier B. Raposo G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). However, in addition to fusion with lysosomes, MVBs are able to undergo exocytotic fusion with the plasma membrane and release their “intraluminal vesicles” (the term for exosomes while they are contained within the MVBs) (24Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, HSP70 is highly expressed on the cell surface (14Gross C. Koelch W. DeMaio A. Arispe N. Multhoff G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41173-41181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Multhoff G. Hightower L.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that cell surface-bound HSP70 is initially internalized via early endosomes and subsequently incorporated into MVBs before being secreted via the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. On the basis of early findings demonstrating that exosomes mediate tumor rejection (19Zitvogel L. Regnault A. Lozier A. Wolfers J. Flament C. Tenza D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), exosomes isolated from monocyte-derived dendritic cells have been tested for the immunotherapy of cancer patients (26Thery C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). Exosomes contain many proteins essential to the generation of immune responses, e.g. MHCI and MH-CII, CD81, CD86, and CD11b, and, as discussed above, the presence of HSP70 within exosomes may also contribute to exosome immunogenicity. Given the known immunostimulatory properties of HSP70, and our data demonstrating that the HSP70 content of exosomes is significantly increased following a transient heat shock, it is an intriguing possibility that the immunogenicity of clinical grade exosomes for use in cancer vaccines may be enhanced by exposing cells to transient, sublethal heat shock. In conclusion, we show for the first time that exosomes contribute to HSP70 release from PBMCs in both the basal (37 °C) and stress-induced (40 or 43 °C for 1 h) state. Furthermore, although lipid rafts contribute to the release of HSP70 from heat-shocked epithelial cells, our results suggest that lipid rafts do not contribute to HSP70 release from PBMCs. Given the known immunomodulatory functions of both recombinant HSP70 and purified exosomes and that HSP70 is highly expressed within exosomes, we suggest that exosomal HSP70 may account for some of the immunostimulatory properties of exosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2044643318,"The chemically most primitive stars provide constraints on the nature of the first stellar objects that formed in the Universe; elements other than hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium within these objects were generated by nucleosynthesis in the very first stars. The relative abundances of elements in the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several models have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of the giant star HE 0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of heavy elements known. Here we report the discovery of HE 1327-2326, a subgiant or main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower than that of HE 0107-5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances of HE 1327-2326, however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: none predicts the high Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion mechanism consistent with data available for the most metal-poor stars."

Herein we show that FC accumulation in macrophages leads to the induction and secretion of two inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The increases in TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein were mediated by FC-induced activation of the IκB kinase/NF-κB pathway as well as activation of MKK3/p38, Erk1/2, and JNK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Activation of IκB kinase and JNK1/2 was needed for the induction of both cytokines. However, MKK3/p38 signaling was specifically involved in TNF-α induction, and Erk1/2 signaling was required for IL-6. Most interestingly, activation of all of the signaling pathways and induction of both cytokines required cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The CHOP branch of the unfolded protein response, an ER stress pathway, was required for Erk1/2 activation and IL-6 induction. In contrast, one or more other ER-related pathways were responsible for activation of p38, JNK1/2, and IκB kinase/NF-κB and for the induction of TNF-α. These data suggest a novel scenario in which cytokines are induced in macrophages by endogenous cellular events triggered by excess ER cholesterol rather than by exogenous immune cell mediators.

Moreover, this model may help explain the relationship between FC accumulation and inflammation in vulnerable plaques. Macrophages are the most prominent cell type in atherosclerotic lesions and are associated with two hallmarks of the disease, lipid deposition and inflammation (1Linton M.F. Fazio S. Int. J. Obes.

Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which subsequently internalize large amount of atherogenic, cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particles (4Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In the early stages of atherosclerosis, most of the internalized cholesterol is stored as cholesteryl-fatty acid esters, resulting in “foam cell” formation. As a lesion becomes more advanced, however, there is a progressive decrease in the cholesteryl ester content and a reciprocal increase in the unesterified, or “free” cholesterol (FC) 1The abbreviations used are: FC, free cholesterol; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; Erk, extracellular signal-related kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IL-6, interleukin-6; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response; LDL, low density lipoprotein; IKK, IκB kinase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. content (5Rapp J.H.

FC accumulation is a potent inducer of macrophage apoptosis and secondary necrosis, which is thought to contribute to lesional necrosis and plaque disruption, leading to acute atherothrombotic cardiovascular events (8Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 9Zhou J. Chew M. Ravn H.B. Falk E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. Suppl. 1999; 230: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, the mechanism of FC-induced macrophage apoptosis involves overloading the normally cholesterol poor and fluid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (10Li Y. Ge M. Ciani L. Kuriakose G. Westover E.J. Dura M. Covey D.F. Freed J.H. Maxfield F.R. Lytton J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37030-37039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This event, which leads to an abnormal “stiffening” of the ER membrane, activates the ER stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (11Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 12Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). A particular branch of the UPR pathway involving the effector protein CHOP then triggers apoptosis (13Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Another key characteristic of advanced, or “vulnerable,” atherosclerotic lesions is the presence of a variety of inflammatory cytokines, many of which are thought to be secreted by macrophages (14Aikawa M. Libby P. Can. J. Cardiol. 2004; 20: 631-634PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fan J. Watanabe T. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2003; 10: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Raines E.W. Ross R.

However, it remains largely unknown how the inflammation is triggered and what inflammatory pathways are involved. The typical model, which is based upon processes in non-atherosclerotic inflammatory lesions, envisions immune cell mediators triggering cytokine induction in lesional macrophages. Herein we present evidence for a new model in which endogenous, FC-mediated signaling events in macrophages are sufficient to induce the synthesis of two inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. As with FC-induced apoptosis, cytokine induction requires FC-mediated ER stress pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK inflammatory signaling pathways. This new model may help explain the relationship between FC accumulation and the inflammatory component of plaque vulnerability in advanced atherosclerosis.

FC loading was effected by incubating the cells with acetyl-LDL (100 μg/ml) and compound 58035 (10 μg/ml) in the aforementioned medium for various times. Note that most of the experiments shown in this study were also conducted in macrophages elicited by the intraperitoneal concanavalin A method (10Li Y. Ge M. Ciani L. Kuriakose G. Westover E.J.

Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from macrophages using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). 0.5 μl of cDNA was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR amplification using Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for TNF-α were CGGAGTCCGGGCAGGT and GCTGGGTAGAGAATGGATGAACA, respectively, and the probe was 6FAM-CTTTGGAGTCATTGCTCTGTGAAGGGAATG. The forward and reverse primers for IL-6 were GAGGATACCACTCCCAACAGACC and AAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACA, respectively, and the probe was 6FAMCAGAATTGCCATTGCACAACTCTTTTCTCA. 36B4 was used as the internal control, the forward and reverse primers for 36B4 were AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT and GTTCTTGCCCATCAGCACC, respectively, the probe was CAL-CGCTCCGAGGGAAGGCCG. The reactions were run on a MX4000 multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene), the thermal profile settings were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Nuclear Fractionation—Cells on 35-mm plates were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice. 100 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol, plus protease inhibitors) was added, and the plate was put on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were scraped from the plates, and cell clumps were disrupted by repetitive pipetting. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 min, and the supernatant was collected (cytoplasmic fraction). The pellet was resuspended into 20 μl of Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol; plus protease inhibitors) by vortexing at the highest setting for 5 min and then at the medium setting for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected (nuclear fraction). Cytokine Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Cells on 12-well plates were incubated with acetyl-LDL, 58035, or acetyl-LDL plus 58035 for various times. In certain experiments, cells were incubated as above for 9 h, the incubation media were removed, and then the cells were washed twice and incubated with fresh media for various times. At the end of the incubation period, the media were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the media were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assays were performed in the Cytokine Core Laboratory (Baltimore, MD). Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Pierce). IKK Activity Assay—IKK assays were performed as described previously (25Schwabe R.F. Bennett B.L. Manning A.M. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in the Triton lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. 200 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of anti-IKKγ for 2 h, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C using glutathione S-transferase-IκB 1-54. The supernatant from the kinase reactions was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Equal substrate loading was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. Equal immunoprecipitate of IKK was shown by loading the beads onto SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotting for IKKγ. Whole-cell Cholesterol Esterification Assay—Macrophages were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2% BSA containing 0.1 mm [14C]oleate complexed with albumin and 100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL for 5 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, air-dried, and then extracted twice with 500 μl of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Cholesterol esterification activity was determined by measuring the cellular content of cholesteryl [14C]oleate by thin-layer chromatography. The cells were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and assayed for protein by the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments unless stated otherwise. Absent error bars in the bar graphs signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. FC Loading of Macrophages Induces the Synthesis and Secretion of TNF-α and IL-6—Our recent in vivo study showed that macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL plus the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor 58035 are a good model of FC-loaded macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions (23Feng B. Zhang D. Kuriakose G. Devlin C.M. Kockx M. Tabas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10423-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, the data described below were confirmed using acetyl-LDL-incubated macrophages from acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1-deficient mice (not shown), which was also shown to be relevant for advanced atherosclerosis in vivo (27Fazio S. Major A.S. Swift L.L. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Using the acetyl-LDL/58035 model, we assayed the mRNA level of a number of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β, and MIP-2 in macrophages. FC loading with acetyl-LDL plus 58035 led to a marked increase of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 1A) but did not affect the other cytokines mentioned above. Acetyl-LDL (cholesteryl ester loading) or 58035 alone did not alter the transcription of any of the cytokines. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we showed that both TNF-α and IL-6 were detected in the medium of FC-loaded cells but not in the medium of macrophages incubated with either acetyl-LDL or 58035 alone (Fig. 1B). This latter observation emphasizes the requirement for FC loading and rules out endotoxin contamination of the reagents as an explanation for cytokine induction. Moreover, in a related study, we demonstrated the biological activity of the secreted TNF-α by showing its ability to induce ABCA1 in neighboring macrophages. 2M. Gerbod-Giannone, Y. Li, A. Holleboom, D. Mangelsdorf, I. Tabas, and A. R. Tall, submitted manuscript. We noticed that FC-induced TNF-α mRNA and protein secretion peaked prior to that of IL-6. Because TNF-α is a known inducer of a number of cytokines including IL-6, we considered the possibility that IL-6 induction was a secondary effect of FC-induced TNF-α release. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, IL-6 mRNA was elevated to the same degree in FC-loaded Tnfa+/+ and Tnfa–/– macrophages. We also showed that IL-6 induction was not diminished by a TNF-α-blocking antibody (Fig. 2B). Thus, IL-6 induction is independent of TNF-α secretion in FC-loaded macrophages. Cholesterol Trafficking to the Endoplasmic Reticulum Is Required for TNF-α and IL-6 Induction—FC-induced macrophage apoptosis is dependent on cholesterol trafficking to the ER, which triggers the ER-based stress pathway known as the UPR (13Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Macrophages from mice with a heterozygous mutation in the cholesterol-trafficking protein NPC1 have a specific defect in transporting lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the ER, and Npc1+/– macrophages are resistant to FC-induced UPR and apoptosis (23Feng B. Zhang D. Kuriakose G. Devlin C.M. Kockx M. Tabas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10423-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when FC-loaded macrophages were treated with nanomolar concentrations of the amphipathic amine U18666A, which also selectively blocks cholesterol trafficking to the ER (13Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether cholesterol trafficking to the ER was also required for TNF-α and IL-6 induction. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of 70 nm U18666A completely suppressed FC-induced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA elevations. Similarly, TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA in Npc1+/– macrophages remained at basal levels upon FC loading (data not shown). Thus, cholesterol trafficking to the ER is a key event in the induction of TNF-α and IL-6 by FC loading. FC Loading of Macrophages Activates the NF-κB Pathway, Which Is Required for the Full Induction of TNF-α and IL-6— Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 in a wide variety of systems (28Azzolina A. Bongiovanni A. Lampiasi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1643: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Jeong H.J. Koo H.N. Na H.J. Kim M.S. Hong S.H. Eom J.W. Kim K.S. Shin T.Y. Kim H.M. Cytokine. 2002; 18: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether FC loading of macrophages leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway. As shown in Fig. 4A, a gradual accumulation of p65 NF-κB in the nuclei was detected in FC-loaded, but not acetyl-LDL-loaded, macrophages over a prolonged period of time. In addition, robust IKK kinase activity was detected (Fig. 4B). 70 nm U18666A completely blocked FC-induced IKK activation and p65 NF-κB translocation (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that NF-κB activation depended on cholesterol trafficking to the ER. To examine the role of NF-κB activation in TNF-α and IL-6 induction, macrophages were loaded with FC in the absence and presence of a specific IKK inhibitor, PS1145. 10 μm PS1145 completely blocked FC-induced p65 translocation (Fig. 4D), and it markedly suppressed FC-induced elevation of TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 4E). Importantly, cellular cholesterol uptake and trafficking to the ER were not affected by PS1145 (data not shown). Therefore, FC loading of macrophages activates the IKK/NF-κB pathway, which is required for the full induction of TNF-α and IL-6. FC Loading of Macrophages Leads to Sustained Activation of p38, Erk1/2, and JNK1/2 MAP Kinases, Which Differentially Regulate TNF-α and IL-6 Induction—MAP kinase signaling pathways have been reported to mediate TNF-α and IL-6 in a variety of biological systems, and the transcription factors resulting from these pathways often act in concert with NF-κB transcription factors to induce inflammatory cytokines (30Jiang J.X. Zhang Y. Ji S.H. Zhu P. Wang Z.G. Shock. 2002; 18: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Kim S.H. Kim J. Sharma R.P. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 49: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that MAP kinases are involved in TNF-α and/or IL-6 induction in FC-loaded macrophages, we first examined the activation of the three MAP kinase signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 5A, robust and sustained phosphorylation of all three MAP kinases, p38, Erk1/2, and JNK1/2, was observed upon FC loading. There are a number of upstream kinases that may activate p38 kinase, notably MKK3 and MKK6. Fig. 5B demonstrates that FC-induced p38 phosphorylation was abolished in MKK3-deficient macrophages, indicating FC-induced p38 activation is mediated through MKK3. 70 nm U18666A completely blocked the phosphorylation of all three MAP kinases (Fig. 5C), implying that MAP kinase activation, like apoptosis and NF-κB activation, is dependent on cholesterol trafficking to the ER. To test the functional significance of p38 activation in cytokine induction, we assayed TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA in Mkk3+/+ versus Mkk3–/– macrophages. As shown in Fig. 6A, the FC-induced TNF-α mRNA level was abolished in Mkk3–/– macrophages, whereas IL-6 mRNA levels were not affected by MKK3 deficiency. The role of Erk1/2 MAP kinase signaling was assessed using PD98058 and U0126, which are two specific inhibitors of the upstream MAPK kinase activators of Erk1/2 and MEK1/2. As shown in Fig. 6B, when the cells were loaded with FC in the presence of 10 μm PD98058 or 2.5 μm U0126, IL-6 induction was abolished, whereas TNF-α was not affected. The role of JNK1/2 MAP kinase signaling in the induction of TNF-α and IL-6 was assessed using a specific inhibitor against JNK1/2, SP600125. Fig. 6C shows that when the macrophages were loaded with FC in the presence of 10 μm SP600125, TNF-α induction was suppressed completely, and IL-6 was inhibited by ∼50%. At the concentrations used, the MAP kinase inhibitors did not affect cholesterol uptake or trafficking to the ER. To summarize the findings in this and the preceding sections, activation of IKK/NF-κB and JNK1/2 is needed for the full induction of both TNF-α and IL-6, whereas MKK3/p38 signaling is specifically involved in TNF-α induction and Erk1/2 signaling is specifically required for IL-6. The CHOP Branch of the UPR Pathway Is Required for FC-induced IL-6 Induction and for Full Activation of Erk1/2 MAPK—As mentioned above, FC loading activates the UPR ER stress pathway, resulting in induction of the cell death effector CHOP (13Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Because all of the cellular events we observed in this study, the induction of TNF-α and IL-6, IKK/NF-κB activation, and p38, Erk1/2, and JNK1/2 MAP kinase activation, were dependent of cholesterol trafficking to the ER, we questioned whether the CHOP branch of the UPR was implicated in any of these events. Using macrophages from Chop–/– mice as the instrument to address this question, we found that TNF-α induction, IKK/NF-κB activation, nor p38 or JNK1/2 activation required CHOP (Fig. 7). On the other hand, IL-6 induction and Erk1/2 activation were diminished in Chop–/– macrophages. These results indicate that CHOP induction is upstream of Erk1/2 activation, which, as described above, is required for IL-6 induction. In contrast, activation of IKK/NF-κB, p38, and JNK1/2, which are upstream of TNF-α induction, are not CHOP-dependent despite requiring cholesterol trafficking of the ER. Thus, these pathways are likely activated by a non-CHOP branch of the UPR and/or by a non-UPR ER stress pathway. Previous studies on the biology of FC-loaded macrophages have focused on FC-induced apoptosis in these cells, an event that is likely to be important in the generation of the ruptureprone and clinically important vulnerable plaque (13Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 32Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42468-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that another important series of events associated with plaque vulnerability, namely, inflammation, is also induced by FC loading prior to apoptosis. Our data show that multiple inflammatory signaling pathways are triggered by FC accumulation and implicated in the induction of TNF-α and/or IL-6. Among the three MAP kinase signaling pathways, JNK1/2 cooperates with MKK3/p38 to induce TNF-α (Fig. 8, left panel) and with UPR/Erk1/2 to induce IL-6 (Fig. 8, right panel). The IKK/NF-κB pathway is required for both TNF-α and IL-6 induction (Fig. 8). From a mechanistic viewpoint, these findings raise a number of important issues that will be the subject of future studies. For example, we wish to understand how CHOP leads to Erk1/2 activation in FC-loaded macrophages. One possibility is that CHOP directly activates the Erk1/2 pathway via upstream molecules such as Raf, c-Mos, MEKK1/2, or other Erk1/2 activators. For example, Hu et al. (34Hu P. Han Z. Couvillon A.D. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49420-49429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) showed that the UPR activators thapsigargin or tunicamycin activate Erk1/2 through a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In another scenario, which is suggested by the data of Nguyen et al. (35Nguyen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emadali A. Lee E.h. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), ER stress may promote the repression of an Erk1/2 inhibitor. In that study, ER stress induced by protein-misfolding agents led to the dissociation of the ER-based Erk1/2 inhibitor Nck from the ER and presumably from ER-associated Erk1/2, leading to Erk1/2 activation. However, these studies did"

Clinical neoplastic progression risk factors, such as age and the length of the esophageal BE segment, have been identified. However, improved molecular biomarkers predicting increased progression risk are needed for improved risk assessment and stratification. Using real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR, we screened 10 genes (HPP1, RUNX3, RIZ1, CRBP1, 3-OST-2, APC, TIMP3, p16, MGMT, p14) for promoter hypermethylation in 77 EAC, 93 BE, and 64 normal esophagus (NE) specimens. A subset of genes manifesting significant differences in methylation frequencies between BE and EAC was then analysed in 20 dysplastic specimens. All 10 genes except p14 were frequently methylated in EACs, with RUNX3, HPP1, CRBP1, RIZ1, and OST-2 representing novel methylation targets in EAC and/or BE. p16, RUNX3, and HPP1 displayed increasing methylation frequencies in BE vs EAC. Furthermore, these increases in methylation occurred early, at the interface between BE and low-grade dysplasia (LGD). To demonstrate the silencing effect of hypermethylation, we selected the EAC cells BIC1, in which the HPP1 promoter is natively methylated, and subjected them to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Aza-C) treatment. Real-time RT–PCR indicated increased HPP1 mRNA levels after 3 days of Aza-C treatment, as well as decreased levels of methylated HPP1 DNA. Hypermethylation of a subset of six genes (APC, TIMP3, CRBP1, p16, RUNX3, and HPP1) was then tested in a retrospective longitudinal study of 99 BE and nine LGD specimens obtained from 53 BE patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy. Only high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or EAC were defined as progression end points. Two patient groups were compared: eight progressors (P) and 45 nonprogressors (NP), using Cox proportional hazards models to determine the relative progression risks of age, BE segment length, and methylation events. Multivariate analyses revealed that only hypermethylation of p16 (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33–2.20), RUNX3 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.08–2.81), and HPP1 (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06–2.81) were independently associated with an increased risk of progression, whereas age, BE segment length, and hypermethylation of TIMP3, APC, or CRBP1 were not independent risk factors. In combined analyses, risk was detectable up to, but not earlier than, 2 years preceding neoplastic progression. Hypermethylation of p16, RUNX3, and HPP1 in BE or LGD may represent independent risk factors for the progression of BE to HGD or EAC. These findings have implications regarding risk stratification, early EAC detection, and the appropriate endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with BE."

However, the structure of this coiled coil and the mechanism it uses to mediate communication between the MTBD and ATP-binding core are unknown. Here, we sought to identify the optimal alignment between the hydrophobic heptad repeats in the two strands of the stalk coiled coil. To do this, we fused the MTBD of mouse cytoplasmic dynein, together with 12-36 residues of its stalk, onto a stable coiled-coil base provided by Thermus thermophilus seryl-tRNA synthetase and tested these chimeric constructs for microtubule binding in vitro. The results identified one alignment that yielded a protein displaying high affinity for microtubules (2.2 μm). The effects of mutations applied to the MTBD of this construct paralleled those previously reported (Koonce, M. P., and Tikhonenko, I. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 523-529) for an intact dynein motor unit in the absence of ATP, suggesting that it resembles the tight binding state of native intact dynein. All other alignments showed at least 10-fold lower affinity for microtubules with the exception of one, which had an intermediate affinity. Based on these results and on amino acid sequence analysis, we hypothesize that dynein utilizes small amounts of sliding displacement between the two strands of its coiled-coil stalk as a means of communication between the AAA core of the motor and the MTBD during the mechanochemical cycle.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first AAA domain (AAA1) is the principal site of ATP hydrolysis (13Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, nucleotide hydrolysis is also required at AAA3 (14Reck-Peterson S.L. Vale R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and nucleotide binding at sites AAA2 and AAA4 may also contribute to dynein function (13Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Reck-Peterson S.L. Vale R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2004; 101: 12865-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sequences of the AAA5 and AAA6 domains have highly degenerate ATP-binding motifs, indicating that these domains are unlikely to bind nucleotides and that they presumably serve primarily structural roles. Dynein is thought to bind microtubules by a small globular microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) located at the tip of a long (10-15 nm) and slender stalk (Fig. 1) (16Goodenough U. Heuser J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 1083-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike myosins and kinesins that have their polymer binding sites on the surface of the catalytic core, the MTBD of dynein is well separated from the enzymatic sites. This raises the intriguing question of how transitions in the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle are communicated to the MTBD by the ATP binding sites. Sequence analysis of the dynein heavy chain reveals two stretches of predicted coiled coil (CC1 and CC2) that are located between AAA4 and AAA5 and separated by a small globular region with a mass of ~14 kDa (17Gibbons I.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19714-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An expressed fragment of dynein containing this region of the heavy chain forms a rod-like structure similar to the stalk. The ~14 kDa globular region was identified as the MTBD by its ability to bind to microtubules (18Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the demonstration that mutagenesis of conserved residues within the MTBD interferes with microtubule binding (20Koonce M.P. Tikhonenko I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, a smaller expressed fragment, containing principally the MTBD, has been shown to decorate microtubules (21Mizuno N. Toba S. Edamatsu M. Watai-Nishii J. Hirokawa N. Toyoshima Y.Y. Kikkawa M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the details of how CC1 and CC2 interact to form the stalk as well as the mechanism by which the coiled coil couples the dynein ATP hydrolysis cycle with changes in the affinity of the MTBD remain unknown. Here we addressed these questions by making a series of chimeric constructs in which the different lengths of the dynein stalk were given a stable base by splicing them to a portion of the antiparallel coiled-coil side arm found in the native structure of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SRS). We hypothesized that the MTBD in these constructs would be able to bind microtubules if the dynein sequence emerging from the SRS was properly phased to align the two strands of the putative coiled coil in their native conformation. Our microtubule binding data combined with sequence analysis suggest that an antiparallel coiled coil in the distal region of the stalk is required for tight microtubule binding and that sliding movements between the two strands of the coiled-coil structure constitute a possible mechanism for regulating the affinity of microtubule binding during the ATPase cycle. DNA fragments encoding the MTBD of cytoplasmic dynein and desired lengths of its coiled-coil stalk were PCR-amplified from mouse testis cDNA (See-Gene, Inc.) using primers with in-frame SalI and HindIII restriction sites to facilitate cloning into the SalI and HindIII sites in a synthetic construct encoding a monomeric form of SRS (GenBank™ accession number AY881245). The resultant clones contained a continuous open reading frame encoding the SRS-MTBD chimeric protein with the MTBD and coiled coil of the dynein fused between residues Leu-33 and Lys-93 of the native SRS coiled-coil side arm (Fig. 2). The SRS-MTBD chimeric protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 16 °C. After being washed into homogenization solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the bacteria were lysed using a French press, and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation. The expressed protein was purified by adsorption on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and eluted with a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 150-200 mm imidazole. The yield of purified protein was ~10 mg/liter of culture for most monomeric constructs. A sample of each expression culture was processed for nucleotide sequencing to confirm its identity. Gel electrophoresis of typical preparations showed that the SRS-MTBD was ~95% pure. In typical monomeric preparations, ~90% of the protein eluted as a single symmetrical peak upon size exclusion chromatography (supplemental material). Some preparations were further purified by chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. Polymerized bovine or porcine brain microtubules were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended gently in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm paclitaxel, and 10% glycerol) at 2.0 mg/ml. Samples of SRS-MTBD were precipitated with 40% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and redissolved in assay buffer at 2.0 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined from the A280 of aliquots diluted into 6 m guanidine HCl by assuming extinction coefficients of 1.04 and 1.15 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1 for SRS-MTBD and tubulin, respectively. Binding of SRS-MTBD was assayed by incubating appropriate concentrations of SRS-MTBD with a suspension of microtubules (5 μm dimeric tubulin) in assay buffer for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200,000 × g, the pellet was rinsed before resuspension in an equal volume of buffer. Samples of the uncentrifuged suspension and of the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The intensities of Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to SRS-MTBD and tubulin were quantified by digital scanning and integration with the IBM-PC version of NIH Image (Scion Corp.). The fraction of total SRS-MTBD that co-sedimented with microtubules was computed for each sample and used to calculate values for the unbound SRS-MTBD concentration and the microtubule occupancy. Values of the binding affinity and of the saturation binding level were calculated by using the program Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.) to fit a single-site binding hyperbola to a plot of microtubule occupancy as a function of unbound SRS-MTBD concentration. In the fitting of the plot, points were weighted by 1/(microtubule occupancy) to compensate for the magnified effect of small errors at high occupancy levels. Control experiments showed that <1% of a 20 μm solution of unmodified monomeric SRS containing no MTBD bound to microtubules under the conditions of the assay (data not shown). Throughout this paper, the numbers used to identify particular amino acids refer to positions in the full-length sequence of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain from mouse (GenBank™ accession number AAF91078). To gain insight into the structure of the dynein stalk, we first analyzed the sequence of this region. Although prediction programs clearly identify coiled-coil heptad repeats (hydrophobic residues in the first “a” and fourth “d” positions of a 7-position repeat) in CC1 and CC2, the length of coiled coil and the residues belonging to the heptad repeat are difficult to establish with certainty in individual dynein sequences (18Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out an alignment of stalk regions from a wide variety of dyneins to determine whether a conserved heptad motif would emerge in CC1 and CC2. The alignment of a subset of dyneins is shown in Fig. 2A (for complete alignment see supplemental material). The alignment reveals that the sequence and length of CC1 and CC2 are strongly conserved although the precise boundaries of an antiparallel coiled coil remain hard to predict. A pair of conserved proline residues is present close to the junction between the stalk and the MTBD (23Gee M. Vallee R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, the sequence alignment shows that the heptad repeat continues past these residues. At the basal end of the stalk adjacent to AAA4 and AAA5, the boundary of the coiled coil is again difficult to define from the sequence. We also attempted to decipher the phasing of the heptad repeat in CC1 and CC2. In the case of CC2, the alignment shows a pattern of conserved “a” and “d” position hydrophobic residues that create a continuous registry of heptad repeats over the full-length of the stalk (Fig. 2A). CC1 shows a different pattern in which conserved hydrophobic residues repeat only once per seven amino acids over most of the stalk length. Thus, unlike CC2, CC1 appears to contain just one, rather than two, conserved hydrophobic residues every heptad. This pattern can be fit into two equally probable registries for the phasing of the heptad (Fig. 2A, registries α and β). As a result of the ill defined boundaries of the putative coiled coil and the ambiguity in the phasing of CC1, it is difficult to predict the structure of the stalk (i.e. which amino acids in CC1 pack against those in CC2 to form the core of the coiled coil). To investigate the structure of the stalk, we designed a series of chimeric constructs in which the MTBD along with a portion of its predicted coiled-coil stalk is fused onto a stable antiparallel coiled-coil base. We hypothesized that these constructs would bind microtubules tightly if the heptad repeats in the two strands of the dynein portion were in correct phase with those in the coiled-coil base. For the base coiled coil, we chose a monomeric form of the SRS from Thermus thermophilus, a thermostable protein with a known atomic level structure (Fig. 2B) (24Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In a first set of constructs, we maintained the heptad repeat of CC2 in synchronous phase with that of the SRS by keeping the number of dynein residues in CC2 constant at 19, whereas the corresponding number of residues in CC1 was varied from 15 to 29 (all lengths are counted from the conserved residues Pro-3285 and Pro-3409). This synchronization of phasing is illustrated in Fig. 2C, which shows the coiled-coil sequences of native SRS and of three chimeric constructs, SRS-22:19, SRS-19:19, and SRS-26:19. Assays comparing the relative abilities of these constructs to bind microtubules indicate that they separate into three groups: a high level of binding in SRS-22: 19, an intermediate level of binding in SRS-19:19, and only low levels of binding in all of the other constructs of the set (Fig. 3, A and C). More detailed assays to quantify the affinity of microtubule binding in SRS-22:19, SRS-19:19, and three representative examples of the weak binding constructs are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. In three independent preparations of the strong binding construct SRS-22:19, the binding affinity averaged 2.2 ± 0.2 μm, with 57 ± 3% of the dimeric tubulin sites in the microtubule appearing occupied at saturation. In preparations of SRS-19:19, the binding affinity averaged 12.1 ± 1.5 μm with a saturation binding of 60 ± 4% of the microtubule sites. The apparent saturation of SRS-22:19 binding when approximately half of the binding sites become occupied may be due to steric interference from the SRS component of the construct. In the weak binding constructs, the available data were inadequate to determine saturation binding levels, but constraining this level to be equal to that of SRS-22:19 yielded average binding affinities of 26-62 μm for SRS-15:19, SRS-21:19, and SRS-23:19. To study a broader range of alignments between CC1 and CC2, we prepared additional constructs in which the lengths of both CC1 and CC2 were varied. The results in Fig. 3C reveal the presence of a series of high affinity constructs, SRS-15:12, SRS-22:19, SRS-29:26, and SRS-36:33, the members of which are all related to SRS-22:19 by a change of one or more full heptads in the lengths of both CC1 and CC2. The constructs in this series all have high levels of affinity for binding to microtubules, close or identical to that of SRS-22:19 itself. In a second series of constructs that are similarly related to SRS-19:19, the binding affinities appear substantially less uniform, with only that of SRS-12:12 being comparable with that of SRS-19:19, whereas the affinity of SRS-26:26 is as high as that of SRS-22:19, and the affinity of SRS-33:33 is down within the range of the other low affinity constructs. Apart from the constructs in these two series, none of the other constructs examined had more than a low affinity for binding to microtubules. A change of as little as a single residue added to or subtracted from the length of CC1 in SRS-22:19 or SRS-29:26 was sufficient to reduce the binding affinity by more than 10-fold. Moreover, constructs such as SRS-26:19, SRS-29:19, and SRS-15:19 (Figs. 2C and 3C) that were formed by adding or subtracting either one-half or one full heptad to CC1 while keeping CC2 unchanged showed a similarly low affinity for microtubules. These results demonstrate that the affinity of the MTBD for binding to microtubules is very sensitive to the configuration of the coiled-coil residues in the adjacent region of stalk. It is notable that the series of constructs related to SRS-22:19 all have their CC2 registry aligned with registry α of CC1, whereas the series of constructs related to SRS-19:19 all have their CC2 registry aligned with registry β of CC1 (Fig. 2, A and C) so that the members of both series have the potential to form a well structured coiled coil in the stalk. In summary, we have identified the alignment of CC1 and CC2 in constructs related to SRS-22:19 as stabilizing a strong binding conformation of the MTBD and the corresponding alignment of SRS-19:19 as stabilizing a second moderately high affinity conformation. All other alignments tested had only a low affinity for microtubules, regardless of whether they were predicted to be favorable (SRS-15: 19, SRS-26:19, SRS-29:19, SRS-22:26) or unfavorable (all other constructs outside the two series) for coiled-coil formation. To examine whether the observed affinity differences were associated with local or global structural changes in the MTBD, we used gel-filtration chromatography to determine the Stokes radius (RS) of a selection of 10 SRS-MTBD constructs. The obtained values of RS increased gradually with stalk length, from 3.7 nm for the shortest construct (SR-12:12) up to 4.2 nm for the longest (SRS-36:33). No detectable variation in RS was observed to correlate with the affinities of the different constructs (supplemental material). These data suggest that the different affinities observed are the result of local conformational changes in the vicinity of the microtubule binding site rather than being due to a global disruption of the MTBD structure. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that both high and low affinity constructs appeared almost identical in their pattern and speed of fragmentation upon limited digestion with trypsin (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that such large scale effects as twisting or bending of the stalk may play a role by influencing the steric accessibility of the microtubule binding site on an SRS-MTBD construct to a microtubule in some cases. To test the hypothesis that the MTBD in SRS-22:19 represents a tight binding conformation similar to that occurring in native dynein, we examined the effects of mutations that have previously been shown (20Koonce M.P. Tikhonenko I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to modulate the affinity of an intact dynein motor domain in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4). The mutation E3289A (corresponding to E3370A in Dictyostelium dynein), which increases the affinity of intact dynein for microtubules in the absence of ATP, increases the amounts of SRS-22:19 bound to microtubules by 37%. Similarly, the mutations E3304A and R3382A (E3385A and R3464A in Dictyostelium dynein) as well as the double mutation K3298A,K3299A (K3379A,K3380A in Dictyostelium dynein), which all inhibit the binding of intact dynein to microtubules in the absence of ATP, inhibit the binding of SRS-22:19 to microtubules by 60-85%. We also examined the effects of the above mutations applied to SRS-19:19 and found that they qualitatively paralleled that of the same mutation applied to SRS-22:19 (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results show that the effect of each of the four mutations on microtubule binding of SRS-22:19 paralleled the effect of the same mutation on the binding of the intact dynein motor to microtubules in the absence of ATP (20Koonce M.P. Tikhonenko I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The data strongly suggest that the conformation of the MTBD in SRS-22:19 represents the native tight binding conformation of the MTBD of intact dynein in the absence of ATP and that its high affinity is not an artifact of the chimeric construct. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the values of RS for the above mutated forms of SRS-22:19 are identical to those of the wild-type construct (data not shown) as well as by the fact that the binding affinity of wild-type SRS-22:19 (2.2 μm) is similar to that reported previously (21Mizuno N. Toba S. Edamatsu M. Watai-Nishii J. Hirokawa N. Toyoshima Y.Y. Kikkawa M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for a small (~14 kDa) fragment of yeast dynein that decorates microtubules (1.6 μm). Our results demonstrate that the affinity of the MTBD for binding to microtubules is very sensitive to the configuration of the putative coiled-coil residues in the adjacent region of the stalk. Two factors in the structure of this region appear to be important for stabilizing a high affinity conformation of the MTBD. One is a requirement for a well structured coiled coil in the region of the stalk adjacent to the MTBD. The second is a requirement for a correct alignment between the two strands of the coiled coil, CC1 and CC2. The stringency of the requirement for a coiled-coil structure is indicated by the small number of sharply defined stalk configurations that appear able to stabilize a high affinity conformation of the MTBD. In the series of high affinity constructs related to SRS-22:19, the phasing of the hydrophobic heptad register passes smoothly from its establishment in the SRS base over the length of CC1 and CC2 to the junction of the stalk with the MTBD. Changes in the length of CC1 that interrupt the continuity of the heptad phasing by as little as one residue cause a greater than 10-fold reduction in microtubule binding affinity, whereas changes that maintain the heptad phasing by addition or subtraction of one or more full heptads to the lengths of both CC1 and CC2 (as in SRS-29:26, SRS-36:33 and SRS-15:12) form a series of uniformly high affinity. The functional importance of an uninterrupted heptad repeat is supported by sequence alignments showing that the regularity of this repeat is highly conserved in the stalks of axonemal and cytoplasmic dyneins (Fig. 2A). However, the presence of a continuous heptad repeat is not by itself sufficient to stabilize a high affinity conformation in the MTBD. It is also necessary that the alignment of CC1 and CC2 be correct. For example, in SRS-15:19 and SRS-29:19, the CC2 registry is aligned with the α-registry of CC1, the same as in SRS-22:19, yet these constructs have only a low binding affinity (Fig. 3, B and C). The low affinity of these constructs suggests that a correct spatial relationship between coiled-coil residues at the top of the stalk and residues in the MTBD is an essential second requirement for high affinity binding to microtubules. A particularly intriguing outcome of our microtubule binding data is that CC1 can potentially adopt a second position relative to CC2, corresponding to SRS-19:19 and the series of constructs related to it, in which the CC2 registry is aligned with the β-registry of CC1. Structural models of the dynein stalk coiled coil in the 22:19 and 19:19 configurations (Supplemental data) illustrate the relationship between the two structures. In the 22:19 model, the hydrophobic residues repeating every seven amino acids in CC1 (Fig. 2A) pack against one side of CC2, whereas in the 19:19 structure they pack to the other side (Fig. 5A). In both cases, the side of the hydrophobic core opposite from these hydrophobic residues of CC1 is occupied by hydrophilic amino acids (Fig. 5B). The models also raise the possibility that the stalk could undergo a sliding transition, either between the 22:19 and 19:19 structures by a sliding of the hydrophobic residues in CC1 along the hydrophobic groove in CC2 (Fig. 5) or possibly by sliding in the opposite direction along the rather shallower groove between their positions in the structures of 22:19 and 26:19. Our results strongly suggest that changes in the configuration of the dynein stalk are able to modulate the affinity of the MTBD. However, a remaining substantial question concerns the nature of the coiled-coil stalk transition that propagates the information for a state change over the 15-nm length of the stalk between the AAA motor unit at one end and the MTBD at the other. One possible model is that the transition involves a small sliding movement, similar to the 1.5-Å displacement simulated by removal of one residue from CC1, which might generate a low affinity binding state by distorting the coiled-coil structure in the stalk region adjacent to the MTBD in a manner similar to that occurring in our SRS-21:19 and SRS-23:19 constructs. However, this model appears to lack a mechanism for propagating the distortion of an ~1.5-Å displacement over the full length of the intact stalk. A more probable model, indirectly supported by our data, involves CC1 sliding by half a heptad (~4.5-Å axial displacement with ~58° rotation) relative to CC2 as shown in Fig. 5. In this model, the transition between the ADP/no nucleotide (tight binding) and the ATP/ADP-Pi (weak binding) states of dynein (25Porter M.E. Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) would correspond to a shift from a 22:19-like to either a 19:19-like or possibly a 26:19-like configuration of the stalk. In either case, the change in registry could be mediated by the AAA4 domain of the catalytic core pulling and pushing on CC1 in a manner similar to that involved in the mechanical functioning of other AAA ATPases (26Vale R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2102972481,"Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction. ADMA is metabolized by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), with DDAH2 representing the predominant endothelial DDAH isoform. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), also originating from arginine methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases, is an inhibitor of intracellular arginine uptake. In both chronic pulmonary hypertensive rats and patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH; NYHA class III and IV), a marked increase in plasma ADMA and SDMA levels, as well as tissue levels of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylated proteins, was observed. Moreover, when comparing lung tissue from pulmonary hypertensive rats and IPAH patients to corresponding normal lung tissue, expression of DDAH2 was found to be reduced at both the mRNA and the protein level with no significant changes in DDAH1 expression. These findings were further supported by demonstrating a decrease in DDAH2 function in the experimental pulmonary hypertension model. Immunohistochemistry in human and rat control tissue demonstrated both isoforms of DDAH in the endothelial layer and in the alveolar epithelium. In contrast, in pulmonary hypertensive tissue, the immunoreactivity of DDAH2 in pulmonary endothelium was significantly decreased compared with DDAH1. Therefore, altogether we can conclude that enhanced dimethylarginine levels may contribute to vascular abnormalities in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Suppression of endothelial DDAH2 expression and function represents an important underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2132375330,"We have developed an assay for the assembly of FtsZ based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We mutated an innocuous surface residue to cysteine and labeled separate pools with fluorescein (donor) and tetramethylrhodamine (acceptor). When the pools were mixed and GTP was added, assembly produced a FRET signal that was linearly proportional to FtsZ concentration from 0.7 μm (the critical concentration (Cc)) to 3 μm. At concentrations greater than 3 μm, an enhanced FRET signal was observed with both GTP and GDP, indicating additional assembly above this second Cc. This second Cc varied with Mg2+ concentration, whereas the 0.7 μmCc did not. We used the FRET assay to measure the kinetics of initial assembly by stopped flow. The data were fit by the simple kinetic model used previously: monomer activation, a weak dimer nucleus, and elongation, although with some differences in kinetic parameters from the L68W mutant. We then studied the rate of turnover at steady state by pre-assembling separate pools of donor and acceptor protofilaments. When the pools were mixed, a FRET signal developed with a half-time of 7 s, demonstrating a rapid and continuous disassembly and reassembly of protofilaments at steady state. This is comparable with the 9-s half-time for FtsZ turnover in vivo and the 8-s turnover time of GTP hydrolysis in vitro. Finally, we found that an excess of GDP caused disassembly of protofilaments with a half-time of 5 s. Our new data suggest that GDP does not exchange into intact protofilaments. Rather, our interpretation is that subunits are released following GTP hydrolysis, and then they exchange GDP for GTP and reassemble into new protofilaments, all on a time scale of 7 s.

Light microscopy shows that FtsZ assembles into a Z-ring that constricts to divide the cell. The Z-ring is highly dynamic in vivo. Subunits in the ring continuously exchange with a half-time of 8–9 s (1Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The tryptophan fluorescence of this mutant increased 2.5-fold upon assembly. A major advantage of this assay is that it accurately reports total polymer, in contrast to centrifugation and light scattering, which underreport small polymers. The tryptophan fluorescence assay was used for a comprehensive study of the kinetics of initial assembly. The data were fit to a model involving a step of monomer activation and formation of a weak dimer nucleus followed by elongation steps that were thermodynamically more favorable. The critical concentration (Cc) of the mutant FtsZ-L68W was 5–10-fold lower than that of wild-type FtsZ, meaning that it assembled with higher affinity. The mutant protein does, however, function normally for cell division, so we believe the basic assembly mechanism is the same as for wild-type FtsZ. Nevertheless, we felt it was important to study nucleation and elongation of a protein closer to wild type. We therefore designed a new fluorescence assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). 1The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy; GMP-CPP, guanosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate. The FRET assay requires two pools of subunits, one labeled with a donor fluorophore (fluorescein) and the other with an acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)). When the subunits assemble into a protofilament, they will assort randomly, and a significant fraction of donors will be adjacent to an acceptor. The 4.3-nm spacing of subunits in the FtsZ protofilament (4Erickson H.P. Stoffler D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) is smaller than the 5.0–5.5-nm Förster distance of a fluorescein-TMR pair (5Corbalan-Garcia S. Teruel J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Glauner K.S. Mannuzzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), so the FRET signal should provide a direct measure of total subunits in polymer. To label FtsZ for FRET, we constructed the mutant FtsZ-F268C, which introduces a single cysteine on the lower back right surface (7Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). F268C was originally identified as a mutant that was resistant to the division inhibitor SulA (8Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5602-5609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It functions normally for cell division (8Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5602-5609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its rate of GTP hydrolysis is only slightly reduced (7Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of an FtsZ-SulA complex, it is seen that Phe-268 makes contact with SulA, consistent with the mutation blocking the binding of SulA (9Cordell S.C. Robinson E.J. Lowe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7889-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, Phe-268 is ∼2 nm from the protofilament interface (10Oliva M.A. Cordell S.C. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), so it should have minimal or no effect on protofilament assembly. Leu-68, in contrast, makes partial contact across the interface, and the larger tryptophan probably enhances assembly by contributing additional area to the interface. In addition to providing a measure of the initial assembly kinetics, the FRET assay provides a novel approach to measure the dynamics of subunit turnover at steady state. Protein Purification—The mutant F268C of Escherichia coli FtsZ was overexpressed from a pET11b vector (Novagen). The protein was purified using the protocol of Romberg et al. (11Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Following the 20% ammonium sulfate cut and 30% precipitation, the protein was chromatographed on a Resource Q 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm KCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and stored frozen at -80 °C. Protein Labeling—Fluorescein-5-maleimide and tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide were purchased from Molecular Probes. FtsZ-F268C protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl was reacted with a 5-fold excess of probe for 2 h at room temperature. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 2.5 mm MgAc, 1 mm EGTA to remove free probe, and KCl (KCl prevents the efficient pelleting of calcium polymers). Before each experiment, a cycle of calcium assembly-disassembly (12Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was done to remove any inactive protein and remaining free probe. CaCl2 was added to 10 mm and GTP to 2 mm, and the reaction was incubated 5 min at 37 °C. The FtsZ polymer was collected by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman TLA100 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in the appropriate buffer at a protein concentration >100 μm. The sample was centrifuged again to remove any insoluble protein. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce) and corrected for the 75% color ratio of FtsZ/BSA (13Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To measure the TMR-labeled protein, the BCA assay was read at 655 nm instead of the usual 570 nm (where TMR absorbs). The labeling efficiency was ∼60–90% for each fluorophore. Higher labeling should give a stronger FRET signal, but the exact ratio of fluorophore to FtsZ was not important for these measurements. Experimentally, we found that different ratios of the labels and variable amounts of unlabeled subunits gave different FRET levels, but the kinetics were the same. One experiment gave identical kinetics when one-half of the labeled protein was replaced with unlabeled FtsZ. This shows that the labeled FtsZ has similar assembly properties to unlabeled FtsZ. Electron Microscopy Measurements—Negative stain electron microscopy was used to visualize FtsZ filaments. About 10 μl of FtsZ solution was incubated with GTP for several minutes and applied to a carbon-coated copper grid. Excess solution was blotted with filter paper, and the grid, held at a 50° angle, was rinsed with 3–4 drops of 2% uranyl acetate, blotted, and air-dried. Filaments were visualized and photographed using a Phillips 301 electron microscope at ×50,000 magnification. Fluorescence Measurement—FRET can be measured by the increase in acceptor fluorescence, the decrease in donor fluorescence, or the ratio. For the kinetic measurements, we wanted to measure at a single wavelength, and we chose the decrease in donor fluorescence, which gave a much stronger signal than the acceptor increase. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer. The samples measured included donor only (FtsZ labeled with fluorescein plus unlabeled FtsZ equivalent to that with acceptor), donor plus acceptor FtsZ without GTP, and donor plus acceptor FtsZ with 200 μm GTP. The donor-acceptor ratio was ∼2:3. All samples were excited at 470 nm, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded from 480 to 650 nm. For kinetic measurements, donor emission was measured at 516 nm. Stopped-flow measurements were made using an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorometer equipped with the SLM Milliflow reactor stopped-flow accessory. The temperature was controlled at 25 °C. The donor fluorescence was excited at 470 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 516 nm, both with a 4-nm slit. The protein concentration was initially calculated based on the dilution and was adjusted so that the initial fluorescence values fell on a straight line. For measurements of assembly kinetics, the FtsZ donor and acceptor were mixed at a ratio of 2:3 and then rapidly mixed with an equal volume of 500 μm GTP to initiate the reaction. To measure the rate of subunit exchange at steady state, donor FtsZ and acceptor FtsZ at 3–10 μm were first assembled separately by adding 1 mm GTP, and then these two pools were rapidly mixed and exchanged. Most assembly experiments were done in MMK buffer (50 mm Mes, 100 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.5). Two other buffers, HMK (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 100 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc, 1 mm EGTA) and MEK (50 mm Mes, 100 mm KAc, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.5), were used as noted. Kinetic Modeling—The FtsZ assembly kinetics data were fitted using the minimal kinetic model described previously (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Three steps followed the addition of GTP to FtsZ: activation of the FtsZ monomer, formation of a dimer nucleus, and elongation (Scheme I). (Note that the kinetic constants for the elongation steps (k3–k8) are all identical, except k-7, which is set to zero; see Ref. 3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for the rationale.) The kinetic data were fit using the programs KINSIM40 and FITSIM40 (14Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 15Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Dang Q. Frieden C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Critical Concentration of FtsZ-F268C Determined by the FRET Assay—When donor (fluorescein) FtsZ co-assembles with acceptor (TMR) FtsZ, the donor fluorescence should decrease and acceptor fluorescence should increase. We found that the donor fluorescence at 516 nm decreased up to 40% when 6 μm FtsZ (mixed donor and acceptor) was induced to assemble by adding GTP (Fig. 1a). Acceptor fluorescence at 575 nm showed a corresponding increase, but this was a smaller signal. Moreover, fluorescence at 575 nm is complicated by a substantial contribution from donor emission, which decreases because of FRET and subtracts from the acceptor increase. We have therefore used the decrease in donor fluorescence as the best FRET signal. We plotted the donor fluorescence versus FtsZ concentration for donor only, donor-acceptor without GTP, and donor-acceptor with GTP. At concentrations <0.7 μm, the three curves superimposed, meaning there was no FRET and no assembly. When concentrations were >0.7 μm, the GTP curve showed a decrease in donor fluorescence that was linear with FtsZ concentration. This indicates a Cc of 0.7 μm for the GTP assembly in the lower concentration range. There was, however, a surprising observation that at FtsZ concentrations >3 μm, a FRET signal developed simply from mixing the donor and acceptor FtsZ without any GTP. We assumed that the FtsZ carries a stoichiometric amount of GDP (following assembly and disassembly in Ca2+), and we found that adding excess GDP did not change the curve, so we refer to this as GDP-mediated assembly. This FRET signal only occurred at concentrations of >3 μm total FtsZ (at the 5 mm Mg2+ in our standard MMK buffer) (Fig. 1c). The FRET signal appeared to be linear above 3 μm, suggesting that it is reporting a second cooperative assembly with a 3 μmCc. This Cc, dependent on the concentration of Mg2+, was 4, 3, or 2 μm in 2.5, 5, and 10 mm Mg2+, respectively (Fig. 1, b–d). In the absence of Mg2+, we found no FRET signal up to 10 μm FtsZ. We show results for MMK, pH 6.5, but very similar curves were obtained in HMK (pH 7.7), with a Cc of 4.2 μm in 5 mm Mg2+ (not shown). Even more surprising, the curves for GTP assembly showed a second break at the same Cc for each Mg2+ concentration, suggesting that GTP assembly is characterized by two Ccs. We used electron microscopy (EM) to look for a structural basis for the enhanced FRET at the higher concentrations. EM showed apparently normal, single protofilaments at 2 μm FtsZ (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2c shows the distribution of protofilament lengths, with an average of about 120 nm or 30 subunits. The distribution of filament lengths was virtually identical at 10 μm FtsZ, although at the higher concentration, some protofilaments further associated into pairs and small bundles (Fig. 2b). This distribution is addressed under “Discussion.” FtsZ Assembly Kinetics Measured by FRET—Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of assembly when the FtsZ donor-acceptor mixture was mixed with 0.5 mm GTP in MMK buffer using a stopped-flow device. All assembly curves showed a lag of 2–3 s, a decrease over 6–10 s, and finally a plateau. The assembly kinetics curves from 0.8 to 3 μm were fit to the kinetic model in Scheme I using the programs KINSIM40 and FITSIM40. Because the FRET signals are complicated by the GDP-mediated oligomerization at a higher concentration, we did not include data over 3 μm in the fitting. These kinetics were fit to the same scheme as the kinetics of FtsZ-L68W, namely a weak dimer nucleus followed by elongation. The major difference was a much weaker dimer nucleus, which is discussed below (Table I).Table IFtsZ assembly rate constants in two different buffers Both buffers contain Mg2+, and they differ in pH. The rates from the present FRET assay are compared with those obtained previously for FtsZ-L68W. k1 and k-1 are the parameters for monomer activation, k2 and k-2 are for formation of the dimer nucleus, and ke and k-e are for elongation.ProteinBufferk1k-1k2kek-2k-ek-2/k2k-e/kes-1s-1μm-1 s-1μm-1 s-1s-1s-1μmμmFtsZ-F268CHMK0.380.010.726.63199.64.0277.20.60MMK0.380.010.796.60199.83.48252.90.53FtsZ-L68WHMK0.700.041.023.611.230.361.210.10MMK0.760.110.623.010.300.600.470.20 Open table in a new tab Assembly kinetics in HMK buffer at pH 7.7 were almost identical to the kinetics in MMK at pH 6.5 (Table I). We also measured the kinetics of the GDP assembly by mixing separate pools of donor and acceptor at 10 μm. The donor fluorescence decreased rapidly and was at a plateau in 200 ms. Rapid Steady-state Subunit Turnover—We used the FRET assay to measure the rate of protofilament turnover at steady state. For this step, we first assembled donor FtsZ and acceptor FtsZ separately. These assembled pools were then mixed rapidly in the stopped-flow device, and the FRET signal was measured as the decrease in donor fluorescence. This FRET signal requires that the subunits disassemble from the separately labeled protofilaments and reassemble into mixed donor-acceptor protofilaments. In MMK buffer, the donor fluorescence decreased rapidly to a plateau (Fig. 4a). The data were fit well by a single exponential, F = Feq + α·e-t/τ. The reaction time τ was 9.3 s, which corresponds to a half-time of 7 s. At steady state, protofilament disassembly must be balanced by reassembly of new protofilaments, so this number measures the rate of each reaction. Thus this experiment shows that all protofilaments are disassembling and reassembling on the time scale of 9 s. The turnover rate was essentially the same for FtsZ concentrations from 3 to 10 μm. The fluorescence decrease was 30%, essentially the same as the 33% decrease for the initial assembly. This means that the turnover involved complete disassembly and reassembly of all protofilaments. To examine the turnover rate in the absence of GTP hydrolysis, we repeated the experiment in MEK buffer, where the chelation of Mg2+ permits protofilament assembly but blocks GTP hydrolysis (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the mixing, the donor fluorescence decreased, and again the decrease could be fit to a single exponential (Fig. 4b). However, there were two differences from the assembly in Mg2+. First, the final decrease in fluorescence was only 12% in EDTA versus 30% in Mg2+. This suggests that only about one-third of the subunits participate in exchange in EDTA. Second, the reaction time was 127 s in EDTA versus 9.3 s in Mg2+. We believe the exchange in EDTA is consistent with reversible dissociation and re-association of subunits at the protofilament ends, with no turnover in the middle. Finally, we repeated the mixing experiment with protofilaments assembled in 0.2 mm GMP-CPP. In this case, the mixing appeared to approach completion, but the reaction time was increased to 350 s. This is consistent with the previous observation that GMP-CPP is hydrolyzed 3–10-fold more slowly than GTP (11Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Rate of FtsZ Depolymerization with Added Excess GDP— Excess GDP can cause FtsZ depolymerization. To observe the kinetics of disassembly, we first assembled 3–10 μm mixed FtsZ (ratio of donor to acceptor was 1:1) in 100 μm GTP. GDP was added to 2 mm, and the sample was rapidly mixed by pipette. Fig. 5, a and b, shows the time course of donor fluorescence increase as the protofilaments disassembled. The reaction time for the exponential fit was 6 ± 1 s in MMK buffer (Fig. 5a) and 25 ± 5 s in MEK buffer (Fig. 5b). We also examined the disassembly of the tryptophan mutant, FtsZ-L68W, monitoring the change in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 5c). The average lifetime of this decay was about 8 s in MMK buffer and 125 s in MEK buffer. The slower disassembly of L68W in MEK buffer is consistent with the 5–10-fold lower k-e of L68W relative to F268C, but it could also reflect differences in filament length. We checked the effect of adding smaller amounts of GDP to protofilaments. In MEK buffer with 200 μm GTP, the addition of 100 and 200 μm GDP caused disassembly of 40 and 60% of the polymer. In MMK buffer, 200 μm GDP caused disassembly of 30% of the polymer. If we assume that GTP and GDP compete for binding and that subunits are inactivated when they have bound GDP, these results suggest that the affinity of FtsZ is somewhat higher for GDP in EDTA and somewhat higher for GTP in Mg2+ buffer. This is very different from tubulin, where the affinity for GDP is ∼3-fold lower than for GTP in Mg2+ and GTP binding is hardly measurable in EDTA (19Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17278-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics and Steady-state Assembly in GTP—The kinetics of initial assembly measured here by FRET were fit to the same model (Scheme I) used to fit the assembly of the tryptophan mutant, FtsZ-L68W (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The model involves a step of monomer activation (probably the time needed for release of the initially bound GDP), the formation of a weak dimer nucleus, and a stronger association-giving elongation. One concern in the previous study was that the Cc of the L68W mutant was about 5–10-fold smaller than that of wild-type FtsZ. The labeled protein used for the present FRET assay showed a Cc of 0.7 μm in steady-state measurements (Fig. 1, b–d) and 0.5–0.6 μm from kinetics (k-e/ke, Table I). This is very close to the Ccs of 0.9–1.25 μm measured by sedimentation for wild-type FtsZ (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μm from GTPase (20Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adding an equal amount of unlabeled FtsZ reduced the magnitude of the FRET signal but did not change the kinetics of assembly (not shown). Thus we believe that the assembly of labeled F268C is essentially identical to that of wild-type FtsZ. The kinetic constants for F268C and L68W are compared in Table I. The interpretation of the kinetic constants is discussed in detail by Chen et al. (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The major difference is that the dimer nucleus is much weaker for F268C than for L68W assembly. The KD for the dimer, given by k-2/k2, is about 500-fold larger than the KD for elongation, k-e/ke for F268C, versus only a 2.5–10-fold difference for L68W in Mg2+ buffers. Thus the kinetic evidence for a cooperative assembly is even stronger than it was for L68W. As discussed in more detail by Chen et al. (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we still have no mechanism to explain how a protofilament that is 1 subunit thick can exhibit the characteristics of cooperative assembly and a dimer nucleus. The plot of the steady-state FRET signal versus FtsZ concentration gave the expected results in MMK for FtsZ concentrations up to 3 μm (in our standard buffer with 5 mm Mg2+). Below the Cc of ∼0.7 μm, there was no FRET signal, and above this Cc, the donor fluorescence showed a linear decrease from 0.7 to 3 μm FtsZ. This FRET signal indicates a GTP-mediated assembly, which we interpret to be the straight, single-stranded protofilaments seen in Fig. 2a and in previous EM studies. It should be noted that this Cc for GTP assembly was about 0.7 μm at all Mg2+ concentrations (from 2.5 to 10 mm), implying that this assembly does not involve binding of additional Mg2+. As we pointed out previously (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the simple model used to fit the kinetic data ignores the role of GTP hydrolysis. Because hydrolysis occurs only slowly following entry of a subunit into the protofilament (20Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the nucleation and initial elongation phases should not be affected. At steady state, however, the apparent k-e, which determines the apparent Cc, will mostly be because of dissociation of subunits following GTP hydrolysis, with a smaller contribution from dissociation of FtsZ-GTP. Unfortunately, at the present time we do not know where to place GTP hydrolysis in a kinetic scheme, so the mechanism must remain incomplete. Our confidence in the overall scheme, and in particular the dimer nucleus, is supported by our previous study of assembly in EDTA, which demonstrated similar cooperative assembly without the complication of GTP hydrolysis (3Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A Second Critical Concentration—An important new discovery of the FRET assay is a Mg2+-sensitive assembly pathway with a second Cc. FtsZ-GDP showed an abrupt and linear FRET signal (decrease in donor fluorescence) above 3 μm FtsZ (in 5 mm Mg2+). Sedimentation studies have already demonstrated an assembly of FtsZ-GDP into dimers and small oligomers (21Sossong T.M. Brigham-Burke M.R. Hensley P. Pearce K.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14843-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and this assembly was Mg2+-dependent, similar to our results with the FRET assay. A major difference between our results and the previous sedimentation assays is that we found an abrupt transition to assembly above a Cc, whereas the previous studies were interpreted as a gradual isodesmic assembly. The Cc implies that assembly in GDP is cooperative, not isodesmic. We suggest that the sedimentation results might be reinterpreted as a cooperative assembly, with all subunits above the Cc incorporated into small oligomers of a similar length. Remarkably, the second Cc was not just a phenomenon of GDP-mediated assembly but was also observed in all curves for GTP assembly. This second decrease in slope always occurred at the same Cc that was observed for GDP assembly. One possibility for this second step of GTP assembly is that it represents bundling of protofilaments. Indeed our EM analysis did show some bundling at higher protein concentrations. However, there are several problems with this interpretation. First, even at 10 μm FtsZ, the large majority of protofilaments are not bundled. Second, it is difficult to understand why bundling would exhibit a Cc, rather than a more gradual concentration dependence. Third, there is no explanation as to why this second Cc was the same in GDP and in GTP assembly. At present, we do not understand the mechanism of this second step of cooperative assembly. No such additional break was seen in our previous study using the tryptophan fluorescence of L68W. This is understandable because the tryptophan fluorescence change is mediated only by the longitudinal contacts within the protofilament and is not likely to be affected by lateral association. The discovery of this second association was only possible with the FRET assay. Steady-state Polymer Dynamics—A second important use of the FRET assay was to investigate assembly dynamics at steady state. This was not possible with any previous assay, including tryptophan fluorescence. We mixed preformed protofilaments labeled separately with donor and acceptor and found that they developed a FRET signal with a half-time of 7 s. This means that the pre-assembled protofilaments are completely disassembling and reassembling with this rapid half-time. This is very close to the 8–9 s half-time for FtsZ turnover in the Z-ring in vivo (2Anderson D.E. Gueiros-Filho F.J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and also to the rate of GTP hydrolysis in vitro (8/min in MMK (20Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and 14/min in HMK (23Redick S.D. Stricker J. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). This agreement of the turnover kinetics suggests that in vitro assembly is indeed close to the in vivo reaction, and both appear to be regulated by GTP hydrolysis. This turnover rate implies a balance of protofilament disassembly and reassembly. We decided to test it further by looking at one side of the turnover, disassembly. To rapidly block assembly, we added an excess of GDP, which should replace the GTP on all free monomers and block their assembly into new protofilaments. As monomers disassemble, they presumably already have a bound GDP, and the excess prevents them from getting a GTP. The disassembly was somewhat faster than the steady-state turnover time, with a half-time of 5 s versus 7 s for turnover. This would be expected if the concurrent reassembly sometimes rescued protofilaments that would otherwise disassemble completely. This disassembly rate is also consistent with the k-e = 3.5 s-1 that we obtained from kinetics data (Table I). At this rate, a protofilament of the average length of 30 subunits would disassemble completely in 8.5 s. The GDP-induced disassembly also addresses the issue of whether nucleotide can exchange within a protofilament. It was suggested previously that this might be possible and necessary to explain the high turnover rate of GTP hydrolysis (24Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gomez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently a crystal structure of an FtsZ dimer showed a gap in the interface that might permit nucleotide exchange (10Oliva M.A. Cordell S.C. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We now believe that this is unlikely for three reasons. 1) Our new data show that the turnover rate of subunits at steady state (half-time, 7 s) is fully fast enough to accommodate GTP hydrolysis (8/min = 7.5 s/GTP hydrolyzed). 2) When we suddenly added excess GDP to assembled protofilaments, it caused disassembly with a half-time of 5 s, fully consistent with the normal disassembly rate during turnover. 3) When we added GDP to protofilaments assembled in EDTA, they disassembled at a much slower rate, consistent with their slower turnover. If GDP could displace GTP in assembled protofilaments, this should happen on a faster time scale, probably equivalent to the 1–3-s lag seen in the initial assembly kinetics. Overall, our data suggest a model wherein subunits need to disassemble to exchange the GDP for GTP and initiate a new round of assembly. This is similar to the mechanism of tubulin turnover. This turnover rate also correlates nicely with the measured lengths of protofilaments. EM showed protofilaments averaging about 30 subunits (Fig. 2c). The initial assembly kinetics for elongation are diffusion-limited, with ke = 6.6 μm-1 s-1 (Table I). At steady state, the free monomer concentration should be 0.7 μm, so monomers can add to the protofilament at a rate of 6.6 × 0.7 = 4.6 s-1. A protofilament that is 30 subunits long could therefore be assembled in 6.5 s. Longer protofilaments would not be possible with the observed turnover rate. The Z-ring in vivo, which has a circumference of ∼3,000 nm, shows the same turnover rate. We conclude that the Z-ring is built from overlapping segments of short protofilaments ∼120 nm in length. We found that the distribution of protofilament lengths was the same at 2 and 10 μm total FtsZ. This independence of protofilament length on FtsZ concentration is expected from the rapid turnover. After 1–2 min of assembly, every protofilament will have turned over several times. Importantly, every reassembly will occur from the pool of free subunits at a concentration of 0.7 μm. Thus, higher concentrations of total FtsZ will produce more protofilaments of the same length. Finally, the in vitro experiment provides new insight on the in vivo exchange into the Z-ring. The exchange in vivo could have been because of exchange of individual subunits or of whole protofilaments. The in vitro FRET experiment can only be explained by exchange of subunits, probably by dissociation and reassociation at protofilament ends. This suggests that the in vivo exchange, which has the same half-time, also occurs by exchange of individual subunits. In conclusion, we suggest speculatively that the rapid assembly dynamics may operate by a mechanism related to dynamic instability of microtubules. Novel experimental approaches may be needed to explore the mechanism. The FRET assay described here provides one new tool for these future experiments. Note Added in Proof—We would like to reference two previous studies showing that excess GDP caused a rapid disassembly of FtsZ (25Scheffers D.J. Den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Mukherjee A. Saez C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We suggest that the GDP-induced disassembly reflects the steadystate turnover rate in both of these cases."

https://openalex.org/W2094599192,"Doppler spectroscopy has detected 136 planets around nearby stars. A major puzzle is why their orbits are highly eccentric, while all planets in our Solar System are on nearly circular orbits, as expected if they formed by accretion processes in a protostellar disk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been little observational evidence to support any particular one. Here we report that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around Upsilon Andromedae (ups And) provides evidence for a close dynamical interaction with another planet, now lost from the system. The planets started on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (ups And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the eccentricity of the middle planet (ups And c). Indeed, we show that ups And c periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 9000 years. Our analysis shows that strong planet-planet scattering, one of several mechanisms previously discussed for increasing orbital eccentricities, must have operated in this system."

https://openalex.org/W2092771529,"The mitochondrial cell death pathway is known for its role in signaling apoptosis. Here, we describe a novel function for the mitochondrial cell death pathway in signaling initiation of differentiation in the developing lens. Most remarkably, we induced lens cell differentiation by short-term exposure of lens epithelial cells to the apoptogen staurosporine. Activation of apoptosis-related pathways induced lens epithelial cells to express differentiation-specific markers and to undergo morphogenetic changes that led to formation of the lens-like structures known as lentoids. The fact that multiple stages of differentiation are expressed at a single stage of development in the embryonic lens made it possible to precisely determine the timing of expression of proteins associated with the apoptotic pathway. We discovered that there was high expression in the lens equatorial epithelium (the region of the lens in which differentiation is initiated) of pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax and Bcl-xS and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Furthermore, we found significant caspase-3-like activity in the equatorial epithelium, yet this activity was far lower than that associated with lens cell apoptosis. These apoptotic pathways are likely regulated by the concurrent expression of prosurvival molecules, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL; phosphorylation of Bad; and high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins chicken IAP1, IAP3, and survivin. This finding suggests that prosurvival pathways allow pro-apoptotic molecules to function as molecular switches in the differentiation process without tipping the balance toward apoptosis. We call this process apoptosis-related Bcl-2- and caspase-dependent (ABC) differentiation. The mitochondrial cell death pathway is known for its role in signaling apoptosis.

We call this process apoptosis-related Bcl-2- and caspase-dependent (ABC) differentiation. Cell signaling mechanisms involving caspases, the cysteine protease effectors of apoptotic pathways, are responsible for the loss of organelles and nuclei in lens cells as they differentiate into mature fiber cells (1Foley J.D. Rosenbaum H. Griep A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32142-32150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev.

This process is necessary to create an optically transparent lens. Interestingly, despite the activation of apoptotic signaling molecules and the loss of intracellular structures, differentiated lens fiber cells survive throughout an organism's lifetime. Caspases also play a requisite role in the differentiation of cell types that do not lose subcellular structures (4Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 5Weil M. Raff M.C. Braga V.M. Curr.

This suggests that apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be required for lens epithelial cell differentiation, playing roles distinct from the removal of organelles and nuclei. For secondary lens fiber cell differentiation to occur, undifferentiated epithelial cells from the anterior surface of the lens must enter the equatorial zone, where they first pass through a zone of proliferation (8Persons B.J. Modak S.P. Exp. Eye Res. 1970; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and then initiate their differentiation program (9Menko A.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 75: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With the initiation of differentiation, these lens epithelial cells begin a remarkable process in which they change shape as they participate in the creation of the unique cellular organization that characterizes the lens and that is essential to its transparency. This dramatic morphogenesis involves molecular remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell-cell adherens junctions (10Ferreira-Cornwell M.C. Veneziale R.W. Grunwald G.B. Menko A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Only after these morphogenetic changes have occurred do the maturing lens fiber cells lose their organelles and nuclei in a wave that spreads outwards from the central nuclear fiber cell region (11Kuwabara T. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Modak S.P. Perdue S.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1970; 59: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Kuwabara T.

This suggests that molecular mechanisms involving mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis-like pathways may be activated significantly earlier than the appearance of the OFZ. We have examined the involvement of apoptosis-like mechanisms in signaling the early stages of lens cell differentiation as well as the survival molecules that prevent these pro-apoptotic pathways from causing lens cell death. In the canonical mitochondrial death pathway, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bax, Bcl-xS, and Bad) mediate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (17Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), which then participates in initiating the caspase cascade with the activation of caspase-9 (18Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6237) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 cleaves and activates the executioner caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7 (18Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6237) Google Scholar), which cleave numerous intracellular components, leading to apoptosis. Although Bad, Bax, and Bcl-xS promote apoptosis, other Bcl-2 proteins (phospho-Bad, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) inhibit the apoptotic process (19Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The balance between Bcl-2 family members defines whether a cell will live or die. Increased Bax expression is often correlated with apoptotic cell death (20Chen Q. Hung F.C. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4223-4231PubMed Google Scholar, 21Merio G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heermeier K. Benedict M. Li M. Furth P. Nunez G. Hennighausen L. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, when Bax is bound to Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, it is prevented from mediating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (17Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent cell death, and these survival factors are often highly expressed in cells resistant to apoptosis (23Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar, 24Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B.

When Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are bound and sequestered by Bad, apoptosis is promoted (26Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). For Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to be free to bind molecules such as Bax, they must be released from Bad. This occurs when Bad is phosphorylated at any of its serine residues (each targeted by multiple kinases), which releases Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL so that they can perform their prosurvival functions (27Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the mechanism by which Bcl-xS induces apoptosis, although it has been suggested that Bcl-xS can block the anti-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (28Lindenboim L. Yuan J. Stein R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1783-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Bcl-xS expression generally increases during apoptosis (22Heermeier K. Benedict M. Li M. Furth P. Nunez G. Hennighausen L. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and its expression causes a marked increase in sensitivity to apoptotic agents (29Mercatante D.R. Mohler J.L. Kole R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49374-49382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Several Bcl-2-related proteins are expressed in the developing lens (2Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but their differentiation stage-specific expression has not been determined. In the canonical apoptotic pathway, caspases have multiple roles. They cleave proteins to disable repair mechanisms, disassemble organelles and nuclei, and reorganize the cell into apoptotic bodies (30Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 31Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J.

During lens development, caspases serve a non-apoptotic role. The major caspases (caspase-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -8, and -9) are all expressed in the lens, and caspase-1, -2, -4, -6, and -9 have been implicated in the process of lens fiber cell nuclear loss (1Foley J.D. Rosenbaum H. Griep A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32142-32150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Caspase-6 activity in lens differentiation is precisely timed with the appearance of TUNEL-positive nuclei (1Foley J.D. Rosenbaum H. Griep A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32142-32150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation in the lens, as detected by the TUNEL assay, occurs after the disappearance of organelles and the dismantling of the nuclear envelope (36Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating nuclear and organelle loss in the developing lens, caspases cleave components of the membrane-associated cytoskeleton (37Lee A. Morrow J.S. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20735-20742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), thereby remodeling lens fiber cell plasma membrane structures. The activation of caspases within differentiation-specific regions of the embryonic lens at developmental times that precede the formation of the OFZ has not been studied. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) bind to caspases, block their proteolytic activity, and can target them for degradation. Thus, IAPs serve as important regulators of caspase function, acting as protectors against apoptosis. mRNAs for several IAPs have been detected in the lens. The adult human lens contains stable mRNA transcripts for livin (38Wistow G. Bernstein S.L. Wyatt M.K. Behal A. Touchman J.W. Bouffard G. Smith D. Peterson K. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar), and mRNAs encoding survivin and IAP2 are present in neonatal murine lenses (1Foley J.D. Rosenbaum H. Griep A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32142-32150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IAPs likely play regulatory roles during differentiation, allowing caspases to perform crucial functions but preventing them from tipping the balance toward apoptosis. Nothing is known about IAP protein regulation during embryonic lens development. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that molecular mechanisms characteristically associated with apoptosis function as molecular switches early in lens cell differentiation, temporally preceding the signaling of nuclear and organelle loss. We have discovered that the activation of the canonical intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway can signal lens cells to initiate their differentiation. In addition, we present evidence that a molecular balance is maintained through the expression of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins and IAPs that could regulate the apoptosis-related pathway to prevent lens cell commitment to apoptosis. Lens Microdissection—Lenses were isolated from E10 chicken eggs (Truslow Farms, Chestertown, MD) and microdissected as described previously (39Walker J.L. Menko A.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to yield four distinct regions of differentiation: the central anterior epithelium, the equatorial epithelium, the cortical fiber zone, and the central fiber zone (see Fig. 1A). Preparation and Treatment of Primary Lens and Whole Lens Cultures—Differentiating lens cell primary cultures were prepared as described previously (40Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, lens cells were isolated from E10 quail lenses by trypsinization and agitation. Cells were plated on laminin and cultured in Medium 199 with 10% fetal bovine serum. For whole lens cultures, chicken embryo lenses were removed at E10 with the vitreous attached and grown in serum-free Medium 199. Apoptotic pathways were induced with either anisomycin (Sigma) or staurosporine (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) as indicated. Caspases were inhibited with the general caspase inhibitor 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or the caspase-3-specific inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp chloromethyl ketone (Ac-DEVD-cmk) (Calbiochem). For all experiments, control cultures were exposed to Me2SO (Sigma), the solvent for anisomycin, staurosporine, Ac-DEVD-cmk, and Z-VAD-fmk. For growth factor experiments, primary lens cell cultures were exposed to either fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (Sigma) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (LONG™ R3IGF-I, GroPep, Adelaide, Australia) at 15 ng/ml for 24 h. To block the activation of ERK in cultures to be treated with growth factors, cells were exposed to the ERK inhibitor U0126 at a concentration of 10 μm beginning 24 h prior to addition of growth factors. Cytosolic Fractionation for the Determination of Cytochrome c Release—Cytosolic fractions were prepared using a protocol modified from Yang et al. (23Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Microdissected lens tissue was homogenized with a Teflon pestle in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were clarified by centrifugation two times at 800 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged twice, first at 10,000 × g for 20 min and then at 16,000 × g for 20 min, to remove mitochondria (41Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The final supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The CaspACE colorimetric assay system (Promega Corp.) was used to measure caspase-3 activity. Samples were extracted in cell lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer. The caspase activity assay was performed as specified by the manufacturer. Note that the substrate used in this assay is a DEVD tetrapeptide, which also serves as the preferred substrate for caspase-7. Therefore, we refer to the activity detected by this assay as caspase-3-like. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). To control for the possibility that the proteasome cleaves the caspase substrate DEVD, the assay was also performed in the presence of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (200 μm; BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.). Immunoblotting—Samples were extracted in 44.4 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm imidazole containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm H2O2, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) unless stated otherwise. 15 μg of protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on precast 8–16% Tris/glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). For the determination of cytochrome c release, 30 μg of total protein from each sample were loaded on 10–20% Tris/glycine gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Anti-Bax (Δ21), anti-Bcl-xL/S (L-19), anti-Bcl-2 (N-19), anti-Bad (C-7), anti-phospho-Bad Ser112, anti-survivin (FL-142), and anti-cellular IAP1/2 (A-13), antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to X-linked IAP and cytochrome c were from BD Biosciences. Phospho-Bad Ser136 was obtained from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Antibodies to filensin and CP49 were generous gifts from Dr. Paul FitzGerald (University of California, Davis, CA). Anti-δ-crystallin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Joram Piatigorsky (NEI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Anti-aquaporin-0 (MP28) antibody was prepared as described previously (40Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using Eastman Kodak 1D software. For all experiments with microdissected lenses, results were normalized to the undifferentiated cells of the central epithelium. Fluorescence Detection of F-actin and Nuclei—Cultures and E10 lenses were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Lenses were further processed to obtain 7-μm cryosections as described previously (42Zhou J. Menko A.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2293-2300PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized by exposure to 0.25% Triton X-100 and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) to detect F-actin and nuclei, respectively. Fluorescently stained samples were examined using either a Nikon Eclipse 80i or Nikon Optiphot microscope (Optical Apparatus, Ardmore, PA), and images were acquired using Metamorph Version 6.2 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Two dyes were used to track mitochondrial membrane potential, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM) and JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). TMRM is a classic tracker of mitochondrial membrane potential. JC-1 permits simultaneous measurement of mitochondria with and without active membrane potential. JC-1 forms aggregates in mitochondria with active membrane potentials that cause the dye to fluoresce red, whereas in mitochondria without a membrane potential, the dye remains as a monomer and fluoresces green. Chick lenses (removed at E10) were incubated with TMRM (3 h) or JC-1 (6 h) and observed live by confocal microscopy. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope. Z-stacks were collected, and projection images were created from the Z-stack. Histograms were created using Zeiss LSM5 Image Examiner software. Increase in Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Proteins as Lens Cells Initiate Their Differentiation—The embryonic lens provides a unique opportunity to study the role of apoptosis-like processes in the regulation of differentiation because, at a single time point in development, multiple stages of differentiation are present, from undifferentiated epithelial cells to terminally differentiating fiber cells (Fig. 1A). The ability to separate these stages by microdissection techniques makes it possible to examine the dynamic processes that regulate lens cell differentiation in vivo. For this study, E10 lenses were separated into four regions: the undifferentiated central epithelium, the equatorial epithelium (where lens cells initiate their differentiation), the cortical fiber zone (where much of lens cell morphological differentiation takes place), and the terminally differentiating core nuclear fiber region. The Bcl-2 family member Bax, a potent inducer of apoptosis, leads to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (17Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 43Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The highest level of Bax expression occurred in the equatorial epithelium of the embryonic lens (Fig. 1B). Bax increased 2-fold in this region, where lens epithelial cells initiate their differentiation. Elevated Bax expression did not extend beyond the equatorial epithelium, dropping precipitously in the cortical fiber region. Bcl-xS paralleled Bax and was most highly expressed in the equatorial zone. The expression of this proapoptotic molecule was enhanced 7-fold in equatorial epithelial cells (Fig. 1B). The increased expression of both Bax and Bcl-xS in the equatorial epithelium and their subsequent suppression in the differentiating cortical fiber zone (2 days before organelles are lost in maturing lens fiber cells) suggest that these pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members provide an initiating signal in lens cell differentiation. Cytochrome c Is Released at the Onset of Differentiation— Because Bax and Bcl-xS induce the mitochondrial death pathway through the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, we investigated the differentiation-specific release of cytochrome c into the cytosol of embryonic lens cells. The cytosolic fraction from each of the microdissected regions of the E10 chick lens was isolated and immunoblotted for cytochrome c (Fig. 1C). Cytochrome c was first released from mitochondria in the cells of the lens equatorial epithelium concurrent with high expression of Bax and Bcl-xS. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria continued to occur in the cortical fiber zone, the principle region of lens fiber cell morphogenetic differentiation, but was barely detected in the more mature central fiber zone. Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential as Lens Cells Differentiate—Because cytochrome c is essential to mitochondrial function, we examined whether its release from mitochondria as lens cells initiate their differentiation results in a parallel decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. E10 chick lenses were incubated with TMRM or JC-1 and observed live by real-time confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). For experiments with the JC-1 tracking dye, histogram analysis demonstrated the proportion of active (red) to inactive (green) mitochondria (Fig. 2E). In the central epithelium of the E10 lens, the mitochondria had active membrane potentials, as seen with both TMRM and JC-1 (Fig. 2, A and F). Histogram analysis of the JC-1 results showed that the mitochondria in these undifferentiated lens epithelial cells were almost exclusively red, evidence that most of the mitochondria had high activity. Dye tracking in the equatorial zone revealed that the release of cytochrome c as these cells initiated their differentiation was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2, B and G). Mitochondrial membrane potential was increasingly diminished as lens cells in the equatorial epithelium became more differentiated and moved toward the cortical fiber zone. In the cortical fiber region, where mitochondria are localized primarily in the apical tips of the cells (44McNulty R. Wang H. Mathias R.T. Ortwerth B.J. Truscott R.J. Bassnett S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 883-898Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c release remained high (Fig. 1), there was a continued loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2, C and H). Tracking in this region for mitochondria with and without membrane potential using JC-1 showed that, although some mitochondria in the outermost region of the cortical zone still maintained a potential, the labeling of mitochondria without membrane potential (green) continued to increase with differentiation (Fig. 2C). Most of the mitochondria in the differentiated cells of the central nuclear fiber region had lost their membrane potential at E10, even though this was 2 days before their degradation. This was observed in whole lenses and when the nuclear fiber region was dissected free of the rest of the lens prior to incubation with the tracker dyes (Fig. 2D), ensuring that the lack of mitochondrial membrane potential was not a dye penetration problem. It is important to note that there was a small subset of mitochondria in this region that maintained membrane potential and therefore the capacity to function (Fig. 2I). These results demonstrate that there is a tight correlation between loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria and loss of membrane potential in the developing lens. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Members Are Expressed Early in Lens Cell Differentiation—One mechanism of regulating the quantity of cytochrome c released and the resultant induction of apoptosis-like pathways involves the action of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. By immunoblot analysis of microdissected E10 chick lens fractions, we found Bcl-xL to be hi"

The role of phosphorylation on two components of the lipolytic process, the TG-lipase and the lipid droplet, was investigated in fat body adipocytes. The activity of purified TG-lipase determined using in vivo TG-radiolabeled lipid droplets was unaffected by the phosphorylation of the lipase. However, the activity of purified lipase was 2.4-fold higher against lipid droplets isolated from hormone-stimulated fat bodies than against lipid droplets isolated from unstimulated tissue. In vivo stimulation of lipolysis promotes a rapid phosphorylation of a lipid droplet protein with an apparent mass of 42–44 kDa. This protein was identified as “Lipid Storage Droplet Protein 1” (Lsdp1). In vivo phosphorylation of this protein reached a peak ∼10 min after the injection of AKH. Supporting a role of Lsdp1 in lipolysis, maximum TG-lipase activity was also observed with lipid droplets isolated 10 min after hormonal stimulation. The activation of lipolysis was reconstituted in vitro using purified insect PKA and TG-lipase and lipid droplets. In vitro phosphorylation of lipid droplets catalyzed by PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of Lsdp1 and the lipolytic rate of the lipase, demonstrating a prominent role PKA and protein phosphorylation on the activation of the lipid droplets.

Insects rely on lipid reserves to survive during physiological non-feeding periods or to meet the energy requirements of developing eggs, flight, and starvation. The fat body is the principal site for storage of both glycogen and lipids. The fat body synthesizes most of the proteins found in the hemolymph while also serving as the main storage site of triglycerides (TG), 1The abbreviations used are: TG, triglyceride; AKH, adipokinetic hormone; DG, diglyceride; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HDLp, high density lipophorin; LDLp, low density lipophorin; PKA, protein kinase A; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; Peri A, perilipin A; PAT, Peri A, ADRP, and TIP47; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which constitute >90% fat body lipids. Therefore, functionally, the fat body accomplishes roles that in vertebrates are carried out by both liver and adipose tissue (1Law J.H. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16335-16338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, feeds constantly, and the content of fat body TG increases continuously until the end of the larval development. During the larval period (∼20 days), the content of TG in the fat body increases from a few micrograms to ∼80 mg (2Fernando-Warnakulasuriya G.J.P. Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 211-214Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During subsequent development, the lipid reserves are used to sustain the life of the adult insect, which feeds occasionally (2Fernando-Warnakulasuriya G.J.P. Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 211-214Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Arrese E.L. Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Pennington J.E. Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Due to these metabolic features, M. sexta represents an excellent model for studying the basic mechanisms involved in either the synthesis/deposition of TG in larvae or the mobilization of TG in adult insects (moth). TG is stored in fat body adipocytes as cytosolic lipid droplets (6Willott E. Bew L.K. Nagle R.B. Wells M.A. Tissue Cell. 1988; 20: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TG hydrolysis (lipolysis) is mediated by a TG-lipase that has been purified from the cytosol (7Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1652-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in mobilization of adipose tissue fatty acids (8Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Kraemer F.B. Shen W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the TG-lipase from M. sexta fat body is an enzyme that can be phosphorylated. The end product of insect lipolysis is sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) that is released into the hemolymph (10Arrese E.L. Rojas-Rivas B.I. Wells M.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 68-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and loaded into the hemolymph lipoprotein, lipophorin. This causes the transformation of high density lipophorin (HDLp) into low density lipophorin (LDLp), which transports DG to the sites of utilization, e.g. the flight muscle, and ovaries, where it is hydrolyzed to fatty acids by a lipophorin-lipase (12Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 371-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lipolytic process is under hormonal regulation by the neuropeptide adipokinetic hormone (AKH) (13Gade G. Auerswald L. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2003; 132: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). AKH action is comparable to that of glucagon in mammals. It contributes to hemolymph sugar homeostasis and is also involved in the mobilization of sugar and lipids from the fat body during energy-requiring activities (14Ziegler R. Schulz M. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 903-908Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Ziegler R. Schulz M. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 997-1001Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Gade G. Hoffmann K.H.

Peptides. 1997; 18: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). AKH receptors from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the silkworm Bombyx mori have been recently identified (18Staubli F. Jorgensen T.J. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Roepstorff P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These receptors are related to the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates both inositol phosphate and cAMP signaling responses. In M. sexta, AKH mobilizes glycogen during the larval stages and promotes a massive lipolytic response in the adult stage (19Ziegler R. Eckart K. Law J.H. Peptides. 1990; 11: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AKH promotes a rapid activation of fat body cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Supporting the role of PKA in lipolysis, agents that raise intracellular cAMP concentration, such as 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin, also stimulate lipolysis in the adult insect (20Arrese E.L. Flowers M.T. Gazard J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the involvement of cAMP, the lipolytic response of AKH also induces a sustained increase in calcium influx (20Arrese E.L. Flowers M.T. Gazard J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Hayakawa Y. Downer R.G.H. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 325-330Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Lum P.Y. Chino H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2039-2044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, calcium-mobilizing agents such as thapsigargin or ionomycin strongly stimulate lipolysis (20Arrese E.L. Flowers M.T. Gazard J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike the vertebrate system in which the lipolytic process is activated by cAMP (23Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibited by intracellular calcium (24Xue B. Greenberg A.G. Kraemer F.B. Zemel M.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2527-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), in insects, both messengers (cAMP and calcium) stimulate lipolysis. Protein phosphorylation mediated by PKA is expected to be part of the mechanism controlling the activation of lipolysis, but the nature of the proteins targeted by PKA remains to be elucidated. It has been shown that TG-lipase can be phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKA from the insect fat body. However, this phosphorylation failed to increase the enzyme activity when assayed in vitro with an artificial substrate (25Patel R. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Arrese E.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, the mechanism of activation of lipolysis was investigated using the native substrate of the TG-lipase, the lipid droplet, and a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments. To study the role of PKA and the impact of the phosphorylation of the TG-lipase and the lipid droplet proteins on the activation of lipolysis, we used a novel approach in which the lipolytic process was reconstituted in vitro using in vivo TG-radiolabeled lipid droplets as the substrate of purified TG-lipase and purified insect PKA. The studies presented here confirm the presumed role of PKA in activation of the lipolysis. More interestingly, the studies suggest that, contrary to previous assumptions, the main role of PKA is to activate the substrate of lipolysis, the lipid droplet, rather than the TG-lipase. The studies led to the identification of the Lsdp1 as the main target of PKA activation. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Lsdp1 emerged as a likely regulator of the lipolytic activation. Materials—[32PO4]Orthophosphate and [γ-32PO4]ATP were purchased from MP Biochemicals (Irvine, CA). Labeled trioleoylglycerol ([tri-9,10-3H(N)]oleoylglycerol) and [9,10-(n)3H]palmitic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, phenyl-Sepharose, and Q-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT Gel was purchased from Bio-Rad. M. sexta AKH was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Electrophoresis items were from Invitrogen. Silica Gel G plates were purchased from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Trypsin sequencing grade was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade. Experimental Insects—M. sexta eggs were purchased from Carolina Biological supplies, and larvae were reared on artificial diet (26Bell R.A. Joachim F.G. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1976; 69: 365-373Crossref Google Scholar). Adult insects were maintained at room temperature without food. All of the experiments were carried out using adult insects 48–72 h after emergence. To achieve a consistent basal level of lipolysis, the insects were decapitated 24 h ahead of the experiment. Two hours before the experiments, the insects were injected with 13 mg of trehalose dissolved in 20 μl of water (27Arrese E.L. Rojas-Rivas B.I. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purification of TG-lipase—TG-lipase was purified from the cytosolic fraction of M. sexta fat body homogenates using anion-exchange, hydroxyl-apatite, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography as reported previously (7Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1652-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the Catalytic Subunit of cAMP-dependent PKA—The catalytic subunit of PKA was purified from the cytosolic fraction of M. sexta fat body homogenates using a combination of ion-exchange chromatographies, as previously described (25Patel R. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Arrese E.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Fat body tissue from two insects was combined and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer fitted with Teflon pestle using 6 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mg/liter aprotonin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm imidazole, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 4 mm sodium potassium tartrate). The homogenate was overlaid with 2 ml of buffer without sucrose and centrifuged (100,000 × g for 1 h). Three fractions were collected: fat cake; infranatant; and pellet. To ensure that the lipid droplets were free of cytosolic components, the fat cake was resuspended in homogenization buffer and gently vortexed. The sucrose concentration was adjusted to 15% (w/v), and a layer of 2-ml buffer without sucrose was laid on top. Samples were centrifuged in a SW 40 rotor at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Purified lipid droplets were collected from the top and resuspended in homogenization buffer without sucrose. Typically, lipid droplets of two insect fat bodies were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer. The pellet was resuspended in buffer and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of buffer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was used as membranes fraction. The infranatant (cytosolic fraction) was passed through a small Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.37 mm Triton-X-100, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mg/liter aprotonin, 2 mm imidazole, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 4 mm sodium potassium tartrate). The column was extensively washed with equilibration buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (20–150 mm) in the same buffer. TG-lipase was eluted with 180 mm NaCl in the same buffer, and all of the fractions containing TG-lipase activity were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated to a final volume of 4 ml. In Vivo Protein Phosphorylation Studies—Experimental insects were injected with 250 μCi of [32PO4]orthophosphate (carrier free) and 90 min later with 100 pmol of AKH. Fat body tissue was dissected at various times after the hormonal injection. For each time, tissue from two insects was pooled and homogenized. The lipid droplets were isolated as indicated above. The lipid droplet-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels according to Laemmli but in sample buffer containing 6% (w/v) SDS. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel was dried, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Gels and autoradiograms were scanned on an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad model GS-700). The intensity of protein bands and phosphorylation was quantified from the gel and autoradiogram scans, respectively, using the Multi Analyst Macintosh software. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—32P-Phosphorylated samples of lipid droplets were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis according to the method of O'Farrel. The pH gradient ranged between 4.0 and 9.0, and the second dimension was done on 10% acrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were dried and exposed. The highly phosphorylated spot with an apparent mass of 42 kDa was excised from the gel. The protein was cleaved with trypsin and then sequenced by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. The MS/MS spectra were correlated with known sequences using the algorithm Sequest and programs were developed in that laboratory (28Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For peptide mass fingerprinting of 42 and 44 kDa, lipid droplet-associated proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and the bands visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, excised, minced, and destained using 100% acetonitrile followed by four washes with water. The gel pieces were incubated for 20 min in 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by 20 min incubation with 500 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Gel pieces were dried under vacuum, rehydrated, and digested with 50 ng/μl trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 4 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the Core Facility using the department ABI Voyager De PRO MALDI-MS and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Preparation of Endogenously [33H]TG-labeled Lipid Droplets—Fat body lipids were radiolabeled following a long-term procedure previously reported (11Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 68-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Arrese E.L. Gazard J.L. Flowers M.T. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the fifth larval instar, insects were fed 200 μCi of [9,10(n)-3H]palmitic acid and, after completion of development (32 days), adult insects were decapitated and injected with trehalose as indicated above. Lipolysis was stimulated by injection of 100 pmol of AKH, whereas injection of buffer provided the level of basal lipolysis. Fat bodies were dissected 20 min after injection, and the lipid droplets were isolated as described above. Lipid analysis of TG showed that the vast majority of the radiolabel (99.8%) was localized in the fatty acyl residues. The remaining 0.2% was found in the glycerol backbone. sn-1,3 positions of TG contained 88.4 ± 2% of the label. An analysis of the distribution of radioactivity among different neutral lipid classes of the lipid droplets showed that TG contained 97.4 ± 0.5% radioactivity. TG-Lipase Activity against [3H]TG-Lipid Droplets—An aliquot of the lipid droplet preparation containing 100 nmol of TG was transferred to a glass tube containing lipase reaction buffer. The reaction was initiated by adding purified TG-lipase (7 μg) in a final volume of 150 μl. Final reaction conditions were 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.67 mm TG, and 0.37 mm Triton X-100. The mixture was gently vortexed for 20 s and incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking. After 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 750 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1) and 5 μl of 6 n HCl. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min. The organic phase was collected, and counts/min were calculated in an aliquot. The remaining organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel G plates using hexane:ethyl ether:formic acid (70:30:3) as the developing solvent (29Arrese E.L. Gazard J.L. Flowers M.T. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoglyceride, DG, free fatty acid, and TG fractions were visualized by I2 vapors and scraped from the plates. After complete removal of the I2, the radioactivity associated with each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Blank reactions in which the TG-lipase was omitted were used to obtain the basal level of distribution of radioactivity among the lipid classes and calculate the percentage of hydrolysis. The lipase activity was expressed as nmol of TG hydrolyzed/min mg protein. All of the determinations were carried out in duplicate. Aliquots of lipid droplets resuspended in TG-lipase reaction buffer were freshly stained with Oil Red O and were observed under the microscope. We found numerous red-colored spheres (0.6–3.5 μm), confirming the existence of the lipid droplets in the reaction mixture. The size of lipid droplets in the final preparation was slightly smaller than the size of native lipid droplets (1.2–4.1 μm). In Vitro Phosphorylation Reactions of TG-Lipase and Lipid Droplets—The lipid droplets were phosphorylated in a reaction mixture (90 μl) containing kinase reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), purified PKA (0.25 units), 7 μl of lipid droplets (0.1 μmol TG), and 0.2 mm [γ-32PO4]ATP (5 × 106 cpm/nmol). After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% acrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled protein band profile was performed by densitometric analysis. Purified TG-lipase was phosphorylated by insect PKA in the presence of [γ-32PO4]ATP as described above. Phosphorylation of the lipase was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To study the effect of phosphorylation on the TG-lipase activity, [3H]TG-lipid droplets and/or TG-lipase were phosphorylated as described above but using unlabeled ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 mm EDTA. Measurement of Low Density Lipoprotein/High Density Lipoprotein Ratio of Hemolymph—The content of DG in the hemolymph was assessed by measuring the relative mass of LDLp and HDLp after separation of the lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in a KBr density gradient (27Arrese E.L. Rojas-Rivas B.I. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The LDLp/HDLp ratio was used as an index of lipolysis. Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibodies against purified TG-lipase were raised in chicken at Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). For Western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was performed using anti-TG-lipase antibodies (1:200). After incubation of membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken secondary antibody (1:50,000), peroxidase activity was detected using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray films were scanned, and the intensity of the positive signal was quantified by densitometry. Protein and TG Content of Lipid Droplets—The lipid droplet-associated proteins were precipitated with acetone (85% v/v) at –20 °C for at least 2 h. Afterward, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the resultant pellet was dissolved in final 10% SDS (w/v). An aliquot was used to measure total protein using the BCA method (Pierce). TG was determined using the Infinity triglyceride reagent kit as described by the manufacturer (ThermoTrace Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). Triolein was used as standard for the calibration curve. Statistics—Statistical comparisons were made by the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Study of a Potential Translocation of the Lipase from the Cytosol to the Lipid Droplet—Studies carried out in rat and 3T3 L1 adipocytes have shown that activation of lipolysis triggers the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid droplets (30Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The potential role of this mechanism of lipolysis activation in M. sexta fat body was investigated by determining the relative distribution of TG-lipase between the cytosolic and lipid droplet fractions of the adipocytes. Immunoblotting was used to estimate the abundance of TG-lipase in the fractions. A comparison between the fractions obtained from control insects and insects treated with AKH for 20 min indicated that activation of lipolysis does not change the levels of cytosolic TG lipase (Fig. 1). Moreover, we were not able to detect the presence of TG-lipase in the lipid droplet fractions. Regardless of the lipolytic condition, the fat body TG-lipase was exclusively found in the cytosol and its abundance was unaffected by the level of lipolysis (Fig. 1). Effect of TG-Lipase Phosphorylation on the Enzyme Activity against TG Contained in the Native Substrate, the Lipid Droplet—Previous studies from our laboratory (7Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1652-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Patel R. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Arrese E.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have shown that PKA phosphorylates the TG-lipase (7Arrese E.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1652-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not enhance the lipase activity (25Patel R. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Arrese E.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because these studies were carried out using an artificial emulsion of TG that certainly does not have the structural and chemical properties of the lipid droplets, we investigated the role of the phosphorylation using the native lipase substrate, the lipid droplets. To obtain lipid droplets, highly radiolabeled in the TG moiety M. sexta larvae were fed with [3H]palmitic acid. Because the moths emerge one month after the larvae were fed, there is a nearly identical distribution of radioactivity and mass among the lipid species (29Arrese E.L. Gazard J.L. Flowers M.T. Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of purified lipase and in vitro PKA-phosphorylated lipase were determined using lipid droplets isolated from the adipocytes of control insects (basal lipolysis) and from AKH-treated insects (20 min after injection). Phosphorylation of the lipase did not modify the enzyme activity hydrolyzing TG contained in the lipid droplets from control insects (Fig. 2). However, the activity of the lipase against lipid droplets isolated from AKH-treated insects was significantly greater (2.4-fold increase) than that measured against lipid droplets obtained from control insects (Fig. 2). It must be noted that no significant endogenous lipase activity was detected in lipid droplets from control- or AKH-treated insects. This was determined by incubating the lipid droplets in the reaction buffer but in the absence of TG-lipase for different time periods (0–60 min). This result is consistent with the absence of lipase associated to the lipid droplets inferred from the Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1). Time Course of AKH-induced Activation and Phosphorylation of the Lipid Droplets—AKH-induced activation of lipolysis involves a rapid 4-fold increase of fat body PKA activity that is reached 2–5 min after the injection of the hormone into the hemolymph (20Arrese E.L. Flowers M.T. Gazard J.L. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential changes in the phosphorylation state of the proteins of the lipid droplets and its possible correlation with the “activity” of the lipid droplets against purified TG-lipase were investigated. To study the time course of changes in protein phosphorylation together with the lipase activity measured against TG contained in the lipid droplets"

https://openalex.org/W2159755129,"WAVE3 is a member of the WASP/WAVE family of protein effectors of actin reorganization and cell movement. The precise role of WAVE3 in cell migration and its regulation, however, have not been elucidated. Here we show that endogenous WAVE3 was found to be concentrated in the lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating MDA-MB-231 cells. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) treatment induced lamellipodia formation as well as two-dimensional migration of cells in the wound-closure assay and chemotactic migration toward PDGF in three-dimensional migration chambers. Knockdown of WAVE3 expression by RNA interference prevented the PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Treatment of cells with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), also abrogated the PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration, suggesting that PI3K may be required for WAVE3 activity. WAVE3 and the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85, were found to interact in a yeast two-hybrid screen, which was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation. The WAVE3-p85 interaction was mediated by the N-terminal region of WAVE3 and the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85. These results imply that the WAVE3-mediated migration in MDA-MB-231 cells via lamellipodia formation is activated downstream of PI3K and induced by PDGF. The findings of the WAVE3-p85 partnership also suggest a potential regulatory role for p85 in WAVE3-dependent actin-cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration.

Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in altering both cellular morphology and motility (1Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) by controlling a range of cellular events, including immune defense, embryonic development, and neuronal outgrowth (2Millard T.H.

In response to extracellular signals such as growth factors, the WASP family of proteins, which contains WASP and N-WASP (4Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 79: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (839) Google Scholar), and the WAVE family of proteins, which contains WAVE1, -2, and -3 (5Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N.

The WASP/WAVE families are protein effectors that act downstream of the Rho GTPases to regulate actin polymerization (7Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between members of the WASP family and Cdc42 or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate are required for their activation allowing exposure of the verprolin homology, cofilin homology, and acidic (VCA) 1The abbreviations used are: VCA, verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, acidic domain; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WAVE3, WASP family verprolin-homologous protein 3; RNAi, RNA interference; WASP, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome; N-WASP, neural WASP; Arp2/3, actin-related proteins; BD, basic domain; AD, activating domain; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; siRNA, small interference RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. region, which can then bind to the Arp2/3 complex and initiate actin polymerization (10Higgs H.N.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the WAVE family function downstream of Rac to induce actin polymerization (12Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 13Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The downstream cellular effects of WASPs and WAVEs are thought to lead to the formation of actin-containing structures known as filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (7Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WASP and WAVE proteins differ in both the signaling inputs that they receive, as well as in their mode of regulation. WASP proteins are autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions that mask the VCA domain in the absence of signaling molecules such as Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (14Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 15Weaver A.M. Young M.E. Lee W.L. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On the other hand, WAVE1 and WAVE2 proteins are sequestered in an inactive state through the formation of a complex with four other proteins, PIR121, Nap125, HSPC300, and Abi1 (12Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16Gautreau A. Ho H.Y. Li J. Steen H. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli result in the dissolution of this complex, which subsequently leads to Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Whether WAVE3 activity is regulated in the same manner or not, is still unknown. Several other proteins have been shown to regulate the activity of the WASP and WAVE proteins (7Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Profilin, which has a high affinity to poly-l-proline, a proline-rich region (or proline-rich domain) that is conserved in all WASP and WAVE proteins (18Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), was shown to play a critical role in the enhancement of Cdc42-WASP-induced nucleation of actin polymerization (19Yan C. Martinez-Quiles N. Eden S. Shibata T. Takeshima F. Shinkura R. Fujiwara Y. Bronson R. Snapper S.B. Kirschner M.W. Geha R. Rosen F.S. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the WISH protein, an SH3-containing protein, was found to activate N-WASP independently of either Cdc42 or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, by binding to the proline-rich region of N-WASP (20Fukuoka M. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Fukami K. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Other proteins such as Syndapin, WIP, and Nck have been shown to physically interact with the WASP protein through different motifs to induce actin polymerization (21Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H.

Although the regulation of WASP proteins is well documented, the regulation of the WAVE proteins, and WAVE3 in particular, has not been well elucidated. The best characterized WAVE protein partner is IRSp53, which has been shown to be an essential intermediate between Rac and WAVE2 in the regulation of membrane ruffling (13Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition to the involvement of WAVE3 in actin polymerization and cytoskeleton organization (9Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5967-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induces a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell survival, in several cell types via its receptor (27Betsholtz C.

Although PDGF has clearly been shown to modulate WAVE1- and WAVE2-mediated cell motility through activation of PI3K and the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, which in turn stimulates the formation of lamellipodia (19Yan C.

We used the human MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells to investigate whether PDGF is involved in WAVE3-mediated actin reorganization and cell motility. Here we show that PDGF treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells induced the formation of lamellipodia at the edges of migrating cells, and the accumulation of WAVE3 in these lamellipodia. WAVE3 has also been shown to act downstream of PI3K and is involved in cell migration and the formation of lamellipodia induced by PDGF. We also show that this WAVE3 activity might be regulated through interaction with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. The WAVE3 siRNA oligonucleotide, 5′-UAGUACUCUUGCCGCUAUC-3′, and the control siRNA, 5′-CUUCACAGACCAAGACUGG-3′ sense strand with symmetric 3′-overhangs of two deoxythymidines, were purchased from Dharmacon and annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The control siRNA was initially designed to target the ZNF198 gene transcript but failed to affect the expression levels of ZNF198 in all the cell lines we tested. SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase Kits and Taq polymerase were obtained from Invitrogen. PCR primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The primer sequences used for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-GAAGGGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTT-3′ for the reverse primers, for p85, 5′-TACCCGCGCTCTGTACCCGT-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-TCACCTCCTCCCTTGAAATG-3′ for the reverse primer. Primers for WAVE1, WAVE2, and WAVE3 were as previously reported (6Sossey-Alaoui K. Head K. Nowak N. Cowell J.K. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study were as follows: human WAVE3/Scar and GST obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA) and human PI3K p85 obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit and goat antimouse from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was obtained from Sigma, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Cell Culture—Human MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells (ATTC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For stimulation with PDGF, the cells were first subjected to serum starvation for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then treated with 50 ng/ml recombinant PDGF. The PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 was added to the medium at a concentration of 30 μm together with PDGF. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using a Spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter Fullerton, CA), and 1 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA with the SuperScript II RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cDNA generated was used as a template for PCR for analysis of gene expression using a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler from MJ Research (Waltham, MA). Three-dimensional Migration Assay—Three-dimensional migration was assayed using collagen IV-coated inserts (8-μm pore size, BD Falcon) in 6-well plates. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and 2 ml of DMEM containing 2 × 105 cells was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber contained 3 ml of DMEM. Where required, PDGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the lower chamber. The inserts were incubated overnight at 37 °C, thereafter the nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells that were able to migrate through the pores onto the lower surface of the membrane were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (American Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL) and photographed using an inverted Leica DM IRB microscope fitted with a charge-coupled device camera (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and counted. Wound-closure Assay—This assay was used to measure the ability of cells to close a gap that is introduced in monolayer cells. MDA-MB-231 cells, plated in 6-well plates, were 80–90% confluent when they were wounded by dragging a plastic pipette tip across the cell surface. The phase contrast images of the wounds were recorded after 24 h, and the wound closure was evaluated by measuring the width of the remaining wound. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature and washed with PBS. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated in the blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Primary as well as secondary antibodies were diluted at the recommended concentration in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Actin filaments (F-actin) were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on object slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope. siRNA Treatment—An siRNA oligonucleotide targeting the human WAVE3 mRNA at nucleotide position 93–111 from the start codon was designed. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm glutamine. For transient transfections, ∼2 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates in DMEM without antibiotics 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 240 pmol of siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM1 medium (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer. Approximately 4–12 h after transfection, media was supplemented with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 48 h. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, cells were grown in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Immediately, ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of proteases inhibitors) was added. The cells were rapidly scraped off the plates, and the crude lysates were transferred to prechilled Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-WAVE3 antibody or rabbit anti-serum for 1 h, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotary wheel. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation using GST fusion proteins the cleared cell lysates were immediately mixed with 100 μg of either GST, GST-p85, or GST-p85 truncated fusion proteins and the tubes were incubated on a rotary wheel overnight at 4 °C. The next morning the protein mixtures were incubated with the anti-WAVE3 antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads as described above. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoblotting cellular lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein (50 μg) were treated with SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P (PVDF) membranes using Bio-Rad gel and transfer apparatus (Hercules, CA). Membranes were incubated in 5% whole milk (or bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, followed by incubation with the primary antibody (as specified) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and the signals were developed using a Western Lights Chemiluminescence Detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmid Construction and Transfections—WAVE3 constructs were generated using the PCR from the template WAVE3 cDNA IMAGE clone 4838122 (ATTC). All 5′- and 3′-primers used in the cloning contained an EcoRI restriction site. In the 5′-primer for the full-length WAVE3 and the WAVE3 lacking the VCA domain (ΔVCA), the ATG sequence for the first methionine was replaced by a TTG. Amplified fragments were subcloned into the pCR2·1 vector using the T-A cloning kit (Invitrogen). The subcloned fragments were inserted into EcoRI-digested pEGFPC1 or pAS2–1 vectors (Clontech), in-frame with the 3′ terminus of EGFP (GFP) or the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD), respectively. All constructs were sequence-verified using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (ABI Prism). The EGFP-recombinant vectors were used for either transient or stable transfections using standard protocols. The GST-p85SH3 (residues 39–80), -p85NSH2 (residues 333–430), and -p85CSH2 (residues 624–720) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. L. Rameh (Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Boston, MA). The WASP and WAVE proteins have been shown to play essential roles in the regulation of actin reorganization and in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, leading to cell migration in several cell types (7Takenawa T.

WAVE1 and WAVE2 are required for PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration (19Yan C. Martinez-Quiles N. Eden S. Shibata T. Takeshima F. Shinkura R. Fujiwara Y. Bronson R. Snapper S.B.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The involvement of WAVE3 in the PDGF-induced cell migration has, however, not been determined. We, therefore, addressed whether WAVE3 is also involved in PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. WAVE3 Is Required for Cell Migration—To investigate whether WAVE3 plays a role in cell migration, we targeted the WAVE3 transcript in MDA-MB-231 cells using short interfering RNAs (siRNA). Untreated cells show high endogenous levels of WAVE3, and siRNA treatment resulted in >90% knock-down of the mRNA (Fig. 1A). The expression levels of the closely related WAVE1 and WAVE2 genes were not affected by the siRNA treatment, indicating that, within this family of genes, the siRNA we used is specific for WAVE3. Treatment with WAVE3 siRNA resulted in a comparable reduction in proteins levels (Fig. 1B). Because WAVE3 is predicted to be involved in actin remodeling, we next determined whether reduction in WAVE3 protein levels affect the formation of lamellipodia, which are necessary for cell movement and migration. ∼30% of cells treated with Oligofectamine alone or with the control siRNA (si-control) formed lamellipodia after being induced with PDGF (Fig. 1, C and D). The number of cells with PDGF-induced lamellipodia was, however, reduced to <10% after transfection with siRNA against WAVE3 (Fig. 1, C and D). Because actin polymerization has also been shown to be involved in cell migration, we investigated the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 cells toward PDGF, after treatment with siRNA using the three-dimensional migration chamber assay. As shown in Fig. 1E, both untreated cells and the cells treated with the control siRNA are easily attracted toward PDGF and pass freely through the collagen-treated barrier, whereas siRNA-treated cells show a marked reduction in their ability to migrate toward PDGF (Fig. 1, E and F). We also determined the effect of WAVE3 knockdown on cell movement using the wound closure assay. Over a 24-h period the control MDA-MB-231 cells can typically completely close the space in the wound assay. However, cells treated with siWAVE3 could not (Fig. 1G), demonstrating a role of WAVE 3 in cell movement. Thus, these assays clearly demonstrate the WAVE 3 is required for cell movement and invasion. PDGF Induces Lamellipodia Formation and Migration of MDA-MB-231 Cells—The role of PDGF in cell migration has already been determined in several cell types (3Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 229: 245-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Kawamura K. Takano K. Suetsugu S. Kurisu S. Yamazaki D. Miki H. Takenawa T. Endo T. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To establish a link between PDGF and cell migration in our system, we investigated the effect of PDGF treatment on the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to form lamellipodia and migrate toward PDGF. When MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, the majority of cells showed elongated and flattened shapes, and only ∼10% of cells formed lamellipodia (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment of these cells with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 30 min induced lamellipodia formation and a polarized shape in more than 30% of cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We next examined the effect of PDGF treatment on cell motility using the wound-closure assay. PDGF-stimulated cells migrated into the wounded area and were able to close the wound within 24 h, whereas, in the serum-starved cells, the wound remained open after 24 h (Fig. 2C). As an alternative measure of cell motility, we also examined the effect of PDGF on the ability of cells to migrate in a three-dimensional migration chamber assay. We observed an increase of ∼6-fold in the number of cells that were able to migrate toward PDGF, compared with the control cells not treated with PDGF (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, PDGF is also capable of stimulating the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, in both nondirectional (wound-closure) and directional (three-dimensional migration chamber) assays, probably by inducing lamellipodia formation at the leading edges. WAVE3 Co-localizes with the Actin Structures in the Lamellipodia—Immunoblotting with a specific WAVE3 antibody showed that WAVE3 protein is present in both the serum-starved and PDGF-induced cells (Fig. 3A). WAVE3 is usually predominantly expressed in normal brain tissue (6Sossey-Alaoui K. Head K. Nowak N. Cowell J.K. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Sossey-Alaoui K. Su G. Malaj E. Roe B. Cowell J.K.

Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that WAVE3 is also expressed in several advanced stage neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines as well as in metastatic breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 cells (26Sossey-Alaoui K. Su G. Malaj E. Roe B. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5967-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which may account for the relationship between overexpression of WAVE3 and the metastatic phenotype. We next investigated whether treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with PDGF affects the intracellular distribution of the WAVE3 protein. Immunocytochemistry analyses showed that WAVE3 was largely concentrated in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the unstimulated cells showed elongated and flattened shapes and numerous stable actin fibers (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, cells induced with PDGF were able to form lamellipodia at the leading edges of migrating cells (Fig. 3B), and, in addition to the diffuse distribution of WAVE3 in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, WAVE3 was also concentrated in the lamellipodia and co-localized with the actin structures in the lamellipodia (Fig. 3B). Interaction between WAVE3 and p85 May Be Required for WAVE3-mediated Lamellipodia Formation and Cell Migration—Analysis of the WAVE1 and WAVE2 proteins demonstrates that their function is mediated through specific protein-protein interactions (12Eden S.

https://openalex.org/W2122714818,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) activates multiple signaling pathways leading to hyperplasia of cardiac fibroblasts. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by Ang II stimulation are assumed to play pivotal roles in this process. Here, we show that ROS mediate Ang II-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Ang II-induced NFAT activation was suppressed by diphenyleneiodonium (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor), dominant negative (DN)-Rac, DN-p47phox, and an inhibitor of Gα12/13 (Gα12/13-specific regulator of G protein signaling domain of p115RhoGEF, p115-regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)). Stimulation of Ang II receptor increased the intracellular ROS level in a Rac- and p47phox-dependent manner. Because p115-RGS suppressed Ang II-induced Rac activation, Ang II receptor-coupled Gα12/13 mediated NFAT activation through ROS production by Rac activation. Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged amino-terminal region of NFAT4 (GFP-NFAT4) was suppressed by p115-RGS or BAPTA but not by diphenyleneiodonium. The expression of constitutively active (CA)-Gα12/13, CA-G translocation α13, or CA-Rac increased the nuclear of GFP-NFAT4. These results suggest that NFAT activity is regulated by both Ca2+-dependent and ROS-dependent pathways. Furthermore, activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) induced by Ang II stimulation is required for NFAT activation because Ang II-induced NFAT activation was inhibited by SP600125, a selective JNK inhibitor. These results indicate that Ang II stimulates the nuclear translocation and activation of NFAT by integrated pathways including the activation of Gα12/13, Rac, NADPH oxidase, and JNK and that Gα12/13-mediated ROS production is essential for NFAT transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2097543600,"Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of asthma therapy and mediate the repression of a number of cytokine genes, such as Interleukin (IL)-4, -5, -13, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are central to the pathogenesis of asthmatic airway inflammation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediates repression by a number of diverse mechanisms. We have previously suggested that one such repressive activity is by direct binding of GR to elements within the GM-CSF enhancer that are recognized by the nuclear factor of activated T cells·activator protein 1 (NF-AT·AP-1) complex. We reasoned that, because many cytokine genes activated in asthma are transcriptionally regulated by the recruitment of this complex to DNA, their binding sites might provide a target for GR to mediate its repressive effects. Here, we show that transcriptional repression of the Interleukin-5 gene involves recruitment of GR to a DNA region located within the IL-5 proximal promoter, which is bound by NF-AT and AP-1 proteins. GR recruitment had a profound effect upon the activation capacity of GATA3, which has a binding site close to the NF-AT·AP-1 domain in both IL-5 and IL-13 promoters. Repression by GR involves co-repressor recruitment, because treatment of transfected cells with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A caused a partial relief of repression. Additionally, repression could be augmented by co-transfection of cells with a histone deacetylase (HDAC1). These data suggest that the local recruitment of GR causes repression by inhibiting transcriptional activation by GATA3, a key tissue-specific determinant of expression of Th2 cytokines.

GR was initially demonstrated to mediate transcriptional activation of the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) gene by binding as a dimer to a consensus response element, the GRE (1Zaret K.S.

Subsequently, however, the array of mechanisms utilized by GR in controlling gene expression has expanded, and in particular, details of transcriptional repression by GR have emerged. These mechanisms involve both DNA binding (2Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 3Rogatsky I. Zarember K.A.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is now clear that some of these systems may operate in conjunction with one another, thereby imparting both variability and complexity of transcriptional regulation upon a target promoter. The genes encoding IL-4, -5, -13, and GM-CSF lie in close proximity on human chromosome 5q (9Frazer K.A. Ueda Y. Zhu Y. Gifford V.R. Garofalo M.R. Mohandas N. Martin C.H. Palazzolo M.J. Cheng J.F. Rubin E.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The products of these genes are pro-inflammatory cytokines, which mediate both asthmatic and allergic responses. Our previous work has described a mechanism for transcriptional repression of the GM-CSF gene by glucocorticoids, which involves binding of GR to NF-AT·AP-1 sites within the GM-CSF enhancer (10Smith P.J. Cousins D.J. Jee Y.K. Staynov D.Z. Lee T.H. Lavender P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The NF-AT·AP-1 complex mediates signaling through the T cell receptor and acts upon numerous genes including IL-4, -5, -13, and GM-CSF (11Rooney J.W. Hodge M.R. McCaffrey P.G. Rao A. Glimcher L.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Specificity of transcriptional regulation is governed, at least in part, by factors such as GATA3 (12Zheng W. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) and c-Maf (13Ho I.C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), which precisely target selected genes rather than having ubiquitous functions. To provide further evidence that NF-AT·AP-1 sites might be sites of action for glucocorticoids, we have used the IL-5 promoter. This promoter has a number of NF-AT·AP-1 sites in addition to a GATA3 response element (14Zhang D.H. Yang L. Ray A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3817-3821PubMed Google Scholar). GATA3 is a key determinant of T cell differentiation, which has been proposed to control chromatin conformation at the 5q locus. In addition to IL-5, GATA3 also binds the IL-13 proximal promoter (15Kishikawa H. Sun J. Choi A. Miaw S.C. Ho I.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4414-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As GATA and AP-1 proteins have previously been demonstrated to functionally interact (16McBride K. Charron F. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8403-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoid repression might effect GATA3-dependent transcriptional activation. Here we demonstrated that GR mediates IL-5 repression, at least in part by acting through an NF-AT·AP-1 site in the proximal promoter. This site has a consensus NF-AT recognition sequence yet lacks an obvious AP-1 site. GR was able to bind to this site in vitro. Repressive activity could be augmented by co-expression of a histone deacetylase, whereas treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor TSA partially relieved repression. These data suggested that repression was an active process. This NFAT·AP-1 site juxtaposes a crucial GATA site in the proximal promoter of IL-5. This proximity prompted us to examine the effect of glucocorticoids on GATA3-mediated activation. Our data demonstrated that glucocorticoids had a profound repressive effect and suggest that GATA3, a key driver of T cell differentiation and IL-5 and -13 transcription, may be a target for the repressive effect of glucocorticoids on pro-inflammatory Th2 cytokine genes. Purification of CD4+ve T Cells—Venous blood was taken from healthy human volunteers using heparin as an anticoagulant. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4+ T cells were purified using positive selection (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). CD4+ purity was >95%. The cells were resuspended at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and IL-2 (50 units/ml). Ethical approval for the use of human volunteers for this study was provided by the Institutional Ethical Review Committee. Stimulation of CD4+ve T Cells—CD4+ve T cells were stimulated in 24-well microtitre plates coated with anti-CD3 (OKT-3) at 1 μg/ml. Where indicated, dexamethasone (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10-7m immediately following plating. Cultures were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, and then the cells were harvested for RNA extraction. Differentiation of Human Th2 Cells—Th2 cells were generated from naïve T cells following the protocol outlined in Cousins et al. (17Cousins D.J. Lee T.H. Staynov D.Z. J.

The cells were activated using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 either alone or in the presence of 10-7m dexamethasone for 18 h and then harvested for RNA extraction. Cell lines and Culture Conditions—Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium, HEK293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium, all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified air. Where indicated, cells were activated with 100 ng/ml phorbol dibutyrate and 1 μg/ml ionomycin (Calbiochem). Dexamethasone (Sigma) was stored at a concentration of 10-2m in ethanol and then further diluted in the appropriate culture medium and added to the cells to give the relevant final concentration. TSA (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 33 × 10-9m. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 250 ng of RNA/sample was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 60 μl using a random hexamer primer (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (10Smith P.J.

Real time quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7900 system and carboxyfluorescein-labeled “Assay-on-Demand” reagent sets (Applera) for: IL-5, Hs00174200_m1; IL-13, Hs00174379_m1; GM-CSF, Hs00171266_m1; and RAD50, Hs00194871_m1. PCR reactions were multiplexed using a VIC-labeled 18 S probe set and analyzed using SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Plasmids—The nomenclature of all plasmids is base-position relative to the transcriptional start site of the gene. p-451–+35.IL-5.CAT was previously described (18Codlin S. Soh C. Lee T. Lavender P.

Staynov D.Z. Lee T.H. Lavender P. J.

The template used was p-451–+35.IL-5.CAT. Amplimers were digested with PstI and SalI (Helena Biosciences) and cloned into pBL3.CAT, which had been linearized with the same enzymes. Upstream regulatory regions encompassing bases -130 to -39 were cloned upstream of the TATA box in the minimal promoter E1b.CAT. This fragment was derived as a PCR amplimer using the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-tacgctgcagTAAGATATAAGGCATTGGAAAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-tacgtctagaTTTGAGGAAATGAATAATTTCTAAC-3′. The -130 to -39 region of the proximal promoter was further divided into three domains: -130 to -90 sense, 5′-ctagTAAGATATAAGGCATTGGAAACATTTAGTTTCACGATATGC-3′, the IL-5 GATA.CLE0 domain; from -80 to -39 sense, 5′-ctagGCATTCTCTATCTGATTGTTAGAAATTATTCATTTCCTCAAA-3′; and the IL-5 CLEO, from -63 to -39 sense, 5′-ctagGTTAGAAATTATTCATTTCCTCAAA-3′. The complementary antisense oligos were used, in each case preserving the ctag overhang of the cloning site.

The resulting 930-bp amplimer was digested with BglII and SalI, and the 275-bp promoter/exon1 fragment was cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBL3.CAT.

Jurkat T cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum until the day prior to transfection and then transferred to medium containing serum that had been stripped with charcoal to remove endogenous steroid and maintained in this medium post-transfection. 4 × 106 Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 μg of reporter plasmid DNA ±1–3 μg of expression plasmid DNA. Electroporation was carried out at 300 mV, 960 microfarads, ∞ ohms, with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The samples were activated and treated with dexamethasone 10 min post-transfection as indicated. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in humidified air for 20 h, harvested by centrifugation, and cell lysates assayed for CAT activity. HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (21Lavender P. Vandel L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

For HeLa cells, 1 μg of reporter plasmid was used along with the same amount of expression vectors for the different transcription factors. Plasmid concentrations were equilibrated with an empty CMV expression vector. For histone deacetylase inhibition assays, TSA was added to cell cultures at a final concentration of 33 nm where indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described using purified FLAG-tagged GR protein (10Smith P.J. Cousins D.J. Jee Y.K.

The glucocorticoid response element (GRE) corresponding to -187 to -161 from the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat was used as a positive control for GR binding and has the following sequence: 5′-GATCGTTTATGGTTACAAACTGTTCTTAAAACA-3′ (23Scheidereit C.

HEK293 cells were transfected with CMV.hGRα, CS2+MT.Sin3A, and CMV.FLAG.H-DAC1 or CMV.FLAG.GATA3 as a negative control. Whole cell lysates were prepared in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% NP40 (IGEPAL, Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were captured by centrifugation, and the beads were washed four times with IPH buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, with thorough mixing of samples at each wash. Immunoprecipitates were then resuspended and electrophoresed through 8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in TBS/Tween 20/4% milk, and then probed with anti-GR antiserum (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Myc tag (New England Biolabs), or anti-FLAG (Sigma). The location of immunoreactive complexes was revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. Th2 Cytokine Transcription Is Repressed by Glucocorticoids—The effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on expression of genes within the human 5q locus was analyzed using primary human CD4+ T cells and primary human Th2 cells. The cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 18 h, either alone or in the presence of 10-7m dexamethasone before harvest and cDNA preparation. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment inhibited IL-4, -5, and -13 and GM-CSF, although having no effect on either RAD50 RNA or 18 S ribosomal RNA expression (Fig. 1A). These data were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR using cDNA derived from the same source of cells. PCR reactions were normalized for 18 S ribosomal RNA expression, and cytokine gene expression was significantly repressed by glucocorticoid treatment compared with RAD50 (Fig. 1C). Data derived from freshly isolated CD4+ cells, containing both naïve and memory populations, was similar to that generated from differentiated Th2 cells. These data demonstrated that glucocorticoids are able to act broadly to mediate repression of 5q cytokine genes. Repression of IL-5 Transcription Is Mediated by the Proximal Promoter—Although glucocorticoids have numerous potential functional targets, we wished to assess effects mediated through interactions of GR with DNA. The IL-5 promoter was therefore functionally tested for its capacity to mediate glucocorticoid responsiveness. Two CAT reporter vectors were generated, driven by either 447- or 130-bp of IL-5 promoter DNA (Fig. 2A). Jurkat T cells were transiently co-transfected with NF-ATc, c-Fos, and c-Jun expression vectors, treated with or without 10-7m dexamethasone, and activated with phorbol dibutyrate/ionomycin for 20 h. A combination of NF-AT and AP-1 proteins could transcriptionally up-regulate both IL-5 promoter fusions, and this up-regulation could be repressed by treatment with dexamethasone. By contrast, a consensus GRE, driving CAT expression under control of the minimal SV40 promoter, was potently activated by glucocorticoids (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that a GR-responsive domain resides within the most proximal 130 bp to the IL-5 transcriptional start site. Repression of the IL-5 Promoter Is Mediated by an NF-AT/AP-1 Response Element—We have previously determined that repression of the GM-CSF enhancer by glucocorticoids mapped to a series of NF-AT/AP-1 sites. The proximal 130 bp of the IL-5 promoter, which mediated dexamethasone responsiveness, is also regulated by the NF-AT·AP-1 complex. The -130 to +35 domain also contains previously described response elements for GATA3, as well as CLE0 binding proteins. These three subdomains were isolated from the IL-5 promoter and were cloned upstream of the TATA box of the E1b minimal promoter (Fig. 3A). In these experiments, we asked whether a given IL-5 region, once activated by NF-AT/AP-1, could be repressed by glucocorticoids. The transcriptional activity of each activated construct was ascribed a value of 100%, and the effect of glucocorticoids was assessed relative to this value. The data demonstrated that the minimal domain mediating repression mapped between -130 and -90 relative to the IL-5 transcriptional start site (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the GATA.CLE0 element (-85 to -39) and the CLE0 (-63 to -39) were slightly activated by the addition of glucocorticoids. The potent down-regulation of the endogenous message demonstrated in Fig. 1 suggests that the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids overrides any local activation at the GATA/CLE0 site. Glucocorticoid Receptor Binds to the IL-5 NF-AT/AP-1 Response Element in Vitro—To understand the mechanism of repression, we determined whether purified GR was capable of directly binding to this -130 to -90 NF-AT/AP-1 element using a band retardation assay. In this experiment, we compared the capacity of GR to bind to IL-5 and to a consensus murine mammary tumor virus GRE and also the capacity of the IL-5 element to act as a competitor of GR binding to the GRE and vice versa. We observed comparable DNA binding ability of GR to the two sites, and each individual site showed almost equivalent activity as a competitor (Fig. 4). These data suggest that in this in vitro scenario, GR was capable of binding directly to the -130 to -90 IL-5 element. Repression of IL-5 Is Mediated by Histone Deacetylases—GR is known to mediate its repressive effects by a variety of mechanisms. Many classes of transcription factor impose their transcriptional effects through the recruitment of proteins that have the ability to modify nucleosomal histone tails, particularly the amino termini of H3 and H4. Acetylation and deacetylation have been demonstrated to be involved in gene activation and repression, respectively. We asked whether the repressive activity of GR at the IL-5 promoter was active or whether it merely blocked the accessibility of the positively acting NF-AT·AP-1 complex to DNA. We addressed this in two ways: first, by the inclusion of the HDAC inhibitor TSA in our repression experiments and second, by HDAC overexpression. We reasoned that if there was no active component, TSA would have no effect on repressive capacity. TSA was, however, able to relieve GR-mediated transcriptional repression of reporter constructs driven by the minimal 41-bp NF-AT/AP-1 response element (-130–-90.IL-5.CAT), the IL-5 promoter (-130-+35.IL-5.CAT), and the GM-CSF enhancer driving CAT expression from the minimal promoter E1b (GM-CSF.E1b.CAT) (Fig. 5A). These data imply that histone deacetylases are involved in the repression of IL-5. HDAC1 was able to augment GR-mediated repression when overexpressed in transient transfections using both IL-5 and GM-CSF reporter constructs (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data suggest that GR promotes active repression that is facilitated by co-repressor recruitment. GR Interacts with HDAC1—To determine whether GR was detectable in a complex with HDAC1, we overexpressed both proteins and Sin3A, a HDAC co-factor, in HEK293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. GR immunoreactivity was present in FLAG immunoprecipitates from FLAG HDAC1-expressing cells, as was Myc-tagged Sin3A. By contrast, no GR was detected in FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the negative control, FLAG.GATA3 (Fig. 6). These data suggest that GR may form a complex with histone deacetylases. The interaction between GR and HDAC1 appeared to be stable, because it was able to withstand vortexing in 500 mm NaCl/IPH wash buffer. Glucocorticoids Potently Repress GATA3-mediated Activation of the IL-5 and IL-13 Promoters—PCR of cDNA derived from the primary CD4+ and Th2 cells demonstrated that cytokine messenger RNA expression was potently repressed by glucocorticoids (Fig. 1). By contrast, the transfections demonstrated only a partial repressive activity mediated by GR binding to NF-AT/AP-1 response elements. In these experiments, we envisaged competition between NF-AT/AP-1 and GR for binding to the same DNA element. The consequence of this competition would be that the two distinct classes of transcription factors would recruit co-activator (via NF-AT·AP-1) or co-repressor (via GR) complexes to the same DNA site, thereby imparting conflicting regulatory signals upon the transcriptional apparatus. To address how this site occupancy would influence repression by GR, we used the fact that the IL-5 promoter can be activated by GATA3, which binding site juxtaposes the -130 to -90 NF-AT/AP-1 site. We reasoned that binding of GATA3 to its site and activation via this route would leave the NF-AT/AP-1 site vacant to permit unimpeded DNA binding by GR. This was done in parallel with transfection of a combination of both NF-AT/AP-1 and GATA3. We performed these co-transfection experiments on both IL-5 -130 to +35 and IL-13 -227 to +50 promoters, which show similar organization with respect to the proximity of NF-AT/AP-1 and GATA3 response elements. With both promoters, NF-AT/AP-1-mediated activation was only partially repressible by glucocorticoids (Fig. 7). When the NF-AT response element was vacant, as when the constructs were activated by GATA3, treatment with glucocorticoids caused an almost complete repression. We observed no ability of GR to interact with GATA3 as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6), and we had previously shown that GR does not mediate repression by acting through the GATA.CLE0 site (Fig. 3). When both GATA3 and NFAT/AP-1 proteins were used as the activator, the constructs reverted to being only partially repressible by steroids. The data suggest that, at both IL-5 and IL-13 proximal promoters, the most profound effect of glucocorticoids is upon GATA3-dependent transcriptional activation and that NF-AT/AP-1 impairs this repression by competing with GR for DNA binding.

Target-induced folding provides a mechanism by which activators could form specific interactions with an array of structurally unrelated target proteins. Evidence for such a binding mechanism has been reported previously in the context of the interaction between the cancer-related c-Myc protein and the TATA-binding protein, which can be modeled as a two-step process in which a rapidly forming, low affinity complex slowly converts to a more stable form, consistent with a coupled binding and folding reaction. To test the generality of the target-induced folding model, we investigated the binding of two widely studied acidic activators, Gal4 and VP16, to a set of target proteins, including TATA-binding protein and the Swi1 and Snf5 subunits of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that these activator-target combinations also display bi-phasic kinetics suggesting two distinct steps. A fast initial binding phase that is inhibited by high ionic strength is followed by a slow phase that is favored by increased temperature. In all cases, overall affinity increases with temperature and, in most cases, with increased ionic strength. These results are consistent with a general mechanism for recruitment of transcriptional components to promoters by naturally occurring acidic activators, by which the initial contact is mediated predominantly through electrostatic interactions, whereas subsequent target-induced folding of the activator results in a stable complex.

Transcriptional activators function by binding specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes and subsequently recruiting components of the transcriptional machinery via their activation domains (ADs). 1The abbreviations used are: AD, activation domain; ABD, activator binding domain; TBP, TATA-box binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, resonance unit(s). Activation domains have to be able to interact with multiple structurally unrelated target proteins because eukaryotic genes require successive recruitment of different co-activator proteins (1Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and different target genes utilize different repertoires of co-activators, even if they are regulated by the same activator (2Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Munsterkotter M. Horz W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6407-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Lui L. Berger S.L. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which activator proteins make specific interactions with structurally distinct target proteins is, however, poorly understood. Many activation domains are known to be intrinsically unstructured but are found in a folded conformation when bound to target proteins (for review, see Ref. 4Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Whereas the structures of the initial and final states of some systems have been characterized, the determinants of complementarity, as well as the mechanism of the coupled folding and binding event, remain unknown. Support for the physiological significance of this transition has been provided by studies showing the unstructured nature of activation domains, even in the context of intact activator proteins (5Grossmann J.G. Sharff A.J. O'Hare P. Luisi B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Ayed A. Mulder F.A.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations, causing substitutions of hydrophobic residues that might be expected to affect folding of the glucocorticoid receptor tau1 activation domain have been shown to cause changes in the activity of the intact receptor protein (7Almlöf T. Gustafsson J Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the activation domain from the cancer-related c-Myc protein interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) in two steps, such that folding of the c-Myc activation domain is coupled to its interaction with the surface of TBP (8Hermann S. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40127-40132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Coupled binding and folding could explain how activators are able to interact specifically with a large set of structurally different targets in the transcriptional machinery and recruit them to promoters. The c-Myc activation domain is unusual because it is divided in two protein segments that are interspersed with sequences that destabilize c-Myc by targeting its proteasome-mediated degradation (9Flinn E.M. Busch C.M. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5961-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Flinn E.M. Wallberg A.E. Hermann S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike the c-Myc activation domain, many activation domains consist of short protein segments that are rich in acidic amino acids. Two examples of acidic transcriptional activators that display extensive structural flexibility in their activation domains are Gal4 and VP16 (5Grossmann J.G. Sharff A.J. O'Hare P. Luisi B.

Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal activation domain of Gal4 also contains the interaction site for Gal80, which inhibits Gal4 activity under non-inducing conditions (14Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 15Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16Johnston M.

VP16 is a co-activator involved in activation of immediate early viral genes in herpes simplex-infected cells, and the C-terminal domain has been identified as an activation domain (18Triezenberg S.J.

Cell. 1988; 52: 425-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Acidic activators have been proposed to interact with target proteins by complementary electrostatic interactions mediated via their acidic residues, without adopting defined structures (20Sigler P.B.

A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it has also been demonstrated that critical hydrophobic amino acids are essential for both target factor binding and the activating potential of acidic activation domains, whereas mutating individual acidic residues has little or no effect (7Almlöf T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4487-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results underscore the importance of critical hydrophobic residues in the target interaction that could be coupled to the conformational changes referred to earlier. Indeed, the Gal4 and Gcn4 acidic activation domains have been shown to adopt β-sheet conformation under acidic conditions in vitro, and mutational analysis indicates that this is a structural requirement for the activation function of Gal4 (11Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Van Hoy M. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, a relatively recent report indicates that whereas conformational changes may be important for interaction with Gal80, they may not be significant for either the activation activity of Gal4 or its interaction with TBP (21Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both the Gal4 and VP16 activation domains interact with TBP with an affinity that correlates with their potency (26Sullivan S.M. Horn P.J. Olson V.A. Koop A.H. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Triezenberg S.J.

We have recently shown that they can also recruit the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex to activated promoters via interactions with specific segments within the Swi1 and Snf5 subunits of the complex (32Neely K.E.

Cell. 2003; 12: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These activator-interacting segments are not required for the overall integrity of the Swi/Snf complex, but when both are deleted, interaction with activators is severely reduced. This reduction correlates with a similar reduction in the activation potential of Gal4 in yeast strains containing the defective Swi/Snf complex (34Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Li B. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these segments of the Swi/Snf complex interact with activator proteins have not been studied. Here we investigate whether the target-induced folding model for the mechanism of activator-target protein interactions that we previously suggested in the context of the interaction between c-Myc and TBP could be a general mechanism for the interaction of acidic transcriptional activators with a broader group of target proteins. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have focused on binding of the two highly acidic natural activators Gal4 and VP16 to the yeast target proteins TBP, Swi1, and Snf5. The results demonstrate that the target-induced folding model is applicable to a broader range of activator-target protein interactions. Plasmids and Proteins—pRSET-Snf5, which encodes amino acids 1–334 of yeast Snf5 with an N-terminal His6 tag, has been described previously (34Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Li B. Workman J.L.

All proteins in this study were produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli strain BL21/(DE3)pLys by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. His-tagged Snf5ABD and Swi1ABD were expressed from fresh transformants in SOC medium at 37 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 500 mm NaCl, supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by thawing and sonication. Lysates were cleared by DNase treatment and centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Up to 40 mm imidazole in resuspension buffer was used for washing, prior to elution with 500 mm imidazole. Swi1ABD was dialyzed (Sigma; molecular weight cutoff, 12,000) against TC100 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), and Snf5ABD was dialyzed against HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20). GST and GST fusion proteins of VP16AD and Gal4AD were expressed in LB medium at 37 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. They were subsequently treated essentially as described above, except that the soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Resuspension buffer was used for washing, prior to elution with 20 mm glutathione in resuspension buffer. GST and GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Yeast TBP was purified and treated as described previously (8Hermann S. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40127-40132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All proteins were frozen immediately following purification and subsequently stored at –70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). All proteins were at least 90–95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. SPR Analysis—Kinetic experiments were performed on a BIA-core2000 instrument under control of the BIAcore control 3.1 software (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden). Amine-coupling kits and GST capture kits were purchased from BIACORE. The following is common to all experiments. Approximately 5000 resonance units (RU) of anti-GST antibodies were immobilized onto flow cell surfaces of CM4 sensor chips (BIACORE) using amine coupling chemistry. Prior to experiments, the binding capacity of immobilized antibodies was tested by capturing GST. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were carried out at 25 °C, using HBS supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 as running buffer. GST and the GST-tagged activators were separately immobilized onto the sensor chip, after which 75 μl of target protein was injected at a rate of 20 μl/min. After each cycle, flow cell surfaces were regenerated by two pulses of regeneration buffer (10 mm glycine, pH 2.2) (BIACORE). All response data were collected at a rate of 1 Hz, manually aligned along the x-axis and y-axis, and processed by double referencing (i.e. subtraction of background binding to the affinity tag (GST), as well as adjustment for flow cell-specific bulk effects by subtraction of buffer injection). Curve fitting was performed using BIAevaluation 3.0.2 software (BIACORE) and a sequential two-step model as previously described (8Hermann S. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40127-40132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Comparison of wild-type and mutant VP16AD was performed on adjacent flow cells. Characterization of the VP16AD-TBP interaction was performed in duplicate samples on adjacent flow cells, using 0.83, 1.7, and 3.3 μm TBP. One injection of buffer control was run prior to injection of target protein and used for double referencing. Characterization of the Gal4AD-TBP, Gal4AD-Swi1ABD, and VP16AD-Swi1ABD interactions was performed on flow cell 2, using flow cell 1 for the GST reference, with the following concentrations of target proteins: 0.21, 0.43, 0.85, 1.7, and 3.4 μm Swi1ABD; and 0.21, 0.41, 0.83, 1.7, and 3.3 μm TBP. Three consecutive injections of buffer control were run prior to injection of dilution series of target proteins, which were followed by a fourth buffer control injection. An average of three buffer injections was used for double referencing. The running buffer was supplemented with 2% glycerol, and analyte samples were diluted to 2% glycerol prior to injection. Temperature experiments on Gal4AD-Swi1ABD were performed using the running buffer described above containing 300 mm NaCl. Reproducibility was assessed as follows. Results obtained by repeating the 150 mm NaCl experiment at 25 °C on Gal4AD-TBP at different time points and on different sensor chips varied by <11% for the fast phase, 18% for the slow phase, and 27% for overall affinity. For duplicates on parallel flow cells in VP16AD-TBP experiments, results generally varied by <11% for the fast phase, 26% for the slow phase, and 26% for overall affinity. Acidic Activators Bind Target Proteins in Two Major Kinetic Steps—We used SPR to monitor the interaction of target proteins with activation domains that were immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip. Using this technique, it is possible to measure the time-dependent association of target proteins in the buffer stream with immobilized activation domains as they flow over the chip surface. Furthermore, because the continuous flow of target protein solution can be exchanged for buffer alone following association, it is possible to measure the dissociation kinetics of complexes that have been formed on the chip surface. The plots (sensograms) are then subjected to regression analysis in order to extract the kinetic and equilibrium constants according to a selected binding model. To determine whether acidic activators bind to target proteins by a mechanism similar to that reported for the c-Myc-TBP interaction, we measured the kinetics of VP16AD binding to TBP as well as protein segments constituting the ABDs of Swi1 and Snf5. Fig. 1 displays the characteristic bi-phasic time course of VP16AD interacting with all three target proteins. The mutant VP16Δ456, which has impaired transcriptional activity (18Triezenberg S.J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1199-1208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and displays severely reduced affinity for Swi1 and Snf5 (33Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Brown C.E. Howe L. Workman J.L.

Cell. 2003; 12: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is included as a control. As expected, this mutant (Fig. 1, gray line) also produces a significantly reduced SPR response. A two-step model reproduces the experimental data well (Fig. 1, dashed line) and demonstrates that activator-target complex formation is consistent with an initial fast step followed by a subsequent slower step. Increased Temperature Favors the Slow Phase but Generally Does Not Affect the Fast Initial Phase—The kinetics of activator binding to a dilution series of target proteins was measured as a function of temperature. Fig. 2 provides an overview of the binding data by showing sensograms for the highest concentration of the respective target proteins interacting with each activator at the extremes of temperature tested. All activator-target combinations interact with bi-phasic kinetics under all conditions tested. Higher temperature (black line) significantly increases the rate of the slow association phase but does not markedly affect the dissociation rate or the fast association phase, resulting in an increased rate of complex formation. To investigate the nature of the respective interaction phases, equilibrium affinity constants for initial and subsequent phases were obtained as a function of temperature and subjected to a van't Hoff analysis. Increased temperature caused a progressive increase in association during the slow phase for all activator-target combinations, and the positive sign of the van't Hoff enthalpy indicates that the slow phase is entropy-driven (Fig. 3, A–D; Table I). The fast phase was not significantly affected by temperature, except in the case of Gal4AD binding to Swi1ABD, in which the fast phase displays a clear trend that is opposite to that of the slow phase (Fig. 3B; Table I).Table Ivan't Hoff enthalpies calculated from data shown in Figs.3and6Activator-target interactionΔHslowΔHfastΔHoverallkJ × mol-1kJ × mol-1kJ × mol-1Gal4AD-TBP52 ± 181 ± 452 ± 16VP16AD-TBP39 ± 4-3 ± 835 ± 12Gal4AD-SwilABDa300 mm NaCl.172 ± 53-53 ± 8118 ± 45VP16AD-SwilABD72 ± 1416 ± 1393 ± 9a 300 mm NaCl. Open table in a new tab Increased Ionic Strength Inhibits the Fast Initial Phase but Favors the Subsequent Slow Phase—The kinetics of activator binding to a dilution series of target proteins was measured as a function of NaCl concentration. An overview of the binding data is shown by the sensograms for the highest concentration of the respective target proteins interacting with each activator at the extremes of NaCl concentrations tested (Fig. 4). As shown for the effect of temperature (Fig. 2), the interaction kinetics of each of the activator-target combinations remains bi-phasic under all the conditions studied. Increased ionic strength (gray line) significantly reduces the amplitude of the overall response without significantly affecting the relative contribution of the fast and slow association phases, as would be expected if the initial step was largely electrostatic in nature. When plotted as the natural logarithms of the calculated affinity constants for each binding phase as a function of NaCl concentration, the data demonstrate that increasing ionic strength results in a reduction of the magnitude of the initial fast phase for all activator-target combinations (Fig. 5, A–D). Contrary to this inhibitory effect on the initial fast phase, increasing ionic strength favored the subsequent slow phase. Effect of Increased Ionic Strength and Temperature on the Overall Affinity of Acidic Activators for Target Proteins—The different nature of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions makes it difficult to predict the effect of increased ionic strength and temperature on the overall affinity of activator-target interactions. Fig. 6A shows that the overall affinities for all the interactions tested increase with increased temperature. The slopes of these plots again yield a positive van't Hoff enthalpy for binding. The overall reaction is therefore also entropy-driven. The effect of increasing ionic strength on overall affinity (Fig. 6B) is more heterogeneous. Gal4AD displayed an increased overall affinity for both TBP and Swi1ABD with increasing ionic strength. VP16AD behaves differently when binding Swi1ABD and TBP. The VP16AD-Swi1ABD interaction is similar to the Gal4AD pattern with both targets, although in the case of VP16AD binding to Swi1ABD, the increase in overall affinity with increased ionic strength is subtle. However, the interaction of VP16AD with TBP is sensitive to increasing ionic strength and thus shows a trend opposite to that observed for the other interactions. Here we have tested the generality of the target-induced folding model, using the activation domains of two naturally occurring acidic activators, Gal4 and VP16, which are frequently used as models in studies of activator function. In addition to the well-established binding partner TBP, two recently defined activator-binding domains within the Swi1 and Snf5 subunits of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex were also studied. The target-induced folding model that we proposed previously to account for the interaction between c-Myc and TBP entails three main requirements. First, the interaction between activator and target occurs in two main steps. Second, the initial step is rapid and dependent on electrostatic interactions between the proteins. Third, the second interaction step is slower and entropy-driven, suggesting the involvement of protein folding. All three of these conditions are fulfilled by all the interactions between the acidic activators and target proteins tested here. We therefore propose that the target-induced protein folding model is applicable to a broad range of activator-target interactions. It has been suggested that activation domains of acidic activators, including VP16 and Gal4, function as “acid blobs” that recruit target proteins to promoters via low affinity, nonspecific electrostatic interactions (20Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 21Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results provide a more complete context for understanding the role played by electrostatic forces in interactions between acidic activation domains and the target factors they recruit. According to our model, electrostatic interactions dominate during the initial binding phase, but they generally have a subordinate role in the subsequent entropy-driven phase, where formation of the final complex depends on hydrophobic interactions. This is consistent with our observation that increased temperature, which increases the efficiency of the entropy-driven step, stabilizes formation of the final complex. Our model is consistent with genetic studies showing both the importance of overall acidity and the crucial role played by specific individual hydrophobic but not individual acidic residues in activation domain function (7Almlöf T. Gustafsson J Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Almlöf T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J. Å. J. Biol.

We conclude that whereas electrostatic interactions might sometimes increase the rate of complex formation, the affinity of interactions between acidic activators and the factors they recruit depends on hydrophobic interactions that are likely to be associated with folding of the participating activation domains. The target-induced folding model suggests that target proteins exert a dominant influence on the ultimate state of the activator-target complex, and thus one might expect to see characteristic binding patterns associated with at least some target proteins. Such a pattern was observed for TBP, for which all changes in experimental variables had essentially the same effects on the binding pattern of both VP16AD and Gal4AD (see Figs. 2 and 4). This suggests that the activators may have similar contacts on TBP, a notion that is supported by previous studies (30Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In light of these results, a picture emerges of a relatively predefined TBP scaffold, providing a common surface specialized in activator recognition. Although all the interactions studied here conform to the two-step target-induced folding interaction model, differential contributions of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions could be responsible for some interesting differences between the different activator-target interactions. One example is the different behavior of the overall affinities for the VP16AD-TBP and Gal4AD-TBP complexes in response to ionic strength. This behavior correlates with previous affinity data for TBP, measured using other techniques (29Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 30Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Unlike VP16AD, Gal4AD displays increased overall affinity for both target proteins in increased ionic strength, which suggests that Gal4AD may have some additional unfavorable electrostatic interactions to overcome upon complex formation, compared with VP16AD. Furthermore, the observation that Swi1ABD, but not TBP, can support an increased overall affinity with both of these activators at high ionic strength helps to illuminate the individual influence of a target on activator binding despite some potentially unfavorable interactions. Interestingly, whereas the effect of ionic strength on overall affinity appears to depend on both activator and target protein, the magnitude of the effect of temperature appears to depend entirely on the target protein (see Fig. 6, A and B). Higher temperature has a stronger positive effect on the activator complexes with Swi1 than it does with TBP. These binding characteristics of Swi1 could be interpreted as the activator-binding surface being more hydrophobic in nature. Upon activator binding, repulsive electrostatic interactions dominate, compared with TBP. However, because there are multiple ways that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions could combine at the interaction interfaces producing the observed differences between activator-target complexes, it is difficult to predict a priori the nature of the interaction surfaces. In summary, our results indicate that the acidic activator proteins Gal4 and VP16 share a common target protein binding mechanism that is consistent with binding-induced folding of the activator. We propose that, in general, the role of the abundant acidic residues of such activators is primarily to promote a rapid, rather unspecific, initial contact and that specificity relies on hydrophobic interactions that determine the stability of the final complex and the rate with which it forms. However, as shown here, the relative contribution of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to complex stability varies for particular activator-target combinations. The model we propose provides a framework that integrates the previously demonstrated importance of both acidic and bulky hydrophobic amino acid residues for target recruitment and the activation potential of acidic activators (11Leuther K.K.

They are subject to post-translational modification by phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues. Recent evidence suggested that STATs are methylated on a conserved arginine residue within the N-terminal region. STAT arginine methylation has been described to be important for STAT function and loss of arginine methylation was discussed to be involved in interferon resistance of cancer cells. Here we provide several independent lines of evidence indicating that the issue of arginine methylation of STATs has to be reassessed. First, we show that treatment of melanoma and fibrosarcoma cells with inhibitors used to suppress methylation (N-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine, adenosine, dl-homocysteine) had profound and rapid effects on phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 but also on p38 and Erk signaling cascades which are known to cross-talk with the Jak/STAT pathway. Second, we show that anti-methylarginine antibodies did not precipitate specifically STAT1 or STAT3. Third, we show that mutation of Arg31 to Lys led to destabilization of STAT1 and STAT3, implicating an important structural role of Arg31. Finally, purified catalytically active protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1, -2, -3, -4, and -6) did not methylate STAT proteins, and cotransfection with PRMT1 did not affect STAT1-controlled reporter gene activity.

Subsequent to receptor binding, the STAT proteins are phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue (Tyr701 in STAT1 and Tyr705 in STAT3). The phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptors, form active dimers through interactions of their SH2 domains, and translocate to the nucleus to induce gene transcription. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, STATs 1, 3, and 5 also require phosphorylation on a serine residue in the C-terminal region to achieve maximal transactivation potential (1Heinrich P.C.

Later, it was published by the same group that methylation of Arg31 of STAT1 is necessary for its dephosphorylation by the phosphatase TcPTP (5Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol.

Therefore, we started to investigate the potential arginine methylation of STATs. Our results did not confirm the occurrence of arginine methylation on STAT1 or STAT3 in cell culture or in vitro.

Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In agreement with a very recent report by Meissner et al. (11Meissner T. Krause E. Lodige I. Vinkemeier U. Cell. 2004; 119: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) we present further compelling evidence which suggests the lack of arginine methylation on STATs. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—729 or WM9 cells (human melanoma cells obtained from Dr. G. Blanck, University of South Florida, and from Dr. M. Herlyn, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). 2fTGH and U3A cells (human fibrosarcoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London); MEF fl/fl and STAT3-negative MEF Δ/Δ cells (murine embryonic fibroblasts kindly provided by Dr. V. Poli, Torino, Italy) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 100 mg/liter streptomycin and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% CO2. Transient transfections of MEF Δ/Δ and U3A cells were performed using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokines and Reagents—IFNα and OSM were obtained from IntronA and from Peprotech, respectively. Recombinant IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor was prepared as described previously (12Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Küster A. Müller-Newen G.

Adenosine, dl-homocysteine, MDA, and 5′-methylthioadenosine were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in culture medium or Me2SO. Plasmids—The constructs of human STAT1 R31K and murine STAT3 R31K were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pBS-STAT1 and pBS-STAT3 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Hirano (Osaka, Japan) and were used as a template in PCR. cDNA fragments corresponding to human STAT1wt, STAT1R31K, murine STAT3wt, or STAT3R31K were then inserted into KpnI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The plasmid encoding a GST fusion protein of full-length STAT1 was generated by excision of an EcoRV/NotI fragment from pBS-STAT1 and subsequent ligation into the SmaI/NotI sites of pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). PGEX-HRMT1L2 (v2) (= pGEX-PRMT1, human) has been described previously (14Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). pGEX-GAR was a gift from Dr. S. Clarke (15Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1 hPRMT1 full-length wild type was cloned from the pGEX-HRMT1L2 (v2) by PCR introducing a BamHI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the HRMT1L2 cDNA (deleting the stop at the same time). Subsequently the HRMT1L2 cDNA was subcloned with BamHI and EcoRI into pcDNA3.1-B (Invitrogen) generating a C-terminal myc/His-tag. The point mutations S69A, G70A, and T71A were introduced into pcDNA3.1 hPRMT1 via site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit to give rise to pcDNA3.1 PRMT1 full-length catalytic mutant. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed on the dish with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were clarified at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall) and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Rabbit anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) (9171), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (9131), rabbit anti-phospho-MAP-KAPK-2 (Thr222) (3044), and mouse anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (9106) were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Mouse anti-STAT1 (610185) and mouse anti-STAT3 (610189) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-STAT1 (E-23), rabbit anti-STAT3 (C-20), rabbit anti-p38 (C-20), goat anti-Erk1/2 (C-16 and C-14), goat anti-SOCS3 (M-20), anti-GST (B-14, mouse IgG1), and anti-Lamin A/C (346, mouse IgM) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-phospho-p38 (V1211) was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). ab412 (mono- and dimethylarginine antibody, mouse IgG1) and ab413 (dimethylarginine antibody, mouse IgM) were supplied from Abcam. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 20 min at 75 °C. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates (1 ml containing 1.5 mg of protein) were incubated with 5 μl of monoclonal mono-/dimethylarginine antibody (Abcam) or an isotype control antibody overnight at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were precipitated with 5 mg protein A-Sepharose (CL-4B, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, and boiled in Lämmli buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and EMSAs were performed as described previously (17Kortylewski M. Komyod W.

Dermatol. 2004; 122: 414-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using the m67SIE probe binding STAT1 and STAT3. GST Fusion Protein Expression—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 using the pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) vector system. Purification of GST fusions from crude bacterial lysates was performed by immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, fusion proteins were eluted from the beads in the presence of 25 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 solution. Eluates were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol. In Vitro Methyltansferase Assays—Eluted and dialyzed GST-PRMT1 was incubated with eluted/dialysed GST-GAR and GST-STAT1, respectively, in the presences of 1 μl of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, 60 mCi/mmol) and phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 2 h. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. Reporter Gene Assay—U3A cells were transfected with 3 μg of IRF-1 luciferase reporter construct, 1 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid, and 100 ng of STAT1wt or 1 μg of STAT1R31K using Superfect (Qiagen). MEF Δ/Δ cells were transfected with 3 μg of c-fos luciferase reporter construct, 1 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid, and 100 ng of STAT3 wt or 1 μg of STAT3R31K using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1000 units/ml IFNα or 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 for 16 h. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed using Promega's dual luciferase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the co-transfected β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular Modeling of the N-terminal Domains of STAT1 and STAT3—For molecular modeling and graphic representation of the protein structures, the programs WHAT IF (18Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (52–56): 29Google Scholar), Ribbons (19Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and Rasmol (20Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar) were used. The structure of the N-terminal domain of STAT4, Brookhaven data bank entry code 1BGF (21Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), was used as a template for the model structures. MDA Affects Multiple Signaling Pathways—A combination of N-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine, dl-homocysteine, and adenosine (termed MDA treatment) has been employed previously as an inhibitor of methylation reactions (5Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35787-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Chen W. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J.

In the following, we investigated the effects of MDA on the STAT signaling pathway in WM9 and 729 melanoma cells. MDA reduced the IFNα- or OSM-mediated STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity (Fig. 1A, first through fifth panels). Interestingly, when reprobing the blots with antibodies against phosphorylated p38 and Erks, we found that MDA had a serious impact on these kinases, i.e. it resulted in a dramatic decrease of p38 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, seventh and tenth panels). Moreover, phosphorylation of MAPKAP2 was reduced, and it abrogated inducible SOCS3 expression in WM9 cells (Fig. 1A, sixth and ninth panels). The effect was detectable at a concentration of 0.2 mm MDA (Fig. 1B), which is below the concentrations that have previously been used to inhibit methylation (0.3 mm up to 2 mm (5Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35787-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Chen W. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22795-22798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). The inhibition of signal transduction by preincubation with MDA occurred rapidly, i.e. in less than 1 h (Fig. 1B, lower panels). In fibrosarcoma cells, MDA pretreatment similarly attenuated IFNα- and OSM-mediated STAT phosphorylation as well as p38 and SHP-2 phosphorylation. In this cellular system, however, MDA treatment stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). The Jak/STAT signaling cascade is well known to be subject to cross talk with signaling pathways involving Erks, p38, and SHP-2 (1Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar, 23Platanias L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Fischer P.

Therefore, effects of MDA treatment on STAT function do not necessarily mean that STAT arginine methylation is affected. Since the solvent, culture medium or Me2SO, was reported to influence the effect of the methylation inhibitor MTA on STAT phosphorylation (4Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 7Mowen K. David M.

Cell. 2004; 119: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of MDA using either culture medium or Me2SO as carrier. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, phosphorylation of STATs, Erk1/2, and p38 was diminished upon MDA treatment, irrespective of the solvent used. We also tested the effects of MTA, dissolved in culture medium or in Me2SO (supplemental Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2 was unchanged by MTA treatment. We observed in 729 melanoma cells an inhibitory effect of MTA on STAT phosphorylation, in particular STAT3, but this effect was independent of the solvent, which does not correspond to the findings by Mowen and David (7Mowen K. David M. Cell. 2004; 119: 589-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). No Evidence for Specific Recognition of STAT1 and STAT3 by Dimethylarginine Antibodies—We used the mono-/dimethylarginine-specific antibody ab412 for precipitation experiments, which has been employed to detect methylation of STATs (4Mowen K.A.

Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A monoclonal STAT1 antibody recognized a band in the immunoprecipitate of 2fTGH cell lysate co-migrating with STAT1, which was not precipitated by an anti-GST antibody, the isotype-matched specificity control (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). However, a band with the same apparent molecular weight could be seen in the lane with immunoprecipitates of STAT1-deficient 2fTGH-derived U3A cells (lane 2). In contrast, a polyclonal anti-STAT1 antibody did not reveal STAT1 precipitated by the anti-methylarginine antibody, whereas in the lysate lanes STAT1 was readily detected by this antibody (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Similarly, the mono-/dimethylarginine-specific antibody ab412 precipitates a protein, which is recognized by a monoclonal STAT3 antibody in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 2B, upper panel). However, a protein co-migrating with STAT3 was also precipitated from lysates of MEFs lacking STAT3 (Δ/Δ) and recognized in STAT3-specific Western blots, indicating again a specificity problem. Using another STAT3-specific antibody for detection we observed no band corresponding to STAT3 neither in wild-type MEFs nor in STAT3 knock-out MEFs (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Furthermore, the dimethylarginine-specific antibody ab413 did not lead to a specific precipitation of STAT1 or STAT3 (data not shown). Taken together, these data do not provide any evidence for arginine methylation of STATs but indicate a specificity problem of the mouse anti-STAT antibodies and underline the importance of negative control cells (i.e. STAT1/3-deficient cells). Exchange of Arg31 Renders STATs Unstable—Replacement of STAT1 Arg31 by alanine or by glutamic acid or of STAT6 Arg27 by alanine rendered the proteins unstable (4Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 6Chen W. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6744-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, the solved structure of the STAT4 N-terminal region (21Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggests that Arg31 plays a structural role as it has multiple contacts with other amino acids in the N-terminal domain, which are also conserved in STAT1 and STAT3 (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). To generate a mutation that would minimize structural effects we decided to exchange Arg31 by Lys. Structural models of the N-terminal regions of STAT1 and STAT3 indicated that this residue could mimic at least one of the two salt bridges built up by Arg31 (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). However, upon heterologous expression the mutant STAT1 and STAT3 proteins still turned out to be expressed to a much lower extent (Fig. 2, C and D, upper panels), an effect that could at least partly be attributed to the reduced half-life of the R31K mutants, which was investigated by cycloheximide treatment and Western blot analysis (lower panels). In the case of STAT1, the RK mutation slightly reduced STAT1-mediated gene expression but had no effect on IFNα-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation or induction of STAT1 DNA binding activity (supplemental Fig. 3A). The RK mutation in STAT3 led to a decrease in STAT3-mediated gene expression and possibly in IL-6/sIL-6R-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 3B). However, the relevance of these effects is questionable considering the 10-fold excess of DNA encoding the R31K mutants of STAT1 or STAT3, which was needed to obtain approximately equivalent expression levels of the wild-type and mutant proteins. No Evidence for in Vitro Methylation of STAT by PRMT1 and for Effects of PRMT1 on STAT1-mediated Gene Expression—To assess arginine methylation directly we performed in vitro methylation assays using purified PRMT1 as well as GST-STAT1 and GST-STAT3 fusion proteins. Although PRMT1-mediated 14C-labeled methyl group incorporation was readily detectable for histone H4 and GST-GAR (glycine-arginine-rich domain of fibrillarin), which were used as positive controls, we failed to detect methylation of the STAT fusion proteins (Fig. 3A and data not shown). We further tested whether STAT3 could be a substrate for other PRMT family members, like PRMT2, -3, -4, and -6, but could not detect any in vitro methylation of STAT3 by these enzymes (data not shown). We co-expressed PRMT1 or a mutant of PRMT1 lacking catalytic activity together with STAT1 in U3A cells lacking STAT1 along with a STAT1-responsive reporter construct. The slight increase in reporter gene activity observed in cells coexpressing PRMT1 was similarly evident in cells expressing catalytically inactive PRMT1. Thus, it is unlikely that the methyl transferase activity of PRMT1 affects STAT function (Fig. 3B). In the current study, we provide several lines of evidence questioning the previously proposed arginine methylation of STATs. (i) We did not observe an in vitro methylation of a full-length GST-STAT1 fusion protein by PRMT1, although the catalytic activity of our enzyme preparation was readily demonstrated for the glycine-arginine rich protein. It should be noted that Mowen et al. (4Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) used a GST fusion protein of STAT1 truncated after the N-terminal 129 amino acids to demonstrate in vitro methylation, which might explain the divergent results. Moreover, we did not observe in vitro methylation of a GST-STAT3 fusion protein by active enzyme preparations of PRMT1, -2, -3, -4, or -6, although FLAG-tagged STAT3 had been used as a positive control in a study on in vivo arginine methylation of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein (8Rho J. Choi S. Seong Y.R. Choi J. Im D.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8031-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we did not observe a difference in STAT1-mediated reporter gene activity upon co-expression of PRMT1 or a catalytically inactive form of PRMT1. Interestingly, in previous reports a similar PRMT1 co-expression substantially enhanced reporter gene activity controlled by NIP45 co-activator and nuclear hormone receptors, respectively (28Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 29Mowen K.A. Schurter B.T. Fathman J.W. David M. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, our data indicate that PRMT1 does not affect STAT1 function with respect to transcriptional regulation. (ii) Certain STAT antibodies can apparently recognize proteins that are precipitated by anti-methylarginine antibodies but that are different from STAT1 or STAT3, since they were also observed in cells lacking STAT1 and STAT3, respectively. The reason for this unexpected cross-reactivity of potentially arginine-methylated proteins with monoclonal antibodies directed against STAT1 or STAT3 is currently unknown. A potential unspecific detection of proteins, which are co-migrating with STAT1 and STAT3, makes it difficult to interpret Western blot results (4Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 5Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). (iii) Our data certainly underline the importance of Arg31 for the structural integrity and stability of the STAT protein, a fact already implied by the solved crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of STAT4 (21Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Analyzing the three-dimensional structure it is difficult to envisage how this arginine residue can post-translationally be modified. When the DNA amounts of the STAT wild-type and R31K mutant expression vectors were adapted to obtain equal overall expression levels, we observed a suppressive effect of the mutation on STAT-mediated gene expression. Our findings are contrasting those describing a gain-of-function upon mutation of Arg31 in GST-STAT1 (4Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) but would match data describing loss-of-function of STAT1-Arg31 and STAT6-Arg27 mutants, which both showed defective nuclear translocation (6Chen W. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6744-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Meissner T. Krause E. Lodige I. Vinkemeier U. Cell. 2004; 119: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (iv) We have shown that MDA treatment not only affects STAT phosphorylation and DNA binding activity but also rapidly reduces phosphorylation of p38 and Erk MAP kinases. MTA primarily inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and weakly also of STAT1. The MDA effects can be observed at concentrations below those usually used for inhibition of arginine methylation (5Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35787-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Chen W. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22795-22798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, MDA treatment suppressed luciferase reporter gene expression under the control of the IRF-1 promoter, but it also led to a reduction of β-galactosidase expression regulated via the cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown) further underlining the wide range of MDA effects. The Jak/STAT signal transduction cascade is known to be influenced by other pathways (1Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar, 23Platanias L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Fischer P. Lehmann U. Sobota R.M.

Therefore, effects of MDA treatment on STAT function could well be explained by the influence on these and possibly other signaling molecules and do not necessarily imply an involvement of STAT arginine methylation. N-Methyl-2-deoxyadenine is a nucleoside that naturally only occurs in DNA from prokaryotes. Long term incubation with this compound has previously been shown to affect various cell types: it induces differentiation of P19 teratocarcinoma cells and of C6.9 glioma cells, neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, and also stimulates C2C12 cells to undergo myogenic differentiation. Based on inhibitor studies, a possible involvement of adenosine A2a receptors and cAMP-, MAPK-, and rapamycin-sensitive pathways has been discussed (30Ratel D. Boisseau S. Davidson S.M. Ballester B.

It clearly warrents further investigations to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects of MDA and MTA on STAT function and the p38 and Erk pathways, as well as the role protein arginine methylation may play.

We have used this map to identify areas that are constantly illuminated during a lunar day in summer and which may therefore be in permanent sunlight. All are located on the northern rim of Peary crater, close to the north pole. Permanently sunlit areas represent prime locations for lunar outpost sites as they have abundant solar energy, are relatively benign thermally (when compared with equatorial regions), and are close to permanently shadowed regions that may contain water ice."

Sorting to the apical membrane is essential for transporter function; however, little is known regarding cellular proteins that bind ATP binding cassette proteins and regulate their trafficking. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat liver cDNA library identified the myosin II regulatory light chain, MLC2, as a binding partner for BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2. The interactions were confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. BSEP and MLC2 were overrepresented in a rat liver subcellular fraction enriched in canalicular membrane vesicles, and MLC2 colocalized with BSEP in the apical domain of hepatocytes and polarized WifB, HepG2, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Expression of a dominant negative, non-phosphorylatable MLC2 mutant reduced steady state BSEP levels in the apical domain of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Pulse-chase studies revealed that Blebbistatin, a specific myosin II inhibitor, severely impaired delivery of newly synthesized BSEP to the apical surface.

A yeast two-hybrid screen identified myosin II regulatory light chain, MLC2, as a BSEP binding partner.

These findings indicate that myosin-II is required for BSEP trafficking to the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Materials and Antibodies—Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid system and vectors were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), pEGFP-N1 and pEYFP-N2 vectors from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and pMAL-p2x from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

Mlc2 cDNA was excised from pMP47–5 with XbaI and XhoI and transferred to pFLAG-CMV to generate pMlc2-FLAG. Mlc2 cDNA excised with EcoR1 and SalI was subcloned into pMAL-p2x to produce pMAL-Mlc2. cDNA inserts from pBsep-EYFP, pMlc2-WT-GFP, and pMlc2-AA-GFP (18Fumoto K. Uchimura T. Iwasaki T. Ueda K.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A PCR DNA fragment coding for amino acids 653–741 of rat Bsep was cloned into pSOS vector (Stratagene) to generate bait plasmid pSL49. A liver cDNA library was generated in the pMyr vector from rat liver poly(A)+RNA using the Superscript system (Invitrogen). Library plasmid DNA was co-transformed into temperature-sensitive cdc25h yeast with pSOS bait plasmids. Yeast grown for 24–48 h at 25 °C were replica-plated on galactose plates and incubated at the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C for 3–5 days. Individual colonies that grew at 37 °C were picked and expanded in liquid medium at 25 °C. Washed cells were spotted on galactose or glucose solid media and incubated at 37 °C. GST Pulldowns—GSH-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used to purify GST, GST-MDR2, and GST-BSEP fusion proteins from BL-21 Escherichia coli harboring plasmids pGEX5–3x, pSL27, or pSL25 (15Ortiz D.F.

For binding to GST-MDR2, 5 mg of protein from a rat liver homogenate 2000 × g pellet were solubilized for 30 min in binding buffers containing 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 μl/ml aprotinin), 50 mm KPO4, and either 250, 350, or 450 mm NaCl and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated for 2–3 h with 10 μg of GST or GST-MDR2 proteins bound to GSH-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed four times with the corresponding binding buffers, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer for immunoblot analyses with anti-MLC2 antibodies. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) and MBP-MLC2 were purified from TB-1 E. coli according to the manufacturer's instructions. GSH-Sepharose beads coated with 1 μg of GST or GST-BSEP were incubated for 2 h with 100 ng of MBP or MBP-MLC2 in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were washed three times with PBS 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs). Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Culture and Transfection of Mammalian Cells—Rat liver cryosections were prepared and immunostained (20Ortiz D.F. Li S. Iyer R. Zhang X. Novikoff P. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1493-G1500PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-thin sections were fixed in cold methanol and incubated with MLC2-P and c219 antibodies or normal rabbit serum and normal mouse IgG. Primary antibodies were labeled with Alexa-488 anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-594 anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies. WifB9 and HepG2 cells were cultured on poly-lysine-coated glass coverslips, which were washed in PBS, fixed in methanol, and blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal donkey serum in Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were then incubated 1–2 h with goat anti-MLC-A20 and mouse anti-MDR1 (c219) antibodies diluted in IF buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's PBS). Coverslips were washed ten times in PBS, blocked for 30 min with IF buffer, and incubated with Texas red-labeled donkey anti-goat and fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibodies for 45 min. Coverslips were washed ten times in PBS and mounted using Prolong anti-quench mounting medium. Mounted tissue sections and cells were viewed with a Hammamatsu digital camera on an Axiovert 10 epifluorescence microscope. MDCKII cells (gift from Dr. Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan) were grown in transwells (Corning) and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transwells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol. Filters were excised, washed ten times with PBS, and mounted on glass slides. Fluorescent proteins were viewed with a Leica TRS2 laser confocal microscope. Preparation of Membrane Fractions, Immunoblot Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—Preparation of rat liver subcellular fractions, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitations from rat liver fractions were performed as indicated (20Ortiz D.F. Li S. Iyer R. Zhang X. Novikoff P. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1493-G1500PubMed Google Scholar). Enrichment of marker proteins was determined by immunoblot analyses, except for lysosomes and mitochondria, which were measured by biochemical enzyme assay. Rat liver lysosomes (21Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mitochondria (22Lotscher H.R. Winterhalter K.H. Carafoli E. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9325-9330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo. MDCK cells cultured in six-well plates were transfected with pBsep-DsRed, or pmDsRed, pMlc2-FLAG, or pFLAG-CMV. Two days later cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μm dithiobissuccinimidylpropionate. Cells were washed with 50 mm glycine in PBS and lysed for 1 h in 2× PBS 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm glycine. Homogenates were prepared by douncing 10 strokes in a glass homogenizer and centrifuging for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose beads, which were removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of Tu41 antisera or normal rabbit serum overnight. Antibodies were recovered with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, which were washed four times with 2× PBS 0.25% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Biotinylation and Pulse-Chase Metabolic Labeling—Cell surface biotinylation and pulse-chase labeling of proteins in MDCK cells were performed as described (20Ortiz D.F. Li S. Iyer R. Zhang X. Novikoff P. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1493-G1500PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the time periods indicated. Blebbistatin was dissolved in Me2SO to produce a 10-mm stock solution that was stored under nitrogen. For myosin II inhibition, transwells were preincubated for 30 min before the pulse in medium containing 100 μm Blebbistatin or Me2SO. Inhibitor was maintained throughout the pulse and chase periods. The Linker Domains of MDR1, MDR2, and BSEP Interact with MLC2 in Yeast—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat liver cDNA library was performed using the BSEP linker domain as bait. The linker resides immediately downstream of the first nucleotide binding domain and connects the homologous halves of BSEP (Fig. 1A) (24Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The screen identified a full-length cDNA that encodes the rat non-muscle regulatory myosin II light chain MLC2 as a BSEP interacting protein. Mlc2 cDNAs were isolated on three separate occasions. Plasmid pM47–5, which contains the full-length Mlc2 cDNA, permitted growth at 37 °C of yeast that harbored plasmids expressing BSEP (pSL47), MDR2 (pSL49), and MDR1a linkers (pSL 67) (Fig. 1B). It did not enable growth of yeast carrying the empty pSOS vector, pSOS-Coll (a negative control that expresses amino acids 148–357 of murine type IV collagenase), or pSOS fusions that contain the amino-terminal 40 amino acids of MDR2 (PSL55) or the carboxyl-terminal 35 residues of MDR2 (pSL56). Thus, MLC2 interacts with the linker domains of three MDR subfamily members. Two-hybrid analyses of pSL47 and pSL49 deletion derivatives revealed that MLC2 interacted in yeast with portions of the MDR2 and BSEP linkers that are proximal to the amino-terminal nucleotide binding domains (Fig. 1, C and D). The minimal MLC2 binding region was 32 amino acids in BSEP and 24 residues in MDR2. GST-MDR2 and GST-BSEP Fusion Proteins Bind MLC2— GSH-agarose beads adsorbed with a chimeric GST protein containing 79 amino acids of the MDR2 linker, or with GST alone, were incubated with rat liver homogenates. GST-MDR2 beads effectively extracted MLC2 from liver homogenates, whereas GST alone did not (Fig. 2A). The interaction was robust, and GST-MDR2 was capable of binding MLC2 in the presence of 0.5 m salt. GSH-agarose beads coated with GST-BSEP, which contains 90 amino acids of the BSEP linker, were incubated with purified MBP or an MBP-MLC2 chimera. Immunoblots of bound proteins revealed that MBP-MLC2 interacted with GST-BSEP, but not with GST alone (Fig. 2B). MBP alone did not bind GST-BSEP or GST alone. These experiments, together with the yeast two-hybrid results, indicate that MDR2 and BSEP linker domains interact directly with MLC2. MLC2 Co-precipitates with BSEP from Mammalian Cell Extracts—BSEP was immunoprecipitated from MDCK cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing BSEP-DsRed and MLC2 tagged with the FLAG peptide. Immunoblot analysis revealed that immunoprecipitates contained MLC2 in addition to BSEP (Fig. 3). MLC2 was not immunoprecipitated from cells that did not express BSEP, indicating that anti-BSEP Tu41 antibody does not cross-react with MLC2. Co-immunoprecipitation indicates that MLC2 and BSEP interact in mammalian cells. MLC2 Is Enriched in the Canalicular Domain of Hepatocytes, WifB9, and HepG2 cells—Immunofluorescence microscopy of rat liver sections revealed that MLC2 was enriched in the apical domain of hepatocytes. Colocalization of MLC2 and MDR1/2 fluorescence was most pronounced in pericanalicular vesicles rather than in the canalicular membrane (Fig. 4A). The hepatoma-derived WifB9 (25Ihrke G. Neufeld E.B. Meads T. Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Laurent M. Schroer T.A. Pagano R.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; : 1761-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and HepG2 (26Sormunen R. Eskelinen S. Lehto V.P. Lab. Investig. 1993; 68: 652-662PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chiu J.H. Hu C.P. Lui W.Y. Lo S.C. Chang C.M. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) cell lines polarize in culture to form canalicular structures between cells that are functionally and structurally analogous to the bile canaliculus of hepatocytes. MLC2 is enriched in the apical domain of WifB9 (Fig. 4B) and HepG2 (Fig. 4C) cells. In both hepatocytes and cell lines, MLC2 colocalized with MDR1 in abundant pericanalicular vesicles. Close proximity of these vesicles to the canalicular membrane prevented resolution as to whether MLC2 and the transporters colocalize in the canalicular membrane. Myosin II Co-immunoprecipitates with BSEP and MDR1/2 from Rat Liver CMV—Immunoblot analyses of rat liver subcellular fractions indicated that BSEP, MDR1, MDR2, MLC2, and myosin II heavy chain were enriched in canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) (Fig. 5A). BSEP or MDR1/2 were immunoprecipitated from CMV using Tu41 or c219 antibodies, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were examined for subunits of myosin II, which is a heterohexamer composed of two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains. Immunoprecipitation of the transporters also precipitated myosin heavy chain (Fig. 5, B and C). MLC2 detection in immunoprecipitates was obscured by IgG light chains, which co-migrated with MLC2 in SDS-PAGE gels. Tu41 and c219 antibodies did not precipitate myosin heavy chain from liver fractions that contained myosin II but were devoid of BSEP, indicating that anti-BSEP and anti-MDR1 antibodies do not cross-react with myosin II. These data indicate that BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2 transporters interact with the myosin II holoenzyme in hepatocytes. Expression of a Non-phosphorylatable MLC2 Mutant Decreases Apical Membrane BSEP in MDCK Cells—MLC2 phosphorylation at threonine 18 and serine 19 residues positively regulates myosin II activity (28Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing a non-phosphorylatable MLC2 mutant (MLC-AA-GFP), in which Thr-18 and Ser-19 were replaced by alanine, or wild-type MLC2 (MLC-WT-GFP) fused to GFP, were cotransfected into MDCK cells with constructs expressing BSEP-DsRed. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of polarized MDCK monolayers revealed that MLC-WT-GFP was concentrated in punctate structures that were enriched in the apical domain and colocalized with apical BSEP-DsRed. The MLC-AA-GFP mutant was dispersed in the cytoplasm and did not display the apical punctate distribution. Intracellular BSEP-DsRed fluorescence was markedly increased in cells expressing MLC-AA-GFP when compared with controls expressing MLC-WT-GFP (Fig. 6). Biotinylation of surface proteins in transfected MDCK cells revealed that plasma membrane BSEP-EYFP resides exclusively in the apical domain (15Ortiz D.F. Moseley J. Calderon G. Swift A.L. Li S. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32761-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Apical BSEP-EYFP levels in cells co-transfected with MLC-AA-GFP were less than half (45 ± 6%) of those observed in controls expressing MLC-WT-GFP (Fig. 7, A and B). Expression of MLC-AA-GFP did not significantly affect BSEP-EYFP expression levels, and biotinylation analyses indicated that MLC-AA-GFP did not induce mistargeting of BSEP-EYFP to the basolateral membrane (not shown). Expression of mutant MLC-AA-GFP did not affect transepithelial permeability of MDCK monolayers to mannitol (Fig. 7C), indicating that tight junction integrity is not affected by expression of the dominant negative mutant. Myosin II Inhibition Impairs BSEP Delivery to the Apical Membrane—Myosin II activity is specifically inhibited by Blebbistatin (29Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), which is membrane permeable. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling was performed in transfected MDCK cells treated with 100 μm Blebbistatin and in controls. Total cellular levels of metabolically labeled BSEP were not significantly different in Blebbistatin-treated cells and controls (Fig. 8, Total), indicating that Blebbistatin did not affect BSEP-EYFP translation or processing. Delivery of newly synthesized BSEP-EYFP to the apical membrane was determined by immunoprecipitation of surface-biotinylated proteins. Metabolically labeled BSEP-EYFP was detected in the apical membrane of MDCK cells after a 1-h chase, and its levels peaked at 3–4 h (15Ortiz D.F. Moseley J. Calderon G. Swift A.L. Li S. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32761-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Blebbistatin-treated cells, apical membrane levels of radioactively labeled BSEP were reduced by 72 ± 14, 61 ± 15, and 60 ± 11% after 2, 3, and 4 h of chase, respectively, when compared with the corresponding controls (Fig. 8, Apical). These data indicate that myosin II inhibition impairs delivery of newly synthesized BSEP to the apical membrane of MDCK cells. The MLC2 gene product was identified as a binding partner for BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Interactions were confirmed in vitro by GST pulldown assays and in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation. MLC2 encodes a 20-kDa regulatory light chain subunit of the non-muscle myosin II holoenzyme, which consists of two heavy chains, two regulatory light chains, and two essential light chains (30Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). The regulatory light chains are an integral part of the complex and have no known function separate from the myosin II heavy chains in cells. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation of BSEP or MDR1 and MDR2 co-precipitated the myosin II heavy chain, indicating that the transporters interact with MLC2 as part of the myosin II holoenzyme. MLC2 is phosphorylated on threonine 18 and serine 19 by myosin light chain kinase, p21 kinase, or RHO kinase and dephosphorylated by myosin light chain phosphatase (28Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 30Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). MLC2 phosphorylation regulates activity of the myosin II complex by influencing its ability to interact with actin and stimulating multimerization of heavy chains (31Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 3: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Trybus K.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A non-phosphorylatable form of MLC2, in which threonine 18 and serine 19 have been replaced by alanine residues, supplants MLC2 on the holoenzyme and inhibits localized myosin II activation by cellular kinases (18Fumoto K. Uchimura T. Iwasaki T. Ueda K. Hosoya H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of this dominant negative MLC2 mutant inhibits oocyte fertilization (33Simerly C. Nowak G. de Lanerolle P. Schatten G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2509-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), chromaffin granule secretion (34Neco P. Giner D. Viniegra S. Borges R. Villarroel A. Gutierrez L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27450-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and cell migration after wounding (18Fumoto K. Uchimura T. Iwasaki T. Ueda K. Hosoya H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Confocal fluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation of polarized MDCK cells revealed that non-phosphorylatable MLC2 increased intracellular BSEP abundance and significantly reduced apical membrane BSEP levels. To elucidate how myosin II influences BSEP distribution, myosin II was inhibited by Blebbistatin, and trafficking of metabolically labeled proteins to the apical membrane was analyzed by pulse-chase and cell surface biotinylation. Blebbistatin is a specific membrane-permeable inhibitor that stabilizes myosin II in an actin-detached state (35Ramamurthy B. Yengo C.M. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14832-14839Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Kovacs M. Toth J. Hetenyi C. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35557-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) and inhibits muscle and non-muscle myosin II activities with IC50s ranging from 0.05 to 5 μm. It does not affect activity of non-conventional myosins I, V, X, or XV at 100 μm (37Limouze J. Straight A.F. Mitchison T. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase studies indicated that myosin II inhibition did not affect BSEP synthesis or post-translational modification. Analyses of metabolically labeled surface-biotinylated proteins revealed that Blebbistatin significantly impaired appearance of newly synthesized BSEP in the apical surface of MDCK cells, confirming that myosin II plays an important role in delivery of the transporter to the apical membrane. Non-muscle myosin II is required for cell motility, cytokinesis, and morphology maintenance in many cell types. In hepatocytes, myosin II is enriched in the apical actin network and MLC2 phosphorylation is coincident with canalicular contraction (38Tsukada N. Azuma T. Phillips M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6919-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki S. Watanabe S. Hirose M. Kitamura T. Oide H. Sato N. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 31: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). There are several possible mechanisms by which myosin II could participate in BSEP trafficking. Myosin II is associated with membranes of the Golgi and trans-Golgi networks (40Ikonen E. de Almeid J.B. Fath K.R. Burgess D.R. Ashman K. Simons K. Stow J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110 (Pt. 18): 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fucini R.V. Chen J.L. Sharma C. Kessels M.M. Stamnes M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is required for formation and release of specific vesicle subtypes in these compartments (42Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 43Musch A. Cohen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, myosin II inhibition could impair BSEP delivery to the apical membrane by blocking its departure from Golgi and/or trans-Golgi networks. This mechanism is unlikely because inhibition of myosin II with non-phosphorylatable MLC2 did not result in BSEP accumulation in Golgi. The myosin II motor also participates in vesicle transport. Anti-myosin II antibodies and inhibitors of MLC phosphorylation prevented movement of myosin II-containing vesicles on actin filaments in vitro (44Wollert T. DePina A.S. DeSelm C.J. Langford G.M. Biol. Bull. 2003; 205: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 45Sandberg L. Stafford P. Langford G.M. Biol. Bull. 2000; 199: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Inhibition of myosin II activity or MLC phosphorylation suppressed insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells (46Iida Y. Senda T. Matsukawa Y. Onoda K. Miyazaki J.I. Sakaguchi H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Niki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E782-E789PubMed Google Scholar), granule exocytosis in chromaffin cells (34Neco P. Giner D. Viniegra S. Borges R. Villarroel A. Gutierrez L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27450-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and mobilization of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic neurons (47Ryan T.A. J.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, myosin II may facilitate BSEP vesicular transport to the canalicular membrane. BSEP trafficking to the apical domain requires microtubules (10Wakabayashi Y. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Arias I.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3485-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar, 13Misra S. Ujhazy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, microtubules do not contact the canalicular membrane but rather abut the cortical actin sheath that surrounds the canaliculus (49Tsukada N. Ackerley C.A. Phillips M.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1106-1113PubMed Google Scholar, 50Novikoff P.M. Cammer M. Tao L. Oda H. Stockert R.J. Wolkoff A.W. Satir P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 21-32PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that myosin II is enriched in the apical domain of hepatocytes, WifB9, and HepG2 cells and colocalizes with endogenously expressed ABC transporters in pericanalicular vesicles. Delivery of rhodopsin (51Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and Trk receptor (52Heerssen H.M. Pazyra M.F. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to their target membranes requires direct interactions with light chains of the dynein motor complex. Similarly, BSEP association with the myosin II regulatory light chain may enable vesicles carrying the transporter to negotiate the dense, multilayered actin network that envelops the canaliculus."
https://openalex.org/W2061154983,"Upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 is frequent in human cancers and may result from tissue hypoxia or genetic mechanisms, in particular the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene (TSG). Tumours with VHL inactivation are highly vascular, but it is unclear to what extent HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms account for pVHL tumour suppressor activity. As the identification of novel pVHL targets might provide insights into pVHL tumour suppressor activity, we performed gene expression microarray analysis in VHL-wild-type and VHL-null renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. We identified 30 differentially regulated pVHL targets (26 of which were 'novel') and the results of microarray analysis were confirmed in all 11 novel targets further analysed by real-time RT-PCR or Western blotting. Furthermore, nine of 11 targets were dysregulated in the majority of a series of primary clear cell RCC with VHL inactivation. Three of the nine targets had been identified previously as candidate TSGs (DOC-2/DAB2, CDKN1C and SPARC) and all were upregulated by wild-type pVHL. The significance for pVHL function of two further genes upregulated by wild-type pVHL was initially unclear, but re-expression of GNG4 (G protein gamma-4 subunit/guanine nucleotide-binding protein-4) and MLC2 (myosin light chain) in a RCC cell line suppressed tumour cell growth. pVHL regulation of CDKN1C, SPARC and GNG4 was not mimicked by hypoxia, whereas for six of 11 novel targets analysed (including DOC-2/DAB2 and MLC2) the effects of pVHL inactivation and hypoxia were similar. For GPR56 there was evidence of a tissue-specific hypoxia response. Such a phenomenon might, in part, explain organ-specific tumorigenesis in VHL disease. These provide insights into mechanisms of pVHL tumour suppressor function and identify novel hypoxia-responsive targets that might be implicated in tumorigenesis in both VHL disease and in other cancers with HIF upregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2112400982,"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Previously, we showed that Scd1 deficiency reduces liver triglyceride accumulation and considerably decreases synthesis of very low density lipoprotein and its secretion in both lean and obese mice. In the present study, we found that Scd1 deficiency significantly modulates hepatic glycerophospholipid profile. The content of phosphatidylcholine (PC) was increased by 40% and the activities of CTP:choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo PC synthesis, and choline phosphotransferase were increased by 64 and 53%, respectively, in liver of Scd1-/- mice. In contrast, the protein level of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in PC synthesis via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, was decreased by 80% in the liver of Scd1-/- mice. Membrane translocation of CCT is required for its activation. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that twice as much CCTα was associated with plasma membrane in livers of Scd1-/- compared with wild type mice, suggesting that Scd1 mutation leads to an increase in CCT membrane affinity. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PC was increased by 2.5-fold in Scd1-/- primary hepatocytes compared with those of wild type mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity was reduced by 42% in liver of Scd1-/- mice; however, the activities of microsomal glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and ethanolamine phosphotransferase were not affected by Scd1 mutation.

TAG is the major energy storage form, as well as a major component of secreted chylomicra and lipoproteins, mainly very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). PLs, the primary lipid component of cellular membranes, are essential for the synthesis and secretion of bile and lipoproteins, as well as providing a reservoir of signaling molecules like lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, and the arachidonate- and eicosapentanoate-derived eicosanoids (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA (or palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoleoyl-CoA), has recently been shown to be an important control point of lipogenesis, leading many to believe that SCD inhibition might play a protective role against obesity and the metabolic syndrome (reviewed in Refs. 2Ntambi J.M.

Furthermore, Scd1 has been found to be a major target gene of leptin, and the antisteatotic effects of this hormone in the liver were shown to be, to a large extent, mediated by repression of Scd1 (10Cohen P.

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the primary PL of eukaryotic cellular membranes and has a crucial role in structural maintenance of the lipid bilayer. In mammals, PC is also the predominant phospholipid in plasma lipoproteins and bile and plays a critical role as a second messenger in signal transduction (14Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism,1st Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). PC is the major component of intracellular transport vesicles, and the synthesis of PC is intimately involved in the regulation of vesicle transport (15Howe A.G. McMaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ongoing PC synthesis is also required for global transcriptional regulation of lipid biosynthesis (reviewed in Ref. 15Howe A.G. McMaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In liver, PC is synthesized through two routes, the CDP-choline pathway (the Kennedy pathway) and the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). Studies on Pemt-/- mice have suggested that PEMT is involved in synthesizing PC that is exported into bile (16Agellon L.B. Walkey C.J. Vance D.E. Kuipers F. Verkade H.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and plays a significant role in synthesis and secretion of VLDL (17Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

The CDP-choline pathway is a three-step process: phosphorylation of intracellular choline and conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, which reacts with 1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG) to form PC and accounts for ∼70% of hepatic PC biosynthesis (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway is CTP:choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which catalyzes the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem.

Although hepatic cells express two isoforms of CCT, α and β, CCTα is the predominant isoform in liver (20Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends. Biochem.

One well characterized mode of regulation of CCT activity is through translocation of the protein from an inactive, soluble form to an active, membrane-bound form (20Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C.

The insertion of CCT into membranes has been shown to increase by the properties of membranes, including loose packing of lipids in the membrane (23Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), curvature strain (24Johnson J.E. Xie M. Singh L.M. Edge R. Cornell R.B. J. Biol.

Because oleic acid is the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid in mammalian PL, we hypothesized that membrane perturbation that might occur as a consequence of Scd1 deficiency would affect CCT translocation into membranes, and thus SCD might play an important role in regulating PC biosynthesis. To understand the role of SCD in PL synthesis, we investigated the major steps of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis in liver of Scd1-/- mice. We analyzed the activities of key enzymes involved in PL biosynthesis in liver and measured the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into different glycerolipid classes in Scd1-/- primary hepatocytes. Our study revealed that Scd1 deficiency specifically increases CCT activity by promoting its translocation into the membrane and thus enhances PC biosynthesis in liver. Animals—The generation of Scd1-/- mice has been previously described (5Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Twelve-week-old purebred homozygous (Scd1-/-) and wild type male mice on SV-129 background were used. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility operating on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed a normal nonpurified diet (5008 test diet; PMI Nutrition International Inc., Richmond, IN). The breeding of these animals was in accordance with the protocols approved by the Animal Care Research Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Mice were sacrificed and livers were isolated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Materials—CDP[methyl-14C]choline, CDP[2-14C]ethanolamine, [3H]-glycerol, [methyl-14C]phosphocholine, [3H]glycerol-3-phosphate, [1-14C]-oleoyl-CoA, and α-[32P]dCTP were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-CCTα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-PEMT antibodies were obtained from Dr. Jean Vance (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Lipid standards were from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Newark, DE). All other chemicals were purchased either from Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Measurement of Lipids—Liver lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43088) Google Scholar) and measured as described (28Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Dobrzyn A. Gorski J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E277-E285Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipids were separated into DAG, TAG, free fatty acids, and PL by thin layer chromatography on silica gel-60 plates (Merck) in heptane/isopropyl ether/glacial acetic acid (60/40/4, v/v/v) with authentic standards. Additionally, PL classes were separated in chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50/37.5/3.5/2, v/v/v/v). The bands corresponding to standards were scraped off the plate and transferred to screw cap glass tubes containing methylpentadecanoic acid as an internal standard. Fatty acids were then transmethylated in the presence of 14% boron trifluoride in methanol. The resulting methyl esters were extracted with hexane and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Total contents were calculated from individual fatty acid content in each fraction. Hepatocyte Isolation and Radiolabeling with [3H]Glycerol—Hepatocytes from wild type and Scd1-/- mice were isolated as described (30White A.L. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and the livers were perfused first with Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl2, 20 mm d-glucose, 6.7 mm KCl, 1 mm adenosine, 1.5 mm NaOH, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 nm insulin) for 10 min (7 ml/min), followed by Buffer B (Buffer A without EGTA, supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 mg/ml collagenase B) for an additional 10 min. Hepatocytes were released into Hanks' buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 4.19 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 9.12 mm Hepes, NaOH (pH 7.4)) containing 2% BSA and washed twice with ice-cold low-glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml), and 100 nm insulin. Resuspended hepatocytes were plated in 6-well plates at 6.2 × 105 cells/well. The cells were incubated with [3H]glycerol (4.4 μCi, 25 μm final concentration) in 2 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum, low-glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (28Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After 12 h, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted and fractionated by TLC as described above. Incubations were performed in triplicate and terminated by placing the culture plates on ice. The 3H-labeled spots were scraped into vials and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Western Blot Analysis—For the measurement of total levels of PEMT and CCTα, liver samples were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, and 10% glycerol and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. For measurement of membrane-associated CCTα, total membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h as described (17Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 9% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred and immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies against PEMT and CCTα. The proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein level was used as a loading control. Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase Activity—GPAT activity was assayed with 300 μm [3H]glycerol-3-phosphate and 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA according to Muoio et al. (31Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) in samples containing both microsomes and mitochondria. Microsomal GPAT was estimated by subtracting the N-ethylmaleimide-resistant activity (mitochondrial GPAT) from the total. CTP:Phosphocholine Cytidylyltransferase (CCT), Choline Phosphotransferase (CPT), and Ethanolamine Phosphotransferase Activities— Livers were homogenized in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. CCT activity was measured in homogenates (50 μg of protein) by monitoring the conversion of [methyl-14C]phosphocholine into CDP-choline (32Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT and ethanolamine phosphotransferase activities were measured in isolated microsomes by monitoring incorporation of either CDP-[methyl-14C]choline into PC or CDP-[2-14C]ethanolamine into PE as described (21Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase (DGAT) Activity and Gene Expression—DGAT activity was determined as described (33Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA into triglyceride was measured by adding exogenous diacylglycerol substrate in acetone (4 mm solution). Partially purified membranes (100 μg of protein) were used as the enzyme source. Reactions were carried out for 5 min at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed as described (34Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from liver using TRIzol reagent. Dgat1 and Dgat2 gene expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. 20 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose-2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP by a random primer labeling kit (Promega, Madison, WI). After washing, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C, and signals were quantified by densitometry. The probes for Dgat1 and Dgat2 were obtained from Dr. Robert Farese, Jr. (University of California, San Francisco). pAL15 mRNA was used as an internal control (5Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Protein Content—The protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using the Student's t test. A difference of p <0.05 was considered significant. Values are presented as means ± S.D. (n = 6 mice/group). PC and PE Levels Are Increased in the Liver of Scd1-/- Mice—We have previously shown that SCD1 deficiency reduces liver TAG content in both lean (7Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1018-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and obese (10Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) mice. Consistently in the present study we found a 48% reduction in TAG content in the liver of Scd1-/- compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1A). The total content of liver free fatty acids was decreased by 34% in Scd1-/- mice, whereas DAG level was not significantly different between Scd1-/- and wild type mice (Fig. 1A). The contents of PC and PE were increased by 40 and 23%, respectively, whereas the contents of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were decreased by 16 (p = 0.071) and 27%, respectively, in the liver of Scd1-/- mice compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1B). Because the increases in PC and PE levels were greater than the decreases in PI and PS, the total content of PLs tends to be higher in the liver of Scd1-/- mice (p = 0.27) (Fig. 1A). SCD1 Deficiency Alters Phospholipid Fatty Acid Composition in the Liver—The FA composition of phospholipids is tightly regulated and believed to stabilize membrane fluidity and functions of intrinsic membrane proteins, including receptors and transporters (35Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). To determine changes in fatty acid composition of hepatic glycerophospholipids due to Scd1 deficiency, PC, PE, PS, and PI were separated and their fatty acid contents were determined. The relative amounts of palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acids were reduced by 67 and 85% in PC, by 50 and 68% in PE, by 27 and 57% in PS, and by 64 and 65% in PI in the liver of Scd1-/- compared with wild type mice. The relative amounts of their saturated precursors, palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids, were unchanged or slightly increased due to SCD1 deficiency in most of the PL fractions (Table I). Only in the PS fraction, the 18:0 was increased by 83% and 16:0 was reduced by 20% in liver of Scd1-/- as compared with wild type mice (Table I). SCD1 deficiency also affected the relative amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in hepatic PLs. Linoleic (18:2) and arachidonic (20:4) acids were increased by 24 and 32%, respectively, in PC and by 17 and 36%, respectively, in PE in the liver of Scd1-/- compared with wild type mice (Table I). In the PI fraction, SCD1 deficiency increased 20:4 by 31%, whereas the relative amounts of docosahexanoic acid (22:6) and 18:2 were reduced by 50 and 31%, respectively (Table I). In the PS fraction, 22:6 was increased by 20%, whereas 18:2 was reduced by 23% in liver of Scd1-/- mice compared with the controls (Table I). Differences in other major fatty acid species were not significant (data not shown).Table IRelative fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the liver of Scd1-/- and wild type mice The data are expressed as average (n = 6).

The incorporation of [3H]glycerol into TAG was decreased by 56%, whereas its incorporation into total PLs was increased by 78% in Scd1-/- compared with wild type hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). [3H]Glycerol incorporation into PC and PE was 2.5- and 1.4-fold higher, respectively, whereas incorporation into PI and PS was reduced by 21 and 38%, respectively, in Scd1-/- hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). [3H]Glycerol incorporation into hepatic DAG was not significantly different between wild type and Scd1-/- mice (Fig. 2A). Mitochondrial GPAT Activity Is Decreased in the Liver of Scd1-/- Mice—The initial and committed step in the de novo synthesis of all cellular glycerolipids is the acylation of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate to form 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate by GPAT. Mammalian tissues contain two GPAT isoforms, one in the outer mitochondrial membrane (mitochondrial GPAT) and the other in the endoplasmic reticulum (microsomal GPAT) (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 36Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that GPAT mRNA level is significantly reduced in the liver of Scd1-/- mice (4Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Stoehr J.P. Lan H. Kendziorski C.M. Yandell B.S. Song Y. Cohen P. Friedman J.M. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11482-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that mitochondrial Gpat activity is 42% lower in the liver of Scd1-/-, whereas the activity of microsomal GPAT does not differ between wild type and Scd1-/- mice (Fig. 3). CDP-Choline Pathway of PC Synthesis Is Up-regulated, whereas PEMT Pathway Is Down-regulated in the Liver of Scd1-/- Mice—We hypothesized that the increase in PC content and higher incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PC in Scd1-/- liver results from an increased rate of PC biosynthesis. There are two pathways of PC biosynthesis in liver, the CDP-choline pathway and PE methylation by PEMT (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). CCT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway, undergoes post-transcriptional regulation by its translocation from an inactive, soluble form to an active, membrane-bound form (20Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To determine whether disruption of the Scd1 gene resulted in increased CCT protein level and/or enhanced its membrane association, immunoblot analysis was performed on liver homogenates and isolated membranes. CCTα, the predominant isoform of CCT in liver (21Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was analyzed. The amount of membrane-associated CCTα was increased by 1.6-fold, whereas the total protein level of CCTα measured in homogenates was reduced by 20% in the liver of Scd1-/- compared with wild type mice (Fig. 4A). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase used as a control was not different in homogenates and membranes. The analysis of CCT subcellular distribution revealed that the liv"

https://openalex.org/W2016677649,"We report a new mechanism of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing resulting in constitutive activation of a mis-spliced oncoprotein (KIT) leading to malignancy (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) in contrast to loss of function of mis-spliced proteins resulting in diverse human diseases in the literature. The mechanisms of three consecutive molecular events, deletion of noncoding and coding regions encompassing the 3′ authentic splice site, creation of a novel intra-exonic pre-mRNA 3′ splice acceptor site leading to in-frame loss of 27 nucleotides (nine amino acids; Lys550–Lys558), and the mechanism of constitutive activation of the mis-spliced KIT are elucidated. Loss of a peptide in a critical location unleashed the protein from autoinhibition (as evidenced by three-dimensional structural analysis), causing KIT to become constitutively activated and resulting in the GIST phenotype. We also demonstrated that only one of the following two exonic splicing enhancers is sufficient for inclusion of the KIT exon 11 in vivo: AACCCATGT (nucleotides 2–10 from the 5′ end, which are recognized by SC35, SRp55, and SF2/ASF) or GGTTGTTGAGG (nucleotides 27–37 from the 5′ end, which are recognized by SC35 and SRp55), suggestive of exonic enhancer redundancy."
https://openalex.org/W2154857324,"Integrin β3 is polymorphic at residue 33 (Leu33 or Pro33), and the Pro33-positive platelets display enhanced aggregation, P-selectin secretion, and shorter bleeding times. Because outside-in signaling is critical for platelet function, we hypothesized that the Pro33 variant provides a more efficient signaling than the Leu33 isoform. When compared with Pro33-negative platelets, Pro33-positive platelets demonstrated significantly greater serine/threonine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) and myosin light chain (MLC) but not cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 upon thrombin-induced aggregation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β3 and the adaptor protein Shc was no different in the fibrinogen-engaged platelets from both genotypes. The addition of Integrilin (αIIbβ3-fibrinogen blocker) or okadaic acid (serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor) dramatically enhanced ERK2 and MLC phosphorylation in the Pro33-negative platelets when compared with Pro33-positive platelets, suggesting that integrin engagement during platelet aggregation activates serine/threonine phosphatases. The phosphatase activity of myosin phosphatase (MP) that dephosphorylates MLC is inactivated by phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of MP at Thr696, and aggregating Pro33-positive platelets exhibited an increased Thr696 phosphorylation of MP. These studies highlight a role for the dephosphorylation events via the serine/threonine phosphatases during the integrin outside-in signaling mechanism, and the Leu33 → Pro polymorphism regulates this process. Furthermore, these findings support a mechanism whereby the reported enhanced α granule secretion in the Pro33-positive platelets could be mediated by an increased phosphorylation of MLC, which in turn is caused by an increased phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of myosin phosphatase.

Integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at the site of vascular injury and plays a pivotal role in hemostasis and thrombosis. The binding of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 to ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor during aggregation/adhesion transmits information into the platelets called outside-in signaling. These signals are critical for platelet physiology and contribute to platelet thrombus formation by promoting the secretion of internal granules, the secondary wave of aggregation, and the formation of membrane vesicles with procoagulant activities (1Phillips D.R. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Prasad K.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Glanzmann thrombasthenic human platelets and mouse platelets expressing β3 integrin in which the cytoplasmic tyrosines have been replaced with phenylalanines have defective outside-in signaling (2Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wang R. Shattil S.J. Ambruso D.R. Newman P.J. J. Clin.

Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). All these lines of evidence indicate that hemostasis requires a coordinated interaction between integrin αIIbβ3 and the signaling machinery in platelets. αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling is initiated by integrin engagement via an organized interaction of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases such as Src, Csk, Syk, and protein kinase C-β with the integrin β3 subunit (5Obergfell A.

The net result is the phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine/threonine residues of several proteins including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 2 (ERK 2), 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; ppMLC, diphosphorylated MLC; cPLA2, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; MP, myosin phosphatase; MBS, myosin-binding subunit; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin. myosin light chain (MLC), and cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Phosphorylation of ERK, MLC, and cPLA2 modulates various biological functions. For example, tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 is involved in cell growth and proliferation (8Lewis T.S.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation of MLC is essential for migration, cytoskeletal clustering of integrins (12Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

Ji P. Ginalis E. Kramer R. Greco R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since the net phosphorylation on any protein is regulated by both kinases and phosphatases, it is likely that phosphatases also play a role in the process of outside-in signaling. Indeed, integrin αIIbβ3 engagement activates tyrosine phosphatases PTP1B by calpain cleavage (16Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11927-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that integrin αIIbβ3 engagement can regulate the activity of αIIb-associated protein phosphatase 1 PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase (17Vijayan K.V.

Signal. 1999; 11: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas phospho-MLC is dephosphorylated by a serine/threonine phosphatase from the PP1 family such as myosin phosphatase (MP) (20Hartshorne D.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Platelet MP is composed of three subunits, a 36-kDa catalytic subunit of the type 1 protein phosphatase δ, a 130-kDa regulatory subunit called myosin-binding subunit (MBS) or myosin-targeting subunit, and a small 20-kDa subunit (20Hartshorne D.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Integrin β3 is polymorphic at residue 33 (Leu33 or Pro33, also known as PlA1 or PlA2, respectively). This polymorphism is not rare, and 25% of individuals of northern European descent express Pro33 isoforms on their platelets (21Williams M.S. Bray P.F. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Platelets expressing the Pro33 isoform have shortened bleeding times and exhibit enhanced activation, α granule secretion, and aggregation (22Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Feng D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and are associated with acute coronary syndromes in some studies (21Williams M.S. Bray P.F. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHO and 293 cells expressing the Pro33 isoform demonstrate enhanced adhesion and migration (24Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Sajid M. Vijayan K.V. Souza S. Bray P.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, an underlying mechanism for the increased platelet reactivity observed in some but not all functional assays with the Pro33-positive platelets is still elusive. Although our previous study demonstrated an increased phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC in CHO and 293 cells expressing the Pro33 isoform, outside-in signaling in human platelets expressing the Pro33 isoform has not been investigated. Because outside-in signaling is critical for platelet function, we hypothesized that the Pro33 variant provides a more efficient signaling than the Leu33 isoform. We show here that when compared with the platelets lacking the Pro33 isoform, Pro33-positive platelets demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of the ERK2-MLC axis pathway. More importantly, this enhanced signaling in the Pro33-positive platelets is in part due to an inefficient activation of a serine/threonine phosphatases following integrin αIIbβ3 ligation and is independent of integrin β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Reagents—Human fibrinogen was from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc; (South Bend, IN). Okadaic acid, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture were from Sigma. Antibodies specific for the phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated cPLA2, and total cPLA2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), whereas anti-ERK1/2 antibody was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibody specific for the diphosphorylated myosin light chain (ppMLC) was a generous gift from Dr. James Staddon, (Eisai London Research, London, UK). Anti-MLC and -Shc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc; (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies that recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated integrin β3 were purchased from BIOSOURCE International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Thrombin and eptifibatide were generous gifts from Drs. John Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY) and D. Phillips (Portala pharmaceuticals Inc., San Francisco, CA), respectively. Platelet Aggregation and Adhesion—Blood was obtained in acidcitrate-dextrose anticoagulant from normal, healthy, and fasting donors of known PlA genotype. In this study, we used PlA1,A1 homozygous platelets (designated Pro33-negative platelets or Leu33/Leu33) and PlA1,A2 heterozygous or PlA2,A2 homozygous platelets (designated Pro33-positive platelets). Washed platelets from all three genotypes were prepared (26Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suspended in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and allowed to recover for ∼2 h at 37 °C. Aggregation was performed using varying concentrations of thrombin for 2 min using 2 × 108 platelets in 225 μl of Tyrode's in a BIO-DATA 4-channel platelet aggregometer. In some experiments, 25 μm Integrilin or 250 nm okadaic acid or control Me2SO (0.1%) were added 3 min prior to initiating aggregation. After 2 min, the reaction was stopped by solubilization with 25 μl of 10× SDS sample buffer. For adhesion studies, 12.5 μg/ml fibrinogen or heat-treated BSA was immobilized in a 100-mm tissue culture plate. 3 ml containing 3 × 108 platelets were added to each plate and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The fibrinogen bound platelets and the non-adherent platelets from the BSA-coated plate were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the protein content was determined. Immunoblotting—For these studies, 50 μg of protein obtained from the Triton X-100 lysates or 90 μl of SDS protein lysates described above were separated by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 22 °C. The blots were incubated overnight with the following antibodies: anti-phospho ERK1/2 (Thr183, Tyr185), anti-ppMLC (Thr18, Ser19), anti-phospho cPLA2 (Ser502), anti-phospho integrin β3 (Tyr747) and (Tyr759), anti-phospho Shc (Tyr 317), and anti-phospho MBS (Thr695) at 4°C. The blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibodies for 2 h, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL (Amersham Biosciences) system. To confirm equal loading of proteins, the membrane was stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50°C and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The blots were reprobed with antibodies to ERK1/2, MLC, cPLA2, integrin β3, Shc, and MBS as described above. The signals were scanned using PhotoShop 6 software, and the densitometric quantitation was performed using NIH Image software from beta 4.0.2 of Scion Image, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD. Enhanced Phosphorylation of ERK2 in Aggregating Pro33-positive platelets—To determine whether the PlA2 polymorphism of integrin β3 regulates outside-in signaling to ERK2 in human platelets, we studied thrombin-induced aggregation using the Pro33-positive and Pro33-negative platelets. Significantly (p = 0.02) greater levels of phosphorylated ERK2 were detected in the Pro33-positive platelets when compared with Pro33-negative platelets at varying concentrations of thrombin (Fig. 1A). By densitometry, and when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets, Pro33-positive platelets exhibited a maximum of ∼2.4-fold increase in ERK2 phosphorylation at 0.5 units/ml thrombin (Fig. 1B). The level of total ERK1/2 in each lane was equivalent and could not account for the signaling differences (Fig. 1A). Essentially similar results were obtained with the Pro33 homozygous platelets (Fig. 1C). To address whether the ERK2 phosphorylation was a result of direct thrombin signaling or αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation, we analyzed ERK2 phosphorylation in the absence of platelet aggregation. Inhibition of integrin-fibrinogen engagement with Integrilin blocked platelet aggregation and dramatically enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation in platelets lacking the Pro33 form. (Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with a previous study that showed increased phosphorylation of ERK2 upon blocking integrin-fibrinogen interaction using RGDS peptide or AP-2 antibody (27Nadal F. Levy-Toledano S. Grelac F. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that ERK2 phosphorylation was caused by thrombin signaling, possibly via activation of protease-activated receptors, whereas integrin engagement with fibrinogen during aggregation (αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling) results in a negative regulation (dephosphorylation) of ERK2. Under similar conditions, Integrilin blocked the aggregation of the Pro33-positive platelets and only modestly enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). At a concentration of 0.5 units/ml thrombin, the addition of Integrilin enhanced a maximum of ∼7-fold in ERK2 phosphorylation in the Pro33-negative platelets and only ∼2-fold ERK2 phosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets. These studies indicated that the engagement of integrin with fibrinogen during aggregation resulted in the dephosphorylation of ERK2 in a more efficient manner in the Pro33-negative platelets than in the Pro33-positive platelets. Thrombin signaling alone cannot account for the Leu33 → Pro differences in ERK2 signaling since ERK2 phosphorylation was not different in the Integrilin-treated Pro33-positive and Pro33-negative platelets. These studies suggest that a difference in the extent of an ERK2 dephosphorylation event upon integrin engagement in the Pro33-positive platelets, when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets, is likely responsible for the enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets. Enhanced Phosphorylation of MLC in Aggregating Pro33-positive Platelets—We have previously reported an ∼3-fold increase in α granule (P-selectin) secretion in response to thrombin in the Pro33-positive platelets when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets (26Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since Thr18/Ser19 phosphorylation of MLC is critical for platelet secretion (13Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation status of MLC in platelets based on the Leu33 → Pro genotype. Substantially greater levels of diphosphorylated MLC were detected in the Pro33-positive platelets when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets at varying concentrations of thrombin (Fig. 2A). When compared with the platelets lacking the Pro33 form, Pro33-positive platelets exhibited a maximum of ∼2.5-fold increase in phosphorylated MLC at 0.5 units/ml thrombin concentrations (Fig. 2B). This signaling difference was not due to the difference in total MLC loaded (Fig. 2A). In a manner similar to the ERK2 studies, inhibition of platelet aggregation enhanced MLC diphosphorylation by ∼5-fold in Pro33-negative platelets and only by ∼2.0-fold in Pro33-fold in Pro-positive platelets at 0.5 units/ml thrombin concentrations (Fig. 2C). These studies indicate that a difference in the extent of MLC dephosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets, when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets, is likely responsible for an enhanced Pro33-mediated MLC signaling. Under similar conditions, Ser505 phosphorylation of cPLA2, a substrate for ERK2 and P38 (29Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), was no different in thrombin-induced aggregating Pro33-positive and Pro33-negative platelets (Fig. 2D), indicating that the Pro33-mediated enhanced signaling is specific to ERK2-MLC pathway. Enhanced Signaling in the Pro33-positive Platelets Is Independent of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Integrin β3 and Adaptor Protein Shc—Previous studies have shown an essential role for tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in the αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling process (4Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To understand better whether the enhanced ERK2-MLC signaling observed in Pro33-positive platelets was initiated from the integrin β3 itself, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 from the Pro33-positive and Pro33-negative platelets either suspended over BSA substrate or adhered to fibrinogen. When compared with the platelets in suspension, platelets adhering to fibrinogen demonstrated an increased phosphorylation of Tyr747 and Tyr759 of integrin β3 (Fig. 3A, left panel). However, the level of Tyr747 and Tyr759 phosphorylation of integrin β3 as determined by densitometry was no different between the fibrinogen adhered Pro33-positive and the Pro33-negative platelets (Fig. 3A, right panel). The adaptor protein Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated during the process of αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling (30Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and since phosphorylation at Tyr317 is essential for ERK2 activation in other cell types, we examined the status of Tyr317 phosphorylation in platelets based on the Pro33 genotype. Shc Tyr317 phosphorylation increased during aggregation, reaching a maximum at 20 s after the addition of thrombin, and decreased with further continued stirring (Fig. 3B). Similar patterns of Shc phosphorylation in response to thrombin-induced aggregation were reported previously (30Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the extent of Tyr317 phosphorylation of Shc was no different between the aggregating Pro33-positive and Pro33-negative platelets (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, the same blot reprobed for ERK2 revealed enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets (not shown), suggesting that the ERK2 phosphorylation status in platelets was not dependent on Shc phosphorylation. Taken together, these results imply that the enhanced ERK2 and MLC signaling in the Pro33-positive platelets are independent of Shc and β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Differential Activation of Serine/Threonine Phosphatases in the Pro33-positive platelets—Since integrin engagement during platelet aggregation resulted in a dephosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC, we examined a possible role for serine/threonine phosphatases in this process. Because serine/threonine phosphatases PP2A and PP1 participate in dephosphorylating ERK2 and MLC, generic PP2A/PP1 inhibitor was employed. The addition of 250 nm okadaic acid, a concentration that inhibits PP2A and PP1 (31McCluskey A. Sim A.T. Sakoff J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1151-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), efficiently enhanced ERK2 and MLC phosphorylation in platelets lacking the Pro33 form (Fig. 4, A and C). In contrast, under similar conditions, okadaic acid only had a modest increase in ERK2 and MLC phosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets (Fig. 4, B and D). These results are consistent with the observations in Figs. 1D and Fig. 2C wherein Pro33-negative platelets but not Pro33-positive platelets exhibited an increased phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC upon treatment with Integrilin. Thus, the phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC in the Pro33-negative platelets can be increased by blocking integrin-fibrinogen engagement at the platelet surface or by inactivating serine/threonine phosphatases inside the platelet. These studies indicate that integrin-fibrinogen engagement during aggregation negatively regulates ERK2/MLC signaling, possibly through an efficient activation of serine/threonine phosphatases in platelets lacking the Pro33 form. In contrast, integrin engagement in the Pro33-positive platelets only modestly activated these phosphatases. Because okadaic acid failed to appreciably enhance MLC phosphorylation in the Pro33-positive platelets, we considered whether the PP1-myosin phosphatase is rendered inactive in these platelets following integrin engagement. The phosphatase activity of myosin phosphatase is regulated by phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit (MBS), such that phosphorylation at residue Thr696 inactivates the phosphatase (32Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the phosphorylation status of MBS at Thr696 in the aggregating platelets based on the Leu33 → Pro genotype. A greater phosphorylation of MBS was detected in the Pro33-positive platelets when compared with the Pro33-negative platelets at 0.5 units/ml thrombin (Fig. 5A). By densitometry and when compared with Pro33-negative platelets, Pro33-positive platelets exhibited an ∼2-fold increase in the level of phosphorylated MBS (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the enhanced MLC phosphorylation observed in the Pro33-positive platelets upon integrin engagement may in part be due to the increased phosphorylation and thus inactivation of myosin phosphatase. Platelet physiology is influenced by outside-in signals that are generated by the engagement of integrin αIIbβ3. In this study, we use platelet aggregation and adhesion studies to investigate the impact of the Leu33 → Pro polymorphism of integrin β3 on outside-in signaling. Several prior studies have considered a key role for phosphorylation events via kinases in the process of outside-in signaling, but the contribution of the dephosphorylation events via phosphatases during outside-in signaling is poorly understood. The results from our studies identify an enhanced outside-in signaling to ERK2-MLC axis in the Pro33 variant of integrin β3, which is caused in part by an inefficient activation of serine/threonine phosphatase(s) following integrin ligation. Furthermore, this study illustrates a novel role for the Pro33 polymorphism of integrin β3 in regulating the activation of myosin phosphatases by a mechanism involving a phosphorylation event of the myosin binding subunit. Using platelets of known Leu33 → Pro genotype, we examined the outside-in signaling to ERK2 and MLC during platelet aggregation. When compared with the platelets lacking the Pro33 form, the Pro33-positive platelets exhibited an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC (Figs. 1A and 2A). This observation is consistent with our previous study in which we identified a greater phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC in Pro33 CHO and 293 cells adhered to fibrinogen (26Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ERK2 signaling in platelets is required for the release of stored Ca2+, for GPIb-IX-dependent activation of integrin αIIbβ3 and platelet aggregation to low doses but not to high doses of thrombin, collagen, arachidonic acid, and U46619 (33Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34McNicol A. Philpott C.L. Shibou T.S. Israels S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ERK2 activation promotes cell adhesion and spreading (35Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and dominant negative ERK2 inhibits these processes (36Lai C.F. Chaudhary L. Fausto A. Halstead L.R. Ory D.S. Avioli L.V. Cheng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14443-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We observed the Pro33 isoform in CHO cells to enhance actin polymerization, spreading, adhesion, and migration to fibrinogen (24Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Sajid M. Vijayan K.V. Souza S. Bray P.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) kinase inhibition abolished the Pro33-mediated enhancement in cell adhesion (26Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and migration (25Sajid M. Vijayan K.V. Souza S. Bray P.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to fibrinogen. On the other hand, MLC phosphorylation promotes myosin ATPase activity and increases actinomyosin contractile responses that are involved in platelet shape change, secretion, and migration (37Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Pro33-positive platelets exhibit an ∼3-fold increase in α-granule secretion in response to thrombin (26Vijayan K.V. Liu Y. Dong J.F. Bray P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, MLC phosphorylation is required for aggregation and secretion in response to ADP (38Hashimoto Y. Sasaki H. Togo M. Tsukamoto K. Horie Y. Fukata H. Watanabe T. Kurokawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 39Wilde J.I. Retzer M. Siess W. Watson S.P. Platelets (Edinburgh). 2000; 11: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and increased aggregation and secretion were reported in Pro33-positive platelets in response to ADP (22Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Feng D. Lindpaintner K. Larson M.G. Rao V.S. O'Donnell C.J. Lipinska I. Schmitz C. Sutherland P.A. Silbershatz H. D'Agostino R.B. Muller J.E. Myers R.H. Levy D. Tofler G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings that the increased outside-in signaling to ERK2 and MLC in the Pro33-positive platelets correlate well with the enhanced functions of these signaling molecules in the physiology of Pro33-positive platelets. Despite the increased phosphorylation of ERK2 in the Pro33-positive platelets, tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β3 and adaptor protein Shc was not increased in the Pro33-positive platelets (Fig. 3). This observation is in contrast to the classical activation of ERK2 pathway in other cell types that primarily couple Shc to the Ras-Raf-MEK axis (8Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our observations, others have reported that activation of Ras (40Tulasne D. Bori T. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Raf (41Nadal-Wollbold F. Pawlowski M. Levy-Toledano S. Berrou E. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) is not sufficient to lead to ERK2 phosphorylation in platelets, although all of these signaling components are expressed in platelets. Outside-in signaling is initiated via several kinases that associate with the β3 tail (5Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Shc and β3 could favor signaling via kinases. An enhanced signaling in the Pro33-positive platelets without a corresponding increase in β3 and Shc phosphorylation could imply little role for kinases coupled to β3 and Shc in the enhanced ERK2 outside-in signaling. We pursued the possibility that a differential activation of phosphatases (or the extent of dephosphorylation events) could account for the Pro33-mediated increased phosphorylation events. Indeed, inhibition of Pro33-negative platelet aggregation resulted in a 7- and 5-fold enhanced phosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC, respectively, suggesting that αIIbβ3 engagement during aggregation activates serine/threonine phosphatases. A similar ∼10-fold increase in the ERK2 phosphorylation at residue Thr183 upon blocking platelet aggregation with RGDS peptide was reported previously (42Pawlowski M. Ragab A. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More importantly, the increase in ERK2/MLC phosphorylation upon blocking integrin-fibrinogen interaction appeared to be lost when we studied the Pro33-positive platelets (Figs. 1D and 2C). These studies suggested that serine/threonine phosphatases are activated by integrin ligation during platelet aggregation, and the Pro33 polymorphism regulated this activation process. This idea is supported by the observations that serine/threonine phosphatase PP1/PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid enhanced ERK2 and MLC phosphorylation more efficiently in the platelets lacking the Pro33 form when compared with the Pro33-positive platelets (Fig. 4). Thus, our studies using platelets from both genotypes suggest that dephosphorylation events are as important as phosphorylation events and that changes in the extent of dephosphorylation events could alter the process of outside-in signaling. How could the engagement of Pro33 isoform of integrin lead to inefficient activation of serine/threonine phosphatases such as MP? Dissociation of MP subunits by arachidonic acid (43Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of MBS at Thr696 by Rho kinases (32Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), or phosphorylation of CPI-17, an inhibitory phosphoprotein of MP through protein kinase C (44Watanabe Y. Ito M. Kataoka Y. Wada H. Koyama M. Feng J. Shiku H. Nishikawa M. Blood. 2001; 97: 3798-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), are different mechanisms that could contribute to the inactivation of MP. Indeed, we observed an ∼2-fold increased phosphorylation of MBS at Thr696 in the Pro33-positive platelets. Thus, increased phosphorylation of regulatory subunits of myosin phosphatase and its subsequent inactivation could account for the increased MLC signaling in the Pro33-positive platelets. Rho kinase is activated by integrin ligation, and its activity regulates the stability of αIIbβ3 adhesion contacts under shear to von Willebrand factor (45Schoenwaelder S.M. Hughan S.C. Boniface K. Fernando S. Holdsworth M. Thompson P.E. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14738-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed an enhanced adhesion of Pro33-CHO cells to von Willebrand factor (28Vijayan K.V. Huang T.C. Liu Y. Bernardo A. Dong J.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Alevriadou B.R. Bray P.F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the Pro33 isoform could induce a greater Rho activation upon integrin ligation, leading to a greater Thr696 phosphorylation of MBS. Our proposed model for an increased signaling in the Pro33-positive platelets is shown in Fig. 6. In conclusion, we have shown that integrin αIIbβ3 engagement during platelet aggregation leads to serine/threonine phosphatase activation (as revealed by the dephosphorylation of ERK2 and MLC) and that the Leu33 → Pro polymorphism regulates the level of the myosin phosphatase activation via Thr696 phosphorylation events. Thus, studies using platelets from both genotypes have 1) shed light on the critical role for the dephosphorylation process in the outside in signaling process and 2) revealed that the Leu33 → Pro polymorphism regulates this dephosphorylation process. These studies provide further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the increased function (secretion) and increased signaling (MLC phosphorylation) exhibited by a commonly inherited variation of integrin β3."
https://openalex.org/W2084675324,"Oxidative stress is the main cause of cardiac injury during ischemia/reperfusion but the molecular mechanism for this process is unclear. In this study, it was found that hypoxia induces apoptosis in rat embryonic heart-derived H9c2 cells leading to the induction of GADD153, which is an apoptosis-related gene. Therefore, this study addressed the molecular role of GADD153 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis. The stable or inducible overexpression of GADD153 sensitized the H9c2 cells to apoptotic cell death. The results suggest that the transactivation domain of the GADD153 might be responsible for this cell execution and play a role in the nucleoplasmic localization of GADD153. The cells transiently transfected with the antisense GADD153 were more resistant to hypoxia-induced apoptosis than the vector control cells. Furthermore, GADD153 transcriptionally down-regulated the expression of the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein gene (CARP), which is a nuclear transcriptional co-factor that negatively regulates the expression of the cardiac gene. The ectopic expression of CARP in H9c2 cells increased the resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that GADD153 overexpression and the concomitant down-regulation of CARP might have a causative role in the apoptotic cell injury of hypoxic H9c2 cells.

The apoptosis of cardiac myocytes is a cellular mechanism of a limited ischemic injury to the heart, whereas prolonged ischemia appears to cause necrosis of the cardiac myocytes (1Kajstura J.

Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which cardiomyocytes undergo apoptosis following oxidative stress would be helpful, and might provide additional targets for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. It has been reported that hypoxia-induced apoptosis of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is regulated by the expression of the Fas antigen and the intracellular signaling pathways activated by p53 (4Long X. Boluyt M.O. Hipolito M.L. Lundberg M.S. Zheng J.S. O'Neill L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Tanaka M. Ito H.

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway or cyclin A/cdk2 activation play an important roles in signaling oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cardiomycytes (9Turner N.A. Xia F. Azhar G. Zhang X.

Recently, the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene, BNIP3, was shown to contribute to apoptotic cell death in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (11Guo K. Searfoss G. Krolikowski D. Pagnoni M. Franks C. Clark K. Yu K.T. Jaye M. Ivashchenko Y. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how hypoxia actually triggers cell death in cardiomyocytes. The GADD153 protein (also known as CHOP-10) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcriptional factors (12Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. GADD153 is transcriptionally activated. In addition, is strongly expressed after treating the cells with a variety of growth arrest and/or DNA damaging factors (13Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Holbrook N.J. Shock. 1996; 6: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GADD153 has been implicated in growth arrest and cell death. A microinjection of GADD153 induces 3T3 cells to arrest at the G1/S boundary (21Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), whereas ectopic expression of GADD153 causes M1 myeloblast leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis (22Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). GADD153 was reported to sensitize cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress via mechanisms involving the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and enhanced oxidative injury (23McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). In particular, hypoxia/oxidative stress-induced GADD153 gene expression was observed in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or vascular smooth cells (24Chen R. Harrod K.S. Olson J.W. Gillespie M.N. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 2000; 108: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang J.R. Nakamura M. Okura T. Takata Y. Watanabe S. Yang Z.H. Liu J. Kitami Y. Hiwada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GADD153 was induced at both the mRNA and protein levels, which is in parallel with the induction of vascular smooth cell apoptosis, after treatment with the platelet-derived growth factor-BB. The overexpression of GADD153 in the vascular smooth muscle cells significantly reduced the level of cell viability and induced apoptosis. Moreover, in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model, the GADD153 protein was expressed in apoptotic vascular smooth muscle cells (25Tang J.R. Nakamura M. Okura T. Takata Y. Watanabe S. Yang Z.H. Liu J. Kitami Y. Hiwada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, recent reports do not explain whether or not GADD153 overexpression functions in hypoxic stress-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, this study showed that GADD153 is overexpressed in H9c2 cells as a result of hypoxia, which may be associated with apoptotic cell death, and proposes the molecular role of GADD153 in this type of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Cell Lines and Reagents—The rat embryonic heart-derived H9c2 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). CoCl2, 2,2′-dipyridyl (DP), 1The abbreviations used are: DP, 2,2′-dipyridyl; TA, transactivation domain; CARP, cardiac ankyrin repeat protein gene; DFO, desferrioxamine; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PI, propidium iodide; DAPI, diamidino-2-phenylindole; FCM, flow cytometry; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; GRPs, glucose-regulated proteins; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and the desferrioxamine (DFO), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), and propidium iodide (PI) were obtained from Sigma. The adriamycin (doxorubicin) was obtained from Sigma, and the N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide was a kind gift from the Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Spring House, PA). Cell Culture and Detection of Apoptotic Cells—The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in air containing 5% CO2. The cells (105) were plated on 6-cm dishes and transferred to a chamber. Hypoxic conditions were achieved using a BBL GasPac Plus (BD Biosciences, San Diego), which catalytically reduced the oxygen level to 0.5% within 150 min (time 0 of the hypoxic conditions) (26Imhof A. Heinzer I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1646-1648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of viable cells was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion. The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated using diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Briefly, H9c2 cells were either incubated under hypoxic conditions for 16 h, or treated with the indicated concentrations of CoCl2, DFO, or DP for a 48-h period. The cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min and stained with the DAPI reagent (1 μg/ml). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon diaphot microscope. Apoptotic cells were recognized by the condensed, fragmented, and degraded nuclei, or ghosts that stained only faintly. At least 200 cells were counted at each time point and all the counting was carried out in a blinded fashion. DNA Fragmentation or Flow Cytometric Analysis for Apoptotic Quantitation—Genomic DNA was analyzed by harvesting the cells and combining them with the nonattached cells in the supernatant. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the extracts were treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, then with chloroform, and finally precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate. Twenty μl of each extract (dissolved in 50 μl of H2O) was then loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel and separated in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Flow cytometry (FCM) with FACScan (BD Bioscience) was used to count the number of cells, as described previously (27Kim D.G. Jo B.H. You K.R. Ahn D.S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 630-nm long band pass filter was used to measure the red fluorescence because of the PI-bound DNA. The data were analyzed as a single parameter frequency histogram in an SFIT model. Northern Blot Analysis—The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until they reached 70% confluence. They were then incubated under hypoxic conditions or treated with the indicated agents. Total RNA was extracted from the treated or untreated cells using a phenol and guanidine thiocyanate solution (TriReagent; Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNA was then fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, and transferred to membranes. The blots were hybridized overnight with a 2 × 106 cpm/ml cDNA probe, labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) by random priming, washed, and exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C, as described previously (28Wen J.

As a loading control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was detected using a GAPDH cDNA probe. Western Immunoblotting—The cells were washed twice with cold PBS on ice and harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended directly into a Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (w/v) and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v). The extracted proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nylon membranes, as described previously (29Kim D.G. You K.R. Liu M.J. Choi Y.K. Won Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38930-38938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The GADD153 polyclonal antibody (R-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Stable or Inducible Overexpression of GADD153—Transfection of the GADD153 gene into H9c2 cells was carried out using an expression plasmid vector encoding human GADD153 cDNA or the control pcDNA3. Construction of the GADD153 expression vector was achieved by ligating the human GADD153 (a gift from Dr. Nikki J. Holbrook) with pcDNA3 in the BamHI and XhoI sites in either sense or antisense orientations, as described elsewhere (29Kim D.G. You K.R. Liu M.J. Choi Y.K. Won Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38930-38938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The transfections were carried out by Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GADD153-transfected or neo-transfected cells were selected in the presence of 600 mg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. Finally, individual colonies were isolated using cloning rings, expanded, and assayed for the expression of the transfected gene using Northern and Western blotting analysis. For the pTRE2-GADD153 construct, a fragment of GADD153 DNA from pcDNA3-GADD153 was ligated to the BamHI and SalI sites of pTRE2hyg (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The H9c2 cells were transfected with the pTet-Off vector (Clontech) and selected with 600 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. The surviving cells (Tet-Off cell lines) were expanded and screened for tTA regulatory protein expression by transient transfection with TRE2hyg-Luc (Clontech) for the clones with a low background and a high level of luciferase induction in response to tetracycline. An H9c2 Tet-Off clone was transfected with the pTRE2hyg-GADD153 expression construct. After selection with 50 μg/ml hygromycin for 2–3 weeks, the surviving cells were expanded and Northern blotting was used to determine the presence of GADD153 gene expression. The effect of CARP regulation on cell survival was determined by generating an antisense CARP expression plasmid by ligating an open reading frame PCR amplified to pcDNA in the XbaI and KpnI sites in an antisense orientation using a set of primers containing either XbaI (sense primer, 5′-GCTCTAGACCTTCAGCCAACATGATGG) or KpnI (antisense, 5′-GGGGTACCCCTCAGAATGTAGCTATGC). The sense CARP expression plasmid was generated by ligating an open reading frame PCR amplified to pcDNA3.1/HisA in the KpnI and XhoI sites in a sense orientation using a set of primers containing KpnI (sense primer, 5′-GGGGTACCAGCCAACATGATG) or XhoI (antisense, 5′-CCCTCGAGGCCTCAGAATGTAGC). Cellular Localization of the Functional GADD153 Protein and Immunofluorescense—The H9c2 cells were transfected with the expression vector, pEGFP-GADD153 deletion mutants, which were kindly provided by Dr. Joel F. Habener (30Maytin E.V. Ubeda M. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were stained with DAPI and the transfected cells were examined using laser-scanning microscopy (LCM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For immunofluorescence, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS on ice and fixed in 4% PBS-paraformaldehyde for 30 min, which was followed by membrane permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS buffer for 1 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using PBS/bovine serum albumin 1% (w/v) for 1 h followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibody against 5 mg/ml CARP at 4 °C. Primary antibody binding was detected with the tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate isomer R (TRITC)-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:100, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The polyclonal antibody to CARP was affinity purified from the sera of the immunized rabbits with the recombinant GST-CARP protein produced in Escherichia coli. Luciferase Assay—PCR amplification was performed from the human liver genomic DNA to generate the luciferase reporter gene CARP-206Lucas described elsewhere (31Kanai H. Tanaka T. Aihara Y. Takeda S. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PCR product was subcloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates, and 18 h later the cells were then cotransfected at 37 °C for 16 h with 500 ng of CARP-206Luc plasmid along with various concentrations of the GADD153 expression plasmid and Lipofectin (Invitrogen). The cells were lysed in 120 μl of a lysis buffer at the indicated time intervals and stored at –20 °C until assayed. The luciferase activity was measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was normalized using a Renilla luciferase activity. Statistical Analysis—All data were entered into the Microsoft Excel 5.0 package and GraphPad Software was used to perform the two-tailed t tests. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Induction of GADD153 during Hypoxia-induced Apoptosis— Hypoxia effectively induced apoptotic cell death in cultured cells stained with the DNA-binding dye DAPI in a time-dependent manner. This revealed the condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclear morphologies that are characteristic of apoptosis in H9c2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). An overnight culture under hypoxic conditions caused apoptosis in ∼35% of the H9c2 cells. The level of DNA fragmentation was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The H9c2 cells cultured under hypoxia showed increased fragmentation of the lower molecular weight DNAs in a time-dependent manner, which supported the above findings (Fig. 1C). The percentage of apoptotic cells measured using DAPI was similar to the apoptotic population measured by FCM, i.e. the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 fraction stained with PI showed similar results (data not shown). During apoptotic cell death, it was found that the GADD153 gene is expressed in proportion to the level of hypoxia induced-apoptotic cell death in H9c2 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Therefore, this study examined whether or not hypoxic induction by chemicals including divalent cations (CoCl2) and iron chelators (DFO and DP) cause apoptotic cell death and GADD153 mRNA overexpression. As expected, these “hypoxia imitators” effectively induced GADD153 expression (Fig. 1E), which was in proportion to the level of apoptotic cell death observed in H9c2 cells (Fig. 1F). The iron chelators induced higher GADD153 mRNA overexpression and apoptotic cell death than the divalent cations. Effect of Ectopic GADD153 Overexpression on Apoptosis—To determine the role of GADD153 mRNA overexpression, the GADD153 expression system was introduced to the H9c2 cells because these cells expressed a low level of constitutive GADD153. Two types of H9c2 cells (HG-10 and HG-19) that stably express different levels of human GADD153 mRNA were isolated (Fig. 2A). The cells were then maintained under hypoxic conditions at 37 °C. Compared with the control cells transfected with the empty vector alone (VC-4 and VC-5), the HG-10 and HG-19 cells became apoptotic within 12 h of being exposed to hypoxic conditions (p < 0.01), i.e. up to 80% of the HG-10 and HG-19 cells were apoptotic, whereas only 18% of the VC-4 and VC-5 cells were apoptotic. The proportion of apoptotic cells appears to be related to the GADD153 protein expression level. FCM analysis found that the apoptotic sub-G1 fraction of the cells also increased in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2B). A GADD153 expression construct was produced by placing GADD153 cDNA under control of a tetracycline (tet)-repressible promoter (32Bernhard D. Ausserlechner M.J. Tonko M. Loffler M. Hartmann B.L. Csordas A. Kofler R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1991-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The H9c2 Tet-Off clone was then transfected with the pTRE2hyg-GADD153 expression construct described under “Experimental Procedures.” After selection with hygromycin for a 2–3-week period, the surviving cells were expanded and screened for GADD153 gene expression using Northern blotting. Two clones, TREG8 and TREG20, which showed efficient tet-repressible expression of the GADD153 transgene, were selected for cell growth experiments. In both clones, GADD153 overexpression was induced by the depletion of tetracycline in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The level of apoptotic cell death was increased as a result of tetracycline depletion in TREG8 and TREG20 cells in response to hypoxia for 16 h (85.6 and 87.5% versus 37.4 and 36.6%, respectively) (Fig. 2D), which correlates with the observed GADD153 mRNA overexpression. The transient co-transfection of an antisense expression plasmid of GADD153 (3 μg) with pEGFP (1 μg) was performed to determine whether the prevention of GADD153 overexpression might lead to the inhibition of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. The level of apoptotic cell death was determined by gating the GFP-positive cells and calculating the sub-G1 fraction of cells transfected with the antisense GADD153 cDNA. The antisense transfectants were significantly resistant to hypoxia, e.g. ∼15.8% of the transfectants were apoptotic (p < 0.01), compared with 35.7% of the empty vector control cells (Fig. 2E). The accumulation of GADD153 mRNA in H9c2 cells transfected with antisense GADD153 cDNA was effectively decreased to less than 50% of the controls (right panel). This suggests that the inhibition of GADD153 expression correlates positively with cell survival in H9c2 cells. Proapoptotic Ability and Cellular Localization of Deletion GADD153 Mutants—To determine what regions of the GADD153 molecule play a role in hypoxia-induced apoptosis, various GADD153 deletion mutants (30Maytin E.V. Ubeda M. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) were examined for their ability to stimulate apoptosis upon transfection (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence-activated cells were gated and analyzed for a hypodipolid fraction in cells transfected with the GFP fusion deletion mutants of GADD153. The level of apoptosis (sub-G1 fraction) increased 4-fold in the wild-type GFP-GADD153 (Fig. 3B). The mutant where the entire transactivation (TA) region was missing (pEGFP-bZIP) did not enhance the level of apoptotic cell death to almost the same degrees as the GFP vector control. In contrast, the other deletion mutants containing the TA region elicited apoptotic cell death in response to hypoxia, irrespective of the partial deletion of the first third of the TA region (36 amino acids) or point mutations at Ser78 and Ser81 of the TA region (Fig. 3C). This suggests that the proapoptotic ability of GADD153 resides in the TA region of the protein and is independent of a partial deletion or point mutation in the TA region. The proapoptotic ability of these deletion mutants was then examined to determine whether they were relevant to their cellular localization. Interestingly, wild-type GFP-GADD153 was located in the nucleoplasm, which is devoid of nucleoli. pEGFP-bZIP is mainly located in the nucleoli. The deletion mutant, GFP-LZ(–) (missing ZIP), is located in both the nucleoplasm and the nucleoli. The GFP-GADD153Ala78,Ala81 mutant is located at the nucleoplasm, whereas the GFP-TA(–) (missing partial deletion of TA) is initially located at the nucleoplasm but migrates to the nucleoli (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the nucleoplasmic localization resulting from the TA region appears to be related to apoptotic cell death. In the process of apoptotic cell death, nuclear translocation of the GADD153 protein was partially impaired and was retained in the cell cytoplasm until the late stage. This was also observed with the nuclear localization results (Fig. 3E). The stress-activated phosphorylation of GADD153 by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) at serines 78 and 81, is responsible for cell apoptosis, and pretreatment with a p38-kinase inhibitor, SB203580, blocks both the phosphorylation of GADD153 and stress-mediated apoptosis (33Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). However, the data shows that an Ala78,Ala81 mutation of GADD153 has no impact on hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, this study next examined whether or not p38 MAPK activation still functions during apoptosis. SB203580 (20 or 40 μm) effectively enhanced cell survival (3.1- or 4.0-fold) (Fig. 4A) and did not alter GADD153 protein levels (Fig. 4B), which suggests that the alternative pathway to p38 MAPK activation or a p38 MAPK-independent pathway is involved. Furthermore, NAC (2 or 4 mm) effectively inhibited hypoxia-induced apoptosis and enhanced the level of cell survival by ∼3.1 or 3.8 times compared with the vehicle controls (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, NAC did not inhibit overexpression of the GADD153 protein, rather the higher concentration (4 mm) of NAC significantly stimulated GADD153 protein expression (Fig. 4B), which indicates that NAC functions downstream of GADD153 expression. GADD153 Down-regulate the Expression of CARP—It was observed that treatment with adriamycin induces apoptotic cell death and the concomitant overexpression of GADD153 mRNA in H9c2 cells. It should be noted that adriamycin (2 μg/ml) effectively induced apoptotic cell death (66%) and concomitant GADD153 overexpression in a time-dependent manner over a 48-h period (Fig. 5A). In addition, expression of the CARP gene during adriamycin-induced apoptosis was examined because adriamycin-mediated cardiac toxicity is related to down-regulation of CARP gene expression via oxidative stress (34Aihara Y. Kurabayashi M. Tanaka T. Takeda S.I. Tomaru K. Sekiguchi K.I. Ohyama Y. Nagai R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results showed that adriamycin consistently down-regulated CARP mRNA expression. However, CARP down-regulation fluctuated with GADD153 mRNA expression during the 36-h adriamycin treatment (Fig. 5B). The relationship between GADD153 and CARP mRNA expression in response to hypoxia was examined. Both genes were inversely expressed in a time-dependant manner during hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Therefore, oxidative stress might result in GADD153 overexpression, which subsequently down-regulates the CARP expression level. To examine this hypothesis, the expression of CARP mRNA was tested in cells stably expressing GADD153. As expected, the CARP mRNA expression level was reduced in the stable transfectants. The CARP mRNA expression level was inversely proportional to the GADD153 mRNA expression level (Fig. 5D). Another approach to support this hypothesis was to demonstrate the promoter activation by GADD153. The reporter plasmid, pGL3B-CARP(–206), which consists of a 206-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence and a 170-bp fragment of the 5′-untranslated region of the human CARP gene, was transiently cotransfected into H9c2 cells using either the empty vector or the pcDNA3-GADD153 expression vector. Cotransfection with the pcDNA3-GADD153 expression plasmid decreased the luciferase activity driven by the CARP promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Four μg of GADD153 reduced the promoter activity to 25% of the control. In addition, the immunofluorescence assay revealed that the expression of the CARP protein was"

The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in the determination of cell fate/differentiation in a number of organs. Notch signaling is a complex process, and the mechanism by which Notch regulates multiple cellular processes is intriguing. The expression of both Notch and Pak1 has been shown to be deregulated in several human cancers. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified SHARP, one of the Notch signaling components, as a Pak1-interacting protein. We found that SHARP is a physiologic interacting substrate of Pak1, and that this interaction enhances SHARP-mediated repression of Notch target genes. Pak1 phosphorylation sites in SHARP were mapped to Ser3486 and Thr3568 within the SHARP repression domain. Mutation of Pak1 phosphorylation sites in SHARP, inhibition of Pak1 functions by a Pak1-autoinhibitory fragment (amino acids 83–149), or expression of Pak1-specific siRNA interfered with SHARP-mediated repression of Notch target reporter gene activation. These results demonstrate that Pak1–SHARP interaction plays an essential role in enhancing the corepressor functions of SHARP, thereby modulating Notch signaling in human cancer cells."

The crystal structure of HLA-DQ2 complexed with the αI-gliadin epitope (LQPFPQPELPY) revealed four hydrogen bonds between DQ2 and peptide main chain amides. This is remarkable, given that four of the nine core residues in this peptide are proline residues that cannot engage in amide hydrogen bonding. Preserving main chain hydrogen bond interactions despite the presence of multiple proline residues in gluten peptides is a key element for the HLA-DQ2 association of celiac disease. We have investigated the relative contribution of each main chain hydrogen bond interaction by preparing a series of N-methylated αI epitope analogues and measuring their binding affinity and off-rate constants to DQ2. Additionally, we measured the binding of αI-gliadin peptide analogues in which norvaline, which contains a backbone amide hydrogen bond donor, was substituted for each proline. Our results demonstrate that hydrogen bonds at P4 and P2 positions are most important for binding, whereas the hydrogen bonds at P9 and P6 make smaller contributions to the overall binding affinity. There is no evidence for a hydrogen bond between DQ2 and the P1 amide nitrogen in peptides without proline at this position.

Celiac disease is a complex genetic disorder of the small intestine caused by an inflammatory response to dietary wheat gluten (gliadins and glutenins) and related proteins from rye and barley (1Sollid L.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). It is a prevalent disease affecting about 1 in 100 Caucasians (2Maki M. Mustalahti K. Kokkonen J. Kulmala P. Haapalahti M. Karttunen T. Ilonen J. Laurila K. Dahlbom I. Hansson T. Hopfl P. Knip M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The lesion is characterized by villous atrophy, crypt cell hyperplasia, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The villous atrophy may lead to malabsorption, but various extraintestinal symptoms often dominate the clinical picture (3Green P.H.R. Jabri B.

There is a strong HLA association in this disorder, and the primary susceptibility is mediated by HLA-DQ2 in the great majority of patients (4Sollid L.M. Thorsby E.

Binding of peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HATU, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl. class II molecules involves interaction of peptide side chains at the P1, P4, P6, P7, and P9 positions to pockets of the HLA binding site as well as hydrogen bonding between conserved residues of the HLA molecule and main chain carbonyl oxygen (C=O) and amide nitrogen (N-H) groups of the peptide (16Nelson C.A. Fremont D.H. Rev. Immunogenet. 1999; 1: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies demonstrate that the pattern of hydrogen bonding to main chain atoms is similar between MHC alleles, and the involved MHC residues are often conserved across MHC alleles. The hydrogen bonding to the structurally conserved backbone explains why a single MHC class II molecule can accommodate a large number of disparate peptide sequences. The x-ray crystal structure of DQ2 complexed with the deamidated T-cell epitope αI-gliadin QLQPFPQPELPY provided the molecular basis for the superior ability of DQ2 to bind the biased repertoire of proline-rich gluten peptides that have survived gastrointestinal digestion and been deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (17Kim C.Y. Quarsten H. Bergseng E. Khosla C. Sollid L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4175-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Despite the inability of proline to act as a hydrogen bond donor, the αI-gliadin peptide binds to DQ2 with an extensive hydrogen bonding network. The multiple proline residues in gluten-derived epitopes impose a selectivity filter for MHC binding that is unrelated to side chain interactions because only a limited number of registers will maintain the essential main chain interactions. In the few permissible registers, DQ2 can effectively bind deamidated gluten peptides via its interaction with negatively charged anchor residues at P4, P6, or P7. Notwithstanding a common backbone hydrogen bonding pattern, there is some variation among different MHC alleles (16Nelson C.A. Fremont D.H. Rev. Immunogenet. 1999; 1: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the hydrogen bonds are mediated via polymorphic MHC residues (such as tyrosine β30 and the P7 amide in DR3/CLIP (18Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), I-Ad/Ova (19Scott C.A. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A.

Sollid L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4175-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar)), whereas some peptide-MHC complexes appear not to utilize hydrogen bonds to conserved MHC residues (such as tryptophan β61 and the P8 carbonyl in I-Ak/Hel (20Fremont D.H. Monnaie D. Nelson C.A. Hendrickson W.A. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1998; 8: 305-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)). Given this variation, MHC class II molecules may differ in their ability to bind proline-containing peptides with their atypical backbone. DQ2 may have unique characteristics in this regard. The significance of main chain hydrogen bond interactions in the presentation of proline-rich gluten epitopes by MHC is poorly understood. Detailed knowledge about these interactions is needed to better understand the HLA association in celiac disease. To establish the relative importance of hydrogen bonding between DQ2 and the amide nitrogen atoms of the αI-gliadin epitope (Fig. 1), we prepared and analyzed a series of N-methylated peptides. Together with depsipeptides, N-methylated peptides are invaluable reagents for evaluating the role of backbone hydrogen bonds in protein-ligand interactions (21Bramson H.N. Thomas N.E. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5452-5457Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and they have therefore also been exploited in MHC structure-function studies (22Cotton J. Herve M. Pouvelle S. Maillere B.

In addition, we prepared and analyzed several norvaline-containing analogues to assess the potential for amide nitrogen-mediated hydrogen bonding in positions occupied by proline residues in the DQ2-αI-gliadin complex. Our results highlight a critical role for hydrogen bonding at P2 and P4 positions in a proline-rich DQ2 epitope. Peptide Synthesis—N-Methylated peptides used in this study were synthesized using Boc/HBTU chemistry starting from N-α-t-Boc-l-aminoacyl-phenylacetamidomethyl resin. For N-methylated positions, Boc-protected N-methylated amino acids were used, with HATU as the activation reagent. Triple coupling with prolonged coupling time (>1h) pushed the reactions closer to completion. Following cleavage of the peptidyl resin in trifluoroacetic acid/trifluoromethanesulfonic acid/thioanisole (10:1:1, v/v/v) for 4 h, the crude peptides were precipitated in cold ether and dissolved in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/water. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a semi-preparative C18 column using a water-acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular masses of the peptides were confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. The exact sequences of all the N-methylated peptides were confirmed by the fragmentation pattern using tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The peptides were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C before use. Competitive HLA-DQ2-Peptide Binding Assay—Detergent-solubilized HLA-DQ2 (A1*0501, B*0201) molecules were purified from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines as previously described (25Johansen B.H. Buus S. Vartdal F. Viken H. Eriksen J.A. Thorsby E. Sollid L.M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The indicator peptide (KPLLIIAEDVEGEY; Mycobacterium bovis 65-kDa Hsp 243–255Y) was 125I-labeled by the chloramine-T method (26Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). The labeled indicator peptide (30,000 cpm; 1–5 nm) and various concentrations of unlabeled peptides were incubated with 100–300 nm DQ2 overnight at 37 °C in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (25Johansen B.H. Buus S. Vartdal F. Viken H. Eriksen J.A. Thorsby E. Sollid L.M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Complexes of peptide and DQ2 were separated from unbound peptides by spin column chromatography technique as described previously (27Buus S. Stryhn A. Winther K. Kirkby N. Pedersen L.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was counted, and the concentrations of the competing peptides required to give 50% inhibition of the binding of the indicator peptide (IC50) were calculated. The IC50 values were determined by four consecutive titration experiments; first we did a 10-fold titration, then a 4-fold titration, and finally, two 3-fold titration experiments around the estimated IC50 values. The consistency of the results was excellent, and the results from one of the 3-fold titration experiments are presented. Dissociation Experiments—Preformed complexes were prepared by incubating radiolabeled peptide with purified HLA-DQ2 overnight at 37 °C. Conditions were identical to those employed in the binding assay, except that the concentration of radiolabeled peptide was 10-fold higher. The complexes were isolated by spin columns and then incubated at pH 5.2 in the presence of protease inhibitors (as described in the peptide binding assay) at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various time points and separated on spin columns. The dissociation kinetics were fit into the one-phase exponential decay function (Y = As × exp(–ksx)) or the two-phase exponential decay function (Y = Af × exp(–kfx) + As × exp(–ksx)) using GraphPad Prism (Version 3.02). Binding of N-Methylated Peptides—The importance of hydrogen bonds mediated by the peptide main chain amide groups was investigated by testing the binding of a series of N-methylated variants of the peptides LQPFPEPELPY and AAIAAVKEEAF. By N-methylation, the N-H groups of the peptide backbone were converted to N-CH3 groups that are unable to engage in hydrogen bonding. The LQPFPEPELPY peptide was used instead of the LQPFPQPELPY peptide because it has a 4-fold higher affinity to DQ2. IC50 values of the two peptide series were measured using a competitive binding assay with a radiolabeled indicator peptide. The experimentally determined IC50 values of these peptides are given in Figs. 2 and 3. N-Methylation at position P2 and P4 in the αI-gliadin peptide resulted in substantially reduced binding affinity (35.6- and 23.3-fold, respectively), indicating that hydrogen bond interactions at these positions contribute significantly to peptide binding. N-Methylation at the P9 position also resulted in an 8.0-fold reduction in binding affinity. In contrast, the high affinity, proline-free AAIAAVKEEAF peptide showed decreased affinity when N-methylated at positions P4 and P9 (10.5- and 5.1-fold, respectively), but not at P2. Of note, the discriminatory effect of N-methylation was more pronounced for the LQPFPEPELPY peptide than the AAIAAVKEEAF peptide.Fig. 3IC50 values for the N-methylated high affinity binder peptide AAIAAVKEEAF. The O in the amino acid sequence denotes N-methylated amino acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dissociation of N-Methylated Peptides—The importance of hydrogen bonding was further addressed by dissociation experiments. For the LQPFPEPELPY analogue series, we were unable to form significant amounts of complexes with peptides N-methylated at the P2 and P4 positions, presumably due to their low affinity for DQ2. The dissociation experiment results are given in Fig. 4 and Table I. Peptides that were N-methylated at either position P6 or P9 showed faster dissociation compared with the unmethylated peptide, whereas the peptide N-methylated at position P7 had a dissociation rate similar to that of the unmethylated peptide. Consistent with this result, the DQ2-αI-gliadin crystal structure revealed no hydrogen bonding at the P7 position. The YAAIAAVKEEAF peptide, containing a tyrosine at the N terminus for labeling purposes, was synthesized for additional dissociation experiments. More than 60% of the peptide-DQ2 complexes remained intact after 30 days (data not shown). The slow dissociation of this peptide from DQ2 prevented us from proceeding with the testing of N-methylated variants.Table IDissociation kinetic parameters of N-methylated αI-gliadin peptidePeptidePosition testedT50%aT50% is defined as the half-life when 50% of the peptide remains bound to DQ2, i.e. x = T50%|Y = 0.5 × (Af + As).AfbAf (%) is defined as the proportion of the fast phase in the total population of peptide-DQ2 complexes.

Open table in a new tab Binding of Norvaline-substituted Peptides—To probe for the potential for hydrogen bonding at positions occupied by proline residues in the αI-gliadin epitope, a series of peptides containing norvaline in place of proline was tested for binding to DQ2 in a competitive binding assay. Norvaline is an acyclic amino acid that is isosteric to proline and can therefore participate in backbone hydrogen bonding. The IC50 values for these peptides are shown in Fig. 5. In contrast to the experiments summarized in Fig. 2, the native (weaker-binding) αI-gliadin epitope was used here to maximize the chances of detecting energetically favorable hydrogen bonds that are masked by proline residues. The analogue with a norvaline substitution at position P1 bound to DQ2 with a higher IC50 value, contrary to what is expected when an additional hydrogen bond is present in the binding of the peptide. All other norvaline-substituted peptides (at positions P3, P5, and P8) had moderately (1.5–5.4-fold) lower IC50 values than the unsubstituted peptide. Dissociation of Norvaline-substituted Peptides—Peptide dissociation experiments were performed to further characterize the hydrogen bonds in the norvaline-substituted peptides. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and Table II. DQ2 complexes with peptides containing a norvaline substitution at P1 or P3 had a half-life comparable to that of the unsubstituted peptide, whereas the P5 substitution resulted in a considerably increased half-life, primarily due to virtual abolition of the fast phase of the dissociation curve.Table IIDissociation kinetic parameters of norvaline-substituted αI-gliadin peptidePeptidePosition testedT50%aT50% is defined as the half-life when 50% of the peptide remains bound to DQ2, i.e. x = T50%|Y = 0.5 × (Af + As).AfbAf (%) is defined as the proportion of the fast phase in the total population of peptide-DQ2 complexes.

Open table in a new tab The abundance of proline residues in gluten epitopes is a hallmark of celiac disease. This, in turn, has led to an increased appreciation for the possibility that the mechanistic consequences of certain proline-rich motifs may be a key to understanding celiac disease pathogenesis. This enigmatic relationship between proline and celiac disease is perhaps most vividly illustrated by the affinity of gluten epitopes for HLA-DQ2. Although the importance of backbone hydrogen bonding in MHC-ligand interactions is widely appreciated, T-cell epitopes from gluten can have as many as four proline residues, none of which are able to act as backbone hydrogen bond donors. To understand the molecular logic for high affinity binding of such epitopes, we have systematically investigated the effect of disrupting hydrogen bond interactions by N-methylation of nonproline residues and proline-to-norvaline substitutions in the celiac disease-relevant gluten T-cell epitope, αI-gliadin. Our results indicate that backbone hydrogen bonds at P2 and P4 contribute significantly to the overall binding energy, whereas those at P6 and P9 are less important. Moreover, we found no evidence for a hydrogen bond between DQ2 and the P1 amide nitrogen in a peptide analogue that should be capable of establishing this bond. This property differentiates DQ2 from other human MHC class II molecules and is therefore likely a key parameter for explaining the preferential binding of prolinerich gluten peptides to DQ2. Several previous studies have addressed the importance of hydrogen bonding to the peptide main chain for binding to MHC class II molecules. These include mutational study of the MHC class II molecules (28McFarland B.J. Beeson C. Sant A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3567-3571PubMed Google Scholar, 29Arneson L.S. Katz J.F. Liu M. Sant A.J. J.

Gliadin T-cell epitopes presented by DQ2 molecules are particularly rich in proline residues. In this study, we examined the relative contribution of individual backbone hydrogen bond interactions by comparing the binding and dissociation of backbone N-methylated analogues in the context of HLA-DQ2. N-Methylation could affect peptide binding by interfering with the amide group hydrogen bond formation. It could also affect the free energy of binding as the result of introducing a hydrophobic methyl group or impose steric effects. The results must be interpreted with this in mind. The most prominent effect for peptide binding was observed for analogues N-methylated at the P2 and P4 positions. This is consistent with the crystal structure of the DQ2-αI-gliadin complex, which shows hydrogen bonds at these positions. The crystal structure also indicated hydrogen bonds mediated by the amide nitrogen at the P6 and P9 positions. The analogues with N-methylation at positions P6 and P9 displayed some reduced binding, and the off-rates of these analogues were clearly increased. Taken together, these results are compatible with the notion that the hydrogen bonds at the P6 and P9 positions are energetically less important than those at the P2 and P4 positions. The DQ2-αI-gliadin structure gave no indication of a hydrogen bond to the P7 amide. The analogue with N-methylation at position P7 had a slightly higher IC50 compared with the unmodified peptide, whereas the off-rate was unaltered. In the crystal structure, the amide of P7 residue points directly toward DQ2. Therefore, methylation at the P7 position may cause a steric clash, thereby impairing ligand binding. Whereas results from the N-methylated analogues of the αI-gliadin peptide showed clear discrimination, there was little difference in IC50 values for N-methylated analogues of the AAIAAVKEEAF peptide, a peptide designed to bind well to DQ2 that lacks any proline residues. A reason for this could be the high binding affinity and strong interaction of this peptide at several positions in the DQ2 binding site. Strategic positioning of proline residues that maintains the backbone hydrogen bond network provides an explanation for the observation that proline residues are never found at the P2, P4, or P9 positions in gluten T-cell epitopes bound to DQ2. The localization of proline at the P6 position in some DQ2-restricted gluten T-cell epitopes is, however, in conflict with this scheme. Similarly, one could expect that N-methylation at the P6 position would have less effect than N-methylation at the P9 position. The IC50 values for the analogues with N-methylation at P6 and P9 are virtually the same, whereas the off-rate is higher for the analogue with N-methylation at P6. A possible explanation for this is that the side chain of proline is a favorable anchor for the P6 pocket, but not for the P9 pocket (34Vartdal F. Johansen B.H. Friede T. Thorpe C.J. Stevanovic S.

In the DQ2-αI-gliadin complex crystal structure, there is a proline residue positioned at P1, and hence there is no hydrogen bond to the amide nitrogen at this position.

Interestingly, DQ2 has a deletion of the α53 residue, and it is conceivable that DQ2 is unable to establish a hydrogen bond to the P1 amide nitrogen (17Kim C.Y. Quarsten H. Bergseng E. Khosla C. Sollid L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4175-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Previous functional assays suggest that the P1 hydrogen bond is critical for binding of peptides to DR molecules. In binding analysis of DR1 and DR4 (0401, a subtype of DR4) for N-methylated peptide series, the weakest binding was found for analogues with N-methylation at the P1 position (24Falcioni F. Ito K. Vidovic D. Belunis C. Campbell R. Berthel S.J. Bolin D.R. Gillespie P.B. Huby N. Olson G.L. Sarabu R. Guenot J. Madison V. Hammer J. Sinigaglia F. Steinmetz M. Nagy Z.A. Nat.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 2890-2898PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, off-rate analysis of DR1-peptide complexes showed the highest off-rate for the peptide with N-methylation at P1 both for DM-catalyzed and non-DM-catalyzed reactions (33Stratikos E. Wiley D.C. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For I-Ed, similar binding analysis did not reveal any clear effects for N-methylated analogues representing the P1–P9 positions (22Cotton J. Herve M. Pouvelle S. Maillere B. Menez A. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although I-Ed does not have a deletion at α53. To probe the possibility of hydrogen bond formation between the P1 amide and DQ2, we tested an analogue of the αI-gliadin peptide containing a norvaline substitution at P1. Norvaline and proline have the same number of carbon atoms in their side chains, but in contrast to proline, the side chain of norvaline does not have a cyclic structure. Compared with the unmodified αI-gliadin peptide, the P1 norvaline analogue bound with a higher IC50 value and had the same off-rate. This suggests that DQ2 binds peptides without establishing a hydrogen bond to the P1 amide. The majority of the gluten T-cell epitopes characterized so far (10Vader W. Stepniak D. Kooy Y. Mearin L. Thompson A. van Rood J.J. Spaenij L. Koning F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12390-12395Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar),1 including the αI-gliadin peptide, bind to DQ2 with proline residues positioned at the P1 position. Presumably, proline may be accommodated at this position with no penalty, despite the lack of hydrogen bond to the peptide backbone. In a study assessing the relative importance of main chain hydrogen bonds toward HLA-DM action in HLA-DR1, Stratikos et al. (33Stratikos E. Wiley D.C. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) observed that disrupting hydrogen bonds involving DRα residues 51–53, and in particular the hydrogen bond between the P1 amide and the carbonyl of α53, led to heightened HLA-DM catalytic efficacy. The authors suggest that these hydrogen bonds are disrupted in the MHC conformation recognized by HLA-DM, thereby allowing a conformational shift in the short extended strand formed by the α51–53 region and facilitating peptide exchange. Our observation that DQ2 binds peptides without establishing the hydrogen bond to the P1 amide suggests that the interaction between DQ2 and HLA-DM may differ qualitatively from that of many other MHC class II molecules. In this respect it is interesting that invariant chain (i.e. CLIP) peptides are remarkably abundant among the endogenous peptides eluted from DQ2 molecules of B-cell lines (34Vartdal F. Johansen B.H. Friede T. Thorpe C.J. Stevanovic S. Eriksen J.E. Sletten K. Thorsby E. Rammensee H.G. Sollid L.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35van de Wal Y.

Higher affinity and slow dissociation of the αI-gliadin peptide substituted with norvaline at P5 is compatible with the notion that DQ2 has the potential to establish a hydrogen bond to the peptide P5 amide.

The side chain of alanine β74 in DQ2 is, however, not a hydrogen bond acceptor. The entropic effect imposed by the proline residue can be another factor explaining our observations for the P5 substitution. Higher backbone flexibility resulting from norvaline substitution could lead to better docking of the side chains in the neighboring pockets. For some N-methylated peptide analogues, the binding was impaired so severely that it was impossible to generate a sufficient amount of peptide-MHC complexes to determine dissociation rates. However, for many of the analogues, both IC50 values and off-rate constants were established. With few exceptions, one being the αI-gliadin analogue N-methylated at the P7 position, the results of the two binding parameters paralleled each other. This underscores the importance of the off-rate component in the IC50 value. A steric effect of the methyl group at P7 amide for peptide docking could explain the dissonant observation at the P7 position. Blocking of peptide presentation by DQ2 is an attractive approach for a new treatment of celiac disease because DQ2 (or DQ8) is a necessary but insufficient genetic component for disease development. Such a blocker can most easily be administered locally at the intestinal surface parallel to gluten antigen ingestion. In this regard, celiac disease differs radically from other HLA-associated diseases for which this type of intervention also has been suggested. Effective inhibition of antigen presentation will likely require a slow off-rate of the blocking compound. A blocking compound can be designed as a peptidomimetic, and the ability to achieve slow off-rate will require the peptidomimetic compound to successfully establish hydrogen bonds to amide nitrogen at the P2 and P4 positions. A blocking compound will also have to be designed such that the T-cell receptor is prevented from making a productive contact to the blocker-DQ2 complex, and the blockers should also be proteolytically stable. How this should be obtained will be the focus of additional studies."

A diverse range of cellular movements is driven by members of the myosin superfamily (1Kieke M.C. Titus M.A. Schliwa M. Molecular Motors. Wiley VCH, Weinheim2003: 3-44Google Scholar). Myosins generate movement along actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner and are characterized by the presence of a conserved motor domain, typically located at the N terminus, and a highly divergent C-terminal tail region. The class VII myosins (M7) 1The abbreviations used are: M7, myosin VII; MyTH4, myosin tail homology 4; FERM, band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin; SH3, src homology 3; DdM7, Dictyostelium myosin VII; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; PI, protease inhibitor. are among the most widely expressed of the myosin family members, having been identified in organisms ranging from Dictyostelium to human. The M7 tail domain contains a tandem repeat of two MyTH4/FERM domains separated by an SH3 domain. In many cases, the tail begins with a region of predicted coiled-coil. In vertebrates, M7a is expressed almost exclusively in cells that possess specialized actin structures, most notably in the sensory hair cells of the ear in mice and zebrafish (2Hasson T.

Consistent with these observations, M7a is localized to regions of the stereocilia where links between adjacent stereocilia are formed and current evidence suggests that M7a is critical for providing a connection between the actin cytoskeleton and these extracellular links via interaction with vezatin and harmonin, proteins that interact directly or indirectly with cadherins (8Küssel-Anderman P.

The lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum expresses a single M7, DdM7, an initially surprising finding given that this organism does not possess any highly specialized actin-based structures. DdM7 is localized at the plasma membrane where it is transiently found in actively extending actin-rich regions of the cell, such as the leading edge and filopodial tips. Dictyostelium lacking DdM7 adhere poorly to surfaces, lack calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, are defective in extending filopodia, and are smaller in size than control cells (6Tuxworth R.I.

Talin is a conserved cytoskeletal protein characterized by the presence of an N-terminal FERM domain that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrins and a C-terminal I/LWEQ actin binding domain (11Critchley D.R. Kreis T. Vale R.D. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1999: 141-144Google Scholar).

TalinB, distinguished from talinA by the presence of a villin headpiece at its C terminus, is expressed at low levels in vegetative cells and is essential for development (13Tsujioka M. Machesky L.M.

Dictyostelium talinA has been shown to play a role in cell-substrate adhesion. It is localized to the leading edge of chemotactic cells, the cortex and filopodia (14Kreitmeier M. Gerisch G. Heizer C.

The functional similarities between DdM7 and talinA suggest that the two proteins may interact with each other or with the same adhesion receptors. Consistent with this view, a recent report indicates that, in the absence of DdM7, talinA levels are significantly reduced (17Gebbie L. Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Froquet R. Cherix N. Malbouyres M.

Generation of Expression Plasmids—All cloning was performed using enzymes and reagents from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Roche Applied Science following the manufacturers' protocols. An extrachromosomal plasmid expressing GFP-DdM7 was generated by a PCR-based approach in combination with TOPO cloning (Invitrogen) to add restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding region using Dictyostelium genomic DNA as a template. The sequence of all PCR-generated clones was verified by sequencing. The entire myoi gene encoding DdM7 (19Titus M.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was inserted into the XhoI site of pTX-GFP, a low copy number extrachromosomal plasmid carrying the gfp gene under the control of the actin15 promoter (20Levi S. Polyakov M. Egelhoff T.T. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The resulting expression plasmid was designated pDTi112. The GFP-tagged mutant DdM7 tail expression plasmids were generated using a similar approach except that the cloned myoi gene was used as a template. The region encompassing either the full-length tail (amino acids 809-2357), which includes the N-terminal predicted coiled-coil region or the tail lacking either the N-terminal or C-terminal FERM domains (amino acids 1314-1554 and 2057-2357, respectively), the tail lacking both FERM domains, the tail lacking most of the central SH3 and C-terminal proline-rich region alone (amino acids 1594-1790) were each cloned in-frame into p40B.2, a vector carrying the gene encoding GFP driven by the actin15 promoter (21Larochelle D.A. Vithalani K.K. De Lozanne A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The entire insert (i.e. the promoter, gfp gene, myoi tail sequence, and terminator) from each was then cloned into pSmall, a low copy number Dictyostelium extrachromosomal expression plasmid that carries a neomycin resistance cassette (22Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tail lacking both of the MyTH/FERM domains (MyTH4a/FERM1: amino acids 1157-1554; MyTH4b/FERM2: amino acids 1879-2357), the N-terminal region of predicted coiled-coil alone (809-901) and the N-terminal proline-rich region (amino acids 902-1156) was cloned directly into pTX-GFP. The GFP fusion expression plasmids, pDTi35 (full-length tail), pDTi85 (ΔFERM1 tail), pDTi76 (ΔFERM2 tail), pDTi114 (ΔFERM1/ΔFERM2 tail), pDTi155 (ΔM4/FERM), pDTi159 (ΔSH3/Pro2), pDTi172 (Coil), pDTi183 (Pro1), or the GFP-talinA plasmid (15Hibi M. Nagasaki A. Takahashi M. Yamagishi A. Uyeda T.Q.P. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 25: 127-140Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were transformed into either wild type, DdM7 null, or talinA null cells. Transformants were selected by growth in 10 μg/ml G418, screened for fluorescence, and then analyzed for expression of GFP-M7, GFP-M7 mutant, or wild type tails or tail fragments or GFP-talinA by Western blotting. A control strain expressing GFP alone was generated by transforming Ax2 cells with pTX-GFP. Immunoprecipitation—Log-phase Dictyostelium cells were collected and washed twice in phosphate buffer (PB; 16.6 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.4). Cells were then resuspended to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (ILB; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Mg-ATP) containing protease inhibitors (PIs; 4 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 100 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Type I-S, from soybean, Sigma)) and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed either by passage through two 3-μm polycarbonate filters (Osmonics Inc., Minnetonka, MN) or by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce Chemical Co.). The lysate was then centrifuged at 21,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. To remove proteins that nonspecifically bound the beads, 700 μl of supernatant was incubated sequentially with three separate solutions of Protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). For each incubation, supernatant was added to 100 μl of protein A beads that had been washed twice with ILB, the sample was gently mixed at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at low speed for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was collected for the next incubation with beads. A rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was added to the pre-cleared supernatant, at a final concentration of 12 μg/ml, and the sample was incubated with gentle mixing at 4 °C for 1-12 h. The antibody-supernatant solution was then added to 100 μl of Protein A beads that had been washed with ILB, and the slurry was incubated with gentle mixing at 4 °C for 6 h. The beads were collected by gentle centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved for analysis. The bead complex was then washed several times with ILB containing PIs, and the final bead pellet was carefully drained of all excess liquid. A total of 30 μl of urea-containing SDS sample buffer (ULSB; 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 4% SDS, 6 m urea, and 20 mm dithiothreitol) was added to the beads, and the samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 min and then applied either to a 6% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The samples were then either transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for immunoblotting or gels stained with either Coomassie R-250 or silver. Sucrose Gradients—Log-phase cells were collected, washed twice in PB, resuspended to a density of 3 × 107 cells/ml in sucrose gradient lysis buffer (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, 10 mm Mg-ATP, and PIs), and physically lysed by passage through 3-μm filters (as above). The lysate was centrifuged in a TL100.3 rotor in an Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 126,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting high speed supernatant was collected, and 500 μl was loaded onto a 10-ml linear gradient of 5-20% sucrose in gradient buffer (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mg-ATP, and PI), and the sample was centrifuged in an Sw41 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 h. Fractions of equal volume (700 μl) were collected, and the sucrose percentage was measured by a hand refractometer. The samples were concentrated by acetone precipitation, dissolved in 20 μl of ULSB, heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting. Sucrose gradient standards consisted of cytochrome c (12 kDa), catalase (62.5 kDa monomer), and thyroglobulin (670-kDa tetramer (Sigma)) with sedimentation coefficients of 2.1 S, 11.3 S, and 19.4 S, respectively (23Cole D.G.

A total of 75 μg of each standard protein was loaded onto a 10-ml sucrose gradient. Immunoblotting—The IgG fraction from rabbit serum containing antibodies directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing the DdM7 predicted coiled-coil region (amino acids 809-901; UMN87) was used at 1:1,500 for immunoblotting. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the heavy chain of the class I myosin, myoB, was used at 1:1,500 (24Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for Dictyostelium talinA (monoclonal antibody 477 and monoclonal antibody 341, mixed at 1:1 (14Kreitmeier M. Gerisch G. Heizer C. Muller-Taubenberger A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Niewöhner J. Weber I. Maniak M. Müller-Taubenberger A. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) and a monoclonal antibody specific for Dictyostelium actin (monoclonal antibody 244; used at 1:400) were generous gifts of Dr. Günther Gersich (Max-Planck Institut, Martinsried, Germany). A rat polyclonal antibody specific for the dynein intermediate chain (Rat 144; used at 1:1,500 (25Ma S. Triviños-Lagos L. Gräf R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) was a generous gift of Dr. Rex L. Chisholm (Northwestern University School of Medicine). All of the primary antibodies, with the exception of the talinA antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline. Washed blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), or donkey anti-rat (Jackson Immunologicals, West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies and bands detected by chemiluminescence using Super Signal (Pierce) followed by exposure to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak). Other Methods—Total cellular membranes and cytosol were prepared as described previously (26Senda S. Lee S.F. Côté G.P. Titus M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2898-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were prepared for confocal microscopy by plating them at subconfluent densities on tissue culture plates in HL5 the day before analysis. The cells were collected and washed twice with PB, allowed to adhere to coverslips, and then analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (6Tuxworth R.I. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G.C. Soll D.R. Gerisch G. Titus M.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A co-IP approach was used to initially identify DdM7-binding proteins from total cell extracts. A vector that drives GFP-DdM7 expression under the control of the actin15 promoter was transformed into DdM7 null cells to create a strain that stably expressed GFP-DdM7. Cells were either physically lysed by passage through 3-μm filters or chemically lysed by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 and the GFP-DdM7 immunoprecipitate using a commercially available antibody directed against GFP. The IP pellet was analyzed first by SDS-PAGE and found to contain two high molecular weight bands, one at the predicted ∼300-kDa size of GFP-DdM7. The second band migrated slightly below, at ∼260 kDa (Fig. 1A). The same result was obtained if the IP was performed with growth-phase cells that were actively extending filopodia and with aggregation-competent cells undergoing streaming (i.e. active chemotaxis) (data not shown). Control IP experiments were performed on lysates from either wild type cells expressing GFP alone or GFP-DdM7-expressing cells but without added GFP antibody, and no high molecular weight bands were observed in the IP pellet (Fig. 1, A and B). The identity of the higher molecular mass (∼300 kDa) band as GFP-DdM7 was confirmed by immunoblotting of the IP pellet with a DdM7-specific antibody directed against the N-terminal region of the tail (Fig. 1B). The 260-kDa band was identified as talinA by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Because DdM7 and talinA are both actin-binding proteins, the IP was carried out in the presence of 10 mm Mg-ATP to ensure that DdM7 was not indirectly associated with talinA due to binding to actin via its motor domain. Furthermore, when examined by immunoblotting, no actin was detected in the IP pellet (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that the calculated molecular mass of Dictyostelium talinA is 220 kDa, but this protein has been observed to run at ∼260 kDa on an SDS gel (14Kreitmeier M. Gerisch G. Heizer C. Muller-Taubenberger A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To further confirm the identification of the 260-kDa band as talinA, GFP-DdM7 was expressed in talinA null cells, and the IP pellet was shown to contain only a single ∼300-kDa band (Fig. 1B). A reciprocal IP on lysates from talinA null cells expressing GFP-talinA (15Hibi M. Nagasaki A. Takahashi M. Yamagishi A. Uyeda T.Q.P. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 25: 127-140Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was also performed. A major band migrating at ∼260 kDa was observed in the anti-GFP IP pellet by silver staining (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Immunoblotting revealed that this band was recognized both by GFP- and DdM7-specific antibodies (Fig. 1D, lower panels). These results establish that talinA binds directly to DdM7. The tail domains of myosins have been shown to interact with a range of binding proteins (1Kieke M.C. Titus M.A. Schliwa M. Molecular Motors. Wiley VCH, Weinheim2003: 3-44Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of M7 tail-binding proteins have been identified through yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments and the majority of these have been shown to interact with the C-terminal FERM domain (i.e. harmonin, MAP2B, protein kinase A regulatory subunit (RIα), MyRIP, and vezatin (8Küssel-Anderman P.

T.V. Gibson F. Kendrick-Jones J. Steel K.P. Brown S. D.M. Genes Func. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility that talinA interacts with the DdM7 tail, and does so by binding to one or both of the FERM domains, was investigated. A GFP-tagged full-length DdM7 tail (from the predicted coiled-coil region through to the end of the C terminus) or tails lacking one or both FERM domains (Fig. 2A) were expressed in Ax2 cells. The expression level of the GFP-tagged tail fragments was analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were also probed with an antibody to myoB (24Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a class I myosin, to provide an internal loading control. All tails were stably expressed at modest levels relative to the endogenous full-length DdM7 (Fig. 2B). The GFP-tagged fragments were immunoprecipitated as before, and the IP pellet was analyzed by both 6% and 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Inspection of the silver-stained gels revealed, in addition to the IgG bands and a band just below 100 kDa that is also routinely observed in control IP pellets with no antibody (see Fig. 1B), only two other bands were present in the GFP-tail IP pellet, one at 150-200 kDa and the other at ∼260 kDa (Fig. 2C). The sizes of the two bands were consistent with those of the expressed GFP-tail and endogenous talinA. Each of the three GFP-tagged deletion tails, one that lacked the N-terminal FERM domain (ΔFERM1), one that lacked the C-terminal FERM domain (ΔFERM2), or a tail lacking both (ΔFERM1-ΔFERM2), was found to co-IP with talinA (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that talinA interacts directly with the DdM7 tail domain and that the FERM domains of DdM7, either alone or in combination, are not required for this interaction. A series of GFP-tagged DdM7 tail fragments were expressed in wild type Dictyostelium cells to identify the region that binds to talinA (Fig. 3A). Tails lacking both of the MyTH4/FERM domains (ΔM4/FERM) or the central region of the tail encompassing all of the SH3 domain and most of the second proline-rich region (ΔSH3/Pro2) were stably expressed, although the level of ΔSH3/Pro2 tail expression was lower than that typically observed for the full-length tail (Fig. 3B). TalinA co-immunoprecipitated with both of these mutant tails (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the region of predicted coiled-coil (Fig. 3B) did not interact with talinA. These findings indicated that the region of the DdM7 tail that interacts with talinA lies between the region of predicted coiled-coil and the first MyTH4 domain. This region was fused to GFP and expressed at relatively high levels in wild type cells (Fig. 3B) and found to co-IP with talinA (Fig. 3C). M7 has been suggested to be a dimer based on the presence of a region of predicted coiled-coil at the N-terminal region of the tail domain. Gel filtration analysis of baculovirus-expressed mouse M7a confirmed that M7a is a dimer, although it was shown that the region of predicted coil could not promote dimerization of an “HMM” construct comprised of the motor domain, the IQ motifs, and the region of predicted coiled-co"

We used NMR techniques to study the backbone dynamics of skeletal troponin C (TnC) in the complex. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy pulse sequences and deuteration of TnC were essential to assign most of the TnC residues in the complex. Backbone amide 15N relaxation times were measured in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA/Mg2+. T1 relaxation times could not be interpreted precisely, because for a molecule of this size, the longitudinal backbone amide 15N relaxation rate due to chemical shift anisotropy and dipole-dipole interactions becomes too small, and other relaxation mechanisms become relevant. T2 relaxation times were of the expected magnitude for a complex of this size, and most of the variation of T2 times in the presence of Ca2+ could be explained by the anisotropy of the complex, suggesting a relatively rigid molecule. The only exception was EF-hand site III and helix F immediately after, which are more flexible than the rest of the molecule. In the presence of EGTA/Mg2+, relaxation times for residues in the C-domain of TnC are very similar to values in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the N-domain becomes more flexible.

Recent determination of the crystal structure of cardiac troponin (5Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) has revealed an apparently quite flexible complex. This has focused interest on the need for dynamics information on the troponin complex in order to properly interpret the structural data. The three components of Tn, troponins I, C, and T, are responsible for inhibiting muscle contraction in the absence of Ca2+, sensing the change in intracellular Ca2+ levels, releasing the inhibition in the presence of Ca2+, and transmitting this information to the other components of muscle thin filaments, respectively (for a recent review see Ref. 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 854-924Crossref Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Troponin C (TnC) isaCa2+-binding protein containing two domains connected by a linker.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Each domain contains two EF-hand metal-binding sites, and the helices that flank those sites are named A to D in the N-domain and are named E to H in the C-domain. An extra helix at the N terminus is named N. The sites in the N-domain are Ca2+-specific and important for the regulation of muscle contraction, whereas the EF-hand sites in the C-domain have higher affinity, can bind both Ca2+ and Mg2+, and are permanently occupied with one of the two ions. Because of these differences, the two domains are known as regulatory and structural domains, respectively. When the sites are occupied in each domain, conformational changes expose hydrophobic pockets that interact with specific regions of troponin I (TnI). TnI is a mainly helical protein, which interacts with TnC, troponin T (TnT), and actin. The N-terminal region of TnI interacts with the C-domain of TnC (CTnC) and is followed by a region that forms a coiled-coil with a portion of TnT. The inhibitory region, capable of binding to actin and inhibiting muscle contraction, and the switch region follow. The “switch” region is named that because it interacts with the N-domain of TnC (NTnC) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, removing the effect of the inhibitory region (10Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The C terminus of TnI also interacts with actin. TnT has two domains, T1 and T2. T1 is an elongated domain that interacts with tropomyosin and actin, the other two main components of muscle thin filaments, whereas T2 is mainly responsible for interacting with the other two components of the troponin complex (2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 854-924Crossref Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). There have been extensive studies of the interactions among the troponin subunits in various binary and ternary complexes. These are summarized in diagrammatic form in the steric blocking model of Potter and Gergely (11Potter J.D. Gergely J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the representations of the thin filament by Smillie and co-workers (12Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol.

Many recent studies have tended to focus on the interactions between the domains of TnC and peptides from TnI and TnT and have mapped out the interacting regions in some detail.

A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27024-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have revealed the nature of these interactions at atomic detail and have been confirmed by the recent x-ray structures of cardiac (5Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) and skeletal troponin (18Vinogradova M.V. Stone D.B. Malanina G.G. Karatzaferi C. Cooke R. Mendelson R.A. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5038-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The general mechanism of muscle regulation is the same in skeletal and cardiac muscles, but different isoforms allow for fine-tuning. In cardiac TnC, the first EF-hand site is not functional, and the N-domain can bind only one Ca2+ (19van Eerd J.-P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The binding of one Ca2+ is not enough to expose the hydrophobic pocket, and the N-domain of isolated cardiac TnC is always in a “closed” state. Interaction with the switch region of TnI causes the opening of the domain (14Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The second main difference between skeletal and cardiac troponin complexes is that cardiac TnI has an N-terminal extension, absent in skeletal TnI. TnT has multiple isoforms, expressed differently in different tissues, including cardiac and slow and fast skeletal muscles. Despite those differences, the similarities of the troponin complex in the two systems justify the comparison between cardiac and skeletal data. NMR techniques can be used to study internal motions of different time scales in proteins. Relaxation measurements give insight into protein backbone, side chain, and domain dynamics in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale, as well as the presence of conformational or chemical exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time scale (for reviews see Refs. 20Kay L.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 21Palmer A.G. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3623-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Although many nuclei (2H, 13C, 15N, 19F and 31P) can be used for relaxation studies, backbone amide 15N relaxation rates (the longitudinal relaxation time, T1, and the transverse relaxation time, T2, along with nuclear Overhauser effect) are the most common. These relaxation measurements are typically interpreted using the Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism (22Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3405) Google Scholar), from which an overall rotational correlation time, an internal correlation time, and an order parameter can be obtained for each N–HN bond vector (23Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). To study the dynamics of TnC within the troponin complex, we used a reconstituted 55-kDa troponin complex containing whole skeletal TnC, whole skeletal TnI, and the T2 domain of skeletal TnT. The T1 domain of TnT was not included, because it causes aggregation of the complex (24Stone D.B. Timmins P.A. Schneider D.K. Krylova I. Ramos C.H.I. Reinach F.C. Mendelson R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 689-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25King W.A. Stone D.B. Timmins P.A. Narayanan T. von Brasch A.A.M. Mendelson R.A. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and it does not interact with TnC and TnI (2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 854-924Crossref Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). We used this complex to measure backbone amide 15N NMR relaxation times, which give information about the rotational tumbling and internal dynamics of proteins (20Kay L.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results have been used to delineate the relative motions of the regulatory and structural domains of TnC in the apo (EGTA/Mg2+) and calcium-saturated states. These data demonstrate the existence of flexibility of the N-domain of TnC during the contraction cycle. Sample Preparation—Uniformly deuterated cysteineless chicken fast skeletal muscle TnI was expressed and purified as described (24Stone D.B. Timmins P.A. Schneider D.K. Krylova I. Ramos C.H.I. Reinach F.C. Mendelson R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 689-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using a construct provided by Dr. Smillie (26Dargis R. Pearlstone J.R. Barrete-Ng I. Edwards H. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (and references within): 34662-34665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Substitution of cysteineless TnI for wild-type TnI in the Tn complex does not alter the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin ATPase activity (26Dargis R. Pearlstone J.R. Barrete-Ng I. Edwards H. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (and references within): 34662-34665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A uniformly deuterated deletion mutant of chicken skeletal muscle TnT (isoform TnT-3), corresponding to the T2 domain, was expressed and purified as described (25King W.A. Stone D.B. Timmins P.A. Narayanan T. von Brasch A.A.M. Mendelson R.A. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 13C,15N- and 2H,13C,15N-labeled recombinant chicken skeletal TnC were expressed as described (27Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After lysis by a French press, salts (CaCl2 to 5 mm, MgCl2 to 1 mm, NaCl2 to 50 mm, and DTT to 1 mm) were added to the soluble fraction of the lysate, which was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column, previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% sodium azide. The column was then washed with the same buffer but containing 1 m NaCl and 100 mm CaCl2, and TnC was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. For [2H,13C,15N]TnC, Escherichia coli cells conditioned to grow in medium containing D2O were used, and the medium used for expression contained D2O instead of H2O. The troponin complex containing these subunits was assembled and purified as described (25King W.A. Stone D.B. Timmins P.A. Narayanan T. von Brasch A.A.M. Mendelson R.A. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The resulting complex was concentrated, dialyzed against 100 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1 mm DTT, and lyophilized. For each NMR sample, ∼13 mg of freeze-dried complex were dissolved in 550 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 250 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.03% sodium azide, and 0.2 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. For experiments in the presence of calcium, the buffer also contained 5 mm CaCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 6.8. For experiments in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+, the buffer also contained 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm EGTA, and the pH was adjusted to 7.1. The solution was filtered by using a microcentrifuge tube filter with 0.22-μm pore size, and 500 μl of it were transferred to an NMR tube. Expected free and bound concentrations of each ion and binding site were calculated with MaxChelator 2.50 (28Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This program can be obtained from www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html. The dissociation constants used for the N- and C-domains of TnC were determined by Potter and Gergely (29Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, less than 10% of the N-domain sites were expected to be occupied in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+. This should not have affected the measurements, because titration of EGTA into Ca2+-bound complex indicated that Ca2+ binding happened as a slow exchange event in the NMR time scale, and the “free” and “bound” residues appeared as different peaks in the spectrum (data not shown). A control sample ( (TnC·Ca42++TnI-(115−131))) was produced using the same buffer and conditions for the presence of calcium. To 2H,13C,15N-labeled TnC·Ca42+, an equimolar amount of unlabeled TnI-(115–131) peptide was added to prevent the previously described dimerization of TnC through the N domain (27Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—To determine NMR chemical shift assignments of TnC·Ca42+ in the troponin complex, {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC and three-dimensional TROSY-HNCA spectra were acquired in a Varian INOVA 800-MHz spectrometer, using BioPack (Varian, Inc.) pulse sequences. For the TnC·Ca42++TnI−(115−131) complex, {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC and three-dimensional TROSY-HNCACB spectra were used. NMR chemical shift assignments for TnC and TnC domains, isolated or bound to TnI peptides, in the presence or absence of Ca2+, were used as a guideline in assigning the spectra (30Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). {1H,15N} HSQC NMR spectra were also acquired, using the BioPack (Varian, Inc.) pulse sequence, for comparison with the TROSY pulse sequences. For the backbone amide 15N relaxation measurements, spectra were acquired on Varian INOVA 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers, using the T1 or T2 options in the gNhsqc BioPack (Varian, Inc.) pulse sequence, based on pulse sequences developed by Kay and co-workers (33Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar, 34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). These pulse sequences use 1H 180° pulses during the relaxation period, to eliminate by averaging the effects of cross-correlation between dipolar and CSA relaxation mechanisms, and were chosen to facilitate comparison with previously published data. Relaxation delays were 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 ms for T2 at both fields; 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.3, 1.7, and 2.1 s for T1 at 600 MHz; and 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 s for T1 at 800 MHz. Spectral width was 12,000 Hz in the 1H dimension, 2500 in the 15N dimension, and 6034 Hz (HNCA) or 11,000 Hz (HNCACB) in the 13C dimension. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were collected with 2048 (t2) × 96 (t1) complex points in TROSY mode, and either 720 (t2) × 96 (t1) or 672 (t2) × 96 (t1) complex points when decoupling the indirectly detected dimension during acquisition. Three-dimensional NMR spectra were collected with 2048 (t3) × 64 (t1) × 36 (t2) (for HNCACB) or 2048 (t3) × 62 (t1) × 32 (t2) (for HNCA) complex points. All spectra were acquired at 30 °C. All experimental free induced decays were processed with NMRPipe (35Delaglio F. Grzwsiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11630) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (36Johnson B. Blevins R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar), except for T1 envelope measurements, which were processed and analyzed with Vnmr 6.1 (Varian, Inc.). Linear prediction for up to half the number of experimental points was used in the indirectly detected dimension of experiments used for assigning. No linear prediction was used in the relaxation experiments. Data were zero-filled to the next power of 2 and multiplied by a sine-bell apodization function shifted by 60–90° before Fourier transformation. Data used for assigning were also multiplied by a Gaussian function before Fourier transformation. Backbone amide 15N T2 relaxation data were fitted to a two-parameter exponential decay using the “Rate Analysis” function of NMRView. The error bars in Fig. 5 represent the confidence intervals calculated by NMRView, using the noise level as an estimate for the standard deviation in intensity. For backbone amide 15N T1 relaxation spectra, the spectral region containing HN amide signals was integrated, and the resulting areas were fitted to a single exponential curve using the in-house program xcrvfit (by Robert Boyko, available at www.pence.ca/software/xcrvfit/). The expected values for T1 and T2 were calculated by using an awk script provided by Dr. Stéphane Gagné, a Mathematica script provided by Dr. Leo Spyracopoulos, or the program HYDRONMR (37García de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 147: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For HYDRONMR calculations, the parameters used were temperature = 303 K, viscosity = 0.8 centipoise, effective radius of the atomic elements = 2 Å, γH = 2.654 × 104 radians/s·G, γN =–2.713 × 103 radians/s·G, N–HN bond length = 1.04 Å, and 15N chemical shift anisotropy = –160 ppm. NMR studies of proteins and protein complexes larger than 30 kDa are hindered by fast transverse relaxation of the spins, which broadens the spectral lines, decreasing resolution and limiting the use of many modern and complex pulse sequences commonly used to characterize and assign protein NMR spectra. TROSY techniques (38Pervushin K. Riek R. Wieder G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) reduce transverse relaxation by taking advantage of the interference between its two main contributing sources, dipole-dipole interactions and chemical shift anisotropy, which results in narrower spectral lines, especially for the amide NH resonances. Extensive deuteration of the non-exchangeable protons in a protein can also reduce transverse relaxation, by reducing dipole-dipole interactions between 15N, 1HN, and remote (not covalently bound) protons. We compared the independent effects of TROSY and deuteration on the 55-kDa skeletal troponin complex by acquiring {1H,15N} HSQC and {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC two-dimensional NMR spectra of troponin complex containing uniformly deuterated TnI and TnT-T2 and either 13C,15N- or 2H,13C,15N-labeled TnC in the presence of Ca2+. The simultaneous use of both TROSY techniques and deuteration greatly increased the resolution. A larger improvement was seen by deuteration of TnC, even with non-TROSY pulse sequences, than by using TROSY pulse sequences with non-deuterated TnC (Fig. 1). A comparison of the {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra of 2H,13C,15N-labeled TnC·Ca42+, in the troponin complex or bound to the switch peptide (TnI-(115–131)), revealed the differences in the position of the cross-peaks (Fig. 2). TnI-(115–131) was added to minimize the dimerization of isolated TnC. Some peaks were in very different positions in the two spectra, whereas others were in the same position. This is true mostly for residues in the N-domain, due to the presence of TnI-(115–131), which binds to the hydrophobic pocket in the N-domain. Backbone chemical shift assignments for TnC in the troponin complex were based on three-dimensional TROSY-HNCA and three-dimensional TROSY-HNCO NMR spectra acquired at 800 MHz. Assignments were aided by comparison with the previously determined NMR chemical shift values for the C-domain of TnC bound to TnI-(1–40) (30Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and either the N-domain of TnC bound to TnI-(115–131) (31McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (for troponin in the presence of Ca2+) or the apo N-domain of TnC (32Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (for troponin in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+). 15N, 1HN, and C-α chemical shifts were assigned for more than two-thirds of the residues of TnC in each condition. Fig. 3 compares TnC and TnC domains in different environments to TnC in the troponin complex, by subtracting the NMR chemical shift values of TnC in each environment from the values for TnC in the troponin complex. The chemical shift values used include isolated TnC·Ca42+ (39Slupsky C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the regulatory domain of TnC ( (NTnC·Ca22+)) bound to the switch peptide (TnI-(115–131)) (31McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the structural domain of TnC ( (CTnC·Ca22+)) bound to the first 40 residues of TnI (30Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and CTnC·Ca22+ bound to a TnT peptide (TnT-(160–193)) (40Blumenschein T.M.A. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36606-36612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These peptides represent the main regions of TnI and TnT known to interact with TnC in the troponin complex. Whereas TnC·Ca42+ by itself and CTnC·Ca22+ -TnT-(160–193) show significant differences from TnC in the complex, NTnC·Ca22+ -TnI-(115–131) and CTnC·Ca22+ -TnI-(1–40) show very good agreement with those for the respective regions of TnC in the complex. The {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC NMR spectrum of 2H,13C,15N-labeled TnC in the troponin complex in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+ shows significant differences from the spectrum in the presence of Ca2+. EGTA competes with TnC for the Ca2+, removing it from the EF-hand sites in TnC. The concentrations used were too low to completely remove Ca2+ from the C-domain high affinity sites, and because the buffer also contained Mg2+, the C-domain sites remain occupied. The N-domain sites, however, have a lower Ca2+ affinity, are Ca2+-specific, and were ≥90% empty in the concentrations of EGTA used, as calculated with MaxChelator 2.50 (28Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a region of the corresponding {1H,15N} TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra. Residues in the C-domain suffered almost no change, consistent with the metal-binding sites remaining occupied, whereas the NMR chemical shift values for residues in the N-domain changed, becoming more similar to the values for the apo N-domain of TnC. This confirms that in the troponin complex in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+, the EF-hand sites in the N-domain of TnC become empty, whereas the ones in the C-domain of TnC remain occupied. The Ca2+ binding occurs as a slow exchange event in the NMR time scale during the titration between states (data not shown), with the apo residues and calcium-bound residues appearing as different peaks in the spectrum, which were independently assigned (see above). Backbone amide 15N T2 relaxation times were measured for 2H,13C,15N-labeled TnC in the troponin complex in the presence of Ca2+ and EGTA/Mg2+, at both 600 and 800 MHz, and are presented on a residue-specific basis in Fig. 5. These values were obtained by using pulse sequences that average the cross-correlation between dipolar and CSA relaxation mechanisms (33Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar, 34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

In the presence of Ca2+, T2 values for residues in the N- and C-domains are roughly constant and equal, suggesting that the complex tumbles as a single unit. The T2 values for residues in the N-domain become significantly longer in the presence of EGTA/Mg2+, suggesting that the N-domain moves independently from the remainder of the complex in the presence of EGTA. Table I shows the average of backbone amide 15N T2 values for residues assigned in each domain of TnC in the troponin complex, in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA/Mg2+, in both fields. Backbone amide 15N T2 relaxation times were also measured using 15N HSQC filtered 1H NMR spectra. These envelope measurements dete"

Crystallographic analysis of the HNF-4α and HNF-4γ ligand binding domains (LBDs) demonstrated the presence of endogenous ligands that may act as structural cofactors for HNF-4. It was also proposed by crystallographic studies that a combination of ligand and coactivator might be required to lock the receptor in its active state. We previously showed that mutations in amino acid residues Ser-181 and Met-182 in H3, Leu-219 and Leu-220 and Arg-226 in H5, Ileu-338 in H10, and Ileu-346 in H11, which line the LBD pocket in HNF-4α and come in contact with the ligand, impair its transactivation potential. In the present study, physical and functional interaction assays were utilized with two different coactivators, PGC-1 and SRC-3, to address the role of coactivators in HNF-4 function. We show that the integrity of the hinge (D) domain of HNF-4α and the activation function (AF)-2 activation domain region are critical for coactivation. Surprisingly, a different mode of coactivation is observed among the LBD point mutants that lack transcriptional activity. In particular, coactivation is maintained in mutants Ser-181, Arg-226, and Ile-346 but is abolished in mutants Met-182, Leu-219, and Ile-338. Physical interactions confirm this pattern of activation, implying that distinct amino acid residues may be involved in coactivator and ligand interactions, although some residues may be critical for both functions. Our results provide evidence and expand predictions based on the crystallographic data as to the role of coactivators in HNF-4α constitutive transcriptional activity.

Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors, which regulate a large number of developmental and physiological processes in response to small lipophilic molecules (1Giguere V. Endocr.

However, certain members of the superfamily are classified as orphan receptors since no exogenous ligand has been identified for them, among which, until recently, was HNF-4. 1The abbreviations used are: HNF-4, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4; LBD, ligand binding domain; AF, activation function; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; PGC-1, PPAR-γ coactivator-1; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acids; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; AD, activation domain. 1The abbreviations used are: HNF-4, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4; LBD, ligand binding domain; AF, activation function; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; PGC-1, PPAR-γ coactivator-1; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acids; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; AD, activation domain. HNF-4 is a crucial regulator of several metabolic pathways that are important for lipid and glucose homeostasis and plays a master role in the differentiation of hepatocytes and in maintaining the adult liver phenotype (2Sladek F.M.

There have been conflicting reports in the literature concerning molecules that could act as potential ligands for this receptor (5Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar T.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 6Bogan A. Dallas-Young Q. Ruse Jr., M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the recently solved crystal structures of two family members, HNF-4α and -γ, have revealed the existence of constitutively bound fatty acids in their ligand binding pockets (7Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y-I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Wisely B.G. Miller A.B. Davis R.G. Thornquest A.D.

Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1225-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), defining fatty acids as the endogenous ligands of HNF-4. A combination of crystallographic and functional studies of nuclear receptors has shown that ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the LBD through a translocation of several of the helices forming the nuclear receptor ligand binding pocket, with most prominent being that of H12, which exposes the solvent residues of the AF-2 core motif (AF-2 AD). This motif was shown to be critical for coactivator interaction. However, the recent crystallographic data on HNF-4 suggested a different model of transactivation. In the crystal of HNF-4α, the receptor forms homodimers, and the two molecules in each homodimer adopt distinct conformations, the so-called “open” and “closed” forms, in which H12 is either fully extended into the solvent and collinear with H10 or packed against the body of the receptor, respectively (7Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y-I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The ligand binding pocket forms a narrow channel that is lined almost exclusively with side chains of hydrophobic residues present in H3, H5, H7, and H10 (7Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y-I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the inability to displace the fatty acids from the LBDs of both HNF-4α and HNF-4γ might reflect the fact that these molecules are acquired as the nascent protein is folded. In this respect, they may act as structural cofactors, helping the protein to assume its correct conformation. These molecules do not appear to act at a subsequent level of activation, as traditional ligands do for other nuclear hormone receptors (8Wisely B.G. Miller A.B. Davis R.G. Thornquest A.D. Johnson R.

This is a revolutionary view that could, however, explain the constitutive transcriptional activity of HNF-4, which is well established from functional studies (9Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, it was proposed that a combination of ligand and coactivator might be required to lock this receptor in its closed and active state (7Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y-I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was recently confirmed by the crystallization of the LBD of HNF-4α bound to both fatty acid ligand and a coactivator sequence derived from SRC-1 (10Duda K. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23311-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Various studies have shown that HNF-4 interacts strongly with the p160 coactivators (11Sladek F.M. Ruse M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Stafford M.J. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and HNF-4 activity can also be enhanced by the action of CREB-binding protein (14Dell H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9013-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), probably through acetylation, which is crucial for its proper nuclear retention (15Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, HNF-4 interacts with PGC-1, having an active role in controlling hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to starvation (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Although PGC-1 contains an LXXLL motif, similar to that of other coactivators, which has been shown to mediate ligand-dependent interactions of the coactivator with several members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (17Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar), this motif exhibits distinct binding characteristics from those found in the p160 family members, as proposed from its surrounding amino acids and from transcriptional analysis studies in other receptors (18Tcherepanova I.

Based on the fact that PGC-1 forms a complex with HNF-4α enhancing transcriptional activation (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) and that HNF-4α activity can be enhanced by the actions of CREB-binding protein, SRC-1, GRIP-1, and SRC-3 (11Sladek F.M. Ruse M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Stafford M.J. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), we sought to identify the key regions of HNF-4α required for enhancement by coactivators. We found that the integrity of AF-2 AD and hinge (D) regions of HNF-4α (particularly amino acids 160–175) are critical for coactivation by PGC-1. Mutation in the critical residue E363K in the conserved AF-2 AD motif resulted in complete loss of transactivation, and this was maintained in the presence of coactivator. However, mutagenesis in the positively charged amino acid residues R168G/K170N/K171N that lie in the hinge (D) region had a small effect in HNF-4α-mediated transactivation, which was enhanced in the presence of coactivator. Furthermore, in a recent study, we have shown that point mutations in residues that are located in helices H3, H5, H10, and H11, which come in contact with the ligand, cause a dramatic decrease in HNF-4α activity (21Aggelidou E.

Structural modeling showed that these residues play a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the HNF-4α LBD. To investigate further the involvement of these amino acid residues in coactivator function, we used transient transfection analysis and interaction assays. We demonstrate that distinct residues in the LBD pocket, previously shown to control transcriptional activity (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30680-30688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), may be involved in coactivator and ligand interactions, although some residues may be critical for both functions. Plasmids—The GAL-HNF-4α wild type and deletion mutants were described previously (9Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The pCMXGAL-LBD point mutations in residues Ser-181 and Met-182 in H3, Arg-212 in H4, Leu-219, Leu-220, and Arg-226 in H5, Ile-338 in H10, and Ile-346 in H11 were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (21Aggelidou E.

The pcDNA3.1-LBD mutants have also been described (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol.

The full-length point mutants pcDNA3.1-LBD R168G/K170N/K171N and E363K were generated by the PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30680-30688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) by using forward primers 5′-GAC ATT GGG GCC AAT AAT ATT GCC 3′ (R168G/K170N/K171N) and 5′-C CTG CTG CAG AAG ATG CTG CTT GG-3′ (E363K) and reverse primers 5′-GGC AAT ATT ATT GGC CCC AAT GTC-3′ (R168G/K170N/K171N) and 5′-CC AAG CAG CAT CTT CTG CAG CAG G-3′ (E363K), respectively. The underlined triplets show the mutated codons. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal primers, HNF-N and HNF-C used, have been described (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30680-30688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The PCR amplified fragments were cloned into the vector pCDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at the HindIII and BamHI sites. Coactivator plasmids pcDNA3-HA-PGC1, GST-PGC-1 (aa 91–408) and pCMX-SRC-3 were kind gifts from Dr. Anastasia Kralli (University of Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. J. D. Chen (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), respectively. Constructs pG5CAT, containing five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the β-globin promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and p(BA1)5CAT, containing five copies of the HNF-4α binding element from the apoB gene in front of the minimal apoB promoter and the CAT gene, were used as the reporters to assay the degree of transactivation (22Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid apoCIII(–890/+24)CAT, containing the natural apolipoprotein CIII promoter, was also used in transcriptional analysis of the pcDNA3.1-LBD point mutants (23Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pEV-BirA and pcDNA3.1-Bio plasmids, encoding the bacterial biotin ligase BirA and the 23-amino-acid biotinylation epitope, were generous gifts of Drs. John Strouboulis (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and Dr. Dimitris Kardassis (University of Crete), respectively. The Bio-PGC-1 plasmid was created by amplifying PGC-1 from the HA-PGC-1 vector (forward primer 5′-ATT GCC GAT ATC GC ATG GCG TGG GAC ATG TCC A-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGC AAT GCG GCC GC TTA CCT GCG CAA GCT TCT CT-3′). The underlined sequences show the EcoRV and NotI restriction sites engineered by the primers into the 5′ and 3′ end of the PGC-1 sequence, respectively, with the addition of nucleotides where appropriate (in bold), to clone the sequence into frame with the Bio-epitope sequence in the pcDNA3.1-Bio vector. The resulting Bio-PGC-1-expressing plasmid was used in cell transfections for in vivo copurification assays. Cell Transfections and CAT Assays—HepG2, COS-7, and HEK-293 cells were maintained as stocks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 50–60% confluent 30-mm dishes were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 and/or HepG2 cells and assayed for their ability to promote transcription of the CAT gene. The transfection mixture contained 3 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid, 200 ng of the GAL-HNF-4α, pCMXGAL-LBD or pcDNA3.1-LBD wild type or mutant plasmids, 1 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid and, in coactivator interaction experiments, 1.25 μg of PGC-1 or SRC-3 plasmid. In each case, vector DNA was added as necessary to achieve a constant amount of transfected DNA (5.45 μg). 40 h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and collected in TEN solution (0.04 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl). Whole cell extracts were prepared in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, by three sequential freezethaw cycles. The β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates was determined as described previously (22Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the values obtained were used to normalize variability in the efficiency of transfection. CAT activities were determined using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA as described previously (22Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT enzyme levels that exhibited more than 60% conversion of acetylated product were diluted and re-assayed for CAT activity in the linear range. The results represent the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments, each carried out in duplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The various pcDNA3.1-LBD mutants were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and nuclear extracts were isolated and used to evaluate the dimerization and DNA binding properties of all mutants as described previously (24Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cardot P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9657-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the B regulatory element of the apoCIII promoter (CIIIB), which is a high affinity binding site for HNF-4α, was used as a probe (23Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide is composed of CIIIBfor, 5′-GGTCAGCAGGTGACCTTTGCCCAGCG-3′, and the complementary CIIIBrev, 5′-CGCTGGGCAAAGGTCACCTGCTGACC-3′. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 μg of poly(dI-dC). Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing gel followed by autoradiography. In dimerization experiments, extracts from cells transfected with the point mutants were incubated with extracts from CD1b transfectants for 15 min prior to the addition of the probe. CD1b is a truncated form of HNF-4α that has been previously shown to retain the wild type DNA binding and dimerization properties (9Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—Cells of the BL21 Escherichia coli strain were transformed with the pGEX-4T2 and pGEX-PGC-1 (aa 91–408) expression plasmids, and isolated colonies were grown in 200-500 ml of appropriate selective medium. The cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and, 3 h later, cells were harvested and lysed in 1 volume of cold lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS), with sonication. The cell debris was pelleted, and supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 0.1 volumes of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) that were equilibrated in PBS. After binding, the beads were washed four times in cold PBS and resuspended in an equal volume of cold washing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Nuclear extracts from HEK-293 transfected cells were prepared. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 μm leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were homogenized and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B+ (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m KCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 μm leupeptin) and extracted on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and 2 volumes of buffer B– (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl) were added to the supernatant. GST interactions were carried out for 1 h at 4°C in reaction volumes of 500 μl with cold interaction buffer (same as washing buffer plus 10% glycerol) by using 2 μg of GST or GST fusion protein and 20–60 μl of the various nuclear extracts per reaction. The precise amounts of nuclear extracts used in each interaction were normalized to mutant expression, as assessed by Western blot analysis. The beads were extensively washed in cold washing buffer after each interaction. Proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× loading buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) by boiling for 5 min, and they were subsequently analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blot analysis, as described previously (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30680-30688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In detail, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting, and the membranes were preincubated in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, they were incubated with the primary goat polyclonal anti-HNF-4α C-19 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5,000 in PBST for 1 h at 25°C. Membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the secondary antibody, rabbit anti-goat IgG, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBST for 1 h at 25°C. Membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and once in PBS, and proteins were visualized by exposure to ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Copurification of Biotin-tagged PGC-1 and HNF-4α from Cell Extracts—50–60% confluent 60-mm dishes of HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg each of the following plasmid vectors: pEV-BirA, Bio-PGC-1, and the pcDNA3.1-LBD wild type or mutant plasmids. Empty vector DNA was added as appropriate to achieve a constant amount of transfected DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors) by gentle rocking for 20 min at 4 °C. Depending on protein expression, 100–200 μl of the cell extracts were added to 50 μl of 50% streptavidin beads (Sigma), in lysis buffer, up to a final volume of 500 μl/reaction, and reactions were incubated by rotation at 4 °C overnight. Following extensive washing of the beads, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× loading buffer, as described previously (25De Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and they were electrophoretically separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) as described above, and membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin polymer (Sigma) at a 1:7,500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature following incubation in Tris Buffered Saline +0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated PGC-1 was visualized by exposure to ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following stripping of the membranes in 25 mm glycine, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS stripping solution, pH 2.5, membranes were reincubated with the anti-HNF-4α C19 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at the dilutions described above. Proteins were again visualized with the aid of the ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). To identify key regions of HNF-4α that are targets for coactivation, various GAL-HNF-4α mutant chimeras (21Aggelidou E. Iordanidou P. Tsantili P. Papadopoulos G. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol.

We found that PGC-1 alone could not activate transcription (data not shown), although a synergistic effect was observed between GAL-HNF-4α and the coactivator (Fig. 1A). This synergistic effect was maintained in deletion mutants GAL-D2HNF4-(128–455) and GAL-D2CD1-(128–370) and abolished in mutants GAL-D2CD1b-(128–360), lacking the AF-2 AD core motif, and GAL-D6CD1-(175–370), lacking the hinge (D) region (Fig. 1A). In particular, progressive deletions in the hinge region revealed the importance of residues 160–175 for enhancement of transcriptional activation by PGC-1 since mutant GAL-D5CD1-(160–370) showed a 20-fold increase in the presence of PGC-1, whereas no increase was observed for GAL-D6CD1-(175–370) in the presence of the coactivator. Western blot analysis in transfected cells revealed that the GAL-HNF-4α chimeras were expressed in similar amounts (Fig. 1B). Having identified the importance of the AF-2 AD core motif (ΦΦXEΦΦ) for PGC-1 coactivation, we wished to examine the effect of a point mutation in the conserved amino acid residue Glu-363 in the context of the full-length HNF-4 molecule. Furthermore, it was interesting to map potential residues of the D domain important for PGC-1-mediated transactivation by introducing point mutations. It was previously proposed that Arg-168 of the D domain could be important for HNF-4α activity since the homologous residue in reti"
https://openalex.org/W2060966923,"Most studies aimed at characterizing the utrophinactin interaction have focused on the amino-terminal tandem calponin homology domain. However, we recently reported evidence suggesting that spectrin-like repeats of utrophin also participate in binding to actin. Here we expressed several recombinant fragments encoding the utrophin amino-terminal domain alone or in combination with various numbers of spectrin-like repeats. We further quantitatively characterized the actin binding properties of each recombinant utrophin fragment using a high-speed sedimentation assay. To evaluate the capacity of each protein to stabilize actin filaments, we compared the effect of utrophin recombinant fragments and full-length utrophin on 6-propionyl-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)naphthalene actin depolymerization. Our results suggest that, whereas the amino-terminal domain is essential for primary interaction between utrophin and actin, spectrin-like repeats have additive effects on the affinity and stoichiometry of binding. Our data indicate that the amino-terminal domain and first 10 consecutive spectrin-like repeats recapitulate the actin binding activity of full-length utrophin more faithfully than the amino-terminal domain alone. These findings support the model for lateral association of utrophin along the actin filament and provide the molecular basis for designing the most effective utrophin mini-genes for treatment of dystrophinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2043908422,"Studies of the mechanisms of blood coagulation zymogen activation demonstrate that exosites (sites on the activating complex distinct from the protease active site) play key roles in macromolecular substrate recognition. We investigated the importance of exosite interactions in recognition of factor IX by the protease factor XIa. Factor XIa cleavage of the tripeptide substrate S2366 was inhibited by the active site inhibitors p-aminobenzamidine (Ki 28 ± 2 μm) and aprotinin (Ki 1.13 ± 0.07 μm) in a classical competitive manner, indicating that substrate and inhibitor binding to the active site was mutually exclusive. In contrast, inhibition of factor XIa cleavage of S2366 by factor IX (Ki 224 ± 32 nm) was characterized by hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition, indicating that factor IX binds to free and S2366-bound factor XIa at exosites. Consistent with this premise, inhibition of factor XIa activation of factor IX by aprotinin (Ki 0.89 ± 0.52 μm) was non-competitive, whereas inhibition by active site-inhibited factor IXaβ was competitive (Ki 0.33 ± 0.05 μm). S2366 cleavage by isolated factor XIa catalytic domain was competitively inhibited by p-aminobenzamidine (Ki 38 ± 14 μm) but was not inhibited by factor IX, consistent with loss of factor IX-binding exosites on the non-catalytic factor XI heavy chain. The results support a model in which factor IX binds initially to exosites on the factor XIa heavy chain, followed by interaction at the active site with subsequent bond cleavage, and support a growing body of evidence that exosite interactions are critical determinants of substrate affinity and specificity in blood coagulation reactions.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). fIX conversion to fIXaβ is achieved through two proteolytic cleavages after Arg145 and Arg180, releasing an 11-kDa activation peptide (3Fujikawa K.

During hemostasis, fIX activation occurs through two distinct pathways mediated by the protease factors VIIa and XIa (fXIa) (3Fujikawa K. Lagaz M. Kato H. Davie E.

Plasma coagulation is initiated when factor VIIa binds to the integral membrane protein tissue factor (TF) at a wound site (8Broze G. Girard T. Novotny W.

Activation of fIX by fXIa likely occurs after initial fibrin formation (11Broze G. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walsh P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 189-201PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for maintenance of clot stability, particularly in tissues rich in fibrinolytic activity that would otherwise quickly degrade the clot (13Asakai R.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). fXIa differs from other coagulation proteases in several important aspects. fXI is a homodimer (15Bouma B. Griffin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas other coagulation proteases are monomers (2Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal portion of the fXI polypeptide is a typical trypsin-like protease domain, the N-terminal non-catalytic region contains four repeats called apple domains (A1–A4 from the N terminus) not found on other coagulation proteases (16McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fXIa lacks the phospholipid-binding Gla domain characteristic of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases. Indeed, although phospholipid lowers Km for most coagulation protease reactions several orders of magnitude, it has little effect on fIX activation by fXIa (4DiScipio R. Kurachi K. Davie E. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Osterud B. Bouma B. Griffin G. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism by which fXIa activates fIX is not completely understood, and the unusual structural features of fXIa cited above make it difficult to extrapolate from data obtained for other coagulation proteases. Enzymes involved in fibrin formation are members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases (2Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 19Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20Bode W. Brandstetter H. Mather T. Stubbs M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite having relatively similar catalytic domains, these enzymes exhibit specific substrate recognition (21Mann K. Jenny R. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity and affinity for many serine proteases involved in digestive or degradative processes are governed primarily by interactions between the protease catalytic domain and sites on the substrate near the protease cleavage site (22Perona J. Craik C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 23Perona J. Craik C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These interactions, which involve active site groups (primarily the S1–S3 substrate-binding subsites) and surface loops on the catalytic domain, are critical for proper alignment of substrate with the active site. More specialized proteases, including those involved in coagulation, frequently have domains outside of the protease domain that are required for proper function (1Furie B. Furie B. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 2Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W.

Biol. 1987; 52: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A substantial body of evidence obtained by structural biology approaches indicates that binding interactions outside the protease domain are important determinants of substrate affinity and specificity in coagulation reactions (26Duffy E.

A two-step model of coagulation protease zymogen activation has been proposed in which substrate binds initially to an exosite followed by docking at the active site and subsequent catalysis (28Baugh R. Dickinson C. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that fIX activation involves exosite interactions with the fXIa heavy chain. Km for fIX activation by the isolated fXIa catalytic domain is ~25-fold higher than for intact fXIa (36Sinha D. Seaman F. Walsh P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3768-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant fXIa in which the A3 domain is replaced with the homologous domain from plasma kallikrein also activates fIX with a substantially greater Km when compared with wild type fXIa (37Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Sun M. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although these studies clearly show that the fXIa heavy chain interacts with fIX, the importance of these interactions, relative to those at the protease active site, in productive substrate recognition is not clear. Here, we investigated the importance of exosite binding to substrate recognition of fIX by fXIa. Materials—S299 (methyl-sulfonyl-d-cyclo-hexyl-glycyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) was from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT), and S2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide) was from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH). Aprotinin and p-aminobenzamidine (pAB) were from Sigma. Plasma Proteins—fIX was prepared from human plasma collected into acid-citrate-dextrose. Plasma (2 liters) at 4 °C was supplemented with benzamidine to 20 mm, and 160 ml of 1 m BaCl2 was slowly added with stirring. After 1 h, the precipitate was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 20 min, washed twice with 1 liter of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm benzamidine, 10 mm BaCl2, and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm benzamidine, 20% saturated ammonium sulfate, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The suspension was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA and then against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm benzamidine, 2.5 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation, fIX was purified from supernatant by antibody-affinity chromatography by using the calcium-dependent anti-human fIX monoclonal IgG SB 249417 (Dr. John Toomey, GlaxoSmithKline) linked to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) (30Aktimur A. Gabriel M. Gailani D. Toomey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After loading, the column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm benzamidine and then eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine. Protein-containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl (TBS). Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and concentration by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Human fXIa, fIXaβ, and fIXai (fIXaβ with the active site inhibited by Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone) were from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant fXIa Catalytic Domain—The human fXI cDNA (17Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) was altered by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), converting the TGT triplet for Cys362 to TCT (Ser) and converting the TGC triplet for Cys482 to AGC (Ser). The construct (fXI-Ser362,482) codes for a protein lacking the disulfide bond that connects the fXIa catalytic domain to the heavy chain. fXI-Ser362,482 cDNA was ligated into vector pJVCMV (38Sun M. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and 50 × 106 293 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1573) were cotransfected by electroporation (Electrocell Manipulator 600 BTX, San Diego, CA) with 40 μg of construct and 2 μg of pRSVneo (38Sun M. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml G418. Supernatants from G418-resistant clones were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using goat anti-human fXI antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Expressing clones were expanded in 175-cm2 flasks, and conditioned medium was collected every 48 h. fXI-Ser362,482 was purified from medium on an anti-fXI IgG 1G5 affinity column (38Sun M. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Purified fXI-Ser362,482 (~300 μg/ml) was activated with 5 μg/ml factor XIIa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) at 37 °C, and complete activation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Activated protein was reapplied to the 1G5 antibody column to separate the fXIa-Ser362,482 catalytic domain (fXIaCD), which binds to the column, from factor XIIa and the fXIa-Ser362,482 heavy chain, which flow through the column. fXIa Hydrolysis of S2366 —fXIa (6 nm active sites, 3 nm protein) or fXIaCD (6 nm active sites, 6 nm protein) was diluted in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (TBSA), 5 mm CaCl2, and S2366 (50–2000 μm) in the presence or absence of pAB, aprotinin, fIX, or fIXai. Rates of generation of free p-nitroaniline were measured by continuous monitoring of absorbance at 405 nm by using 100-μl reaction volumes (3-mm path length) in a SpectraMax 340 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Assays were performed in triplicate. Peptide p-nitroaniline substrate concentrations were determined by absorbance at 342 nm by using an absorption coefficient of 8,266 m–1 cm–1, and product concentrations were calculated by using an absorption coefficient of 9,933 m–1 cm–1 at 405 nm (39Lottenberg R. Hall J. Blinder M. Binder E. Jackson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Active site concentrations ν0=kcat[E]0(1+β[I]0αKi)(1+[I]0αKi)[S]0Km(1+[I]0Ki)(1+[I]0αKi)+[S]0(Eq. 1) for preparations of fXIa were determined by active site titration with human antithrombin in an S2366 cleavage assay. fIX Activation by fXIa—fIX (25–2000 nm) in TBSA containing 5 mm CaCl2 was activated by the addition of fXIa (0.4 nm active sites, 0.2 nm protein). At various time points (0–240 min), 50-μl aliquots were removed and supplemented with aprotinin (final concentration 15 μm) to inhibit fXIa. The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of S299 (1 mm) by quenched samples was studied in TBSA containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 33% ethylene glycol. Changes in absorbance at 405 nm were measured on a SpectraMax 340 plate reader. Duplicate assays were run for each fIX concentration. Generation of fIXaβ as a function of time was determined by interpolation from the linear dependence of the initial rate of S299 hydrolysis on known concentrations of fIXaβ. Initial steady-state rates of fIXaβ formation were determined from slopes of plots documenting the linear appearance of fIXaβ with time. Control experiments established that aprotinin completely inhibited fXIa activity without measurable effect on the detection of fIXaβ activity. fIX (50–3000 nm) activation by fXIa was also studied in the presence of aprotinin or fIXai. Aliquots (50 μl) withdrawn at various time points (20–180 s) after the initiation of activation were quenched by the addition of aprotinin (final concentration 15 μm), and fIXaβ generation was determined as described above. All assays were performed in triplicate. Data Analysis—The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters Km and kcat for fIX activation were obtained both by non-linear least-squares fitting of full progress curves for fIX activation at substrate concentrations ranging from 25 to 1000 nm fIX (0.3–11 × Km), taking into account competitive product inhibition by fIXaβ formed during the time courses (40Duggleby R. Morrison J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 481: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and by the initial rate dependence of fIXaβ formation as a function of fIX concentration. Km and kcat for hydrolysis of S2366 by fXIa were obtained by initial rate analysis of p-nitroaniline generation as a function of S2366 concentration. Ki values for binding of pAB and aprotinin to fXIa were obtained by fitting the substrate and inhibitor dependences of the initial rates of S2366 hydrolysis both by the general hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition model (Scheme 1) and by the classical competitive inhibition model in which no ESI complex is formed (41Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 178-192Google Scholar). The hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition model describes the conversion of S2366 (S) to product (P) by fXIa (E) in the presence of fIX as an inhibitor (I). fIX binds to both free fXIa (E) and fXIa in complex with S2366 (ES) through an exosite interaction. Ks (≈Km) and Ki are dissociation constants for binding of S and I to E, respectively, and kcat is the rate constant for turnover of S in the ES or ESI complex. α and β are the factors by which Ks and kcat change, respectively, when I (fIX) is bound to E. Hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition (Scheme 1) is defined by Equation 1. Equation 1 was used to analyze hydrolysis of S2366 (S) by fXIa (E) in the presence of fIX or fIXai (I), and was compared to the non-competitive (β = 0) model to analyze the cleavage of fIX (S) by fXIa (E) in the presence of aprotinin (I). Binding of fIX or fIXai to fXIa and fXIa·S2366 complex was analyzed by the hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition model and by a two-step interaction model proposed by Boskovic and Krishnaswamy (33Boskovic D.

In this model, a macromolecular ligand (S2) interacts at the exosite during the first step, and after a conformational rearrangement governed ν0,P1=kcat[E]0(1+β[S2]0αKS2)(1+[S2]0αKS2)[S1]0kS1(1+[S2]0KS2+[S2]0K*KS2)(1+[S2]0αKS2)+[S1]0(Eq. 2) ν0,P2=kcat[E]0(1+K*([S1]0αKS1))[S2]0K*KS2(1+[S1]0KS1)(1+K*(1+[S1]0αKS1))+[S2]0(Eq. 3) by K*, binds to the active site during the second step. Binding of the macromolecular ligand to the active site is in competition with binding of a small ligand (S1) that reacts with the active site but not with the exosite. Rate equations were derived for this model for turnover of S2366 (S1) proposed to bind only at the active site of fXIa (E) with the dissociation constant KS1 and catalytic constant kcat, and for turnover of fIX (S2) proposed to dock initially at the exosite governed by KS2, and in a second step governed by equilibrium constant K*, with the active site, forming product with the catalytic constant kcat*. The equations were derived without the previous assumption that α = β = 1 (33Boskovic D. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

The initial rate of hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate in Michaelis-Menten form is given by Equation 2 and the initial rate of cleavage of fIX is given by Equation 3.

For all analyses, it is assumed that the active sites function independently of each other, and all protease concentrations given are active site concentrations. The small molecule inhibitor pAB binds reversibly to the S1 substrate-binding subsite of arginine-specific serine proteases (42Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29485-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given its mechanism of action, pAB is expected to be a classical competitive inhibitor of substrate binding to the fXIa active site. The tripeptide substrate S2366 interacts predominantly with the S1–S3 substrate-binding subsites of the active site and was cleaved by fXIa with Km 233 ± 78 μm and kcat 117 ± 10 s–1 (Table I). As expected, pAB was a purely competitive inhibitor of S2366 cleavage with Ki 28 ± 2 μm (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table I). The Kunitz-type inhibitor aprotinin interacts with the fXIa active site and other sites on the catalytic domain but is not expected to interact appreciably with the fXIa heavy chain (45Navaneetham D. Jin L. Babine R. Abdel-Meguid S. Walsh P. Blood. 2003; 102 (Abstr. 435)Google Scholar). Aprotinin behaved as a competitive inhibitor of fXIa cleavage of S2366 with Ki 1.13 ± 0.07 μm (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table I). The data indicate that S2366, pAB, and aprotinin bind to the fXIa active site in a mutually exclusive manner.Table IKinetics of inhibition of fXIa activity by active site inhibitors and by fIX/fIXaiSubstrateInhibitorInhibition typeKmkcatαβKiK*μms-1μmS2366None233 ± 78117 ± 10S2366pABCompetitive233 ± 78117 ± 1028 ± 2S2366aprotininCompetitive233 ± 78117 ± 101.13 ± 0.07S2366fIXMixed hyperbolic233 ± 78117 ± 102.7 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.10.22 ± 0.05S2366fIXTwo step conformational233 ± 78117 ± 102.7 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.1≥5S2366fIXaiMixed hyperbolic233 ± 78117 ± 102.5 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.10.11 ± 0.02S2366fIXaiTwo step conformational233 ± 78117 ± 102.5 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1≥5fIXNone0.09 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.05fIXAprotininNon-competitive0.09 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.056.3 ± 4.100.89 ± 0.52fIXfIXaiCompetitive0.09 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.050.33 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of fXIa-catalyzed Hydrolysis of S2366 by fIX and fIXai—In surface plasmon resonance studies, fIX and fIXaβ bind to fXIa with similar affinity (30Aktimur A. Gabriel M. Gailani D. Toomey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effect of fIX and active site-blocked fIXaβ (fIXai) on fXIa hydrolysis of S2366 was investigated. During reactions with fIX, it is expected that some fIXaβ will be generated. Preliminary experiments showed that 2 μm fIXaβ does not hydrolyze S2366 appreciably. If fIX interacts with fXIa exclusively at the active site, it would be expected to behave as a competitive inhibitor of fXIa hydrolysis of S2366. In this case, fIXai interaction at the active site may be weak because of the absence of the activation peptide. On the other hand, if exosite interactions are involved in fIX and fIXai binding to fXIa, mixed-type inhibition of S2366 cleavage would be expected for both molecules. fIX and fIXai inhibited fXIa cleavage of S2366 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2), and substantial residual fXIa activity remained at saturating fIX or fIXai concentrations. The data were fit well by the hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition model (Scheme 1). Binding of fIX resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in Km and a 50% reduction in kcat for fXIa cleavage of S2366. Ki for binding of fIX to free and S2366-bound fXIa was 0.22 ± 0.05 and 0.59 ± 0.09 μm, respectively (Table I). Binding of fIXai caused a similar 2.5-fold increase in Km and a less explicit (14%) decrease in kcat for S2366 cleavage. Ki for binding of fIXai to free fXIa and to the fXIa·S2366 complex was 0.11 ± 0.02 and 0.28 ± 0.02 μm, respectively (Table I). The Ki for binding of fIXai to fXIa was in good agreement with the Ki for product inhibition obtained from progress curves of fIX hydrolysis by fXIa (0.075 ± 0.015 μm, Fig. 3).Fig. 3Kinetic parameters for fIX cleavage by fXIa.A, initial rates of fIX hydrolysis by 0.4 nm fXIa active sites (vo) as a function of fIX concentration ([fIX]o).

https://openalex.org/W2046177824,"Tamoxifen has been reported to directly activate large conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels through the KCa β1 subunit, suggesting a cardio-protective role of this compound. The present study using knock-out (KO) mice for the KCa channel β1 subunit was aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of the effects of tamoxifen on arterial smooth muscle KCa channels. Single channel studies were conducted in excised patches from cerebral artery myocytes from both wild-type and KO animals. The present data demonstrated that tamoxifen can inhibit arterial KCa channels due to a major decrease in channel open probability (Po), a mechanism different from the reduction in single channel amplitude reported previously and also observed in the present work. A tamoxifen-induced decrease in Po was present in arterial KCa channels from both wild-type and β1 KO animals. This inhibition was concentration-dependent and partially reversible with a half-maximal concentration constant IC50 of 2.6 μm. The effect of tamoxifen was actually dual Single channel kinetic analysis showed that tamoxifen shortens both mean closed time and mean open time; the latter is probably due to an intermediate duration voltage-independent blocking mechanism. Thus, tamoxifen block would predominate when KCa channel Po is >0.1–0.2, limiting the maximum Po, whereas a leftward shift in voltage or Ca2+ activation curves can be observed for Po values lower than those values. This dual effect of tamoxifen appears to be independent of the β1 subunit.

Nelson M.T. Science. 1992; 256: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Extensive work on the molecular biology of these channels has revealed that KCa channels exist in most tissues as heterodimers formed by two different subunits termed α and β. The α subunit contains the pore-forming region, the voltage sensor, and the Ca2+ binding site, whereas the β subunit (first discovered in smooth muscle, Ref. 2Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.G. McManus O.B.

Previous works on expressed KCa channels have shown that the smooth muscle-specific β1 subunit subtype increases the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, slows the activation and deactivation kinetics, and increases the sensitivity of the agonist dehydrosoyasaponin-I (5Dworetzky S.I.

The KCa channel β1 subunit has also been shown to have a crucial role as a molecular tuner for vasoregulation. Indeed, animals with gene-targeted disruption of the β1 subunit showed an impaired KCa channel function that leads to an increased arterial tone associated with symptoms of hypertension (8Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 9Pluger S. Faulhaber J.

More recently, down-regulation of the KCa channel β1 subunit was shown to have a role in a model of acquired hypertension (10Amberg G.C. Bonev A.D. Rossow C.F. Nelson M.T. Santana L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as well as in a model of genetic hypertension (11Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Conversely, a recently discovered polymorphism of the β1 subunit that promotes a gain of function of the KCa channel is associated with a low prevalence of diastolic hypertension in humans (12Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Tomas M. Vazquez E. Orio P. Latorre R. Senti M. Marrugat J. Valverde M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Given the crucial role of the KCa channel β1 subunit in arterial smooth muscle, together with its highly smooth muscle-specific expression, the search for a specific KCa channel β1 subunit pharmacology has recently increased. Tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative, is predominantly known as a competitive antagonist at the estrogen receptor and is used as an effective prescribed drug in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer (13Fisher B. Costantino J.P. Wickerham D.L. Redmond C.K. Kavanah M. Cronin W.M. Vogel V. Robidoux A. Dimitrov N. Atkins J. Daly M. Wieand S. Tan-Chiu E. Ford L. Wolmark N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1371-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen and other xenoestrogenic and estrogenic compounds have also been reported as direct activators of KCa channels in the micromolar range, suggesting a potential cardio-protective role of these compounds. This nongenomic effect of estrogen-related compounds has been attributed to the presence of the β1 subunit of the KCa channel (14Dick G.M. Rossow C.F. Smirnov S. Horowitz B. Sanders K.M. J. Biol.

Tamoxifen, however, has also been shown to have inhibitory effects on several potassium conductances in the cardiovascular system, such as IK1, Ito, Isus, and HERG (19He J. Kargacin M.E.

In KCa channels from canine colonic smooth muscle cells, tamoxifen and other derivatives were also reported to decrease KCa macroscopic currents, mainly due to a reduction in single channel conductance (15Dick G.M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The present study shows that tamoxifen can activate or inhibit native arterial KCa channels, depending on the level of channel activity. This study also demonstrates, with the use of animals with a targeted deletion of the KCa channel β1 subunit gene, that the dual effect of tamoxifen on arterial KCa channels is not conferred by the β1 subunit in native cerebral artery myocytes. Cell Isolation—Murine arterial smooth muscle cells were isolated as previously described (8Brenner R. Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Eckman D.M. Kosek J.C. Wiler S.W. Patterson A.J. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type C57Bl/6 (Black 6) mice and β1 subunit KO mice were used in the experiments. Adult mice (25–35 g; 3–8 months old) of either sex were euthanized by peritoneal injection of pentobarbital solution (150 mg/kg). The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR analysis of DNA obtained from mouse tails or blood samples following euthanization of the animals. Cerebral arteries were carefully dissected on ice and then digested with papain (0.3 mg/ml papain and 1 mg/ml dithioerythritol for 8 min at 37 °C) and collagenase (1 mg/ml collagenase type F and type H in a 70%:30% mixture, respectively, incubated for 7 min at 37 °C). The digested tissue was triturated with a fire polished glass Pasteur pipette to yield single smooth muscle cells. Cells were kept on ice until use. Single Channel Recordings—Single channel currents were recorded from excised membrane patches of isolated arterial myocytes in symmetrical solutions containing 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm Mg2+, 5 mm EGTA or HEDTA, and Ca2+ free concentration of 10 μm. For Ca2+ activation curves, bath solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA (or HEDTA pCa > 6), 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris base. Free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted with different amounts of CaCl2 calculated with MaxChelator software (C. Patton, Stanford University). Final free Ca2+ concentration was measured with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Single channel activity was recorded at steady potentials indicated in the text with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Currents were filtered at 2–5 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Solution Exchange—Fast solution exchange was performed with a multibarreled application pipette positioned in front of the patch pipette and switched with a remote-controlled piezoelectric device. Subsecond exchange time is normally achieved using this system (SF-77B Perfusion Fast Step; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–22 °C). Tamoxifen was dissolved in Me2SO. Control solutions contained this vehicle (1:10,000 Me2SO). Data Analysis and Statistics—Single channel data analysis was performed with Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments). Curve fitting and linear regression analyses were performed with Origin 6.1 software (Origin-Lab Corp., Northampton, MA). Concentration-response relationship for tamoxifen inhibition was fitted to a Hill equation of the following form: Inhibition = Inhibitionmax/(1 + (IC50/[Tamoxifen])NHill), where Inhibition is 1 – (Po tamoxifen/Po control), Po is the open probability of the channel in control conditions or in the presence of tamoxifen as indicated, Inhibitionmax is the maximal inhibition obtained, IC50 is the concentration of tamoxifen needed to obtain half-maximal inhibition, and [Tamoxifen] is the tamoxifen concentration used. Calcium activation curves were also fitted to a Hill equation of the following form: Po = Po max/(1 + (IC50/[Ca2+])NHill), where Po is the open probability of the channel, Po max is the maximal Po, IC50 is the concentration of Ca2+ needed to obtain half-maximal Po, and [Ca2+] is the Ca2+ concentration used. NHill is the Hill coefficient and represents the slope factor of the Hill equation. Voltage activation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann equation of following form: Po = Po max/(1 + exp(V – V½)/dV), where Po and Po max have the meaning described above, V is the holding potential, V½ is the voltage for half-maximal activation, and dV represents the slope factor. Unless indicated, data are presented by mean ± S.E. from n number of cells. Statistical analyses were made with paired and unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate. The threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical tests were run in Origin 6.1 and SigmaStat 2.03 (Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Tamoxifen Inhibits Arterial Smooth Muscle KCa Channels in the Presence or Absence of the β1 Subunit—Fig. 1 shows KCa single channel activity recorded in excised patches at 10 μm free Ca2+ concentration. Application of 5 μm tamoxifen to the bath promoted two types of changes in KCa channels from WT animals that are illustrated in Fig. 1A: a) a pronounced decrease in channel activity where NPo changes from 0.75 to 0.3; and b) a moderate reduction in single channel amplitude (from 10 to 9.3 pA) that was previously reported (15Dick G.M. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44835-44840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Dick G.M. Hunter A.C. Sanders K.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Corresponding all point histograms on the right illustrate both the change in activity and the small change in channel amplitude. These types of changes can also be observed in the absence of the β1 subunit (KO). Fig. 1B shows KCa channel activity from KO animals recorded, in this case, at +40 mV. Tamoxifen (5 μm) induced a decline in NPo (from 1.8 to 0.32) with a concomitant slight reduction in single channel amplitude (from 9.25 to 8.8 pA) that can be also observed in the corresponding all point histogram on the right. Fig. 1C summarizes the inhibitory effect of 5 μm tamoxifen on arterial KCa channel activity from both WT and β1 KO animals. Tamoxifen promoted a significant decrease in NPo (Fig. 1C, left panel) with respect to control conditions in WT KCa channels (46 ± 13% reduction, p < 0.05, n = 5, paired Student's t test) and also in β1 KO KCa channels (49 ± 8% reduction, p < 0.05, n = 9, paired Student's t test). Tamoxifen also induced a small reduction in the absolute single channel amplitude (Fig. 1C, right panel) from 9.97 ± 0.26 to 8.81 ± 0.26 pA in WT (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 5, paired Student's t test) and from 9.86 ± 0.22 to 8.61 ± 0.34 pA in KO (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 6, paired Student's t test). These findings showed that, besides a small reduction in channel amplitude, tamoxifen inhibition of KCa channel activity is the main inhibitory mechanism and that this inhibition is independent of the presence of the β1 subunit. Tamoxifen Inhibition of KCa Channels Is Concentration-dependent and Partially Reversible—Fig. 2A illustrates single channel activity at 10 μm Ca2+ and –40 mV holding potential from an inside-out patch containing three active channels from cerebral artery isolated myocytes from WT animals. KCa channel activity decreased with increasing concentrations of tamoxifen applied to the bath. Po goes from 0.89 in control to 0.87, 0.71, 0.56, 0.40, 0.20, and 0.17 with increasing tamoxifen concentrations of 0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 μm, respectively. Upon washout, the Po is partially restored from 0.17 at 20 μm tamoxifen to 0.47 in washout. This reversibility was observed in three more independent experiments. Fig. 2B shows the concentration-dependent inhibition curve of WT KCa channels obtained from eight different patches at –40 mV and 10 μm Ca2+. Patches included in this curve lasted long enough to be assayed at least for three different concentrations of tamoxifen. The experimental points were fitted to a Hill function (continuous line) with an NHill of 1.47, suggesting more than one site for interaction between tamoxifen and the KCa channel protein. The half-maximal concentration constant (IC50) obtained from the fit was 2.6 μm. Interestingly, analysis of the inhibition of single channel amplitude in the traces presented in Fig. 2A also shows a concentration-dependent behavior. The decay in single channel amplitude can be well fitted by a Hill function (data not shown). The values obtained for NHill and IC50 were 1.26 and 2.5 μm, respectively, very similar to the values obtained for the inhibition of the Po (1.47 and 2.6 μm, respectively, Fig. 2B). However, the maximum inhibition can only reach 20% compared with the 76% obtained for the Po (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that tamoxifen inhibition of arterial KCa channels is largely due to a novel mechanism that is concentration-dependent and reversible and decreases the activity of the channel. In addition, a concentration-dependent small reduction of single channel amplitude can also be observed. Tamoxifen Can Have a Dual Effect, Depending on the Level of KCa Channel Activity—To confront the present observations that tamoxifen reversibly inhibits KCa channels in a concentration-dependent manner with its well-documented activator effect on KCa channels (14Dick G.M.

Fig. 3B shows for WT membrane patches the KCa channel voltage activation curve obtained from 12 different experiments in the presence or absence of 5 μm tamoxifen at a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm. The solid lines represent the fitting of the data to a Boltzmann equation (see “Materials and Methods”). Under these high Ca2+ concentration conditions, the maximum open probability (Pomax) is 0.82 ± 0.01, half activation voltage (V½) is –39 ± 2 mV, and the slope factor (dV) of the fitted curve is 23 ± 2 mV. Under these conditions, tamoxifen did not significantly change the V½ (–38 ± 4 mV, p > 0.7, unpaired Student's t test) or the slope factor of the curve (25 ± 4 mV, p > 0.5, unpaired Student's t test), but it did significantly reduce the Po max of the WT KCa channels from 0.82 ± 0.01 to 0.49 ± 0.02 (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test). If external Ca2+ was reduced to 100 nm, KCa channel activity decreased dramatically, and the number of events to determine the Po of the channel with accuracy at hyperpolarized voltages was very low. Nonetheless, under these conditions, the tamoxifen activator effect can be detected at a holding potential of +80 mV, which is the maximum depolarized voltage tested without compromising the stability of the membrane patch. Under these conditions, the Po of the KCa channel increases from 0.038 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.3 (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, n = 7, p < 0.05, paired Student's t test). The dual effect of tamoxifen was illustrated for comparison at +80 mV in the paired experiment shown in Fig. 3A, in which KCa channel activity was inhibited by 5 μm tamoxifen at 10 μm Ca2+ concentration (from 0.6 to 0.43, control versus tamoxifen, respectively; 10 μm Ca2+) and activated by 5 μm tamoxifen at 100 nm Ca2+ concentration (from 0.016 to 0.075, control versus tamoxifen, respectively; 100 nm Ca2+). Single channel amplitude also diminished in the presence of tamoxifen (from 17.3 to 15.5 pA, control versus tamoxifen, respectively; 10 μm Ca2+). Similarly, at low Ca2+ concentrations, single channel amplitude was also diminished by the presence of tamoxifen (from 20.5 to 17.3 pA, control versus tamoxifen, respectively; 100 nm Ca2+). The dual effect of tamoxifen on WT KCa channels was also studied in an experimental series involving inside-out patches held at a single membrane potential (+40 mV) and tested at different intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Rapid solution exchange (see “Materials and Methods”) was used to expose the cytosolic side of the channels to several Ca2+ concentrations in the presence and absence of 5 μm tamoxifen. Fig. 4A illustrates original recordings of WT KCa channel activity in control conditions and in the presence of 5 μm tamoxifen. Recordings at concentrations of 100 and 300 nm Ca2+ showed an increase in KCa channel activity with the increase in Ca2+ concentration (2.1E-5 and 0.009, 100, and 300 nm Ca2+, respectively). Addition of 5 μm tamoxifen increased Po (0.0061 and 0.041) at both Ca2+ concentrations (100 and 300 nm Ca2+, respectively; 5 μm tamoxifen). The traces also show that tamoxifen was interacting with the channels present in the patch based on the reduction observed in single channel amplitude (from –10.4 to –8.4 pA, control versus tamoxifen, measured at 300 nm Ca2+). When the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 1 μm, channel activity still increased in control conditions with respect to the previous traces (at Ca2+ concentrations of 100 and 300 nm), but tamoxifen promoted a decrease in channel activity (from 0.51 to 0.28, control versus tamoxifen, respectively; 1 μm Ca2+). Fig. 4B shows Ca2+ activation curves obtained for group data from four similar experiments in the presence and absence of 5 μm tamoxifen. Experimental points were fitted to a Hill equation represented by the solid lines. A crossover of the fitted Hill curves can be observed, indicating that the overall effect of tamoxifen is indeed dependent on the level of KCa channel activity. Tamoxifen diminished the Po max from 0.75 ± 0.06 to 0.24 ± 0.02. (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test). Tamoxifen also changed the half-maximal activation constant from 700 to 270 nm intracellular Ca2+ (p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test). The NHill for Ca2+, however, remained ∼3 (2.7 versus 3, control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p > 0.9, unpaired Student's t test). The inset in Fig. 4B shows the same plot in a log-log scale to expand the changes observed at low Ca2+ and low Po values. These data indicated that tamoxifen reduces the maximum Po of the KCa channels, probably due to a channel block. In addition, tamoxifen also promoted a leftward shift in the Ca2+ activation curve of the channels. Single Channel Analysis Reveals That Tamoxifen Abbreviated Both Mean Closed Time (τc) and Mean Open Time (τo) in WT KCa Channels—Kinetic analysis of the effect of tamoxifen on WT KCa channels was performed in a subset of five experiments from Fig. 3B in which only one active channel was present in the membrane patches. Patches were studied at a Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm at several holding potentials (from –80 to + 80 mV). Fig. 5A (top panel) shows that in control conditions, single channel activity was evident at all the voltages studied. The addition of 5 μm tamoxifen to the bath solution promoted a decrease in single channel amplitude together with a decrease in single channel activity at voltages more positive than –40 mV. At more negative potentials (i.e. –60 and –80 mV), single channel openings appear to be more frequent. This change in activity is summarized in Fig. 5B (top right panel). Experimental points obtained in these five experiments were fitted to a Boltzmann function (solid lines). The plot shows that tamoxifen promotes a reduction in Po max (from 0.84 ± 0.02 to 0.53 ± 0.01, control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test) but does not significantly change V½ (–40 ± 2 versus –30.5 ± 8 mV, control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p > 0.2, unpaired Student's t test). However, a decrease in the slope of the Boltzmann function could be detected with tamoxifen in this subset of experiments. Slope factor changed from 17 ± 2to33 ± 7 mV (control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). This change most likely reflects the combined block and activation mechanisms of tamoxifen. Single channel amplitude was also reduced by tamoxifen (Fig. 5B, top left panel). Slope conductance changed from 227 ± 0.001 to 194 ± 0.002 picosiemens (15% reduction, control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test). Under control conditions, both τc and τo were found to vary with voltage. Fig. 5B (bottom left panel) shows that τc can be well described by the exponential function of the following form: τc = τc(0)exp(–V/C) (solid lines), where τc(0) represents the mean closed time constant at 0 mV, and C is a slope factor (in mV). Under control conditions, τc decreased e-fold by 26 mV, whereas in the presence of tamoxifen, τc decreased e-fold by 40 mV. Analysis of the kinetic changes promoted by tamoxifen in this experimental series revealed that tamoxifen-induced reduction in τc becomes significant at –80 mV (from 29.6 ± 5 to 11.6 ± 3 ms, control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). Tamoxifen, however, did not change τc(0) (1.3 ± 0.4 versus 1.5 ± 0.7 ms; control versus tamoxifen, respectively, p > 0.8, unpaired Student's t test). On the other hand, τo increased linearly with depolarization from 1.9 ms at –80 mV to 4.3 ms at +80 mV, with a slope from the linear regression (solid line) of 0.015 ms/mV (regression coefficient r = 0.99, p < 0.001). Addition of tamoxifen almost abolished the voltage dependence of τo that remained around 1.6 ms at every potential tested, ranging from a minimum of 1.2 ms to a maximum of 1.9 ms (Fig. 5B, bottom right panel). The linear regression after the addition of tamoxifen (solid line, r = 0.8, p < 0.02) showed a 7-fold decrease in the slope from 0.015 to 0.002 ms/mV (p < 0.03, unpaired Student's t test) These data indicated that tamoxifen induces a voltage-independent block of the channel, together with a destabilization of long-lived closed states present at hyperpolarized voltages. The Dual Effect of Tamoxifen Is Also Present in β1 KO KCa Channels—The absence of the β1 subunit in arterial KCa channels does not prevent tamoxifen inhibition of KCa channels as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The question remains whether the activator effect of tamoxifen can also be present in this preparation. To further explore the effect of tamoxifen, in the absence of the β1 subunit, a series of nine concentration-response experiments were conducted with excised membrane patches from β1 KO arterial myocytes at a single Ca2+ concentration (1 μm) and a single voltage (+40 mV). Under these conditions, individual variations in initial Po of the β1 KO KCa channel were observed. In four membrane patches with an initial Po of >0.3, application of increasing tamoxifen concentrations promoted a decrease in channel activity consistent with the initial observations made in Fig. 1 at a high Ca2+ concentration (10 μm). This tamoxifen concentration-dependent inhibition paralleled that observed in WT KCa channels. Fig. 6A shows that tamoxifen concentration-dependent inhibition of β1 KO KCa channels (black circles) closely matches the inhibition obtained with WT KCa channels (gray circles, same data points as in Fig. 2B). However, in the five remaining experiments in which the initial Po was <0.3, tamoxifen concentration response showed a biphasic pattern (black diamonds) with an initial increase in Po at low concentrations, followed by a decrease in activity that parallels the rest of the experimental points at higher tamoxifen concentrations. In three of those five experiments, the increase in activity peaked at 3 μm tamoxifen, whereas in the remaining two experiments, a peak in activity is observed at 5 μm tamoxifen. The overall average of these five remaining experiments did not show a significant change in Po; however, individual experiments showed biphasic behavior with tamoxifen. These data suggest that the concentration-dependent inhibition of KCa channels is conserved, even in the absence of the β1 subunit, and that at low channel activity, tamoxifen can produce a biphasic pattern. To further explore the observation about biphasic response to tamoxifen, an experimental series at nonsaturating cytosolic Ca2+ (1 μm"

The circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated the structure of the C-terminal α-helix was locally disrupted around the methylation site. The CD spectra differences were explained by assuming a helix disruption for four residues on each side of the site of methylation and taking into account the known dependence of CD on the length of an α-helix. Binding and adenylyl cyclase-stimulating data showed that outside of the α-helix, methylation of residues Asp30 and Val31 had little effect on structure or activities. Within the α-helix, disruption of the structure was associated with increased loss of activity, but for specific residues Val21, Leu24, Arg25, and Leu28 there was a dramatic loss of activities, thus suggesting a more direct role of these NH groups in correct P1R binding and activation. Activity analyses with P1R-delNT, a mutant with its long N-terminal region deleted, gave a different pattern of effects and implicated Ser17, Trp23, and Lys26 as important for its PTH activation. These two groups of residues are located on opposite sides of the helix. These results are compatible with the C-terminal helix binding to both the N-terminal segment and also to the looped-out extracellular region. These data thus provide direct evidence for important roles of the C-terminal domain of PTH in determining high affinity binding and activation of the P1R receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1966122324,"Predicting responsiveness to anticancer therapy based on molecular findings at diagnosis is important to optimize treatment decisions. Although clinical outcome correlates with distinct mutations in some cancer entities, treatment responses within these lesion-stratified subgroups still remain heterogeneous, underscoring the need for additional prognosticators. We previously demonstrated that defined genetic defects at the INK4a/ARF locus, which encodes the tumor suppressors p16INK4a and ARF, not only accelerated lymphomagenesis in the Eμ-myc transgenic mouse but also interfered with treatment sensitivity. In this study, we take a nonbiased genome-wide approach to examine whether the responsiveness of these lymphomas can be further stratified based on cytogenetic information at diagnosis. Indeed, using spectral karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 38 primary lymphomas, we find recurrent cytogenetic alterations that refine the predictive value of INK4a/ARF lesions on drug responses in vivo: gain of chromosome 14, which was never detected in INK4a/ARFnull lymphomas, defined an ARFnull subgroup with superior treatment outcome. Gain of chromosome 6 was identified as a recurrent chromosomal aberration that predisposed ARFnull tumors to their subsequent INK4a loss during therapy. These data illustrate how cytogenetic information from cancer specimens might complement established prognostic markers and may improve anticancer treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2054026497,"The cyclic peptide AF17121 is a library-derived antagonist for human interleukin-5 (IL5) receptor α (IL5Rα) and inhibits IL5 activity. Our previous results have demonstrated that the sixth arginine residue of the peptide is crucial for the inhibitory effect and that several acidic residues in the N- and C-terminal regions also make a contribution, although to a lesser extent (Ruchala, P., Varadi, G., Ishino, T., Scibek, J., Bhattacharya, M., Urbina, C., Van Ryk, D., Uings, I., and Chaiken, I. (2004) Biopolymers 73, 556–568). However, the recognition mechanism of the receptor has remained unresolved. In this study, AF17121 was fused to thioredoxin by recombinant DNA techniques and examined for IL5Rα interaction using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor method. Kinetic analysis revealed that the dissociation rate of the peptide·receptor complex is comparable with that of the cytokine·receptor complex. The fusion peptide competed with IL5 for both biological function and interaction with IL5Rα, indicating that the binding sites on the receptor are shared by AF17121 and IL5. To define the epitope residues for AF17121, we defined its binding footprint on IL5Rα by alanine substitution of Asp55, Asp56, Glu58, Lys186, Arg188, and Arg297 of the receptor. Marked effects on the interaction were observed in all three fibronectin type III domains of IL5Rα, in particular Asp55, Arg188, and Arg297 in the D1, D2, and D3 domains, respectively. This footprint represents a significant subset of that for IL5 binding. The fact that AF17121 mimics the receptor binding capability of IL5 but antagonizes biological function evokes several models for how IL5 induces activation of the multisubunit receptor system.

Asthma is an incurable disease characterized by eosinophil bronchial inflammation and tissue remodeling of the airway wall (1Busse W.W. Rosenwasser L.J. J. Allergy Clin.

Urwin D. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 1: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chung K.F. van Rensen E. Stirling R. Barnes P.J. Thorax. 2002; 57: 751Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Injection of IL5 increases eosinophil numbers in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cavities (4Fattah D. Quint D.J. Proudfoot A. O'Malley R. Zanders E.D. Champion B.R.

Immunol. 1991; 3: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This increase can be prevented by the passive administration of anti-IL5 or anti-IL5 receptor antibodies (5Hitoshi Y. Yamaguchi N. Korenaga M. Mita S. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Coffman R.L. Seymour B.W. Hudak S. Jackson J. Rennick D. Science. 1989; 245: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). One distinguishing characteristic of IL5 versus other cytokines is that IL5 functions selectively to activate eosinophils (7Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data argue that IL5 plays a central role in the development of allergen-induced eosinophils and suggest that the ability to block IL5 activity evokes the potential for alternative treatment for asthma. At the molecular level, IL5 leads to biological functions through recruitment of a cell-surface receptor composed of two polypeptide chains, α and β (8Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Fache I. Tuypens T. Fischkoff S. Fiers W. Devos R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The α chain is IL5-specific and is called IL5 receptor α (IL5Rα), whereas the β chain is shared with IL3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (9Tavernier J. Devos R.

Despite a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity of the α chains for IL5, IL3, and GM-CSF, their interaction with cognate cytokine is strictly specific, and no cross-reactivity is found among these cytokines. Previous observations argue that receptor subunit recruitment occurs stepwise, with initial formation of the IL5·IL5Rα complex required for βc binding to induce cytoplasmic signal transduction (12Scibek J.J. Evergren E. Zahn S. Canziani G.A. Van Ryk D. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). IL5Rα alone binds IL5 with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.8 nm when expressed in COS cells, and this binding affinity is increased by only 1.5-fold when α and β chains are coexpressed (13Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Wiedemann U.M. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10572-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, IL5Rα provides most of the binding energy and specificity for IL5, whereas βc is primarily responsible for signaling events. Putting these data together, the IL5-IL5Rα interaction can be seen as a promising target for designing specific inhibitors aimed at suppressing eosinophil-related inflammation. Extensive mutational analyses have identified recognition epitopes on both IL5 and IL5Rα, and the interaction can be envisioned by relating structure to function of these epitopes. IL5 is a symmetric homodimer in which each helical bundle domain is composed of three helices (A–C) from one chain and one (D) from the other (14Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R.

The binding epitope on IL5 for IL5Rα is mapped on the structure, showing the importance of charged residues in helix B (His38, Lys39, and His41), the CD turn (Glu88, Glu89, Arg90, and Arg91), and helix D (Glu110) for IL5Rα binding (15Morton T.

For βc binding and signal transduction, Glu13 in helix A is thought to be a key residue (17Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Verhee A. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. Oefner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). IL5Rα comprises three fibronectin type III domains (D1, D2, and D3) in the extracellular region, and the membrane-proximal pair of D2 and D3 domains constitutes a cytokine recognition motif that generally can be recognized by a cytokine (18Goodall G.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the IL5-binding residues are located in the D1 domain (Asp55, Asp56, and Glu58) as well as in the D2 domain (Lys186 and Arg188) and the D3 domain (Arg297) of IL5Rα (19Ishino T. Pasut G. Scibek J. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9547-9556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The homology-deduced IL5Rα structure indicates that the binding interface of IL5Rα comprises a cluster of negatively charged residues from the D1 domain and a cluster of positively charged residues from the D2D3 tandem domain. From these observations, we have proposed the hypothesis that a pair of charge complementary interfaces plays an important role in the specific interaction between IL5 and IL5Rα. Mimetic peptide methodology has led to the discovery of specific inhibitors for the IL5-IL5Rα interaction. A potent disulfide-cyclized 18-mer peptide, AF17121, inhibits the binding of IL5 to IL5Rα and blocks IL5-dependent eosinophil activation (20England B.P. Balasubramanian P. Uings I. Bethell S. Chen M.J. Schatz P.J. Yin Q. Chen Y.F. Whitehorn E.A. Tsavaler A. Martens C.L. Barrett R.W. McKinnon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6862-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using mutational analysis of AF17121, we have recently found that the sixth arginine residue plays a crucial role in the antagonist effect and that N/C-terminal acidic residues make a finite but lesser contribution (21Ruchala P. Varadi G. Ishino T. Scibek J. Bhattacharya M. Urbina C. Van Ryk D. Uings I. Chaiken I. Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although AF17121 proved to be a specific antagonist of IL5Rα, showing the importance of its charged clusters for its antagonism, the binding mechanism for IL5Rα, including the binding epitopes on the receptor, has remained incomplete. The purpose of this study was to elucidate these mechanistic features of AF17121 by kinetic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis with IL5Rα. To enhance the solubility and binding signal of the peptide in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, we employed a recombinant system to fuse the peptide to a highly soluble protein, thioredoxin. We used thioredoxin-fused AF17121 for kinetic interaction analysis with soluble IL5Rα (sIL5Rα; extracellular domain of IL5Rα) (22Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as well as for biological inhibition assays. Alanine substitution of the two half-cystine residues in AF17121 completely impaired its binding to IL5Rα and its corresponding inhibitory action on cells. Furthermore, we used SPR binding analysis of sIL5Rα alanine-scanning mutational variants to explore the functional impact of each amino acid on the kinetic interaction of the receptor with AF17121. Despite the small size of the peptide, marked effects on the interaction were observed in the entire IL5Rα footprint for IL5. The revealed mechanism of cytokine mimicry simplifies the complexity of the IL5-IL5Rα interaction and evokes several models for how IL5 induces activation of the multisubunit receptor system. Human IL5 and human sIL5Rα proteins were produced and purified as described previously (12Scibek J.J. Evergren E. Zahn S. Canziani G.A. Van Ryk D. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse IL3 protein was purchased from Sigma. Anti-human IL5Rα monoclonal antibody α16 was a generous gift from Dr. Jan Tavernier (University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium). All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The mouse BaF3 cell line was purchased from German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). All DNA oligonucleotide primers, Drosophila S2 cells, cell culture medium, l-glutamine solution (200 mm), and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Invitrogen. For SPR measurements, the CM5 sensor chip, surfactant P20, N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5), and 10 mm glycine HCl (pH 1.5 and 2.0) were purchased from Biacore (Piscataway, NJ). The DNA sequence of the AF17121 peptide (see Fig. 1A) was designed using the Escherichia coli K12 codon usage tabulated from the GenBank™ Data Bank (CUTG) (23Nakamura Y. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for this study were as follows: 5′-CATGGTTGACGAATGCTGGCGTATCATCGCTTCCCACACCTGGTTCTGCGCTGAAGAATGAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTCATTCTTCAGCGCAGAACCAGGTGTGGGAAGCGATGATACGCCAGCATTCGTCACC-3′. Annealing was achieved with 10 nmol of sense and antisense oligonucleotides in 100 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). The reaction mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and at 65 °C for 10 min and then was allowed to cool slowly at room temperature for 1 h. The double-stranded fragment was ligated to expression vector pET-32b (Novagen) that had been digested with NcoI and HindIII. The resulting plasmid was named pTRXaf17. In this construct, the gene for thioredoxin, a hexahistidine tag, the S·Tag peptide, an enterokinase cleavage site, and AF17121 sequence (from the N to C terminus) were placed behind the T7 promoter. The amino acid sequence of the final product (denoted thioredoxin (trx)-AF17121) is shown in Fig. 1B. For the Cys-to-Ala variant (denoted trx-AF17121(AA)) at positions 4 and 15 (numbering as in the AF17121 peptide), mutations were introduced into pTRXaf17 with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the synthetic DNA oligonucleotide 5′-GTTGACGAAGCCTGGCGTATCATCGCTTCCCACACCTGGTTCGCCGCTGAAGAA-3′ as the forward primer and its reverse complementary sequence as the reverse primer. The presence of the desired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. For production of trx-AF17121, plasmid pTRXaf17 was transformed into the host strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). The transformed cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C, and expression was initiated by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to A600 nm = 0.8. After 3 h, cells were harvested and frozen at –20 °C. The frozen cell paste was suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride)/1 g of wet cells, followed by sonication for 20 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then loaded onto a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Any nonspecific binding proteins were washed away with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl), and the fusion peptide was eluted with a linear gradient from buffer A to buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 300 mm imidazole). The protein fraction was diluted five times in redox buffer (1 mm reduced glutathione, 10 mm oxidized glutathione, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)) and stirred to allow disulfide bond formation (24 h, 4 °C). The protein solution was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and then loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer C. The fused protein was located in the 0.1–0.2 m NaCl fraction. The buffer of the purified protein fraction was exchanged with phosphate-buffered saline (1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl (pH 7.4)) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting protein solution was stored below –80 °C. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–20% linear gradient gel; Bio-Rad). The Cys mutant trx-AF17121(AA) and thioredoxin protein were produced and purified in the same manner as described for trx-AF17121, except for the oxidation process. The original expression vector (pET-32b) was used for production of thioredoxin. The purity of the fusion peptides was evaluated by analytical reverse phase HPLC using a 4.6 × 250-mm 218 TP C18 silica gel-packed column (Vydac) and a linear gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O solution over 50 min (flow rate of 1 ml/min). The integrity of the fusion peptides was certified by MALDI mass spectrometry (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Protein quantitation was achieved by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and calculating the concentration using the molar absorption coefficient (ϵ280 = 25,230 m–1 cm–1) according to Pace et al. (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The amount of free cysteine residues in trx-AF17121 and trx-AF17121(AA) was measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) (25Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Protein (0.3 μm) and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (1 mm) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm EDTA. The absorbance at 412 nm was measured, and the moles of sulfhydryl group were determined using the extinction coefficient of oxidized 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (ϵ412 = 13,600 m–1 cm–1). The reactivity of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with the buffer was subtracted from the results obtained. The number of sulfhydryl groups/molecule was then corrected using a standard curve obtained with reduced glutathione. The apparent molecular masses and oligomeric states of trx-AF17121 proteins were evaluated using an HPLC system with a 7.8 × 300-mm BioSep-SEC-S-2000 size exclusion analytical column (Phenomenex) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The column was calibrated with standards of known molecular mass (Amersham Biosciences). Linear regression of log10(molecular mass) versus elution volume of the standard was used to extrapolate the apparent molecular masses of the fusion peptides. sIL5Rα and its mutational variants (D55A, D56A, E58A, K186A, R188A, and R297A) were transiently expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and secreted into serum-free medium as described previously (19Ishino T. Pasut G. Scibek J. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9547-9556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cell-free supernatant was collected after 2 days and stored at –20 °C for the following binding analysis. The kinetic interaction assay was carried out using an SPR biosensor (Biacore 3000, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were conducted at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.005% surfactant P20. Noncovalent Immobilization of IL5Rα and Binding Assay of the Fusion Peptides—The conformation-sensitive anti-IL5Rα monoclonal antibody α16 (26Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Verhee A. Brusselle G. Van Ostade X. Vandekerckhove J. North J. Rankin S.M. Kay A.B. Robinson D.S. Blood. 2000; 95: 1600-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and sIL5Rα was captured by the antibody as described previously (19Ishino T. Pasut G. Scibek J. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9547-9556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of trx-AF17121 or trx-AF17121(AA) were passed over the antibody-captured sIL5Rα surface. To examine the interaction of sIL5Rα mutational variants with trx-AF17121, each receptor mutant was captured to a level of almost 200 resonance units (RU). Covalent Immobilization of Fusion Peptides and Binding Assay of IL5Rα—Immobilization of trx-AF17121 and trx-AF17121(AA) on a CM5 sensor chip was carried out by the amine coupling method as recommended by Biacore. Briefly, ∼10 μm protein solution was diluted 50 times in 10 mm acetate (pH 4.0) and injected onto a biosensor surface that had been pre-activated by a 20-μl injection of a 1:1 mixture of 200 mmN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 50 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide, followed by an injection of 1 m ethanolamine HCl (pH 8.5). The levels of immobilization were ∼200 RU. The real-time interaction was measured by injecting purified sIL5Rα onto these surfaces. The thioredoxin-coupled surface was used as a reference surface to correct for instrument and buffer artifacts. To regenerate chip surfaces, bound proteins were removed from the surfaces by an injection of 10 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.0) after each cycle. All procedures were automated to create repetitive cycles of injection of various concentrations of sIL5Rα (flow rate of 50 μl/min) and the regeneration buffer (flow rate of 100 μl/min). Data Analysis—Nonlinear least-squares analysis was used to calculate the association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff, respectively). Prior to the calculation, the binding data were corrected for nonspecific interaction by subtracting the reference surface data from the reaction surface data and were further corrected for buffer effect by subtracting the signal due to buffer injections from those due to protein sample injections (double referencing) (27Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The interaction curves thus obtained were globally fit using a model for 1:1 Langmuir binding (BIAevaluation software, Biacore). Individual kinetic parameters were obtained from at least three separate experiments. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as Kd = koff /kon. Control Experiments for the Mass Transfer Effect on the Biosensor—To assess the effect of the amount of immobilization on the apparent reaction rate constants, different injection times were used to vary the level of immobilization of sIL5Rα. Various amounts of sIL5Rα were captured by antibody α16 on the surface, and 40 nm trx-AF17121 solutions were passed over each amount of immobilized sIL5Rα. The binding data were collected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The effect of the flow rate on the apparent reaction rate constants was also assessed. The amount of sIL5Rα captured by antibody α16 on the sensor chip was fixed at 130 RU, and 40 nm trx-AF17121 solutions were passed over immobilized sIL5Rα. The binding data were collected at flow rates of 10, 20, 40, and 80 μl/min. The effectiveness of trx-AF17121 and trx-AF17121(AA) in inhibiting the IL5-IL5Rα interaction was evaluated by two types of competition experiments. The first set of experiments measured the ability of the fusion peptides to compete with IL5 binding to sIL5Rα as described previously (21Ruchala P. Varadi G. Ishino T. Scibek J. Bhattacharya M. Urbina C. Van Ryk D. Uings I. Chaiken I. Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For this competition assay, 4 nm sIL5Rα in the absence and presence of different concentrations of trx-AF17121 or trx-AF17121(AA) was passed over the IL5-captured surface (∼200 RU). The second set of experiments measured the ability of IL5 to compete with trx-AF17121 binding to sIL5Rα. In this experiment, trx-AF17121 was directly immobilized on a CM5 sensor surface as described above. sIL5Rα (80 nm) was passed over this surface in the absence and presence of different concentrations of IL5 or trx-AF17121. The concentration of sIL5Rα in each experiment was set close to the Kd value for the interaction of IL5Rα with IL5 or AF17121 (see below). The maximum binding response (Rmax) of the IL5-IL5Rα interaction under the influence of trx-AF17121 was calculated by globally fitting the association and dissociation phases of sensorgrams. Fits were to a 1:1 Langmuir model. Data analysis was conducted using the BIAevaluation program and Microsoft Excel. Inhibitory effects of the peptides resulting in decreases in Rmax values are expressed as ΔRUeq; maximum inhibitory effects are expressed as ΔRUmax; and peptide concentration is expressed as C.IC50 values were calculated from the following equation: IC50 = (C(ΔRUmax – ΔRUeq))/ΔRUeq. Upon rearrangement, ΔRUeq/C = ΔRUmax/IC50 – ΔRUeq/IC50. A plot of ΔRUeq/C against ΔRUeq at different peptide concentrations thus gave a straight line from which the IC50 value was obtained. The assay was carried out using the human IL5-dependent erythroleukemia cell line TF1.28 and the mouse IL3-dependent pro-B lymphocyte cell line BaF3. Both TF1.28 and BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10 nm human IL5 or 10 nm mouse IL3, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured using the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-(3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio)-1,3-benzene disulfonate; Roche Diagnostics). 96-Well plates were seeded at 5000 cells/well and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 pm IL5 for the TF1.28 cells or 2.5 pm IL3 for the BaF3 cells with different concentrations of trx-AF17121 or trx-AF17121(AA). Following the 48-h incubation, 10 μl of soluble WST-1 was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The plate was then read using a microplate reader at an absorbance of 450 nm with a 650-nm reference. Individual values were obtained from three experiments, and the average values were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). Design, Production, and Characterization of Thioredoxinfused AF17121—AF17121 showed inhibitory effects on IL5 function and proved to be a promising lead for rational drug design as reported previously (20England B.P. Balasubramanian P. Uings I. Bethell S. Chen M.J. Schatz P.J. Yin Q. Chen Y.F. Whitehorn E.A. Tsavaler A. Martens C.L. Barrett R.W. McKinnon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To elucidate the detailed mechanism of these effects, we first carried out an interaction assay using the AF17121 synthetic peptide by SPR-based technology. Because the binding signal in SPR biosensor analysis is proportional to the molecular mass of the interacting species, it is often difficult to detect signals from low molecular mass peptides. Enhancing the binding signal can be achieved by increasing the amounts of immobilized protein. However, large amounts of immobilization often cause non-ideal effects such as mass transfer, rebinding, crowding, and steric hindrance, which may result in deviations from ideal binding data. In the case of the AF17121 synthetic peptide, we could not observe its binding signal on a surface immobilized with a relevant amount of sIL5Rα (data not shown). To overcome the signal sensitivity limitation and to eliminate these artifacts in SPR-based biosensors, we used a recombinant system to fuse the peptide (2 kDa) to thioredoxin. Because the final product has a molecular mass of 19 kDa, 10-fold enhancement of the binding signal can be expected. The reason we chose thioredoxin as a fusion partner is that thioredoxin is known to be overexpressed in bacteria without formation of inclusion bodies (28LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is also advantageous for biophysical experiments because the protein is stable to heat and highly soluble. We designed and produced a fusion peptide that consists of thioredoxin, hexahistidine, the S·Tag peptide, and AF17121 sequence from the N to C terminus (Fig. 1B). To investigate the importance of the disulfide-bonded cyclic structure in AF17121, we also designed mutant trx-AF17121(AA), in which Cys4 and Cys15 were replaced with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant protein was expressed in high yield, and the content of the protein was estimated to be half of the total cell protein judging from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). After sonication and ultracentrifugation, the"

(2001) FEBS Lett. 494, 6–10) has pointed to residues in transmembrane segment M4 as being important for proton translocation by P-type proton pumps. To test this model, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was carried out through 12 residues in the M4 of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2. An I282A mutation showed apparent reduced H+ affinity, and this residue was subsequently substituted with all other naturally occurring amino acids by saturation mutagenesis. The ability of mutant enzymes to substitute for the yeast proton pump PMA1 was found to correlate with the size of the side chain rather than its chemical nature. Thus, smaller side chains (Gly, Ala, and Ser) at this position resulted in lower H+ affinity and lowered levels of H+ transport in vivo, whereas substitution with side chains of similar and larger size resulted in only minor effects. Substitutions of Ile-282 had only minor effects on ATP affinity and sensitivity toward vanadate, ruling out an indirect effect through changes in the enzyme conformational equilibrium. These results are consistent with a model in which the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile-282 contributes directly to proton translocation. Homology models of plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Bukrinsky, J. T., Buch-Pedersen, M. J., Larsen, S., and Palmgren, M. G.

These results are consistent with a model in which the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile-282 contributes directly to proton translocation. Plasma membrane proton ATPases are vital proteins for plant and fungal life. These pumps are responsible for ATP-fueled ejection of protons out of the cell and establish the essential proton and electrical gradient across plant and fungal plasma membranes. Phylogenetically, plasma membrane proton ATPases belong to a large group of proteins termed P-type ATPases. Common for P-type ATPases is the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate during catalysis, inhibition by vanadate, and a common domain structure with typically 10 transmembrane helices and a large cytoplasmic extension (1Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Cation transport by the membranous part of the protein is coupled to ATP splitting taking place in the cytoplasmic part of the protein. Members of the P-type ATPase family are localized in a variety of membrane systems and transport cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cd2+ (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The mammalian Na+/K+-and Ca2+-ATPases, together with plant and fungal plasma membrane H+-ATPases, are among the best investigated P-type ATPases. In addition to the plant and fungal plasma membrane proton ATPases, other P-type pumps can catalyze proton translocation. Thus, both Ca2+-ATPases (3Yu X. Carroll S. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and H+/K+-ATPases (4Sachs G. Munson K. Balaji V.N. Aures-Fischer D. Hersey S.J. Hall K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) transport protons during their catalytic cycle; the H+/K+-ATPases transport in the same direction as the plasma membrane H+-ATPases, and the Ca2+-ATPases transport the opposite way. Still, the mechanism of proton transport and the nature of the transported species (H+/H3O+) is yet to be described for any proton-translocating P-type ATPase (5Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Hydrogen ions differ qualitatively from the other cations transported by P-type ATPases (6Briskin D.P. Hanson J.B. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 269-289Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). First, hydrogen ions have no free existence as naked ions in solution where they are found as hydrated proton molecules in the form of the hydronium ion complex (H3O+). Second, protons have a very high mobility in aqueous solution along proton wires, hydrogen-bonded networks of water molecules allowing for fast proton conductance. Currently described proton-translocating proteins have taken advantage of this capability of protons to propagate along hydrogen-bonded networks involving e.g. an ordered chain of protonable amino acid side chain groups, prosthetic groups, and/or water molecules (7Lanyi J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31209-31212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12819-12824Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The transport mechanism of P-type ATPases has been described as an alternating access mechanism in which one or more cation coordination centers change affinity for the transported ion(s) (1Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In these coordination centers, the transported cations get tightly bound within the membrane sector of the protein during catalysis in a process termed occlusion. The nature of such a P-type ATPase coordination center is most clearly seen in the high resolution structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in which oxygen atoms from both the side chains and the main chain carbonyls provide liganding groups for the coordination of two calcium ions (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Provided that all P-type ATPases share a common mechanism for transport of ions, it would be expected that proton-translocating P-type ATPases form proton coordination centers during catalysis. In such a scenario, the transported proton is likely to get occluded during catalysis in the form of a hydronium ion in a specific high affinity hydronium ion coordination center (5Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). No hydronium coordination center in a protein has been described to date, but high affinity hydronium ion coordination centers have been demonstrated in specific crown ether structures (11Behr J.P. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4540-4543Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Bühl M. Wipff G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4473-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in which the hydronium ion is coordinated by the use of hydrogen bonds. Based upon the Ca2+-bound sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase crystal structure, homology models of the Arabidopsis thaliana AHA2 H+-ATPase (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae PMA1 H+-ATPase (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the Neurospora crassa PMA1 H+-ATPase (14Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have been presented. In the region corresponding to the calcium binding sites of the Ca2+-ATPase, only a single charged amino acid residue seems to be strictly conserved between these pumps (Asp-684AHA2, Asp-730PMA1, and Asp-800SERCA1a) (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The carboxylate side chain of Asp-684AHA2 has previously been demonstrated to be essential for translocation of protons (15Buch-Pedersen M.J. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase the corresponding residue is liganding both of the bound calcium ions (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). In the structure of Ca2+-ATPase, a region of M4 is unwound that allows for liganding backbone carbonyl oxygens to be provided to calcium binding site IIA (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Unwinding of M4, supported by conserved Pro residues, has been proposed to be a characteristic feature of P-type ATPases (16Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 665-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the homology model of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2, this proposed unwound part of M4 seems spatially close to the essential Asp-684AHA2 (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to whether backbone carbonyl groups of M4 in the P-type H+-ATPases, in combination with other liganding groups such as Asp-684AHA2, participate directly in the proton transport process. In an effort to illuminate this question, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role in proton transport of residues in M4 of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Expression in Yeast—The S. cerevisiae strain RS-72 was transformed and cultured essentially as described previously (17Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lenfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). In RS-72 the natural constitutive promoter of the endogenous yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, PMA1, has been replaced by the galactose-dependent promoter of GAL1. Because PMA1 is essential for yeast growth, this strain only grows on galactose medium. By using the RS-72 yeast strain, we can test plant H+-ATPases brought under the control of the constitutive PMA1 promoter for their ability to rescue pma1 mutants on glucose medium. In this study a plant H+-ATPase devoid of 73 COOH-terminal amino acids, aha2Δ73, was used because it is constitutively active and complements pma1 mutations well (18Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complementation tests were as reported previously (17Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lenfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown and harvested, and microsomal membranes were isolated as described (17Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lenfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). Pma1 Complementation Test in Yeast—Yeast was grown for 3 days at 30 °C in liquid medium containing 2% galactose. Approximately 250 cells in 10 μl were spotted onto minimal media plates containing either 2% galactose at pH 5.5 or 2% glucose at pH values of 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5. Growth was recorded after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. ATPase Assay—ATPase activities were determined as described previously (17Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lenfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar, 20Venema K. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19659-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For determination of Km(ATP), 0.25 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase were added to the ATPase reaction medium to regenerate ATP, keeping the ATP concentration constant. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (0.2 μm) was also included in the reaction medium. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C, and 4.0 μg of proteoliposome protein was added to start the reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min. The rate of NADH oxidation (proportional to the hydrolysis of ATP) was measured during a 3-min period as the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Membrane fractions were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrotransfer of the proteins to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), protein blots were probed with an antibody against the MRGSH6 tag present at the COOH terminus (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glucose-dependent H+ Extrusion from Yeast Cells—Proton efflux from yeast cells expressing different H+-ATPases was measured by means of a computer-controlled pH-stat system (22Baunsgaard L. Venema K.

Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 400-408Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Alanine Scanning of Transmembrane Segment 4 —A typical feature of the SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase is that M4 is partially unwound, exposing backbone carbonyl oxygens that are used for ion coordination (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Thus, in SERCA1a, one of the two Ca2+ ions bound sits on a saddle composed of three carbonyl oxygens in M4, namely Val-304, Ala-305, and Ile-307, and is being fixed in position by the side chains of other residues, Glu-309 in M4, and Asn-796 and Asp-800 in M6 (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 this part of M4 is aligned with the similar region of plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases. In homology models of plasma membrane H+-ATPase (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) it was proposed that carbonyl oxygens situated in the middle of M4 contribute directly to coordination of the transported proton species. To test this model, we studied the functional consequences of mutagenizing all residues in the region from Leu-278 to Met-289 in AHA2, an Arabidopsis plasma membrane H+-ATPase. In the yeast strain RS-72, the yeast endogenous plasma membrane H+-ATPase, PMA1, is under control of a GAL1 promoter at the chromosomal level. Because PMA1 is essential for yeast growth, RS-72 can only grow on a galactose medium. Using this strain, plasmid-borne plant H+-ATPases, under the control of the constitutive PMA1 promoter and constitutively activated by removal at the gene level of autoinhibitory sequences, can be tested for their ability to rescue pma1 mutants on a glucose medium (18Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Only for three mutations (P286A, G284A, and I282A) could a lowered ability to complement pma1 be identified (Fig. 2). The low degree of complementation for the P286AAHA2 mutant protein (Fig. 2) indicates that Pro-286 in the plant proton pump could play a similar structural role as that seen in other investigated P-type ATPases. Mutagenesis of Pro-422 of the human plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 4 (PMCA4), corresponding to Pro-286 of AHA2, results in loss of the ability of PMCA4 to transport Ca2+ and to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate (25Guerini D. Foletti D. Vellani F. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When the corresponding Pro residues of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and the yeast PMA1 proton pump are mutated, these enzymes have only residual activity (26Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The P335APMA1 mutant protein hydrolyzes ATP to 22% of the wild type enzyme and has a very low level of proton pumping (27Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As the phenotype of P286A mutation could result from indirect effects due to the special properties of Pro, this mutation was not analyzed further. When pH dependence profiles for G284A and I282A mutants were investigated, only the I282A mutant demonstrated a changed pH dependence compared with that of the wild type H+-ATPase (Fig. 3). A G284A mutation did not show any apparent change in H+ dependence (Fig. 3). The fact that a higher proton concentration was required for optimal activity could imply that the affinity of the enzyme for the transported H+ has decreased. To further investigate the role of Ile-282 in the proton pumping mechanism of AHA2, this residue was chosen for further study. It seemed unlikely that the side chain of this residue could be involved in proton coordination. Homology models (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested that the carbonyl oxygen of Ile-282 is part of a proton binding site. Because it is not possible by a conventional mutagenesis approach to modify carbonyl oxygens, a saturated mutagenesis analysis approach was chosen. The rationale was that modification of the size of the side chain would influence the position of the carbonyl oxygen and, in this way, possibly interfere with its role in the pump mechanism. Expression of Ile-282 Substituted H+-ATPases in Yeast—Ile-282 was substituted with all other naturally occurring amino acids, and the resulting mutant proteins were expressed in yeast (Fig. 4). To compare the expression levels of the different Ile-282 substituted H+-ATPases, yeast microsomal proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4A) and immunoblotted for specific detection of the heterologous plant membrane protein (Fig. 4B). All recombinant ATPases were found to be expressed, but lower accumulation levels were repeatedly seen for the I282D, I282P, I282H, I282K, and I282R mutant proteins compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 4B) suggesting that substitution of Ile-282 with Asp, Pro, and most charged residues affects the biosynthesis of the mutant protein, resulting in significantly reduced expression levels. In contrast, replacement of Ile-282 in all other cases resulted in expression levels comparable with that of the wild type. Replacement of Ile-282 With Other Amino Acid Residues Does Not Alter Important Kinetic Parameters—A change in the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformational states would influence not only the apparent H+ affinity of the enzyme but also ATP binding and sensitivity toward vanadate, an inhibitor that binds specifically to the E2 conformation. The Km(ATP) for all mutants were comparable with that of the wild type H+-ATPase (Km ≈ 100 to 200 μm; Fig. 5A and Table I). The affinity for vanadate for the unsubstituted protein and the mutant proteins were more or less identical (Ki between 2 and 4 μm; Fig. 5B). Taken together, this would suggest that any major E1-E2 conformational disequilibrium has not taken place in the mutant proteins.Table IBiochemical characteristics of wild type and Ile-282 single point-substituted plant H+-ATPasesH+-ATPase proteinSpecific activityVanadate sensitivityaIC50 values were determined for vanadate sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis.Km(ATP)μmol min-1 mg-1 proteinμmμmI2820.31 ± 0.102.4 ± 0.10130 ± 15I282G0.064.0220I282A0.473.1220I282S0.432.3240I282C0.332.1250I282V0.311.8150I282T0.351.3200I282L0.075.8140I282N0.491.3150I282E0.211.778I282Q0.441.5170I282M0.401.1120I282F0.124.5100I282Y0.139.5110I282W0.245.1<50a IC50 values were determined for vanadate sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis. Open table in a new tab The pH Dependence of ATP Hydrolysis for the Plant H+-ATPase Shows More Acidic pH Profiles When Ile-282 Is Replaced With Smaller Amino Acid Residues—To investigate the pH dependence for Ile-282 substituted H+-ATPases, the level of ATP hydrolysis in the microsomal membrane fraction was studied between pH 6.0 and 7.7. As is characteristic for P-type H+-ATPases, the pH profiles of ATP hydrolysis were bell-shaped (Fig. 6). The unsubstituted plant H+-ATPase had a pH optimum of ∼6.9 (Fig. 6A). In cases where Ile-282 had been replaced by a smaller amino acid residue (Gly, Ala, Ser, and Cys), the pH optimum was shifted toward a more acidic value of 6.6 (Fig. 6A). For H+-ATPases with a slightly larger amino acid residue (Val or Thr) in place of Ile-282, the pH optimum was determined to be 6.7 (Fig. 6A). The pH optima for ATP hydrolysis of other investigated Ile-282 substituted H+-ATPases were similar to that of the wild type H+-ATPase (Figs. 6, B and C). Thus, the pH dependence of proteins substituted at position Ile-282 and, thus, their proton affinity seems to be related to the size of the side chain rather than its chemical nature. Ability of H+-ATPase Ile-282 Substitutions to Complement pma1 Yeast Mutants—The Ile-282 substitutions were investigated in a growth test of transformed pma1 yeast mutants (Fig. 7). No complementation was observed when Ile-282 was substituted with a Pro residue (Fig. 7). In addition, positively charged amino acid residues introduced at this position eliminated the ability of the mutant enzymes to substitute for PMA1 (Fig. 7). Substitution with the negatively charged residue Asp likewise had a strong negative effect on yeast growth in this system. Furthermore, relatively small amino acid residues (Gly, Ala or Ser) as replacements for Ile-282 caused less efficient complementation of pma1 by AHA2. All other Ile-282 substitutions were able to support yeast growth in the absence of PMA1 (Fig. 7). The specific H+-ATPase activity of isolated membranes was typically 0.3 μmol min–1 mg–1 protein for Ile-282 with comparable activities for mutant enzymes, except for Lys, Asp, Arg, Leu, Gly, Pro, and His substitutions that reproducibly showed reduced activity. There was, in general, good correlation between the ATP hydrolytic activities measured in isolated membranes and the ability of mutant pumps to substitute for yeast Pma1p. However, the I282L and I282G substitutions supported yeast growth well (Fig. 7) but showed very little ATPase activity in vitro (Table I). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but could be related to reduced stability of these mutants during the membrane purification process. The Lowered Proton Affinity of H+-ATPases With Small Amino Acids Introduced at Position Ile-282 Is Accompanied by Lowered Proton-transporting Capabilities—To investigate the correlation between the biochemical assays performed with the reconstituted protein and the ability to complement pma1, we measured proton extrusion from intact yeast cells expressing plant I282G, I282A, and I282S H+-ATPases (Fig. 8). Compared with the I282 enzyme, lower rates of H+ efflux were observed for the I282G, I282A, and I282S proton pumps (Fig. 8) even though kinetic parameters were difficult to ascertain in this assay. Alanine-scanning of Residues in M4 of the Plant Plasma Membrane H+-ATPase—In the investigated region of M4 of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 that stretches from Leu-278 to Met-289 (Fig. 1), only three amino acid residues, Gly 284, Pro-286, and Ile-282, seemed to influence proton pumping (Fig. 2). Among these residues, Ile-282 appeared as a potential proton-coordinating candidate, because the I282A substitution has apparent reduced H+ affinity (Fig. 3). Consequently, this residue was investigated in more detail. To more deeply investigate the role of Ile-282 in the proton pumping mechanism of AHA2, we substituted this residue with all naturally occurring amino acids. Yeast cells expressing H+-ATPases with a small amino acid residue (Gly, Ala, or Ser) as a replacement for Ile-282 showed less efficient complementation as compared with the wild type H+-ATPase, and purified recombinant mutants showed a shift toward more acidic pH profiles for ATP hydrolysis, as expected for a decreased affinity for protons. From our data it appears that at this position the size of the side chain, rather than its chemical properties, determines proton affinity. These substitutions do not exhibit any large change in conformational equilibrium, which would suggest that the effects on H+ affinities are direct rather than indirect. Role of Homologous Residues in Other P-type ATPases—Our analysis has identified Ile-282AHA2 in the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase as belonging to a novel mutant phenotype with decreased H+ affinity but no indication of a shift in the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium. The residue has not been systematically analyzed in other P-type pumps, but structure-function studies have been initiated. In the rabbit muscle sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum, Ca2+-ATPase SERCA1 mutations of the residue corresponding to Ile-282AHA2, Val-304SERCA1, results in mutant proteins with either decreased (V304LSERCA1) or increased (V304ASERCA1) Ca2+ affinities (28Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18359-18364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of M4 in the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase Pma1p resulted in the identification of three groups of mutated proteins with altered properties (27Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Group 1 consists of mutant enzymes defective in biogenesis, group 2 encompasses mutants with reduced ATPase but no apparent changes in kinetic parameters, and group 3 involves mutant enzymes with a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the E1 form with high affinity for ATP and an alkaline pH optimum. The residue in Pma1p corresponding to Ile-282AHA2 is Ile-331PMA1, which was classified as a group 2 enzyme (27Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have no explanation for this apparent discrepancy, although it has to be stressed that in Pma1p only an I331A mutant was analyzed. In the Na+/K+-ATPase the corresponding residue, Val-329NaK, could be altered to a Cys without any detectable changes in protein function (29Horisberger J-D. Kharoubi-Hess S. Guennoun S. Michielin O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29542-29550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). How Could Ile-282 of the Plant H+-ATPase Be Involved in Proton Translocation?—The three-dimensional model of the putative H3O+ coordination center in AHA2 indicates the involvement of three backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of M4, namely those originating from Ile-282, Gly-283, and Ile-285 (13Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Concerning Gly-283 and Ile-285, further investigations are required, but this study demonstrates that Ile-282 could indeed be involved in the proton translocation mechanism of AHA2. The fact that the size rather than the chemical nature of the side chain at position Ile-282 influences the ability of the pump to transport protons is in good agreement with the role of backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile-282 in determining the proton affinity of the enzyme. The mutational evidence presented in this paper will serve as an important tool for future interpretations of a high resolution crystal structure of a plasma membrane H+-ATPase."
