https://openalex.org/W1989999333,"Measurements of species turnover in island bird communities demonstrate two trends with increasing census interval t: (i) Apparent turnover rates T decrease greatly with t, and (ii) the coefficient of variation of T decreases asymptotically to a constant value. These effects are predicted by a statistical model whose parameters are the immigration and extinction probabilities of each species. Available bird censuses at intervals of decades underestimate turnover rates by about an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2001037632,"Selections of barley, Hordeum vulgare, obtained from a composite cross by means of salinized solution culture, a salt-tolerant research line from Arizona, and three cultivars were grown in dune sand and irrigated with water from the Pacific Ocean. All lines grew and produced grain of good feed quality. There is evidence of considerable phenotypic plasticity and of marked genotypic diversity with respect to conditions of seawater culture. Rough estimates of yield approached half the national average for barley."
https://openalex.org/W1968860565,"In a series of papers published between 1923 and 1932, J Harlen Bretz described an enormous plexus of proglacial stream channels eroded into the loess and basalt of the Columbia Plateau, eastern Washington. He argued that this region which he called the Channeled Scabland, was the product of a cataclysmic flood, which he called the Spokane flood. Considering the nature and vehemence of the opposition to his hypothesis, which was considered outrageous, its eventual scientific verification constitutes one of the most fascinating episodes in the history of modern science. The discovery of probable catastrophic flood channels on Mars has given new relevance to Bretz's insights."
https://openalex.org/W2071721936,Acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) in southeastern Arizona exhibited two different types of social organization: one of highly cooperative and resident groups and another of birds that migrated and formed only temporary male-female pairs during reproduction. The occurrence of both patterns in the same population indicates a high degree of social flexibility in this species.

https://openalex.org/W2046176964,"During the past 2 million years, major Northern Hemisphere eruptions occurred within 0.01 million years before 22 of 24 maximum-temperature dates which preceded the ten European glacial stages and 42 of 60 maximum-temperature dates which preceded the 22 cooling episodes. Massive eruptions were even more closely associated with the glacial stages and the cooling episodes. Within the errors of Pleistocene dating, major eruptions apparently occurred at the crucial moments to have triggered each of the ice ages."
https://openalex.org/W1981219245,"Colors of minor planets in the UBV system indicate compositions quite distinct from those of the field population in each of three Hirayama families. The Eos and Koronis families apparently originated from the collisional fragmentation of undifferentiated silicate bodies, and the Nysa group from a geochemically differentiated parent body."

https://openalex.org/W2041978818,Earlier observations of a seismic waveguide in the northwestern Pacific with a velocity of 8.3 kilometers per second to distances of approximately 30 degrees are complemented by suggestions of a possible waveguide with a velocity of 7.8 kilometers per second to distances well in excess of 30 degrees .
https://openalex.org/W2088230264,"A recent proposal for controlling photochemical smog by the addition to ambient air of 0.03 to 0.05 part per million of diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA) is shown to be invalid. The addition of DEHA in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 part per million to ambient air irradiated with sunlight in a dual outdoor environmental chamber caused marked increases in the rates of formation and concentrations of ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and light-scattering particles."
