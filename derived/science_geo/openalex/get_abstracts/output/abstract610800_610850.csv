https://openalex.org/W2804965034,"Recent shifts in the geographic distribution of marine species have been linked to shifts in preferred thermal habitats. These shifts in distribution have already posed challenges for living marine resource management, and there is a strong need for projections of how species might be impacted by future changes in ocean temperatures during the 21st century. We modeled thermal habitat for 686 marine species in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans using long-term ecological survey data from the North American continental shelves. These habitat models were coupled to output from sixteen general circulation models that were run under high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) future greenhouse gas emission scenarios over the 21st century to produce 32 possible future outcomes for each species. The models generally agreed on the magnitude and direction of future shifts for some species (448 or 429 under RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6, respectively), but strongly disagreed for other species (116 or 120 respectively). This allowed us to identify species with more or less robust predictions. Future shifts in species distributions were generally poleward and followed the coastline, but also varied among regions and species. Species from the U.S. and Canadian west coast including the Gulf of Alaska had the highest projected magnitude shifts in distribution, and many species shifted more than 1000 km under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Following a strong mitigation scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement would likely produce substantially smaller shifts and less disruption to marine management efforts. Our projections offer an important tool for identifying species, fisheries, and management efforts that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2804515582,"Objective Despite modern anti-epileptic drug treatment, approximately 30% of epilepsies remain medically refractory and for these patients, epilepsy surgery may be a treatment option. There have been numerous studies demonstrating good outcome of epilepsy surgery in the short to median term however, there are a limited number of studies looking at the long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to ascertain the long-term outcome of resective epilepsy surgery in a large neurosurgery hospital in the U.K. Methods This a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We used the 2001 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system to classify seizure freedom and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the probability of seizure freedom. Results We included 284 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery (178 anterior temporal lobe resections, 37 selective amygdalohippocampectomies, 33 temporal lesionectomies, 36 extratemporal lesionectomies), and had a prospective median follow-up of 5 years (range 1–27). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that 47% (95% CI 40–58) remained seizure free (apart from simple partial seizures) at 5 years and 38% (95% CI 31–45) at 10 years after surgery. 74% (95% CI 69–80) had a greater than 50% seizure reduction at 5 years and 70% (95% CI 64–77) at 10 years. Patients who had an amygdalohippocampectomy were more likely to have seizure recurrence than patients who had an anterior temporal lobe resection (p = 0.006) and temporal lesionectomy (p = 0.029). There was no significant difference between extra temporal and temporal lesionectomies. Hippocampal sclerosis was associated with a good outcome but declined in relative frequency over the years. Conclusion The vast majority of patients who were not seizure free experienced at least a substantial and long-lasting reduction in seizure frequency. A positive long-term outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible for many patients and especially those with hippocampal sclerosis or those who had anterior temporal lobe resections."
https://openalex.org/W2804525729,"In this work, a computer-aided tool for detection was developed to segment breast masses from clinical ultrasound (US) scans. The underlying Multi U-net algorithm is based on convolutional neural networks. Under the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board protocol, a prospective study of the automatic segmentation of suspicious breast masses was performed. The cohort consisted of 258 female patients who were clinically identified with suspicious breast masses and underwent clinical US scan and breast biopsy. The computer-aided detection tool effectively segmented the breast masses, achieving a mean Dice coefficient of 0.82, a true positive fraction (TPF) of 0.84, and a false positive fraction (FPF) of 0.01. By avoiding positioning of an initial seed, the algorithm is able to segment images in real time (13–55 ms per image), and can have potential clinical applications. The algorithm is at par with a conventional seeded algorithm, which had a mean Dice coefficient of 0.84 and performs significantly better (P< 0.0001) than the original U-net algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2804367883,"Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (N = 269) and 36-month-old children (N = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2803568139,"The purpose of this study is to analyze how the spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic accidents involving the elderly population in Seoul are changing by time period. We applied kernel density estimation and hotspot analyses to analyze the spatial characteristics of elderly people's traffic accidents, and the space-time cube, emerging hotspot, and space-time kernel density estimation analyses to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics. In addition, we analyzed elderly people's traffic accidents by dividing cases into those in which the drivers were elderly people and those in which elderly people were victims of traffic accidents, and used the traffic accidents data in Seoul for 2013 for analysis. The main findings were as follows: (1) the hotspots for elderly people's traffic accidents differed according to whether they were drivers or victims. (2) The hourly analysis showed that the hotspots for elderly drivers' traffic accidents are in specific areas north of the Han River during the period from morning to afternoon, whereas the hotspots for elderly victims are distributed over a wide area from daytime to evening. (3) Monthly analysis showed that the hotspots are weak during winter and summer, whereas they are strong in the hiking and climbing areas in Seoul during spring and fall. Further, elderly victims' hotspots are more sporadic than elderly drivers' hotspots. (4) The analysis for the entire period of 2013 indicates that traffic accidents involving elderly people are increasing in specific areas on the north side of the Han River. We expect the results of this study to aid in reducing the number of traffic accidents involving elderly people in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2803371520,"The appreciation for the need to record electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from humans while walking has been steadily growing in recent years, particularly in relation to understanding gait disturbances. Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG signals originate from mechanical forces applied to the scalp electrodes, inducing small electrode movements relative to the scalp which, in turn, cause the recorded voltage to change irrespectively of cortical activity. These mechanical forces, and thus MA, may have various sources (e.g., ground reaction forces, head movements, etc.) that are inherent to daily activities, notably walking. In this paper we introduce a systematic, integrated methodology for removing MA from EEG signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground (OG) walking, as well as quantify the prevalence of MA in different locomotion settings. In our experiments, participants performed walking trials at various speeds both OG and on a TM while wearing a 32-channel EEG cap and a 3-axis accelerometer, placed on the forehead. Data preprocessing included separating the EEG signals into statistically independent additive components using independent component analysis (ICA). We observed an increase in electro-physiological signals (e.g., neck EMG activations for stabilizing the head during heel-strikes) as the walking speed increased. These artefact independent-components (ICs), while not originating from electrode movement, still exhibit a similar spectral pattern to the MA ICs-a peak at the stepping frequency. MA was identified and quantified in each component using a novel method that utilizes the participant's stepping frequency, derived from a forehead-mounted accelerometer. We then benchmarked the EEG data by applying newly established metrics to quantify the success of our method in cleaning the data. The results indicate that our approach can be successfully applied to EEG data recorded during TM and OG walking, and is offered as a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG collected during gait trials."
https://openalex.org/W2803759686,"Tuna fisheries and processing represent economic activities of paramount importance around the world. Most of these products are traded for human consumption and in general are highly demanded commodities. However, not all tuna products achieve the same market price, some consumers are willing to pay a huge amount of money for certain species (i.e. Japanese market for Bluefin tuna) while other species are rather affordable (i.e. Skipjack tuna), therefore mislabelling has been observed frequently. We collected and analysed 545 tuna samples in six European countries, including fresh, frozen and canned products, and we have investigated whether or not these products were correctly labelled under European and national legislations. We found an overall mislabelling rate of 6.79%; in particular, 6.70% of the fresh and frozen tuna products and 7.84% of canned tuna were mislabelled, and only in the case of fresh and frozen tuna samples significant differences among countries were found. Mislabelling rates for Atlantic Bluefin tuna labelled products were very high, ranging from 50 up to 100%. In general, mislabelling was higher when specific names were included in the labels. The “tuna” umbrella term is a very popular one with consumers, but also one that remains vulnerable to ambiguity, hampering efforts towards market transparency and with potential negative consequences to the adequate management of tuna species stocks."
https://openalex.org/W2794294967,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is preferentially found on fermenting fruits. The yeasts that dominate the microbial communities of these substrates are the primary food source for developing D. melanogaster larvae, and adult flies manifest a strong olfactory system-mediated attraction for the volatile compounds produced by these yeasts during fermentation. Although most work on this interaction has focused on the standard laboratory yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a wide variety of other yeasts naturally ferment fallen fruit. Here we address the open question of whether D. melanogaster preferentially associates with distinct yeasts in different, closely-related environments. We characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of Drosophila-associated fungi in Northern California wineries that use organic grapes and natural fermentation using high-throughput, short-amplicon sequencing. We found that there is nonrandom structure in the fungal communities that are vectored by flies both between and within vineyards. Within wineries, the fungal communities associated with flies in cellars, fermentation tanks, and pomace piles are distinguished by varying abundances of a small number of yeast species. To investigate the origins of this structure, we assayed Drosophila attraction to, oviposition on, larval development in, and longevity when consuming the yeasts that distinguish vineyard microhabitats from each other. We found that wild fly lines did not respond differentially to the yeast species that distinguish winery habitats in habitat specific manner. Instead, this subset of yeast shares traits that make them attractive to and ensure their close association with Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2803396225,"Worldwide, acute bacterial meningitis is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality among under five children, particularly in settings where vaccination for H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis is yet to be introduced in the national immunization programs. Estimation of disease burden of bacterial meningitis associated with these pathogens can guide the policy makers to consider inclusion of these newer vaccines in the immunization programs. A network of hospital based sentinel surveillance was established to generate baseline data on the burden of bacterial meningitis among children aged less than 5 years in India and to provide a platform for impact assessment following introduction of the Pentavalent and Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCV).During surveillance carried out in select hospitals across India in 2012-2013, information regarding demographics, immunization history, clinical history, treatment details and laboratory investigations viz. CSF biochemistry, culture, latex agglutination and PCR was collected from children aged 1 to 59 months admitted with suspected bacterial meningitis.A total of 3104 suspected meningitis cases were enrolled from 19,670 children admitted with fever at the surveillance hospitals. Of these, 257 cases were confirmed as cases of meningitis. They were due to S. pneumoniae (82.9%), H. influenzae type b (14.4%) and N. meningitidis (2.7%). Highest prevalence (55.3%) was observed among children 1 to 11 months. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed considerable resistance among S. pneumoniae isolates against commonly used antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, penicillin, and cefotaxime. More commonly prevalent serotypes of S. pneumoniae in circulation included 6B, 14, 6A and 19F. More than 90% of serotypes identified were covered by Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 13.We observed that S. pneumoniae was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in hospitalized children under five years of age in India. Continued surveillance is expected to provide valuable information and trends in future, to take an informed decision on introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in Universal Immunization Programme in India and will also eventually help in post-vaccination impact evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2803273021,"There is a paucity in current literature about the level of patients' satisfaction and factors influencing it in Bangladesh health system. We aimed to measure the level of patients' satisfaction across different types and levels of healthcare facilities and to determine which factors influence this satisfaction level. A patient exit interview was carried out among 2207 patients attending selected health facilities in two administrative divisions of Bangladesh, namely Rajshahi and Sylhet. Information on healthcare experience and satisfaction with received care was collected through an electronic structured questionnaire. Information about 'overall satisfaction with healthcare' was collected on a 10-point scale and then dichotomized based on the median-split. Binomial logistic regressions, both simple and multivariable, were conducted to identify which factors contribute significantly to patients' satisfaction. We found that 63.2% of the participants were satisfied with the healthcare service they received. Patients attending the private facilities had the highest level of satisfaction (i.e. 73%) and patients attending the primary care facilities had the lowest level of satisfaction (i.e. 52%). Factors like convenient opening hours, asking related questions to the providers, facility cleanliness and privacy settings were significantly associated with patients' satisfaction. Being satisfied with facility cleanliness (multivariable OR 4.30; 95% CI: 3.29-5.62) and privacy settings (multivariable OR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.28-2.21) were the strongest predictors of patients' satisfaction. In conclusion, a significant portion of the patients in Bangladesh are not satisfied with their received care. Patients' satisfaction can be increased by focusing on improving facility cleanliness, privacy settings and providers' interpersonal skills."
https://openalex.org/W2804762947,"Proactive motor control is a preparatory mechanism facilitating upcoming action inhibition or adaptation. Previous studies investigating proactive motor control mostly focused on response inhibition, as in the classical go-nogo or stop-signal tasks. However, everyday life rarely calls for the complete suppression of actions without subsequent behavioral adjustment. Therefore, we conducted a modified cued go-nogo-change task, in which cues indicated whether participants might have to change to an alternative action or inhibit the response to an upcoming target. Based on the dual-mechanisms of control framework and using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the role of the sensorimotor cortex and of prefrontal regions in preparing to change and cancel motor responses. We focused on mu and beta power over sensorimotor cortex ipsi- and contralateral to an automatic motor response and on prefrontal beta power. Over ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, mu and beta power was relatively decreased when anticipating to change or inhibit the automatic motor behavior. Moreover, alpha phase coupling between ipsilateral motor cortex and prefrontal areas decreased when preparing to change, suggesting a decoupling of sensorimotor regions from prefrontal control. When the standard motor action actually had to be changed, prefrontal beta power increased, reflecting enhanced cognitive control. Our data highlight the role of the ipsilateral motor cortex in preparing to inhibit and change upcoming motor actions. Here, especially mu power and phase coupling seem to be critical to guide upcoming behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2803471118,"This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0-8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children's health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58-7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07-6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31-2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0-8 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2804722531,"Objective Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are both monocyte-derived cytokines. Both cytokines have been previously described to exert a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis synergizing with other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-17 (IL-17) on target cells, for the perpetuation of the inflammatory response (e.g. IL-6 production). In the context of experimental RA, Cd addition has an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effect when associated to IL-17/TNF-α stimulation, due to its accumulation in synoviocytes. The aim of this work was to evaluate if IL-1β interaction with IL-17 also contributes to metal-import mechanisms and its effects on cell viability and inflammation. Methods IL-17 and IL-1β were added to synoviocyte cultures with or without exogenous Cd addition (0.1 ppm, 0.89 μM). IL-6 production, Cd import kinetics, gene expression of ZIP-8 importer and metallothioneins (MTs) and cell viability were evaluated by ELISA, inductively-coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), q-RT-PCR and viability assays (neutral red and annexin V) respectively. Results IL-17 and IL-1β acted in synergy on synoviocytes to induce IL-6 production similarly to the IL-17/TNF-α combination. Metal import was lower with IL17/ IL-1β in comparison to IL-17/TNF-α exposed-synoviocytes, as the expression of ZIP-8 and MT-1F was less induced. Monocyte and PBMCs exposure to Cd resulted in a reduced production of IL-1β and an increased production of TNF-α and this result was confirmed in co-cultures of synoviocytes and PBMCs. The IL-17/IL-1β combination with Cd slightly reduced cell viability in comparison to the IL-17/TNF-α combination and resulted in a strong induction of IL-6 production. Conclusion IL-17/TNF-α combination but not IL-17/IL-1β combination mainly drives the accumulation of Cd in synoviocytes and its effects on cell viability and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2803273005,"Natural ionizing background radiation has exerted a constant pressure on organisms since the first forms of life appeared on Earth, so that cells have developed molecular mechanisms to avoid or repair damages caused directly by radiation or indirectly by radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional effect of depriving Shewanella oneidensis cultures of background levels of radiation by growing the cells in a mine 655 m underground, thus reducing the dose rate from 72.1 to 0.9 nGy h-1 from control to treatment, respectively. RNASeq transcriptome analysis showed the differential expression of 4.6 and 7.6% of the S. oneidensis genome during early- and late-exponential phases of growth, respectively. The greatest change observed in the treatment was the downregulation of ribosomal proteins (21% of all annotated ribosomal protein genes during early- and 14% during late-exponential) and tRNA genes (14% of all annotated tRNA genes in early-exponential), indicating a marked decrease in protein translation. Other significant changes were the upregulation of membrane transporters, implying an increase in the traffic of substrates across the cell membrane, as well as the up and downregulation of genes related to respiration, which could be interpreted as a response to insufficient oxidants in the cells. In other reports, there is evidence in multiple species that some ROS not just lead to oxidative stress, but act as signaling molecules to control cellular metabolism at the transcriptional level. Consistent with these reports, several genes involved in the metabolism of carbon and biosynthesis of amino acids were also regulated, lending support to the idea of a wide metabolic response. Our results indicate that S. oneidensis is sensitive to the withdrawal of background levels of ionizing radiation and suggest that a transcriptional response is required to maintain homeostasis and retain normal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2803994611,"Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas."
https://openalex.org/W2804093763,"This paper presents an integrated hybrid optimization algorithm for training the radial basis function neural network (RBF NN). Training of neural networks is still a challenging exercise in machine learning domain. Traditional training algorithms in general suffer and trap in local optima and lead to premature convergence, which makes them ineffective when applied for datasets with diverse features. Training algorithms based on evolutionary computations are becoming popular due to their robust nature in overcoming the drawbacks of the traditional algorithms. Accordingly, this paper proposes a hybrid training procedure with differential search (DS) algorithm functionally integrated with the particle swarm optimization (PSO). To surmount the local trapping of the search procedure, a new population initialization scheme is proposed using Logistic chaotic sequence, which enhances the population diversity and aid the search capability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RBF hybrid training algorithm, experimental analysis on publicly available 7 benchmark datasets are performed. Subsequently, experiments were conducted on a practical application case for wind speed prediction to expound the superiority of the proposed RBF training algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2804515519,"Leptospirosis is an important worldwide zoonosis. This disease is caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira which are maintained in the environment via chronic renal infection of carrier animals which can be asymptomatic excretors of the organisms in their urines and become a source of infection for humans and other hosts. The prevalence of animal leptospirosis in Algiers, Algeria, is unknown.Real-time PCR and standard PCR and sequencing were used to detect pathogenic Leptospira organisms in the urines of stray dogs and cats in Algiers. In the presence of appropriate controls, none of the 107 cat urine samples were positive while 5/104 (4.8%) canine urine samples (asymptomatic mixed-breed dogs, three females and two males) were positive in two real-time PCR assays targeting the rrs and hsp genes. The positivity of these samples was confirmed by partial PCR-sequencing of the rpoB gene which yielded 100% sequence similarity with Leptospira interrogans reference sequence. In this study, L. interrogans prevalence was significantly higher in dogs aged < one year (16.46% - 29.41%) than in adults (0%) (P value = 0.0001) and then in the overall dog population (2.68% - 4.8%) (P = 0.0007).These results suggest that dogs are maintenance hosts for zoonotic leptospirosis in Algiers, Algeria. To face this situation, effective canine vaccination strategies and raising public health awareness are mandatory. Further investigations incorporating a larger sample in more localities will be undertaken to document the epidemiology of urban animal leptospirosis in Algeria at large."
https://openalex.org/W2804849345,"Imaging flow cytometry is a powerful experimental technique combining the strength of microscopy and flow cytometry to enable high-throughput characterization of cell populations on a detailed microscopic scale. This approach has an increasing importance for distinguishing between different cellular phenotypes such as proliferation, cell division and cell death. In the course of undergoing these different pathways, each cell is characterized by a high amount of properties. This makes it hard to filter the most relevant information for cell state discrimination. The traditional methods for cell state discrimination rely on dye based two-dimensional gating strategies ignoring information that is hidden in the high-dimensional property space. In order to make use of the information ignored by the traditional methods, we present a simple and efficient approach to distinguish biological states within a cell population based on machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of filter techniques combined with different classification schemes. These techniques are illustrated with two case studies of apoptosis detection in HeLa cells. Thereby we highlight (i) the aptitude of imaging flow cytometry regarding automated, label-free cell state discrimination and (ii) pitfalls that are frequently encountered. Additionally a MATLAB script is provided, which gives further insight regarding the computational work presented in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2803222854,"Recent work suggests that olfactory dysfunction is a strong predictor of five-year mortality in older adults. Based on past work showing: 1) that olfactory dysfunction impairs social functioning and 2) that social ties are linked with mortality, the current work explored whether impairments in social life mediated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and mortality. Additionally, based on work showing gender differences in the social consequences of olfactory dysfunction, gender was assessed as a potential moderator of this association. Social network size mediated the olfactory-mortality link for females. To probe what feature of social networks was driving this effect, we investigated two subcomponents of social life: emotional closeness (e.g., perceived social support, loneliness) and physical closeness (e.g., physical contact, in-person socializing with others). Physical closeness significantly mediated the olfactory-mortality link for females, even after controlling for social network size. Emotional closeness did not mediate this link. Possible mechanisms underlying this relationship are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2804853641,"Recent studies have examined the risk of poverty throughout the life course, but few have considered how transitioning in and out of poverty shape the dynamic heterogeneity and mortality disparities of a cohort at each age. Here we use state-by-age modeling to capture individual heterogeneity in crossing one of three different poverty thresholds (defined as 1×, 2× or 3× the ""official"" poverty threshold) at each age. We examine age-specific state structure, the remaining life expectancy, its variance, and cohort simulations for those above and below each threshold. Survival and transitioning probabilities are statistically estimated by regression analyses of data from the Health and Retirement Survey RAND data-set, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Using the results of these regression analyses, we parameterize discrete state, discrete age matrix models. We found that individuals above all three thresholds have higher annual survival than those in poverty, especially for mid-ages to about age 80. The advantage is greatest when we classify individuals based on 1× the ""official"" poverty threshold. The greatest discrepancy in average remaining life expectancy and its variance between those above and in poverty occurs at mid-ages for all three thresholds. And fewer individuals are in poverty between ages 40-60 for all three thresholds. Our findings are consistent with results based on other data sets, but also suggest that dynamic heterogeneity in poverty and the transience of the poverty state is associated with income-related mortality disparities (less transience, especially of those above poverty, more disparities). This paper applies the approach of age-by-stage matrix models to human demography and individual poverty dynamics. In so doing we extend the literature on individual poverty dynamics across the life course."
https://openalex.org/W2796398079,"Importance Landmark studies showed that partial clinical remission in new-onset type 1 diabetes is associated with reduced prevalence of long-term complications, but early clinical indicators of this favorable outcome are poorly characterized. Aim To determine if there were any differences in lipid parameters, especially LDL-cholesterol, between remitters and non-remitters 4 to 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes after controlling for hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, and pubertal status. Subjects and methods A longitudinal retrospective cohort study of 123 subjects of mean age 11.9 ± 2.9 years, [male 11.7 ± 2.9 years, (n = 55); female 12.0 ± 2.9 years, (n = 68), p = 0.60] with type 1 diabetes of 4–5 years duration. Anthropometric and biochemical data were collected at the 4th or 5th year after diagnosis in line with the American Diabetes Association recommendation to initiate screening for complications in children either at the beginning of puberty or 4–5 years after diagnosis. Puberty was defined by Tanner stages II-V. Partial clinical remission was defined by the gold-standard insulin-dose adjusted hemoglobin A1c (IDAA1c) of ≤9. Results There were 44 (35.8%) remitters (age 13.0 ± 2.5y; male 52.3%). Both the total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in remitters compared to non-remitters: LDL-C: 78.8 ± 28.7 mg/dL vs. 91.6 ± 26.5 mg/dL, p = 0.023; and total cholesterol: 151.5 ± 32.6 mg/dL vs. 167.0 ± 29.6 mg/dL, p = 0.015. Other lipid fractions were similar between the groups. There were no differences between the groups for glycemic control, body mass index z score, thyroid function, celiac disease occurrence, or vitamin D status. A greater number of remitters were in puberty compared to non-remitters (86.4% vs. 60.8%, p = 0.006). LDL-C concentration was similar in prepubertal remitters vs. non-remitters (p = 0.93), but was significantly lower in remitters in puberty compared to non-remitters in puberty (p = 0.018) after adjusting for age and duration of diabetes. Conclusions Children with type 1 diabetes who underwent a honeymoon phase had significantly lower LDL cholesterol 5 years after diagnosis. This early divergence in lipidemia may explain the dichotomy in the prevalence of long-term complication in type 1 diabetes between remitters and non-remitters. It also offers a pathway for targeted lipid monitoring in type 1 diabetes, by establishing non-remission as a non-modifiable risk factor for vascular complication in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2804753668,"Evidence for fire use becomes increasingly sparse the further back in time one looks. This is especially true for Palaeolithic assemblages. Primary evidence of fire use in the form of hearth features tends to give way to clusters or sparse scatters of more durable heated stone fragments. In the absence of intact fireplaces, these thermally altered lithic remains have been used as a proxy for discerning relative degrees of fire use between archaeological layers and deposits. While previous experimental studies have demonstrated the physical effects of heat on stony artefacts, the mechanisms influencing the proportion of fire proxy evidence within archaeological layers remain understudied. This fundamental study is the first to apply a computer-based model (fiReproxies) in an attempt to simulate and quantify the complex interplay of factors that ultimately determine when and in what proportions lithic artefacts are heated by (anthropogenic) fires. As an illustrative example, we apply our model to two hypothetical archaeological layers that reflect glacial and interglacial conditions during the late Middle Palaeolithic within a generic simulated cave site to demonstrate how different environmental, behavioural and depositional factors like site surface area, sedimentation rate, occupation frequency, and fire size and intensity can, independently or together, significantly influence the visibility of archaeological fire signals."

The study group consisted of 268 women with a history of three or more idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortions and 284 women with at least two live births and no history of pathologic pregnancies all from Slovenia and Serbia. Two SNPs in the CLOCK gene were chosen and genotyped. The results showed a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between the two groups in the CLOCK gene for rs6850524 and rs11932595. Our analysis showed that G allele under dominant model (GG+GC/CC) for rs6850524 (p = 2∙10−4, OR = 2.28, 95%CI = 1.46–3.56) as well as G allele under dominant model (GA+AA/AA) for rs11932595 (p = 0.04, OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01–2.04) might be risk factors against IRSA. Our data suggest that genetic variability in the CLOCK gene is associated with IRSA warranting further confirmation and mechanistic investigations."

HtrA1-/- mice were examined for arterial abnormalities. Although their cerebral arteries were normal, the thoracic aorta was affected in HtrA1-/- mice. The number of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the aorta was increased in HtrA1-/- mice of 40 weeks or younger, but decreased thereafter. The cross-sectional area of the aorta was increased in HtrA1-/- mice of 40 weeks or older. Aortic VSMCs isolated from HtrA1-/- mice rapidly proliferated and migrated, produced high MMP9 activity, and were prone to oxidative stress-induced cell death. HtrA1-/- VSMCs expressed less smooth muscle α-actin, and more vimentin and osteopontin, and responded to PDGF-BB more strongly than wild type VSMCs, indicating that HtrA1-/- VSMCs were in the synthetic phenotype. The elastic lamina was disrupted, and collagens were decreased in the aortic media. Calponin in the media was decreased, whereas vimentin and osteopontin were increased, suggesting a synthetic shift of VSMCs in vivo. Loss of HtrA1 therefore skews VSMCs toward the synthetic phenotype, induces MMP9 expression, and expedites cell death. We propose that the synthetic modulation is the primary event that leads to the vascular abnormalities caused by HtrA1 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2803109796,"Background Tinnitus is a common condition, especially prevalent among military Veterans. Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM) is an interdisciplinary, structured, stepped-care approach to providing clinical services, including teaching coping skills, to people bothered by tinnitus. PTM has been shown to be effective at reducing functional distress, but implementation of the intervention outside of a research setting has not been studied, even though dissemination is underway within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system in the United States. This study was designed to address a gap in knowledge of PTM clinical implementation to date, with a focus on factors facilitating or hindering implementation in VHA audiology and mental health clinic contexts, and whether implementing sites had developed intervention adaptations. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 audiology and mental health clinicians and service chiefs across a regional service network. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a hybrid inductive-deductive analytic approach guided by existing implementation research frameworks and then iteratively developed for emergent themes. Results PTM prioritization was rare overall, with providers across disciplines challenged by lack of capacity for implementation, but with differences by discipline in challenges to prioritization. Where PTM was prioritized and delivered, this was facilitated by perception of unique value, provider’s own experience of tinnitus, observation/experience with PTM delivery, intervention fit with provider’s skills, and an environment with supportive leadership and adaptive reserve. PTM was frequently adapted to local contexts to address delivery challenges and diversify patient options. Adaptations included shifting from group to individual formats, reducing or combining sessions, and employing novel therapeutic approaches. Conclusions Existing adaptations highlight the need to better understand mechanisms underlying PTM’s effectiveness, and research on the impact of adaptations on patient outcomes is an important next step. Prioritization of PTM is a key barrier to the scale up and spread of this evidence-based intervention. Developing clinician champions may facilitate dissemination, especially if accompanied by signals of systemic prioritization. Novel approaches exposing clinicians and administrators to PTM may identify and develop clinical champions. Acknowledging the potential for PTM adaptations may make delivery more feasible in the context of existing system constraints and priorities."

This species was found in a single pond, a paleochannel of the Bermejo River, which is seriously disturbed by soybean plantations surrounding it. Despite intensive sampling in the area, this species was only registered in this pond where it was relatively scarce. Therefore, we consider this species as critically endangered. This species is the sister species of A. patriciae in our phylogenetic analyses and is similar, in a general external aspect, to A. varzeae and A. carvalhoi. It can be distinguished among the species of Austrolebias by its unique color pattern in males. Additionally, from A. varzeae by presenting a supraorbital band equal or longer than the infraorbital band (vs. shorter) and from A. patriciae by the convex dorsal profile of head (vs. concave).

In view of the characteristics of annual power load forecasting, the grey model of GM (1,1) are widely applied. Introducing buffer operator into GM (1,1) to pre-process the historical annual power load data is an approach to improve the forecasting accuracy. To solve the problem of nonadjustable action intensity of traditional weakening buffer operator, variable-weight weakening buffer operator (VWWBO) and background value optimization (BVO) are used to dynamically pre-process the historical annual power load data and a VWWBO-BVO-based GM (1,1) is proposed. To find the optimal value of variable-weight buffer coefficient and background value weight generating coefficient of the proposed model, grey relational analysis (GRA) and improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) are integrated and a GRA-IGSA integration algorithm is constructed aiming to maximize the grey relativity between simulating value sequence and actual value sequence. By the adjustable action intensity of buffer operator, the proposed model optimized by GRA-IGSA integration algorithm can obtain a better forecasting accuracy which is demonstrated by the case studies and can provide an optimized solution for annual power load forecasting."

We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients-27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. Escherichia coli was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was -3.7% (-15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; P = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7-10] vs. 14 [14-15] days; P < 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; P < 0.001).Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810."

Here we show that α7 nAChR mediated calcium signals in differentiating PC12 cells activate the proteolytic enzyme calpain leading to spectrin breakdown, microtubule retraction, and attenuation in neurite growth. Imaging in growth cones confirms that α7 activation decreases EB3 comet motility in a calcium dependent manner as demonstrated by the ability of α7 nAChR, ryanodine, or IP3 receptor antagonists to block the effect of α7 nAChR on growth. α7 nAChR mediated EB3 comet motility, spectrin breakdown, and neurite growth was also inhibited by the addition of the selective calpain blocker calpeptin and attenuated by the expression of an α7 subunit unable to bind Gαq and activate calcium store release. The findings indicate that α7 nAChRs regulate cytoskeletal dynamics through local calcium signals for calpain protease activity."

https://openalex.org/W2804739798,"Background Cancer chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common condition that is deadly when bacteremia is present. Detection of bacteremia depends on culture, which takes days, and no accurate predictive tools applicable to the initial evaluation are available. We utilized metabolomics and transcriptomics to develop multivariable predictors of bacteremia among FN patients. Methods We classified emergency department patients with FN and no apparent infection at presentation as bacteremic (cases) or not (controls), according to blood culture results. We assessed relative metabolite abundance in plasma, and relative expression of 2,560 immunology and cancer-related genes in whole blood. We used logistic regression to identify multivariable predictors of bacteremia, and report test characteristics of the derived predictors. Results For metabolomics, 14 bacteremic cases and 25 non-bacteremic controls were available for analysis; for transcriptomics we had 7 and 22 respectively. A 5-predictor metabolomic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.991 (95%CI: 0.972,1.000), 100% sensitivity, and 96% specificity for identifying bacteremia. Pregnenolone steroids were more abundant in cases and carnitine metabolites were more abundant in controls. A 3-predictor gene expression model had corresponding results of 0.961 (95%CI: 0.896,1.000), 100%, and 86%. Genes involved in innate immunity were differentially expressed. Conclusions Classifiers derived from metabolomic and gene expression data hold promise as objective and accurate predictors of bacteremia among FN patients without apparent infection at presentation, and can provide insights into the underlying biology. Our findings should be considered illustrative, but may lay the groundwork for future biomarker development."
https://openalex.org/W2803152071,"Background In fish with external fertilization, two main start-up mechanisms of the path that blocks or activates the spermatozoan motility apparatus are known. The main factor managing the path is osmolality or potassium ion. In burbot from the European and North American population, contradictory findings regarding the factors influencing the onset of spermatozoa motility were reported. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of potassium and osmolality on the spermatozoa activation of European burbot, Lota lota (Actinopterygii, Gadiformes, Lotidae). Moreover, the influence of pH, as well as sodium ion concentrations on spermatozoa motility was investigated. Seven parameters characterising motility were traced by means of computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Principal findings The spermatozoa of European burbot are K+ ion-sensitive. A 6-mM KCl solution significantly decreased motility, and above 12-mM (50 mOsm kg-1) totally ceased spermatozoa movement. Sucrose and Na+ solutions inhibited spermatozoa movement only at concentrations > 450–480 mOsm kg-1. Greater differences in the percentage of motile sperm between individuals were noted in solutions containing high concentrations of chemicals triggering sperm motility. The optimum osmolality for spermatozoa motility is in the range of 100–200 mOsm kg-1. The burbot spermatozoa were motile over a wide range of pH values with the best activation at pH 9. Conclusion It was demonstrated that the spermatozoa of European burbot are inhibited by K+ ions similarly as in North American burbot. Other electrolyte and non-electrolyte solutions inhibit spermatozoa movement only if their osmolality is greater than that of the physiological osmolality of seminal plasma. The data provided on basic knowledge of burbot spermatozoa allow to ensure appropriate conditions during artificial reproduction and scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W2804329709,"Introduction Modern contraceptive use among migrants may be limited due to factors such as language barriers, socio-economic condition, and inadequate knowledge. Limited evidence is available on the factors associated with the use of modern contraceptive methods by migrants in Japan. Moreover, evidence remains scarce on the quality of life (QOL) of migrants in relation to contraceptive use. As the Nepalese migrant population in Japan is increasing, this study was conducted to address their sexual and reproductive health issues. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine the factors associated with the use of modern contraceptive methods and to explore the association between the use of modern contraceptive methods and QOL among married Nepalese female migrants in Japan. Methods This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 189 married Nepalese female migrants residing in five prefectures of Japan from August to October 2016. This study employed snowball sampling to recruit the migrants. Simple and multiple logistic analyses were used to examine the association between independent variables and the use of modern contraceptive methods. Similarly, multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between the use of modern contraceptive methods and quality of life. Results Migrants who had higher knowledge of modern contraceptive methods were more likely to use them (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.31; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.60). The psychological domain scores were higher in those who used modern contraceptive methods (Coefficient [B] = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.05, 1.11). Conclusion This study highlights the importance of the knowledge of modern contraceptive methods to increase their use. Also, the use of modern contraceptive methods improves the psychological QOL domain scores of the migrants using them. These results suggest a need for sexual and reproductive health education for migrants, especially pertaining to modern contraceptive use."
https://openalex.org/W2804715667,"A major challenge in systems biology is to infer the parameters of regulatory networks that operate in a noisy environment, such as in a single cell. In a stochastic regime it is hard to distinguish noise from the real signal and to infer the noise contribution to the dynamical behavior. When the genetic network displays oscillatory dynamics, it is even harder to infer the parameters that produce the oscillations. To address this issue we introduce a new estimation method built on a combination of stochastic simulations, mass action kinetics and ensemble network simulations in which we match the average periodogram and phase of the model to that of the data. The method is relatively fast (compared to Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo Methods), easy to parallelize, applicable to large oscillatory networks and large (~2000 cells) single cell expression data sets, and it quantifies the noise impact on the observed dynamics. Standard errors of estimated rate coefficients are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the mean from single cell experiments with on the order of ~1000 cells. We also provide a method to assess the goodness of fit of the stochastic network using the Hilbert phase of single cells. An analysis of phase departures from the null model with no communication between cells is consistent with a hypothesis of Stochastic Resonance describing single cell oscillators. Stochastic Resonance provides a physical mechanism whereby intracellular noise plays a positive role in establishing oscillatory behavior, but may require model parameters, such as rate coefficients, that differ substantially from those extracted at the macroscopic level from measurements on populations of millions of communicating, synchronized cells."

Methods Retrospective observational case series of 25 patients treated with a single intravitreal ocriplasmin injection between December 2013 and December 2015. Best corrected visual acuity and optical coherence tomography exams were performed to determine visual outcomes and anatomical VMT release and FTMH closure over time. Two patient groups were identified: ocular macular co-morbidity (OCM) and no OCM (nOCM), with follow-up at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Results Twenty-five patients were identified that included 19 patients with VMT, and 6 patients with VMT plus FTMH. In the nOCM group of 22 patients, the release rate of VMT was 44%, 63%, and 69% at 4, 12 and 24 weeks respectively. In the “real-world” OCM group of 25 patients, the VMT release rate was 37%, 53%, and 58% at the same time-points. In both groups, the FTMH closure rate was 33%, 50%, and 67% at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. At mean follow-up of 30 weeks in the VMT group with nOCM, the mean LogMAR VA improved significantly from 0.44 to 0.28 (p = 0.0068, paired t-test). Three were no serious adverse events. Conclusions This study reports improved efficacy of intravitreal ocriplasmin for both VMT and FTMH, and is more favourable in patients with no ocular co-morbidity. We highlight the importance of careful patient selection and structured standard of care pathways to identify patients who will benefit from the positive visual and anatomical effects of intravitreal ocriplasmin."

Exogenously supplied NO (in the form of sodium nitroprusside [SNP] or diethylenetriamine NONOate [DETA]; 125 to 500 μM) results in noteworthy enhancement in seedling growth in a concentration dependent manner irrespective of salt-stress and differentially affects POD activity in 2-day old seedling cotyledons. Elevated NO availability leads to an increase in the specific activity of POD in a concentration-dependent manner within 48 hrs as a rapid signaling response. Purification of POD protein using immunoprecipitation technique has shown that cotyledons derived from salt stressed seedlings exhibit a higher extent of tyrosine nitration of POD as compared to the control seedlings. Out of the four tyrosine residues found in the amino acid sequence of POD, the one at position 100 has been predicted to undergo nitration. Thus, a probable NO-POD crosstalk is evident in sunflower seedling cotyledons accompanying salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2804401762,"We previously demonstrated endocytosis of KCa2.3 is caveolin-1-, dynamin II- and Rab5-dependent. KCa2.3 then enters Rab35/EPI64C- and RME-1-containing recycling endosomes and is returned to the plasma membrane (PM). Herein, we report on the mechanism by which KCa2.3 is inserted into the PM during recycling and following exit from the Golgi. We demonstrate KCa2.3 colocalizes with SNAP-23 and Syntaxin-4 in the PM of HEK and endothelial cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We further show KCa2.3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with SNAP-23 and Syntaxin-4. Overexpression of either Syntaxin-4 or SNAP-23 increased PM expression of KCa2.3, whereas shRNA-mediated knockdown of these SNARE proteins significantly decreased PM KCa2.3 expression, as assessed by cell surface biotinylation. Whole-cell patch clamp studies confirmed knockdown of SNAP-23 significantly decreased the apamin sensitive, KCa2.3 current. Using standard biotinylation/stripping methods, we demonstrate shRNA mediated knockdown of SNAP-23 inhibits recycling of KCa2.3 following endocytosis, whereas scrambled shRNA had no effect. Finally, using biotin ligase acceptor peptide (BLAP)-tagged KCa2.3, coupled with ER-resident biotin ligase (BirA), channels could be biotinylated in the ER after which we evaluated their rate of insertion into the PM following Golgi exit. We demonstrate knockdown of SNAP-23 significantly slows the rate of Golgi to PM delivery of KCa2.3. The inhibition of both recycling and PM delivery of newly synthesized KCa2.3 channels likely accounts for the decreased PM expression observed following knockdown of these SNARE proteins. In total, our results suggest insertion of KCa2.3 into the PM depends upon the SNARE proteins, Syntaxin-4 and SNAP-23."

Professional societies recommend routine screening for environmental, occupational, and dietary exposures to reduce exposures and their associated sequelae. Objective Our objective was to determine the frequency of environmental exposure screening by obstetricians and gynecologists (OBGYNs) at initial patient visits. Study design Practicing OBGYNs were approached at the University of Colorado and by social media. The survey instrument queried demographics, environmental literacy, and screening practices. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square and two-sample t-test. Results We received 312 online survey responses (response rate of 12%). Responding OBGYNs were predominantly female (96%), board-certified (78%), generalists (65%) with a mean age of 37.1 years. Fewer than half of physicians screened for the following factors: occupational exposures, environmental chemicals, air pollution, pesticide use, personal care products, household cleaners, water source, use of plastics for food storage, and lead and mercury exposure. Eighty five percent of respondents reported that they did not feel comfortable obtaining an environmental history and 58% respondents reported that they performed no regular screening of environmental exposures. A higher frequency of screening was associated with > 4 years of practice (p = 0.001), and having read the environmental committee opinion (p = <0.001). Conclusion The majority of OBGYNs did not incorporate screening for known environmental exposures into routine practice. Reading the environmental committee opinions was strongly and significantly associated with a higher rate of screening. Improving physician comfort in counseling patients may enhance screening for exposures that affect reproductive health."

https://openalex.org/W2804122238,"Correct identification of sex is an important component of wildlife management because changes in sex ratios can affect population viability. Identification of sex often relies on external morphology, which can be biased by intermediate or nondistinctive morphotypes and observer experience. For unionid mussels, research has demonstrated that species misidentification is common but less attention has been given to the reliability of sex identification. To evaluate whether this is an issue, we surveyed 117 researchers on their ability to correctly identify sex of Lampsilis teres (Yellow Sandshell), a wide ranging, sexually dimorphic species. Personal background information of each observer was analyzed to identify factors that may contribute to misidentification of sex. We found that median misidentification rates were ~20% across males and females and that observers falsely identified the number of female specimens more often (~23%) than males (~10%). Misidentification rates were partially explained by geographic region of prior mussel experience and where observers learned how to identify mussels, but there remained substantial variation among observers after controlling for these factors. We also used three morphometric methods (traditional, geometric, and Fourier) to investigate whether sex could be more correctly identified statistically and found that misidentification rates for the geometric and Fourier methods (which characterize shape) were less than 5% (on average 7% and 2% for females and males, respectively). Our results show that misidentification of sex is likely common for mussels if based solely on external morphology, which raises general questions, regardless of taxonomic group, about its reliability for conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2803697857,"Behavioral tests have been extensively used to measure the visual function of mice. To determine how precisely mice perceive certain visual cues, it is necessary to have a quantifiable measurement of their behavioral responses.

Despite the widespread use of these tests, the training requirement for the recognition of a variety of different visual targets, and the performance of the behavioral tests has not been thoroughly characterized. We have developed a virtual reality behavior testing approach that can essay a variety of different aspects of visual perception, including color/luminance and motion detection. When tested for the ability to detect a color/luminance target or a moving target, mice were able to discern the designated target after 9 days of continuous training. However, the quality of their performance is significantly affected by the complexity of the visual target, and their ability to navigate on a spherical treadmill. Importantly, mice retained memory of their visual recognition for at least three weeks after the end of their behavioral training."

Consequently, there is a demand for strategies that will reduce the individual-level costs of AGI; this will require a comprehensive understanding of the economic costs of AGI. However, given Inuit communities' unique cultural, economic, and geographic contexts, there is a knowledge gap regarding the context-specific indirect costs of AGI borne by Inuit community members. This study aimed to identify the major indirect costs of AGI, and explore factors associated with these indirect costs, in the Inuit community of Rigolet, Canada, in order to develop a case-based context-specific study framework that can be used to evaluate these costs.A mixed methods study design and community-based methods were used. Qualitative in-depth, group, and case interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify and describe indirect costs of AGI specific to Rigolet. Data from two quantitative cross-sectional retrospective surveys were analyzed using univariable regression models to examine potential associations between predictor variables and the indirect costs.The most notable indirect costs of AGI that should be incorporated into cost-of-illness evaluations were the tangible costs related to missing paid employment and subsistence activities, as well as the intangible costs associated with missing community and cultural events. Seasonal cost variations should also be considered. This study was intended to inform cost-of-illness studies conducted in Rigolet and other similar research settings. These results contribute to a better understanding of the economic impacts of AGI on Rigolet residents, which could be used to help identify priority areas and resource allocation for public health policies and programs."
https://openalex.org/W2803159428,"Rapid horizontal directional well drilling in hard or fractured formations requires efficient drilling technology. The penetration rate of conventional hard rock drilling technology in horizontal directional well excavations is relatively low, resulting in multiple overgrinding of drill cuttings in bottom boreholes. Conventional drilling techniques with reamer or diamond drill bit face difficulties due to the long construction periods, low penetration rates, and high engineering costs in the directional well drilling of hard rock. To improve the impact energy and penetration rate of directional well drilling in hard formations, a new drilling system with a percussive and rotary drilling technology has been proposed, and a hydro-hammer with a jet actuator has also been theoretically designed on the basis of the impulse hydro-turbine pressure model. In addition, the performance parameters of the hydro-hammer with a jet actuator have been numerically and experimentally analyzed, and the influence of impact stroke and pumped flow rate on the motion velocity and impact energy of the hydro-hammer has been obtained. Moreover, the designed hydro-hammer with a jet actuator has been applied to hard rock drilling in a trenchless drilling program. The motion velocity of the hydro-hammer ranges from 1.2 m/s to 3.19 m/s with diverse flow rates and impact strokes, and the motion frequency ranges from 10 Hz to 22 Hz. Moreover, the maximum impact energy of the hydro-hammer is 407 J, and the pumped flow rate is 2.3 m3/min. Thus, the average penetration rate of the optimized hydro-hammer improves by over 30% compared to conventional directional drilling in hard rock formations."
https://openalex.org/W2803371816,"This study tested the potential bio-control role of the common native predatory whelk Reishia clavigera on the invasive bivalves Xenostrobus securis and Mytilopsis sallei and the native Brachidontes variabilis in Hong Kong. Predation experiments were conducted in the laboratory under salinity levels of 22‰ and 32‰, as well as under field conditions. The results indicate that the invasive bivalves are more vulnerable to predation than the native bivalve in environments with high salinity, whereas environments with moderately low salinity (22‰) may reduce predation. Because R. clavigera did not show clear prey preference, the low survival of the invasive species might be due to a lack of effective anti-predatory defenses under experimental conditions. These findings could explain the high abundance of the invasive bivalves in disturbed environments in Hong Kong where predation appears to be lower."
https://openalex.org/W2804058505,"The semi-enclosed nature and estuarine characteristics, together with its strongly alternating bathymetry, make the Baltic Sea prone to much stronger interannual variations in the abiotic environment, than other spawning habitats of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Processes determining salinity and oxygen conditions in the basins are influenced both by long term gradual climate change, e.g. global warming, but also by short-term meteorological variations and events. Specifically one main factor influencing cod spawning conditions, the advection of highly saline and well-oxygenated water masses from the North Sea, is observed in irregular frequencies and causes strong interannual variations in stock productivity. This study investigates the possibility to use the available hydrographic process knowledge to predict the annual spawning conditions for Eastern Baltic cod in its most important spawning ground, the Bornholm Basin, only by salinity measurements from a specific location in the western Baltic. Such a prediction could serve as an environmental early warning indicator to inform stock assessment and management. Here we used a hydrodynamic model to hindcast hydrographic property fields for the last 40+ years. High and significant correlations were found for months early in the year between the 33m salinity level in the Arkona Basin and the oxygen-dependent cod spawning environment in the Bornholm Basin. Direct prediction of the Eastern Baltic cod egg survival in the Bornholm Basin based on salinity values in the Arkona Basin at the 33 m depth level is shown to be possible for eggs spawned by mid-age and young females, which currently predominate the stock structure. We recommend to routinely perform short-term predictions of the Eastern Baltic cod spawning environment, in order to generate environmental information highly relevant for stock dynamics. Our statistical approach offers the opportunity to make best use of permanently existing infrastructure in the western Baltic to timely provide scientific knowledge on the spawning conditions of Eastern Baltic cod. Furthermore it could be a tool to assist ecosystem-based fisheries management with a cost-effective implementation by including the short term predictions as a simple indicator in the annual assessments."

We investigate what effect this change in policy is likely to have on HIV incidence, morbidity, and programme costs, and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the change over different time horizons.We used a complex individual-based model of HIV transmission and antiretroviral therapy scale-up in Uganda. 100 model fits were generated by fitting the model to 51 demographic, sexual behaviour, and epidemiological calibration targets, varying 96 input parameters, using history matching with model emulation. An additional 19 cost and disability weight parameters were varied during the analysis of the model results. For each model fit, the model was run to 2030, with and without the change in threshold to 500 cells/μl.The change in threshold led to a 9.7% (90% plausible range: 4.3%-15.0%) reduction in incidence in 2030, and averted 278,944 (118,452-502,790) DALYs, at a total cost of $28M (-$142M to +$195M). The cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted fell over time, from $3238 (-$125 to +$29,969) in 2014 to $100 (-$499 to +$785) in 2030. The change in threshold was cost-effective (cost <3×Uganda's per capita GDP per DALY averted) by 2018, and highly cost-effective (cost <Uganda's per capita GDP per DALY averted) by 2022, for more than 50% of parameter sets.Model results suggest that the change in threshold is unlikely to have been cost-effective to date, but is likely to be highly cost-effective in Uganda by 2030. The time horizon needs to be chosen carefully when projecting intervention effects. Large amounts of uncertainty in our results demonstrates the need to comprehensively incorporate uncertainties in model parameterisation."
https://openalex.org/W2803498089,"There is extensive literature addressing acceptable practices of colostrum distribution to new-born calves; however, no economic analyses are available concerning the profitability of this practice. Moreover, the health standards associated with colostrum management have been defined through the observation of reference farms without explicit reference to economic assessments. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the profitability of farm colostrum management and to define the optimal economic situations for given livestock systems and farm situations. The herd-level net value was calculated using the value of calf products, the cost of passive transfer failure and the cost of prevention. This value was determined for various beef and dairy scenarios and the various time periods spent managing colostrum. The maximal net values defined the optimal economic situations and enabled the determination of the optimal times for colostrum management and respective health standards (i.e., the prevalence of disorders at optimum). The results showed that the optimal time farmers should spend on colostrum management is approximately 15 min per calf. Furthermore, farmers should err on the side of spending too much time (> 15 min) on colostrum management rather than not enough, unless the cost of labour is high. This is all the more true that potential long term consequences of passive transfer failure on milk yields were not accounted for here due to scarcity of data, leading to consider this time threshold (15 min) as a minimal recommendation. This potential underestimation may arise from the greater nutrient content and bioactive compounds identified in colostrum although the passive immune transfer is here defined through immunoglobulins only. The present results show that for small farms that cannot hire colostrum managers, this work can be performed by the farmer after subcontracting other tasks. Moreover, the method proposed here—the definition of health standards through economic optimisation—is a promising approach to analysing health conventions in the cattle industry."
