https://openalex.org/W1999456501,"EVIDENCE is mounting that in mice, certain specific immunological effector functions of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes are efficient only when donors of T cells and the cells with which they interact have at least a part of the H-2 gene complex in common1–8. Examples include T helper function in vivo and in vitro1–3, cytotoxicity mediated by T cells against virus-infected4–6 or TNP-modified7 target cells in vitro, immunopathology mediated by T cells4, or protection against bacterial8 and viral infection6 in vivo. This requirement for H-2 compatibility has been studied in detail by measuring the cytotoxicity of T cells from donors immunised with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) or ectromelia virus using target cells infected with the homologus virus."

Recently, the presence of ribitol was found in preparations of type b capsular antigen. Our analytical results show equimolar proportions of ribose, ribitol, and phosphate. Periodate oxidation studies, paper chromatography of acidic and alkaline hydrolysates, and NMR spectral data indicate the structure of the capular antigen of H. influenzae b, strain Eagan to be a polyribosylribitol phosphate polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2015192887,"VARIOUS virus infections lead to the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CL), which are capable of killing virus-infected target cells1–4. Specific lysis of target cells infected with 51Cr-labelled vaccinia virus could be observed when investigating the cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction to vaccinia virus5; the CL could be characterised as a T cell. The sensitised lymphocytes from C3H mice could only kill syngeneic L929 cells infected with vaccinia virus, whereas lysis by sensitised lymphocytes derived from DBA/2 mice was restricted to the syngeneic infected mastocytoma P815X2 cells. In the lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection the target cell lysis was shown to be restricted by H-2 antigen6. We report here experiments with primary fibroblasts of the mouse strains C3H, DBA/2 and the (C3H × DBA/2)F1 generation were designed to affirm that the effector phase of virus-specific lysis of target cells mediated by T cells is restricted by H-2 antigen even in the vaccinia virus infection. Further experiments with H-2 alloantisera were performed to indicate the close local relationship between H-2 antigens and viral surface antigens."

https://openalex.org/W1968330498,"The proportion of hnRNA processed into cytoplasmic mRNA in resting and growing 3T3 and 3T6 cells has been investigated by measuring the efficiency of transfer of nuclear poly(A) to the cytoplasm. When nuclear poly(A) is either labeled continuously with precursor or pulse labeled and then chased with cordycepin, growing cells transfer approximately twice as much of the poly(A) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as do resting cells. When cells undergo a serum-induced transition from the resting to growing state, the efficiency of poly(A) transfer is increased to that characteristic of growing cells by 3 hr after the addition of the serum. On the other hand, the proportion of hnRNA which is polyadenylated and the total nuclear poly(A) content are the same in resting and growing cells. It appears that the principal means by which the cell regulates its poly(A)+ mRNA content in the growing and resting states is by regulating the efficiency with which nuclear poly(A)+ RNA is converted to cytoplasmic mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1977530071,"When viewed by scanning electron microscopy human lymphocytes fixed in suspension and processed with minimal cell loss appear uniformly covered with short microvilli. Contrary to previous reports, lymphocytes from subpopulations selectively enriched for T cells are villous and indistinguishable from B lymphocytes. Whereas lymphocyte surface architecture can change rapidly and substantially in response to environmental modifications, such as contact with an underlying surface, these alterations are similar for both B and T cells and do not serve to distinguish these subpopulations."

https://openalex.org/W1965382522,"Thymopoietin is a polypeptide hormone of the thymus that consists of a 49 amino acid polypeptide chain of 5562 daltons. A peptide corresponding to positions 29-41 of bovine thymopoietin II was synthesized by the Merrifield solid-phase technique. This peptide was shown to have a purity (correct sequence) of 96% by amino acid and C terminal analyses and by a complete determination of the amino acid sequence by manual Edman degradations. It displayed a selectivity of action similar to that of thymopoietin itself, inducing the differentiation of T lymphocytes but not of complement receptor (CR+) B lymphocytes. Although a number of substances induce the differentiation of both T cells and CR+B cells under the conditions of assay in vitro, only thymopoietin and the synthetic peptide described in this report have been shown to induce the differentiation of T cells selectively. Our data establish that the key residues involved in the active site of thymopoietin are present within a synthetic polypeptide which constitutes a minor portion of the amino acid sequence of thymopoietin. Since this peptide had 3% activity by comparison with thymopoietin, the tertiary structure of thymopoietin may be required for optimal configuration of the active site to produce full biological activity."

With either mitogen, no significant difference in cellular incorporation of [3H]thymidine was noted between the groups. These results were interpreted to indicate that the functional status of blood lymphocytes was not altered by long-term smoking of marihuana."
https://openalex.org/W1601199599,"The light-activated phosphorylation of rod outer segment membranes may be an intermediary process controlling photoreceptor responses. We have measured phosphorylation of the opsin moiety of rhodopsin in isolated frog retinas and in rod outer segment suspensions and have demonstrated a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation sequence in the suspensions. The results indicate that these reactions take place in vivo and may be physiologically relevant. Extraction of a protein kinase activity from rod outer segment membranes renders the membranes incapable of phosphorylation, but the light-activated reaction can be reconstituted by mixing the soluble extract and the depleted membranes. Illumination of the extract is without effect. Thus the light activation mechanism resides in the membranes. Regeneration of rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis retinal does not influence the phosphorylation. Once activated, the reaction may use either rhodopsin or opsin as the substrate. Furthermore, 11-cis retinal regenerates rhodopsin from phosphorylated opsin without releasing bound phosphate. The isolated rod outer segment which contains regenerated rhodopsin thus differs from one that is dark adapted in that phosphate can remain bound and the phosphorylation reaction remains activated. Dark adaptation in vivo must include at least two membrane associated reactions beyond regeneration of rhodopsin's spectral properties: dephosphorylation, and the inactivation of the phosphorylation process."

https://openalex.org/W1971594342,"MAREK'S disease virus (MDV) of chickens induces lymphomas and other lymphoproliferative changes, which, depending on the virulence of the strain used, may terminate in paralysis and death. Chickens genetically selected for resistance, however, are refractory to clinical MD and most chickens that are fully susceptible when young develop resistance as they become older. Resistance acquired with age is expressed through lesion regression1,2. Our studies with genetic and age resistance established that humoral immunity did not play a major role in either type of resistance3,4 and now we present evidence that the thymus-dependent immune system is of principal importance in the natural resistance of old chickens."

https://openalex.org/W2085329722,"VON WILLEBRAND'S disease (VWD) is an autosomally inherited disorder characterised by low factor VIII activity (antihaemophilic factor, AHF), prolonged bleeding time, reduced retention of platelets in a glass bead column and abnormal distocetin-induced platelet aggregation. The prolonged bleeding time in VWD has been attributed to the absence of a plasma factor, the von Willebrand factor (VWF), as shown by a correction of the bleeding time after infusion of normal and haemophilic plasmas1. Addition of purified factor VIII in vitro specifically corrects the abnormal platelet retention and ristocetin aggregation in VWD2–5, whereas transfusion of similar material into dogs with VWD also corrects the prolonged bleeding time (B.N.B., W. J. Dodds, J. A. van Mourik, J.J.S and W. P. Webster, unpublished). This led to the suggestion that factor VIII is closely related if not identical to VWF, although dissociation of factor VIII procoagulant activity from factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII-RA) is observed in certain conditions6,7. The plasma concentration of F VIII-RA is usually reduced in VWD suggesting a reduced synthesis of factor VIII (VWF)8. In contrast to this we now report the presence of normal concentrations of F VIII-RA in platelets of patients with VWD. This F VIII-RA supported aggregation induced by ristocetin in a washed platelet system9, a property of factor VIII which has been attributed to VWF activity."

https://openalex.org/W49658971,"Intestinal transport and cellular uptake of calcium were studied in vitro in ileal segments obtained from calciferol (vitamin D)-deficient (minus D3) chicks or in calciferol-treated chicks (+ D3). When calcium flux (J) was measured in both the mucosal yields serosal (J-ms) and serosal yields mucosal (J-sm) directions it was found that calcium transport in the +D3 system was an active process. Calcium was not actively transported in the minus D3 system or by either the +D3 or minus D3 serosal tissues which underlie the intestinal mucosa tissue. It was also found that the serosal tissue was not the rate-limiting step in calcium translocation. When calcium uptake was measured at the mucosal or brush border surface it was found to be a cation-oriented, saturable process in both the +D3 and minus D3 systems and was enhanced by calciferol supplementation. The rate of uptake was found to exhibit a two component transport phenomenon, one a saturable process at low Ca2+ concentrations and the other a linear of diffusion process at higher Ca2+ concentrations (greater than 5 mM). The polyene antibiotic, filipin, was used to study the transport and uptake of calcium in both the +D and minusD chick ileum in vitro. Filipin (10 mug/ml), when added in vitro to solutions bathing the mucosal surface of the ileum, stimulated the calcium flux, J-ms, of minus D ileal tissue by 150 to 200%, but had little or no stimulatory effect on J-ms of +D3 ileal tissue. However, in contrast it stimulated calcium uptake across the mucosal membrane in both the +D3 and minus D3 ileal tissue (50 to 100%). The effect of filipin is specific for calcium uptake as compared to Rb+, P-i, SO4(2-), glycerol, thiourea, and urea uptake. Isolated brush borders from +D3 chicks were found to bind calcium to a greater extent than the minus D3 brush borders, but both membrane fractions had the same cholesterol content. The sum of this and other evidence suggests that of uptake of calcium is a calciferol-mediated event which is not the rate-limiting step in the total transport of this ion across the intestinal epithelial cell. The filipin effect appears to affect a structural reorganization of the brush border membrane in both the +D3 and minus D3 membranes in a manner specific for calcium translocation. It now appears that filipin treatment somehow makes both transport systems more efficient in the uptake of calcium, but in a manner independent of the mode of action of calciferol. However, these data suggest that other components associated with calcium uptake are calciferol-dependent in an as yet unknown fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2070034611,"A behavioral assay was developed based on differential tendency of a protozoan to attach to an agar gel containing the test substance. The heterotrophic marine dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium (Gyrodinium) cohnii responded negatively (less tendency to attach) to epinephrine at concentrations above 5 X 10(-15)M and to norepinephrine at concentrations above 5 X 10(-9)M. Response to choline as choline H2 citrate, choline bitartrate, and choline chloride was negative above 10(-7)M, but response to the choline analog carbachol was positve (greater tendency to attach) in the range 5 X 10(-6) to 5 X 10(-4)M. Other responses to neurochemicals at comparable concentrations were: dopa, betaine, and glycine--positive; L-glutamic acid, tryptophan, putrescine, and taurine--negative. Serotonin was inert, responses to tyrosine and gamma-aminobutyric acid were variable, and phenylalanine (6 X 10(-3)M) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5 X 10(-4)M) were negative only at the highest concentrations tested."

https://openalex.org/W1526321695,"The kinetics of the phosphorolysis of polynucleotide (as differentiated from oligonucleotide) by polynucleotide phosphorylase of Micrococcus luteus has been investigated. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity against either inorganic phosphate or polynucleotide concentration are linear, and furthermore, the affinity of the enzyme for either substrate is unaffected by the presence of the other. dADP, an analogue of ADP product, is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Pi and polynucleotidy. (Ap)tA-cyclic-p is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Pi. The results are almost identical with both primer-independent (Form-I) and primer-dependent (Form-T) enzymes, although the various kinetic constants differ. On the vasis of these data a rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi mechanism is proposed. The demonstration of two different inhibitor constants for dADP and the difference between the Michaelis and the inhibitor constant for polyadenylic acid in polynucleotide phosphorolysis indicate at least two binding sites for polyadenylic acid and dADP on M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase. Its is suggested that in the phosphorolysis of long chain polymers the second binding site permits the polynucleotide to snap right back into position after removal of I mononucleotide unit and thus leads to the observed processive degradation. A general discussion of oligonucleotide and polynucleotide phosphorolysis and the differences between Form-I and Form-T enzymes in de novo synthesis and degradation of polynucleotides is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1589246527,"Proton NMR spectroscopy was used to study the binding of adenosine, 5'-deoxyadenosine, adenine, and ethanolamine to the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. Broadening of ligand resonances in the presence of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase indicated that adenosine, 5'-deoxyadenosine, and ethanolamine all formed complexes with the enzyme (KD(mM) = 3.5, 3.0, and 2.5 respectively). The methyl group of enzyme-bound 5'-deoxyadenosine rotated at a rate exceeding 10(7) revolutions/s. Adenine did not appear to bind to the enzyme. Rates of dissociation of nucleosides from the enzyme were fast on the NMR time scale, precluding measurements of rate constants for the binding reaction. The departure of ethanolamine was slow, however, permitting their determination. The values for these rate constants were: k1 = 4.4 times 10(5) M-1 S-1; k-1 = 1.1 times 10(3) S-1. Addition of 1 mol of cyanocobalamin/mol of active sites led to narrowing of the enzyme-broadened ligand resonances. With 5'-deoxyadenosine, linewidths still exceeded those of the free ligand, indicating that binding to enzyme was weakened but not abolished. The KD for this nucleoside in the presence of CNCbl was 8.0 mM. With ethanolamine and adenosine, however, linewidths reverted to values characteristic of the unbound ligand, indicating either that CNCbl greatly lowered the rate of dissociation of the ligand or displaced the ligand from the enzyme. A decision between these two possibilities could not be made from the data at hand, although analogy with the situation obtaining with 5'-deoxyadenosine suggests that adenosine is displaced from the enzyme by CNCbl. 5'-Deoxyadenosine inhibited catalytic activity of the enzyme, competing with adenosylcobalamin (Ki = 2.7 mM). Adenosine had no effect, despite NMR evidence indicating that it formed a complex with free enzyme. These experiments showed that ethanolamine ammonia-lyase possesses binding sites for adenine nucleosides, a class of compounds chemically related to the Cobeta-ligand of the cofactor, as well as for ethanolamine. Binding to the enzyme has now been demonstrated for all three categories of low molecular weight compounds thought to be involved in the reaction; namely, substrate (ethanolamine), corrin, and adenine nucleoside."
