https://openalex.org/W2499800833,"Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal ‘fingerprint’ of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease. A detailed parcellation (map) of the human cerebral cortex has been obtained by integrating multi-modal imaging data, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the resulting freely available resources will enable detailed comparative studies of the human brain in health, ageing and disease. For more than a century, neuroscientists have sought to subdivide the human cerebral cortex into a patchwork of anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Until now such maps have relied largely on only a single property such as micro-architecture or functional imaging, have been based on a relatively small number of individuals, and have usually been blurry due to misalignment of brain areas from person to person. Matthew Glasser, David Van Essen and colleagues have tackled these deficiencies in a new more 'universal' map of the human cerebral cortex by integrating multi-modal imaging data obtained from 210 healthy subjects and validated on 210 other individuals. The authors propose a total of 180 areas per cerebral hemisphere (97 of them previously unknown) and apply a machine-learning classifier to automatically identify these areas in new subjects, even in individuals with atypical parcellations. This freely available resource will enhance the anatomical accuracy and interpretability of future structural and functional studies of the human brain in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2480697384,"The widespread view of bacteria as strictly pathogenic has given way to an appreciation of the prevalence of some beneficial microbes within the human body. It is perhaps inevitable that some bacteria would evolve to preferentially grow in environments that harbor disease and thus provide a natural platform for the development of engineered therapies. Such therapies could benefit from bacteria that are programmed to limit bacterial growth while continually producing and releasing cytotoxic agents in situ. Here we engineer a clinically relevant bacterium to lyse synchronously ata threshold population density and to release genetically encoded cargo. Following quorum lysis, a small number of surviving bacteria reseed the growing population, thus leading to pulsatile delivery cycles. We used microfluidic devices to characterize the engineered lysis strain and we demonstrate its potential as a drug delivery platform via co-culture with human cancer cells in vitro. Asa proof of principle, we tracked the bacterial population dynamics in ectopic syngeneic colorectal tumours in mice via a luminescent reporter. The lysis strain exhibits pulsatile population dynamics in vivo, with mean bacterial luminescence that remained two orders of magnitude lower than an unmodified strain. Finally, guided by previous findings that certain bacteria can enhance the efficacy of standard therapies, we orally administered the lysis strain alone or in combination with a clinical chemotherapeutic to a syngeneic mouse transplantation model of hepatic colorectal metastases. We found that the combination of both circuit-engineered bacteria and chemotherapy leads to a notable reduction of tumour activity along with a marked survival benefit over either therapy alone.Our approach establishes a methodology for leveraging the tools of synthetic biology to exploit the natural propensity for certain bacteria to colonize disease sites."
https://openalex.org/W2497350880,"Atherosclerotic lesions in mice and humans switch on a ‘don’t eat me’ signal—expression of CD47—that prevents effective removal of diseased tissue; anti-CD47 antibody therapy can normalize this defective efferocytosis, with beneficial results in several mouse models of atherosclerosis. Nicholas Leeper and colleagues demonstrate that atherosclerotic lesions in mice and humans switch on a 'don't eat me' signal — in the form of expression of the anti-phagocytic transmembrane protein CD47 — that prevents effective removal of diseased tissue. They show that administration of anti-CD47 antibodies can normalize this defective phagocytic clearance (or ‘efferocytosis’) with beneficial results in several mouse models of atherosclerosis. These results suggest that targeted pro-efferocytic therapies could have potential in cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is the disease process that underlies heart attack and stroke1. Advanced lesions at risk of rupture are characterized by the pathological accumulation of diseased vascular cells and apoptotic cellular debris2. Why these cells are not cleared remains unknown3. Here we show that atherogenesis is associated with upregulation of CD47, a key anti-phagocytic molecule that is known to render malignant cells resistant to programmed cell removal, or ‘efferocytosis’4,5,6,7. We find that administration of CD47-blocking antibodies reverses this defect in efferocytosis, normalizes the clearance of diseased vascular tissue, and ameliorates atherosclerosis in multiple mouse models. Mechanistic studies implicate the pro-atherosclerotic factor TNF-α as a fundamental driver of impaired programmed cell removal, explaining why this process is compromised in vascular disease. Similar to recent observations in cancer5, impaired efferocytosis appears to play a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease, but is not a fixed defect and may represent a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2463545287,"An in-depth analysis of the structure, chromatin accessibility and expression status of the mouse inactive X (Xi) chromosome provides insights into the regulation of Xi chromosome structure, its dependence on the macrosatellite DXZ4 region, the Xist non-coding RNA, as well as the basis for topologically associating domain (TAD) formation on the Xi. During female development, X-chromosome inactivation is triggered by upregulation of the non-coding Xist RNA from one of the two X chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown a loss of local structure on the inactive X (Xi) and formation of large mega-domains, separated by a region containing the DXZ4 macrosatellite. These authors investigate the structure, chromatin accessibility and expression status of the mouse Xi using allele-specific Hi-C, ATAC–seq and RNA–seq in embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The Xi in NPCs lacks topologically associating domains (TADs) except around genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that TAD formation is driven by gene activity. The DXZ4-containing region and Xist shape the mega-domain structure of the Xi. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) involves major reorganization of the X chromosome as it becomes silent and heterochromatic. During female mammalian development, XCI is triggered by upregulation of the non-coding Xist RNA from one of the two X chromosomes. Xist coats the chromosome in cis and induces silencing of almost all genes via its A-repeat region1,2, although some genes (constitutive escapees) avoid silencing in most cell types, and others (facultative escapees) escape XCI only in specific contexts3. A role for Xist in organizing the inactive X (Xi) chromosome has been proposed4,5,6. Recent chromosome conformation capture approaches have revealed global loss of local structure on the Xi chromosome and formation of large mega-domains, separated by a region containing the DXZ4 macrosatellite7,8,9,10. However, the molecular architecture of the Xi chromosome, in both the silent and expressed regions, remains unclear. Here we investigate the structure, chromatin accessibility and expression status of the mouse Xi chromosome in highly polymorphic clonal neural progenitors (NPCs) and embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate a crucial role for Xist and the DXZ4-containing boundary in shaping Xi chromosome structure using allele-specific genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis, an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC–seq) and RNA sequencing. Deletion of the boundary disrupts mega-domain formation, and induction of Xist RNA initiates formation of the boundary and the loss of DNA accessibility. We also show that in NPCs, the Xi chromosome lacks active/inactive compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs), except around genes that escape XCI. Escapee gene clusters display TAD-like structures and retain DNA accessibility at promoter-proximal and CTCF-binding sites. Furthermore, altered patterns of facultative escape genes in different neural progenitor clones are associated with the presence of different TAD-like structures after XCI. These findings suggest a key role for transcription and CTCF in the formation of TADs in the context of the Xi chromosome in neural progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2504220478,"Developmental signals of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt families are transduced across the membrane by Frizzledclass G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) composed of both a heptahelical transmembrane domain (TMD) and an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). How the large extracellular domains of GPCRs regulate signalling by the TMD is unknown. We present crystal structures of the Hh signal transducer and oncoprotein Smoothened, a GPCR that contains two distinct ligand-binding sites: one in its TMD and one in the CRD. The CRD is stacked a top the TMD, separated by an intervening wedge-like linker domain. Structure-guided mutations show that the interface between the CRD, linker domain and TMD stabilizes the inactive state of Smoothened. Unexpectedly, we find a cholesterol molecule bound to Smoothened in the CRD binding site. Mutations predicted to prevent cholesterol binding impair the ability of Smoothened to transmit native Hh signals. Binding of a clinically used antagonist, vismodegib, to the TMD induces a conformational change that is propagated to the CRD, resulting in loss of cholesterol from the CRD-linker domain-TMD interface. Our results clarify the structural mechanism by which the activity of a GPCR is controlled by ligand-regulated interactions between its extracellular and transmembrane domains."

https://openalex.org/W2417256030,"This paper reports Hubble Space Telescope observations of the inner two of three Earth-sized exoplanets that were recently discovered close to the habitable zone of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The combined transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 b and c was obtained during their simultaneous transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum effectively rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet, but they could have a variety of other types of atmosphere, from one consisting mainly of cloud-free water vapour to a Venus-like atmosphere. Three Earth-sized exoplanets were recently discovered close to the habitable zone1,2 of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (ref. 3). The nature of these planets has yet to be determined, as their masses remain unmeasured and no observational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding ultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST-1 planets are the first transiting example. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range, from depleted to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres4,5,6,7,8. Here we report observations of the combined transmission spectrum of the two inner planets during their simultaneous transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at ≥10σ levels; TRAPPIST-1 b and c are therefore unlikely to have an extended gas envelope as they occupy a region of parameter space in which high-altitude cloud/haze formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres9. Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless transmission spectrum—from a cloud-free water-vapour atmosphere to a Venus-like one."
https://openalex.org/W2481900801,"Feedforward and feedback synaptic pathways shape how neural activity evolves across cortical areas, but they are difficult to monitor using traditional methods during behavior. The authors use pathway-specific and cellular-resolution in vivo imaging to quantify sensory and decision-related neural activity both within and propagating between two cortical areas critical for touch perception. The brain transforms physical sensory stimuli into meaningful perceptions. In animals making choices about sensory stimuli, neuronal activity in successive cortical stages reflects a progression from sensation to decision. Feedforward and feedback pathways connecting cortical areas are critical for this transformation. However, the computational functions of these pathways are poorly understood because pathway-specific activity has rarely been monitored during a perceptual task. Using cellular-resolution, pathway-specific imaging, we measured neuronal activity across primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices of mice performing a tactile detection task. S1 encoded the stimulus better than S2, while S2 activity more strongly reflected perceptual choice. S1 neurons projecting to S2 fed forward activity that predicted choice. Activity encoding touch and choice propagated in an S1–S2 loop along feedforward and feedback axons. Our results suggest that sensory inputs converge into a perceptual outcome as feedforward computations are reinforced in a feedback loop."

https://openalex.org/W2467918249,"Recent palaeomagnetic observations report the existence of a magnetic field on Earth that is at least 3.45 billion years old. Compositional buoyancy caused by inner-core growth is the primary driver of Earth's present-day geodynamo, but the inner core is too young to explain the existence of a magnetic field before about one billion years ago. Theoretical models propose that the exsolution of magnesium oxide--the major constituent of Earth's mantle--from the core provided a major source of the energy required to drive an early dynamo, but experimental evidence for the incorporation of mantle components into the core has been lacking. Indeed, terrestrial core formation occurred in the early molten Earth by gravitational segregation of immiscible metal and silicate melts, transporting iron-loving (siderophile) elements from the silicate mantle to the metallic core and leaving rock-loving (lithophile) mantle components behind. Here we present experiments showing that magnesium oxide dissolves in core-forming iron melt at very high temperatures. Using core-formation models, we show that extreme events during Earth's accretion (such as the Moon-forming giant impact) could have contributed large amounts of magnesium to the early core. As the core subsequently cooled, exsolution of buoyant magnesium oxide would have taken place at the core–mantle boundary, generating a substantial amount of gravitational energy as a result of compositional buoyancy. This amount of energy is comparable to, if not more than, that produced by inner-core growth, resolving the conundrum posed by the existence of an ancient magnetic field prior to the formation of the inner core."

https://openalex.org/W2491340588,"Occupational exposure to airborne nickel is associated with an elevated risk for respiratory tract diseases including lung cancer. Therefore, the increased production of Ni-containing nanoparticles necessitates a thorough assessment of their physical, chemical, as well as toxicological properties. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the characteristics of nickel metal (Ni) and nickel oxide (NiO) particles with a focus on Ni release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Four Ni-containing particles of both nano-size (Ni-n and NiO-n) and micron-size (Ni-m1 and Ni-m2) were tested. The released amount of Ni in solution was notably higher in artificial lysosomal fluid (e.g. 80–100 wt% for metallic Ni) than in cell medium after 24h (ca. 1–3 wt% for all particles). Each of the particles was taken up by the cells within 4 h and they remained in the cells to a high extent after 24 h post-incubation. Thus, the high dissolution in ALF appeared not to reflect the particle dissolution in the cells. Ni-m1 showed the most pronounced effect on cell viability after 48 h (alamar blue assay) whereas all particles showed increased cytotoxicity in the highest doses (20–40 μg cm2) when assessed by colony forming efficiency (CFE). Interestingly an increased CFE, suggesting higher proliferation, was observed for all particles in low doses (0.1 or 1 μg cm-2). Ni-m1 and NiO-n were the most potent in causing acellular ROS and DNA damage. However, no intracellular ROS was detected for any of the particles. Taken together, micron-sized Ni (Ni-m1) was more reactive and toxic compared to the nano-sized Ni. Furthermore, this study underlines that the low dose effect in terms of increased proliferation observed for all particles should be further investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2502045296,"The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis holds that our thoughts are shaped by our native language, and that speakers of different languages therefore think differently. This hypothesis is controversial in part because it appears to deny the possibility of a universal groundwork for human cognition, and in part because some findings taken to support it have not reliably replicated. We argue that considering this hypothesis through the lens of probabilistic inference has the potential to resolve both issues, at least with respect to certain prominent findings in the domain of color cognition. We explore a probabilistic model that is grounded in a presumed universal perceptual color space and in language-specific categories over that space. The model predicts that categories will most clearly affect color memory when perceptual information is uncertain. In line with earlier studies, we show that this model accounts for language-consistent biases in color reconstruction from memory in English speakers, modulated by uncertainty. We also show, to our knowledge for the first time, that such a model accounts for influential existing data on cross-language differences in color discrimination from memory, both within and across categories. We suggest that these ideas may help to clarify the debate over the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2476787608,"In this study, we characterized the glycome of cervical-vaginal fluid, collected with a Catamenial cup. We quantified: glycosidase levels; sialic acid and high mannose specific lectin binding; mucins, MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC7; and albumin in the samples collected. These data were analyzed in the context of hormonal status (day of menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception use) and role, if any, of the type of the vaginal microflora present. When the Nugent score was used to stratify the subjects by microflora as normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis, several important differences were observed. The activities of four of six glycosidases in the samples from women with bacterial vaginosis were significantly increased when compared to normal or intermediate women: sialidase, P = <0.001; α-galactosidase, P = 0.006; β-galactosidase, P = 0.005; α-glucosidase, P = 0.056. Sialic acid binding sites as measured by two lectins, Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra binding, were significantly lower in women with BV compared to women with normal and intermediate scores (P = <0.0001 and 0.008 respectively). High mannose binding sites, a measure of innate immunity were also significantly lower in women with BV (P = <0.001). Additionally, we observed significant increases in MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC7 concentrations in women with BV (P = <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, 0.02 respectively). Among normal women we found that the membrane bound mucin MUC4 and the secreted MUC5AC were decreased in postmenopausal women (P = 0.02 and 0.07 respectively), while MUC7 (secreted) was decreased in women using levonorgestrel-containing IUDs (P = 0.02). The number of sialic acid binding sites was lower in the postmenopausal group (P = 0.04), but the number of high mannose binding sites, measured with Griffithsin, was not significantly different among the 6 hormonal groups. The glycosidase levels in the cervical-vaginal mucus were rather low in the groups, with exception of α-glucosidase activity that was much lower in the postmenopausal group (P<0.001). These studies present compelling evidence that the vaginal ecosystem responds to the presence of different vaginal microorganisms. These effects were so influential that it required us to remove subjects with BV for data interpretation of the impact of hormones. We also suggest that certain changes occurring in vaginal/cervical proteins are due to bacteria or their products. Therefore, the quantitation of vaginal mucins and lectin binding offers a new method to monitor bacteria-host interactions in the female reproductive tract. The data suggest that some of the changes in these components are the result of host processing, such as the increases in mucin content, while the microflora is responsible for the increases in glycosidases and the decreases in lectin binding. The methods should be considered a valid marker for insult to the female genital tract."
https://openalex.org/W2519598449,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) binds to hyaluronan and can reorganize/stabilize its structure, also enhancing the binding of this glycosaminoglycan to its cell surface receptor, CD44. TSG-6 is rapidly up-regulated in response to inflammatory cytokines protecting tissues from the damaging effects of inflammation. Despite TSG-6 treatment having been shown to improve outcomes in an experimental model of traumatic brain injury, TSG-6 expression has not been extensively studied in the central nervous system (CNS). We hereby analyzed the expression profile of TSG-6 in the developing CNS and following injury. We show that TSG-6 is expressed in the rat CNS by GFAP(+) and CD44(+) astrocytes, solely in the mature brain and spinal cord, and is not present during the development of the CNS. TSG-6(-/-) mice present a reduced number of GFAP(+) astrocytes when compared with the littermate TSG-6(+/-) mice. TSG-6 expression is drastically up-regulated after injury, and the TSG-6 protein is present within the glial scar, potentially coordinating and stabilizing the formation of this hyaluronan-rich matrix. This study shows that TSG-6 is expressed in the CNS, suggesting a role for TSG-6 in astrocyte activation and tissue repair. We hypothesize that within this context TSG-6 could participate in the formation of the glial scar and confer anti-inflammatory properties. Further studies are required to elucidate the therapeutic potential of targeting TSG-6 after CNS injury to promote its protective effects while reducing the inhibitory properties of the glial scar in axon regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2483811059,"Disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly variable and predicting prognosis is notoriously challenging. Patients' prognosis beliefs, responses to prognostic uncertainty and experiences of prognosis-related communication with healthcare professionals (HCPs) have received little study. These issues have implications for patients' psychological adjustment and are important in the context of the recent development of personalised prognosis forecasting tools. This study explored patient perspectives on the experience of prognostic uncertainty, the formation of expectations about personal prognosis and the nature of received and desired prognosis communication.15 MS patients participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews which were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.Six themes captured key aspects of the data: Experiencing unsatisfactory communication with HCPs, Appreciating and accepting prognostic uncertainty, Trying to stay present-focused, Forming and editing personal prognosis beliefs, Ambivalence towards forecasting the future, and Prognosis information delivery. MS patients report having minimal communication with HCPs about prognosis. Over time MS patients appear to develop expectations about their disease trajectories, but do so with minimal HCP input. Provision of prognosis information by HCPs seems to run counter to patients' attempts to remain present-focused. Patients are often ambivalent about prognosis forecasting and consider it emotionally dangerous and of circumscribed usefulness.HCPs must carefully consider whether, when and how to share prognosis information with patients; specific training may be beneficial. Future research should confirm findings about limited HCP-patient communication, distinguish predictors of patients' attitudes towards prognostication and identify circumstances under which prognostic forecasting benefits patients."
https://openalex.org/W2490921552,"Fungal secretomes contain a wide range of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, including cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and lignin-degrading accessory enzymes, that synergistically drive litter decomposition in the environment. While secretome studies of model organisms such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Aspergillus species have greatly expanded our knowledge of these enzymes, few have extended secretome characterization to environmental isolates or conducted side-by-side comparisons of diverse species. Thus, the mechanisms of carbon degradation by many ubiquitous soil fungi remain poorly understood. Here we use a combination of LC-MS/MS, genomic, and bioinformatic analyses to characterize and compare the protein composition of the secretomes of four recently isolated, cosmopolitan, Mn(II)-oxidizing Ascomycetes (Alternaria alternata SRC1lrK2f, Stagonospora sp. SRC1lsM3a, Pyrenochaeta sp. DS3sAY3a, and Paraconiothyrium sporulosum AP3s5-JAC2a). We demonstrate that the organisms produce a rich yet functionally similar suite of extracellular enzymes, with species-specific differences in secretome composition arising from unique amino acid sequences rather than overall protein function. Furthermore, we identify not only a wide range of carbohydrate-active enzymes that can directly oxidize recalcitrant carbon, but also an impressive suite of redox-active accessory enzymes that suggests a role for Fenton-based hydroxyl radical formation in indirect, non-specific lignocellulose attack. Our findings highlight the diverse oxidative capacity of these environmental isolates and enhance our understanding of the role of filamentous Ascomycetes in carbon turnover in the environment."

We investigated the prevalence and correlates of food insecurity among a cohort of homeless adults with mental illness in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.Data collected from baseline questionnaires in the Vancouver At Home study were analysed to calculate the prevalence of food insecurity within the sample (n = 421). A modified version of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Adult Food Security Survey Module was used to ascertain food insecurity. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine potential correlates of food insecurity.The prevalence of food insecurity was 64%.

Younger age, needing health care but not receiving it, poorer subjective mental health, having spent over $500 for drugs and alcohol in the past month, HIV/AIDS and having gone to a drop-in centre, community meal centre or program/food bank each increased odds of food insecurity, while less than high school completion and heart disease each decreased odds of food insecurity.

https://openalex.org/W2480635284,"It is important to account for the movement behaviour of fishes when designing effective marine protected areas (MPAs). Fish movements occur across different spatial and temporal scales and understanding the variety of movements is essential to make correct management decisions. This study describes in detail the movement patterns of an economically and commercially important species, Diplodus sargus, within a well-enforced Mediterranean MPA. We monitored horizontal and vertical movements of 41 adult individuals using passive acoustic telemetry for up to one year. We applied novel analysis and visualization techniques to get a comprehensive view of a wide range of movements. D. sargus individuals were highly territorial, moving within small home ranges (< 1 km2), inside which they displayed repetitive diel activity patterns. Extraordinary movements beyond the ordinary home range were observed under two specific conditions. First, during stormy events D. sargus presented a sheltering behaviour, moving to more protected places to avoid the disturbance. Second, during the spawning season they made excursions to deep areas (> 50 m), where they aggregated to spawn. This study advances our understanding about the functioning of an established MPA and provides important insights into the biology and management of a small sedentary species, suggesting the relevance of rare but important fish behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2480230194,"The enzyme encoded by the ALOX15B gene has been linked to the development of atherosclerotic plaques in humans and in a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia. In vitro, these enzymes, which share 78% sequence identity, generate distinct products from their substrate arachidonic acid: the human enzyme, a 15-S-hydroperoxy product; and the murine enzyme, an 8-S-product. We probed the activities of these enzymes with nanodiscs as membrane mimics to determine whether they can access substrate esterified in a bilayer and characterized their activities at the membrane interface. We observed that both enzymes transform phospholipid-esterified arachidonic acid to a 15-S-product. Moreover, when expressed in transfected HEK cells, both enzymes result in significant increases in the amounts of 15-hydroxyderivatives of eicosanoids detected. In addition, we show that 15-LOX-2 is distributed at the plasma membrane when the HEK293 cells are stimulated by the addition Ca2+ ionophore and that cellular localization is dependent upon the presence of a putative membrane insertion loop. We also report that sequence differences between the human and mouse enzymes in this loop appear to confer distinct mechanisms of enzyme-membrane interaction for the homologues.

In vitro, these enzymes, which share 78% sequence identity, generate distinct products from their substrate arachidonic acid: the human enzyme, a 15-S-hydroperoxy product; and the murine enzyme, an 8-S-product. We probed the activities of these enzymes with nanodiscs as membrane mimics to determine whether they can access substrate esterified in a bilayer and characterized their activities at the membrane interface. We observed that both enzymes transform phospholipid-esterified arachidonic acid to a 15-S-product. Moreover, when expressed in transfected HEK cells, both enzymes result in significant increases in the amounts of 15-hydroxyderivatives of eicosanoids detected. In addition, we show that 15-LOX-2 is distributed at the plasma membrane when the HEK293 cells are stimulated by the addition Ca2+ ionophore and that cellular localization is dependent upon the presence of a putative membrane insertion loop. We also report that sequence differences between the human and mouse enzymes in this loop appear to confer distinct mechanisms of enzyme-membrane interaction for the homologues.

Macrophages that take up LDL laden with oxidized lipids are transformed to foam cells, an event that leads to further inflammation and apoptosis and results in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Recently, Magnusson et al. (6Magnusson L.U. Lundqvist A. Karlsson M.N. Skålén K. Levin M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Hultén L.M.

These results suggest that inhibition of 15-LOX-2 is a strategy for mitigating the development of cardiovascular disease. Lipoxygenases oxygenate arachidonic acid (AA) to form a stereo- and regiospecific isomer of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE), and isoforms are named according to which carbon atom is oxygenated (for review see Refs. 7Brash A.R.

In general, within a species, lipoxygenases that differ in regiospecificity share ∼40% sequence identity. In contrast, between-species LOX homologues are expected to share ∼75% or better sequence identity and generate the same HpETE isomer. The mouse homologue of human 15-LOX-2, however, is an 8-LOX (m8S-LOX) with free AA as the substrate, and this altered regiospecificity appears to be unique to the mouse enzyme (9Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Nanney L.B. Brash A.R. Molecular cloning and functional expression of a phorbol ester-inducible 8S-lipoxygenase from mouse skin.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We asked whether at the membrane and in a cellular context the mouse enzyme might also generate a 15-HpETE product. This information might provide insight into interpreting atherosclerosis studies that employ a murine model of hypercholesterolemia. We recently reported the crystal structure of 15-LOX-2 and described a possible membrane insertion loop and open active site on one face of the elongated protein that would appear to make it feasible for the enzyme to access AA esterified in a membrane phospholipid (PL) (10Kobe M.J. Neau D.B. Mitchell C.E. Bartlett S.G. Newcomer M.E. The structure of human 15-lipoxygenase-2 with a substrate mimic.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 8562-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We show that in vitro both m8S-LOX and 15-LOX-2 generate the 15-isomer of the product with PL-esterified substrate in a nanodisc membrane bilayer mimic. However, we observed that the homologues differ in their ability to fully process the discreet pools of substrate in separate nanodiscs. In addition, we report that HEK293 cells transfected to express the mouse-8-S enzyme show elevated levels of 15-peroxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), whereas these products are not observed with enzymes incubated with free PUFA in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrate with immunofluorescence data that 15-LOX-2 localizes to the plasma membrane upon Ca2+ stimulation. Binding of 15-LOX-2 to nanodiscs was previously demonstrated by analytical size exclusion chromatography (10Kobe M.J. Neau D.B. Mitchell C.E. Bartlett S.G. Newcomer M.E. The structure of human 15-lipoxygenase-2 with a substrate mimic.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 8562-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and these results established the conditions to investigate membrane-associated enzyme activity with nanodiscs as substrates. The activities of 15-LOX-2, m8S-LOX, and their loop mutants were monitored with AA covalently attached to phospholipids in nanodiscs containing 25% 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC) as substrate. The product HpETE (or the corresponding alcohol generated by its non-enzymatic reduction, a hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE)) covalently bound to the PL was first detected by electrospray ionization TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 1A, products with molecular weights of m/z 826.6 and 842.6, consistent with the addition of -OH and -OOH, respectively, to SAPC were detected when 15-LOX-2 or m8S-LOX were present in the reaction mixture. The hydroperoxy products are often rapidly reduced to their corresponding alcohols with the extraction procedure employed. Only the peak corresponding to unmodified SAPC (m/z 810.6) was observed in the negative control reactions without 15-LOX-2 or m8S-LOX. In the absence of Ca2+, less product was detected for 15-LOX-2. The regiospecificity of the reaction was established by reverse phase HPLC of the phospholipase A2-cleaved products (Fig. 1B). (Prior to HPLC analysis oxygenated fatty acids are reduced; thus detected products are HETEs rather than HpETES.) When either 15-LOX-2 or m8S-LOX were incubated with PL-esterified-AA containing nanodiscs, only 15-HETE was formed as product, as opposed to 8-HETE or a di-HETE, the products observed with m8S-LOX and free AA (9Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Nanney L.B. Brash A.R. Molecular cloning and functional expression of a phorbol ester-inducible 8S-lipoxygenase from mouse skin.J. Biol.

Inositol-PL are enriched with esterified PUFAs in cells; thus nanodiscs containing PL-esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids carrying an inositol head group were used to generate time course data and measure rate constants for the reaction. HPLC-based time course assays were performed with 15-LOX-2 and m8S-LOX on nanodiscs composed of 40% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 25% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 35% l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids). This commercial phosphatidylinositol contains 17% AA and 13% dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) according to the fatty acid distribution data from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Thus both AA (20:4) and DGLA (20:3) substrates were available in these nanodiscs, creating an opportunity to compare enzyme activities with two substrates. The time course of product formation (both 15-HETE from AA and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE) from DGLA) by m8S-LOX and 15-LOX-2 with these “mixed PI” containing nanodiscs is shown in Fig. 2A. The data were fit to a one-phase association equation using GraphPad Prism. The amount of product formed by 15-LOX-2 was 6–10 times higher than by m8S-LOX, and m8S-LOX generated more product from DGLA even though there was less of this substrate in the nanodiscs. The observed rates of the reactions were 0.0263 ± 0.0017 min−1 for m8S-LOX/15-HETE, 0.0373 ± 0.0035 min−1 for m8S-LOX/15-HETrE, 0.0573 ± 0.0122 min−1 for 15-LOX-2/15-HETE, and 0.0582 ± 0.0107 min−1 for 15-LOX-2/15-HETrE. The l-α-phosphatidylinositol containing nanodiscs were also utilized to compare the wild-type activities of the homologues with those of their loopless counterparts (Δ73–79:15-LOX-2 and Δ74–81:m8S-LOX). In these experiments, the reactions were stopped at 40 min for analysis (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the time course data in Fig. 2A, 15-LOX-2 generated more product (>15-fold) than m8S-LOX for the same amount of substrate in nanodiscs. A possible mechanistic reason for this substantial difference in product formation is discussed below. These data suggest a preference for reaction with PL-DGLA over PL-AA for the mouse enzyme, whereas the activity at the membrane of the human enzyme was highly dependent on the presence of the putative membrane insertion loop. The absence of the putative membrane insertion loop in the human enzyme resulted in a ∼50% decrease in product. As much of a dramatic decrease in product generated by the mouse counterpart was not observed. As a means to probe a head group preference for 15-LOX-2, the amount of product formed from AA-esterified nanodiscs of various head group compositions was evaluated. The 15-LOX-2 products of choline, ethanolamine, and inositol PL that carry stearate and arachidonate acyl groups (SAPC, SAPE, and SAPI, respectively) were measured at two time points of 15 min (Fig. 3A) and 90 min (Fig. 3B). All of the reactions were conducted in the presence and absence of Ca2+. At 15 min, there was a significantly higher amount of product from SAPC. At the later time point, the product from SAPI achieved a very similar level to that from SAPC; however the product from SAPE was still significantly lower. For all head groups, the presence of Ca2+ increased product yields significantly. These results suggested a selectivity, rather than specificity, for head group, which might be explained by enzyme-head group interactions. Enzymes that must access substrate in the bilayer may do so in a processive manner where they are able to move along the membrane to process multiple substrate molecules with a single binding event (scooting mode) or in single turnover mode (hopping mode), in which an enzyme membrane collision is required for each turnover (12Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Interfacial enzymology: the secreted phospholipase A2-paradigm.Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 13Gelb M.H. Min J.H. Jain M.K. Do membrane-bound enzymes access their substrates from the membrane or aqueous phase: interfacial versus non-interfacial enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These modes are readily distinguished in a nanodisc assay by the addition of fresh enzyme or substrate to reactions that have been allowed to go to completion. The addition of enzyme to a completed reaction should result in an increase in product only if enzyme functions in scooting mode and is not able to “hop” between nanodiscs to consume all substrate molecules. In contrast, increased product yields because of nanodisc addition is an indication that the enzyme functions in hopping mode because it can readily translocate to the new nanodiscs provided, and the reaction has gone to completion simply because all substrate has been consumed. Fig. 4 shows the results of such experiments for m8S-LOX and 15-LOX-2. The reactions in the top panel were performed with 3 μm m8S-LOX and 10 μm nanodiscs containing 40% POPC, 25% POPS, and 35% l-α-phosphatidylinositol from bovine liver. After 80 min, when the reaction was almost complete, either more m8S-LOX or nanodiscs were added to the reaction for an additional 80 min. There was more product formed only after addition of more enzyme, which suggested the m8S-LOX remains “stuck” on the nanodisc after substrate was consumed. As a control, EDTA (to promote enzyme release from the bilayer) and free linoleic acid (LA) were added at the end of 80 min to establish that the enzyme was still active, and the corresponding reduced hydroxyl product was observed (Fig. 4, top panel, inset). In comparable reactions with 15-LOX-2 (Fig. 4, bottom panel), only the addition of fresh nanodiscs resulted in further product generated, an indication that the entire available substrate pool had been consumed by 15-LOX-2. Thus 15-LOX-2, even in the presence of Ca2+ to promote membrane binding, was able to hop among nanodiscs. This observation is consistent with the fact that 15-LOX-2 generates more product than 8-S-LOX in assay conditions that require access to discrete pools of substrate (Fig. 2). Because the nanodisc assays indicated that the mouse enzyme transforms PL-esterified DGLA more readily than the AA counterpart, we asked whether free DGLA or its ethyl ester derivative were substrates (Fig. 5 and Table 1). 15-LOX-2 with AA displayed substrate inhibition, whereas no substrate inhibition was observed with DGLA (Fig. 5A); m8S-LOX showed substrate inhibition with both AA and DGLA, and DGLA was a poorer substrate than AA as the free fatty acid. The kcat/Km values for the two substrates for 15-LOX-2 are 0.264 ± 0.121 and 0.0895 ± 0.0075 s−1 μm−1 for AA and DGLA, respectively, which suggested a slight preference for AA (Table 1). A preference was not observed for the ethyl esters of the substrates because the kcat/Km values were 0.0464 ± 0.0084 s−1 μm−1 versus 0.0335 ± 0.0056 s−1 μm−1. The free substrates with m8S-LOX displayed considerable substrate inhibition, and enzymatic parameters suggested that both kcat and catalytic efficiency were less for DGLA than for AA, which was the opposite of that observed with nanodisc products for m8S-LOX. The ethyl ester substrates with m8S-LOX did not yield enough activity to be analyzed.TABLE 1Kinetic parameterkcatKmkcat/KmKis−1μms−1 μm−1μmAA15-LOX-20.46 ± 0.091.74 ± 0.720.264 ± 0.12132.6 ± 9.6DGLA15-LOX-20.31 ± 0.013.46 ± 0.270.0895 ± 0.0075N/AAAm8S-LOX0.22 ± 0.072.86 ± 1.510.0758 ± 0.04679.77 ± 2.20DGLAm8S-LOX0.045 ± 0.0040.964 ± 0.1860.0467 ± 0.00996.28 ± 0.49AA-EE15-LOX-20.13 ± 0.012.80 ± 0.460.0464 ± 0.0084N/ADGLA-EE15-LOX-20.211 ± 0.0146.30 ± 0.970.0335 ± 0.0056N/A Open table in a new tab Supplementation conditions to enhance the PUFA content of the HEK cell membranes were established (Fig. 6A). Exogenous 15-LOX-2 was added to crude cell lysates to transform AA and LA to the corresponding hydroperoxides. The products that were PL-esterified were liberated by the addition of PLA2. Note that lysates from cell cultures grown without supplementation had minor amounts of product in the free fatty acid pool, and this amount was increased when PLA2 was added to release additional free fatty acids. Lysates from cells cultured in supplemented media yielded at least 5-fold more free and PLA2-released 15-HETE. Moreover, most of the 15-HETE was only detected after treatment with PLA2, likely an indication that product was generated as the esterified substrate. The results of MS lipidomics analyses of the oxidized fatty acids found in HEK293 cells transfected with pCDNA3.1(+) encoding either the 15-LOX-2 or m8S-LOX are shown in Fig. 6B. We asked whether unesterified LOX products indicative of activity at the bilayer might be identified in the cellular pools of free fatty acids. Because the mouse enzyme only generates 15-HETE from AA as the PL-ester, the presence of 15-HETE in cell lysates of cells expressing m8S-LOX likely reflects enzyme activity at the membrane. The presence of 15-HETrE in cell lysates is also consistent with m8S-LOX activity at the membrane, given the fact that the free DGLA is a poor substrate. For analysis, cells were first washed to remove extracellular free fatty acids and then stimulated with Ca2+ ionophore to induce membrane binding of the LOX. Application of ionophore was also expected to activate PLA2. For cell expressing 15-LOX-2, we could not differentiate between products generated as phospholipid esters or free fatty acids, but these cells clearly yielded elevated levels of 15-HETE and 15-HETrE. For the m8S-LOX-expressing cells, both products were detected at levels comparable with those observed in the 15-LOX-2 transfected cells. The high levels of 8-HETE and 9-HODE in these same extracts reflected activity with free AA and LA, respectively. However, for HEK cells expressing m8S-LOX, additional products to those predicted from the in vitro nanodisc and free AA data are observed. An apparent loss of specificity has been reported for lipoxygenases when the reaction is slow because the enzyme must work on a membrane embedded PL (14Noguchi N. Yamashita H. Hamahara J. Nakamura A.

These same off target products have been detected in mouse lipidomics studies and are observed in 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX knock-out mice (16Demetz E. Schroll A. Auer K. Heim C. Patsch J.R. Eller P.

Earlier experiments with 15-LOX-2 have demonstrated a Ca2+-dependent association with the membrane fraction in cell lysates (17Kilty I. Logan A. Vickers P.J.

In addition, 15-LOX-1 is found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions upon Ca2+ stimulation (18Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kühn H. Membrane translocation of 15-lipoxygenase in hematopoietic cells is calcium-dependent and activates the oxygenase activity of the enzyme.Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-LOX has been shown to localize to the nuclear membrane where the helper protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein is located (19Pouliot M. McDonald P.P. Krump E. Mancini J.A. McColl S.R. Weech P.K. Borgeat P.

Immunofluorescence detection of 15-LOX-2 expressed in transfected HEK293 cells was performed to reveal the cellular location of 15-LOX-2 upon stimulation with the Ca2+ ionophore. Under these conditions, wild-type 15-LOX-2 was detected with a distribution similar to that of a pan-cadherin antibody, a marker for the plasma membrane. In addition, neither the loopless 15-LOX-2 or 15-LOX-2 in which the Ca2+ binding amino acids had been mutated to Ala revealed this same pattern of distribution upon stimulation (Fig. 7); both variants have wild-type enzymatic properties with free AA as the substrate (10Kobe M.J. Neau D.B. Mitchell C.E. Bartlett S.G. Newcomer M.E. The structure of human 15-lipoxygenase-2 with a substrate mimic.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 8562-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Only the wild-type enzyme displays an antibody distribution pattern consistent with that of the plasma membrane marker. The crystal structure of human 15-LOX-2 revealed an open active site and a Ca2+-stabilized putative membrane insertion loop along one face of the enzyme, raising the possibility that the enzyme can access the PL-esterified AA groups of membrane phospholipids and thus not be dependent on a phospholipase activity to liberate its fatty acid substrates (Fig. 8). A distinct mechanism for substrate acquisition by 15-LOX-2 could provide a context for development of isozyme-specific inhibitors in this enzyme family and circumvent the fact that the core active site and catalytic machinery are so highly conserved among the various lipoxygenases (10Kobe M.J.

The structural basis for specificity in lipoxygenase catalysis.Protein Sci. 2015; 24: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 15-LOX-2 activity with solubilized phospholipids was previously reported (25Coffa G. Brash A.R. A single active site residue directs oxygenation stereospecificity in lipoxygenases: stereocontrol is linked to the position of oxygenation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this work, we asked whether 15-LOX-2 might process esterified AA in bilayer phospholipids encompassed in nanodiscs. In addition, we looked at the same reaction with the mouse homologue of 15-LOX-2, which generates exclusively the 8-S-isomer of the hydroperoxy product from free AA, rather than the 15-S, and eventually a di-HETE product. Although the activity of the mouse enzyme at the bilayer was reduced relative to that of the human enzyme, the enzyme was able to process the membrane-embedded substrate and yield only the 15-S-isomer of HETE; the 8-S-isomer was not detected. In addition, immunofluorescence studies indicated that 15-LOX-2 translocated to the plasma membrane upon Ca2+ stimulation, and this translocation required the putative membrane insertion loop that projected from the amino-terminal β-barrel domain. In contrast, the same β-barrel domain in 5-LOX targets it to the nuclear membrane (26Chen X.S. Funk C.D.

Finally, HEK293 cells transformed to express the 15-LOX-2 and m8S-LOX enzymes yielded increased pools of both 15-HETE and 15-HETrE (as well as 8-HETE for the 8-enzyme). In vitro, only the action of the mouse enzyme on PL-esterified AA or DGLA (the precursor to HETrEs) generates 15-HETE or 15-HETrE, respectively. Neither free DGLA nor its ethyl ester were transformed to the HETrEs by the 8S-enzyme at an appreciable rate. We might infer from these results that in a cellular context the m8S-enzyme can process PL-esterified PUFAs and lead to the production of 15-HETrEs and 15-HETEs. From the experiments with 15-LOX-2-expressing HEK293 cells, we were unable to conclude that the enzyme generated 15-HETE as the PL-ester in a cellular context. However, our data from incubations of exogenous 15-LOX-2 incubated with lysates of PUFA-enriched untransfected HEK293 cells strongly hinted at a significant membrane-bound activity for this enzyme as well (Fig. 6A). Exogenous PLA2 was added after heat inactivation of 15-LOX-2, and the free 15-HETE levels increased over 5-fold once the incubations were treated with the phospholipase.

https://openalex.org/W2482887360,"The coagulation factor prothrombin has a complex spatial organization of its modular assembly that comprises the N-terminal Gla domain, kringle-1, kringle-2, and the C-terminal protease domain connected by three intervening linkers. Here we use single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer to access the conformational landscape of prothrombin in solution and uncover structural features of functional significance that extend recent x-ray crystallographic analysis. Prothrombin exists in equilibrium between two alternative conformations, open and closed. The closed conformation predominates (70%) and features an unanticipated intramolecular collapse of Tyr(93) in kringle-1 onto Trp(547) in the protease domain that obliterates access to the active site and protects the zymogen from autoproteolytic conversion to thrombin. The open conformation (30%) is more susceptible to chymotrypsin digestion and autoactivation, and features a shape consistent with recent x-ray crystal structures. Small angle x-ray scattering measurements of prothrombin wild type stabilized 70% in the closed conformation and of the mutant Y93A stabilized 80% in the open conformation directly document two envelopes that differ 50 A in length. These findings reveal important new details on the conformational plasticity of prothrombin in solution and the drastic structural difference between its alternative conformations. Prothrombin uses the intramolecular collapse of kringle-1 onto the active site in the closed form to prevent autoactivation. The open-closed equilibrium also defines a new structural framework for the mechanism of activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase."
https://openalex.org/W2489671768,"Background The need for new options for chronic lung diseases promotes the research on stem cells for lung repair. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate lung inflammation, but the data on cellular processes involved in early airway remodeling and the potential involvement of neuropeptides are scarce. Objectives To elucidate the mechanisms by which local administration of MSCs interferes with pathophysiological features of airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal model. Methods GFP-tagged mouse MSCs were intratracheally delivered in the ovalbumin mouse model with subsequent functional tests, the analysis of cytokine levels, neuropeptide expression and histological evaluation of MSCs fate and airway pathology. Additionally, MSCs were exposed to pro-inflammatory factors in vitro. Results Functional improvement was observed after MSC administration. Although MSCs did not adopt lung cell phenotypes, cell therapy positively affected airway remodeling reducing the hyperplastic phase of the gain in bronchial smooth muscle mass, decreasing the proliferation of epithelium in which mucus metaplasia was also lowered. Decrease of interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-13 and increase of interleukin-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage was also observed. Exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines, MSCs upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Moreover, asthma-related in vivo upregulation of pro-inflammatory neurokinin 1 and neurokinin 2 receptors was counteracted by MSCs that also determined a partial restoration of VIP, a neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusion Intratracheally administered MSCs positively modulate airway remodeling, reduce inflammation and improve function, demonstrating their ability to promote tissue homeostasis in the course of experimental allergic asthma. Because of a limited tissue retention, the functional impact of MSCs may be attributed to their immunomodulatory response combined with the interference of neuropeptide system activation and tissue remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2496363657,"In recent years, the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has caused serious environmental pollution, especially particulate pollution. As the “Earth’s kidneys,” wetland plays a significant role in improving the environmental quality and adjusting the climate. To study how wetlands work in this aspect, from the early autumn of 2014 to 2015, we implemented a study to measure the PM concentration and chemical composition at three heights (1.5, 6, and 10 m) during different periods (dry, normal water, and wet periods) in the Cuihu wetland park in Beijing for analyzing the dry deposition flux and the effect of meteorological factors on the concentration. Results indicated that (1) the diurnal variations of the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at the three heights were similar in that the highest concentration occurred at night and the lowest occurred at noon, and the daytime concentration was lower than that at night; (2) the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations also varied between different periods that wet period > normal water period > wet period, and the concentration at different heights during different periods varied. In general, the lowest concentration occurred at 10 m during the dry and normal water periods, and the highest concentration occurred at 1.5 m during the wet period. (3) SO42−, NO3−, and Cl− are the dominant constituents of PM2.5, accounting for 42.22, 12.6, and 21.56%, respectively; (4) the dry depositions of PM2.5 and PM10 at 10 m were higher than those at 6 m, and the deposition during the dry period was higher than those during the wet and normal water periods. In addition, the deposition during the night-time was higher than that during the daytime. Moreover, meteorological factors affected the deposition, the temperature and wind speed being negatively correlated with the deposition flux and the humidity being positively correlated. (5) The PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were influenced by meteorological factors. The PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were negatively correlated with temperature and wind speed but positively correlated with relative humidity."
https://openalex.org/W2478353803,"Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive screening is important in clinical practice. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a frequently used screening test in PD to detect mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D). However, the proportion in which the subtests are represented in the MoCA total score does not seem reasonable. We present the development and preliminary evaluation of an empirically based alternative scoring system of the MoCA which aims at increasing the overall diagnostic accuracy.In study 1, the MoCA was administered to 40 patients with PD without cognitive impairment (PD-N), PD-MCI, or PD-D, as defined by a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. The new MoCA scoring algorithm was developed by defining Areas under the Curve (AUC) for MoCA subtests in a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and by weighting the subtests according to their sensitivities and specificities. In study 2, an independent sample of 24 PD patients (PD-N, PD-MCI, or PD-D) was tested with the MoCA. In both studies, diagnostic accuracy of the original and the new scoring procedure was calculated.Diagnostic accuracy increased with the new MoCA scoring algorithm. In study 1, the sensitivity to detect cognitive impairment increased from 62.5% to 92%, while specificity decreased only slightly from 77.7% to 73%; in study 2, sensitivity increased from 68.8% to 81.3%, while specificity stayed stable at 75%.This pilot study demonstrates that the sensitivity of the MoCA can be enhanced substantially by an empirically based weighting procedure and that the proposed scoring algorithm may serve the MoCA's actual purpose as a screening tool in the detection of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients better than the original scoring of the MoCA. Further research with larger sample sizes is necessary to establish efficacy of the alternate scoring system."
https://openalex.org/W2492431655,"Aim The purpose of the study was the simultaneous measurement of all the different components of the AGE-RAGE axis as well as several non-invasive markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Materials and Methods In 80 newly diagnosed diabetic patients we measured serum carboxymethyllysine (CML), soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and peripheral mononuclear (PMNC) RAGE and AGER1 mRNA together with ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and malondialdehyde (MDA). We also assessed cardiovascular function by measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), intima-media thickness (IMT) and arterial stiffness. Univariant correlation analysis was used to determine correlation between the variables in the study and multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between the AGE-RAGE axis components and FMD, IMT and arterial stiffness. Results Serum CML correlated positively with sRAGE, PMNC RAGE, HOMA-IR, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MDA, but inversely with PMNC AGER1. sRAGE and RAGE was positively correlated with AGER; IMT was positively correlated with HOMA-IR, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MDA, and sRAGE and arterial stiffness had correlation with HOMA-IR, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MDA, CML, sRAGE, AGER1 and RAGE. In multivariate analysis we found a significant relationship between CML with PMNC RAGE, HOMA-IR; sRAGE with VCAM-1 and MDA; PMNC RAGE with PMNC AGER1and CML; PMNC AGER1 with PMNC RAGE; FMD with sRAGE, CML and HbA1c; IMT with sRAGE, and arterial stiffness with sRAGE, sCML and AGER1 Conclusions We found significant and strong associations between the different components of the AGE-RAGE axis and also found significant association between AGE-RAGE axis markers, especially sRAGE with several noninvasive markers of cardiovascular disease risk. sRAGE, an easily measured parameter in blood, may potentially be used as a surrogate marker of AGEs-RAGE in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2501443666,"Despite recent advances in understanding macrophage activation, little is known regarding how human alveolar macrophages in health calibrate its transcriptional response to canonical TLR4 activation. In this study, we examined the full spectrum of LPS activation and determined whether the transcriptomic profile of human alveolar macrophages is distinguished by a TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dominant type I interferon signature. Bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages were obtained from healthy volunteers, stimulated in the presence or absence of ultrapure LPS in vitro, and whole transcriptomic profiling was performed by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). LPS induced a robust type I interferon transcriptional response and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7 as the top upstream regulator of 89 known gene targets. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USP)-18, a negative regulator of interferon α/β responses, was among the top up-regulated genes in addition to IL10 and USP41, a novel gene with no known biological function but with high sequence homology to USP18. We determined whether IRF-7 and USP-18 can influence downstream macrophage effector cytokine production such as IL-10. We show that IRF-7 siRNA knockdown enhanced LPS-induced IL-10 production in human monocyte-derived macrophages, and USP-18 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced production of IL-10 in RAW264.7 cells. Quantitative PCR confirmed upregulation of USP18, USP41, IL10, and IRF7. An independent cohort confirmed LPS induction of USP41 and IL10 genes. These results suggest that IRF-7 and predicted downstream target USP18, both elements of a type I interferon gene signature identified by RNA-Seq, may serve to fine-tune early cytokine response by calibrating IL-10 production in human alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2475921848,"Ammonia is a biologically potent molecule, and the regulation of ammonia levels in the mammalian body is, therefore, strictly controlled. The molecular paths of ammonia permeation across plasma membranes remain ill-defined, but the structural similarity of water and NH3 has pointed to the aquaporins as putative NH3-permeable pores. Accordingly, a range of aquaporins from mammals, plants, fungi, and protozoans demonstrates ammonia permeability. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed at perivascular glia end-feet in the mammalian brain and may, with this prominent localization at the blood-brain-interface, participate in the exchange of ammonia, which is required to sustain the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Here we observe that AQP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes display a reflection coefficient <1 for NH4Cl at pH 8.0, at which pH an increased amount of the ammonia occurs in the form of NH3. Taken together with an NH4Cl-mediated intracellular alkalization (or lesser acidification) of AQP4-expressing oocytes, these data suggest that NH3 is able to permeate the pore of AQP4. Exposure to NH4Cl increased the membrane currents to a similar extent in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes expressing AQP4, indicating that the ionic NH4+ did not permeate AQP4. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed partial pore permeation events of NH3 but not of NH4+ and a reduced energy barrier for NH3 permeation through AQP4 compared with that of a cholesterol-containing lipid bilayer, suggesting AQP4 as a favored transmembrane route for NH3.

Henceforward, the term ammonia will be used as a general form, whereas NH3 and NH4+ will be used when referring to a specific form. At physiological pH, its pKa of 9.25 dictates that ∼1.5% of the ammonia is found as NH3, whereas the rest exists as NH4+, the latter of which absolutely requires membrane transporters or channels to cross the plasma membrane.

It was long believed that NH3 could permeate the cell membrane by simple diffusion because of its small size and lack of electric charges. NH3 is, however, a polar molecule with a dipole moment of 1.47 D (close to that of water = 1.85 D; see Fig. 1 for a structural comparison) and may thus permeate poorly through lipid bilayers. Indeed, plasma membranes with poor NH3 permeability have been demonstrated (17Hamm L.L. Trigg D. Martin D. Gillespie C. Buerkert J. Transport of ammonia in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule.J.

In the present study, we therefore determine the ammonia permeability of AQP4 by both experimental approaches and molecular dynamics simulations. To determine whether ammonia permeates AQP4, we monitored the ability of ammonia to drive osmotic water flux in Xenopus oocytes expressing AQP4 and, as a positive control, the ammonia-permeable AQP8 (22Holm L.M.

An inherent advantage in this heterologous expression system is the low intrinsic water permeability of the native oocyte membrane; expression of AQP4 increases the osmotic water permeability of the oocyte membrane ∼20-fold (47Meinild A.K.

AQP4- and AQP8-expressing oocytes exposed to an osmotic challenge consisting of the impermeable osmolyte NaCl (10 mm; 20 mosm) therefore, as opposed to uninjected oocytes, displayed robust cell shrinkage (water permeabilities at pH 7.4 in × 10−3 cm/s: 2.99 ± 0.49, n = 12 for AQP4, 2.04 ± 0.39, n = 9 for AQP8, and 0.14 ± 0.01, n = 7 for uninjected oocytes, p < 0.05 for both AQP4 and AQP8 when compared with uninjected); see the representative traces in black in Fig. 2A. To obtain the reflection coefficient of ammonia, the same oocytes were then exposed to an identical osmotic challenge of 20 mosm but obtained with NH4Cl (10 mm) as the osmolyte. Both oocytes expressing AQP4 and AQP8 as well as uninjected oocytes responded to the osmotic challenge in a manner essentially identical to that observed with NaCl as the osmolyte (water permeabilities with NH4Cl as the osmolyte in × 10−3 cm/s: 3.04 ± 0.42, n = 12 for AQP4, 1.94 ± 0.37, n = 9 for AQP8, and 0.13 ± 0.01, n = 7 for uninjected oocytes, p < 0.05 for both AQP4 and AQP8 when compared with uninjected); see the representative traces in red in Fig. 2A. The reflection coefficient for ammonia at pH 7.4, σ7.4, was therefore not significantly different from 1 (1.00 ± 0.03, n = 12 for AQP4, 0.96 ± 0.04, n = 9 for AQP8, and 0.96 ± 0.03, n = 7 for uninjected oocytes), illustrated as white bars in Fig. 2C. Of the 10 mm NH4Cl, only 0.14 mm exists as NH3 at pH 7.4 and the reminder exists as NH4+ (according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation). To increase the fraction of NH3 in the test solution without changing the ammonia concentration, a parallel experimental series was carried out with test solutions of pH 8.0, in which the NH3 concentration is 4-fold higher (0.56 mm). The slightly basic test solutions did not significantly affect the water permeability obtained with NaCl as the osmolyte (water permeabilities at pH 8.0 in × 10−3 cm/s: 2.34 ± 0.28 n = 12 for AQP4, 1.16 ± 0.25, n = 9 for AQP8, and 0.23 ± 0.04, n = 7 for uninjected oocytes); see the representative traces in black in Fig. 2B. These results demonstrate that the higher pH of the extracellular solution in itself did not affect the water permeability of either the AQPs or the native plasma membrane. An osmotic challenge based on NH4Cl (at pH 8.0) provided a cell shrinkage of the uninjected oocytes identical to that obtained with NaCl; see the red trace in Fig. 2B, right panel, for a representative trace. Oppositely, the osmotic water permeability was significantly smaller for both AQP4- and AQP8-expressing oocytes when obtained with NH4Cl instead of NaCl; see the red traces in Fig. 2B, left and middle panels, for representative traces. The reflection coefficient for NH4Cl at pH 8, σ8.0, was, therefore, significantly <1 for the AQP-expressing oocytes (0.80 ± 0.05, n = 12 for AQP4, p < 0.01 and 0.68 ± 0.04, n = 9 for AQP8, p < 0.001), whereas for the uninjected oocytes, σ8.0 was not significantly different from 1 (1.07 ± 0.04, n = 8), summarized as black bars in Fig. 2C. These data suggest that at pH 8.0, at which the test solutions contain a significant NH3 content, we detect ammonia permeation into the pore of the expressed aquaporins, thus preventing ammonia from exerting the full osmotic force as observed with the impermeable NaCl. Cellular influx of NH3 causes intracellular alkalinization, whereas NH4+ influx causes intracellular acidification, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. To further resolve the ability of ammonia to permeate AQP4, we monitored the intracellular pH of uninjected and AQP4-expressing oocytes with a H+-sensitive microelectrode during the addition of ammonia to the extracellular solution. A stable pHi baseline was obtained in control solution before exposure of the oocytes to an isosmotic solution containing 10 mm NH4Cl for 15 min. NH4Cl caused an intracellular acidification of all uninjected oocytes (representative trace in Fig. 3B and summarized data in Fig. 3C; compare pHi of 7.10 ± 0.02 in control solution with 6.72 ± 0.06 in the presence of ammonia, n = 15, p < 0.001, inset). AQP4-expressing oocytes responded in a graded manner with the majority of the tested oocytes responding to NH4Cl with either a robust intracellular alkalization or a lesser acidification than observed with the uninjected oocytes (representative traces are illustrated in Fig. 3D; summarized data are in Fig. 3E, n = 33). 6 of the 33 tested oocytes responded with a pHi change that fell within the confidence interval of the pHi change observed in the uninjected oocytes (ΔpHi of −0.38 (CI −0.49 to −0.26) pH units, n = 15). Summarized data illustrate that the intracellular acidification observed in uninjected oocytes was abolished in the AQP4-expression oocytes; compare pHi of 7.31 ± 0.01 in control solution with 7.39 ± 0.07 in NH4Cl-containing solution, n = 33, p = 0.26, Fig. 3E, inset. The NH4Cl-induced pHi change in AQP4-expressing oocytes (0.08 ± 0.07 pH units, n = 33) was thus significantly different from that obtained in uninjected oocytes (−0.38 ± 0.06 pH units, n = 15), p < 0.001, Fig. 3F. The observed alkalization (or lesser acidification) in a substantial fraction of the AQP4-expressing oocytes (27/33), therefore, suggests that ammonia is able to permeate the pore of AQP4 in the form of NH3. To determine if AQP4 was permeable to NH4+, we monitored the current response of uninjected oocytes and AQP4- and AQP8-expressing oocytes during ammonia exposure. NH4+ membrane permeation results in a membrane current in voltage clamped oocytes which is absent with NH3 permeation. At pH 7.4, isosmotic addition of 5 mm NH4Cl to the test solution caused a small inward current in both uninjected oocytes and AQP-expressing oocytes; see the representative current traces in Fig. 4A. Voltage step protocols applied before and after the addition of ammonia illustrated comparable membrane currents in uninjected oocytes and AQP4- and AQP8-expressing oocytes both in control solution and after exposure to ammonia (see representative I/V current traces in Fig. 4B, summarized I/V relations in Fig. 4C, and summarized currents at −60 mV displayed as the inset); although the membrane current increased in the presence of ammonia for all tested oocytes (uninjected oocytes: compare −26.3 ± 9.9 nA with −63.7 ± 22.7 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.05; AQP4: compare −35.1 ± 6.0 nA with −79.9 ± 22.1 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.05; AQP8: compare −32.7 ± 6.0 nA with −97.5 ± 12.4 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.001), the increase observed in the AQP-expressing oocytes was not significantly different from that of the uninjected oocytes; see the Fig. 4C inset. To obtain an increased fractional NH3 content, a parallel experimental series was carried out at pHo 8.0. Although the ammonia-induced membrane currents intrinsic to the native oocyte membrane was enlarged at this extracellular alkalinization, the observed current pattern resembled that obtained at pHo 7.4; see the representative current traces in Fig. 4D, representative I/V current traces in Fig. 4E, and the summarized I/V relations in Fig. 4F with an inset summarizing the current obtained at Vm = −60 mV (uninjected: compare −21.8 ± 8.0 nA with −256.4 ± 32.9 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.05; AQP4: compare −35.0 ± 5.5 nA with −255.7 ± 42.4 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.05; AQP8: compare −35.7 ± 6.4 nA with −336.3 ± 29.5 nA in the presence of ammonia, n = 9, p < 0.001). At pHo 8.0 as well as pHo 7.4, the ammonia-induced membrane currents were independent of aquaporin expression in the plasma membrane, which supports that AQP4- and AQP8-dependent ammonia permeation takes place via NH3 rather than via NH4+. To obtain details on ammonia entry into the pore of AQP4 on a molecular scale, we performed molecular dynamics on this permeability event. Free simulations were initially carried out to observe the behavior of both NH3 and NH4+ near the surface of AQP4. In these simulations we introduced, separately, 100 molecules each of NH3 and NH4+ with appropriate neutralization for the latter. Each simulation was carried out for 500 ns. For any further analysis, only the latter 400 ns were considered to account for equilibration effects. We observed several partial permeation events of NH3 entering the channel and exiting from the same end. Together, these partial permeation events cover almost the entire protein pore. In contrast, NH4+ never penetrated the pore to any significant extent. Remarkably, NH4+ showed high propensity to cluster around several anionic amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate on either protein surface (Fig. 5). Most of these clustering “hotspots” are placed closely to the opening of the channel pore. To determine the free energy profiles of NH3 permeation via AQP4 versus via lipid membranes of different composition, we carried out umbrella sampling (US) simulations, in which we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) for NH3 permeation through the pore of AQP4. The uncertainty in the PMF calculation was ascertained using a bootstrapping algorithm as implemented in the g_wham tool from GROMACS and is illustrated as a shaded margin around the PMF curves, see Fig. 6A. The radius profile for the channel is shown for reference in Fig. 6B. To gauge the permeability of AQP4 to NH3, we compared these PMFs to free energy profiles calculated across lipid bilayers. We used two lipid membranes for comparison; a pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer and a hybrid bilayer with 20% cholesterol and 80% POPC. This l"

Pain narratives are important to understand the influence of environment on patients with chronic LBP. There are few studies that have explored the experience of patients with chronic LBP in different socio-cultural environments. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of patients with chronic LBP in Spain and Brazil.A qualitative phenomenology approach was implemented. Chronic LBP patients from the University Hospital of Salamanca (Spain), and/or Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil) were included, using purposeful sampling. Data were collected from 22 Spanish and 26 Brazilian patients during in-depth interviews and using researchers' field notes and patients' personal diaries and letters. A thematic analysis was performed and the guidelines for reporting qualitative research were applied.Forty-eight patients with a mean age of 50.7 years (SD: ± 13.1 years) were included in the study. The themes identified included: a) ways of perceiving and expressing pain-the participants focused constantly on their pain and anything outside it was considered secondary; b) the socio-familial environment as a modulator of pain-most participants stated that no one was able to understand the pain they were experiencing; c) religion as a modulator of pain-all Brazilian patients stated that religious belief affected the experience of pain; and d) socio-economic and educational status as a modulator of pain-the study reported that economic factors influenced the experience of pain.The influences of LBP can be determined based on the how a patient defines pain. Religion can be considered as a possible mechanism for patients to manage pain and as a form of solace."

The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of type 2 diabetes according to baseline total meat consumption in a longitudinal assessment of a middle-aged Mediterranean population. Methods We followed 18,527 participants (mean age: 38 years, 61% women) in the SUN Project, an open-enrolment cohort of a highly educated population of middle-class Spanish graduate students. All participants were initially free of diabetes. Diet was assessed at baseline using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire of 136-items previously validated. Incident diabetes was defined according to the American Diabetes Association’s criteria. Results We identified 146 incident cases of diabetes after a maximum of 14 years of follow-up period (mean: 8.7 years). In the fully adjusted model, the consumption of ≥3 servings/day of all types of meat was significantly associated with a higher risk of diabetes (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.03–3.31; p for trend = 0.031) in comparison with the reference category (<2 servings/day). When we separated processed from non-processed meat, we observed a non-significant higher risk associated with greater consumption of processed meat and a non-significant lower risk associated with non-processed meat consumption (p for trend = 0.123 and 0.487, respectively). No significant difference was found between the two types of meat (p = 0.594). Conclusions Our results suggest that meat consumption, especially processed meat, was associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes in our young Mediterranean cohort."

The aim of this study was to determine if these epigenetic marks are associated with chromosomal aneuploidy in human blastocysts. Surplus, cryopreserved blastocysts that were donated to research with IRB consent were chosen with varying chromosomal aneuploidies and respective implantation potential: monosomies and trisomies 7, 11, 15, 21, and 22. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (~485,000 CpG sites). The methylation profiles of these human blastocysts were found to be similar across all samples, independent of chromosome constitution; however, more detailed examination identified significant hypomethylation in the chromosome involved in the monosomy. Real-time PCR was also performed to determine if downstream messenger RNA (mRNA) was affected for genes on the monosomy chromosome. Gene dysregulation was observed for monosomy blastocysts within significant regions of hypo-methylation (AVEN, CYFIP1, FAM189A1, MYO9A, ADM2, PACSIN2, PARVB, and PIWIL3) (P < 0.05). Additional analysis was performed to examine the gene expression profiles of associated methylation regulators including: DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, DNMT3L), chromatin modifying regulators (CSNK1E, KDM1, PRKCA), and a post-translational modifier (PRMT5). Decreased RNA transcription was confirmed for each DNMT, and the regulators that impact DNMT activity, for only monosomy blastocysts (P < 0.05). In summary, monosomy blastocysts displayed hypomethylation for the chromosome involved in the error, as well as transcription alterations of associated developmental genes. Together, these modifications may be contributing to genetic instability and therefore be responsible for the limited implantation potential observed for full monosomy blastocysts."

Caenorhabditis elegans has been used for studying metabolism, reproduction, aging and other physiological processes, providing useful knowledge of the biology and molecular pathways underpinning human diseases. In this study, we report that metformin reduces C. elegans L1 longevity, a survival span of starvation. Using this phenotype, we performed an unbiased genetic screen and found an endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) as a potential molecular target of metformin. Moreover, the same NHE homolog in flies also mediates the effects of metformin, suggesting that an NHE could be a conserved target for metformin. It has been shown that in Drosophila, metformin treatment (100 mm) reduces lifespan (11Slack C. Foley A. Partridge L. Activation of AMPK by the putative dietary restriction mimetic metformin is insufficient to extend lifespan in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47699Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We discovered that metformin (100 mm) also reduces a certain type of lifespan, L1 survival span or L1 longevity, in C. elegans. Hatching without food, the first stage larva (L1) survives ∼14 days at 25 °C and 21 days at 20 °C (12Lee I. Hendrix A. Kim J. Yoshimoto J. You Y.J. Metabolic rate regulates L1 longevity in C. elegans.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e44720Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Metformin (100 mm) reduces L1 longevity to 7 days at 25 °C (Fig. 1A) and to 10 days at 20 °C (Fig. 2A). To identify a molecular target of metformin, we performed an unbiased genetic screen in C. elegans, using this metformin sensitivity phenotype. We screened ∼105 ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized haploid genomes and isolated a mutant with better survival in the presence of metformin. Subsequent mapping and whole genome sequencing revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the nhx-5 gene that led to an amino acid substitution of the conserved glycine 207 to glutamate (G207E). The C. elegans genome contains nine NHEs, NHX-1 through NHX-9, all of which exchange a vesicular or extracellular sodium for a luminal or intracellular proton (13Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some are expressed on the plasma membrane of cells, whereas others are expressed on the membranes of intracellular organelles. nhx-5 encodes the sole homolog of endosomal Na+/H+ exchangers 6, 7, and 9, which reside in the endosomal membranes to modulate endosome pH and regulate the rate of the endocytic cycle in mammals (Fig. 1B) (14Ohgaki R. van IJzendoorn S.C.

Organellar Na+/H+ exchangers: novel players in organelle pH regulation and their emerging functions.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NHX-5 is expressed in many cells including neurons, hypodermis, and intestine in C. elegans (Fig. 1C). NHX-5 proteins in C. elegans are also localized in the membranes of intracellular vesicles of the endocytic cycle (13Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting its conserved cellular function. An existing deletion mutant (ok661, obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center) also survived metformin treatment better (Fig. 1A, shown as Δnhx-5), validating our results from the screen. Both mutants are slightly short-lived when compared with wild type in the absence of metformin (Fig. 1A). The changes in 50% survival due to metformin treatment are 52% for wild type, 29% for nhx-5, and 20% for Δnhx-5. Thus they survive the metformin treatment better than wild type, showing that the better survival by nhx-5 mutations is not due to the intrinsic longevity of nhx-5 mutants.FIGURE 2The homologs of NHX-5 mediate metformin actions. A, the L1 longevities of all available and viable nhx mutants (nhx-3, nhx-6, nhx-8, and nhx-9) were measured and compared with those of a wild-type control and nhx-5 mutants. L1 longevity in the absence (dotted lines) and in the presence of 100 mm metformin (met) (solid lines) was measured at 20 °C to better distinguish the difference. Each data point is plotted as the average of triplicated samples and standard error. B, the L1 longevities of aak-2(ok524) mutants were compared with those of a wild-type control and nhx-5 mutants. The data of wild-type control and nhx-5 are re-used from panel A. L1 longevity in the absence (dotted lines) and in the presence of 100 mm metformin (solid lines) was measured at 20 °C. C, metformin reduces the lifespan of male flies (black circle). This metformin sensitivity is completely abolished in nhe3KG08307 null mutants (red square). Median survival times were 44 days for wild type (n = 257) without metformin, 26 days with metformin (100 mm, n = 70), and 44 days for nhe3 mutants without (n = 290) or with metformin (n = 276). D, metformin reduces the lifespan of female flies. Median survival times were 32 days for wild type (n = 267) without metformin, 16 days with metformin (n = 275), 34 days for nhe3 mutants without metformin (n = 294), and 30 days (n = 291) with metformin. There was no significant difference in survival between metformin-treated and non-treated nhe3 mutant flies by log-rank test from two independent experiments (p = 0.2 for both sexes, log-rank test), whereas there was significant difference between metformin-treated and non-treated wild-type flies (p < 0.0001, for both sexes). E, metformin affects mitochondrial function in part through NHX-5. The isolated mutants of nhx-5 and an existing deletion mutant of nhx-5 (Δnhx-5) were tested. Approximately 3000 adult worms were treated with 100 mm metformin for 30 min, and the rates of oxygen consumption were measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated at least three times. N.S., not significant, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, by paired Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The resistance of nhx-5 mutants to metformin was rescued by restoring the expression of nhx-5 using its endogenous promoter, confirming that nhx-5 mediated metformin sensitivity (Fig. 1D, TG: transgenic siblings that carry nhx-5 gene; NTG: non-transgenic siblings that do not carry nhx-5 gene; TG looked similar to wild type, so therefore it rescued the phenotype.). These results are consistent with the idea that metformin could act on multiple targets. Among nine Na+/H+ exchangers in C. elegans, deletion mutants of five other nhxs were available to test (nhx-3, nhx-4, nhx-6, nhx-8, and nhx-9). On the other hand, nhx-2 deletion mutants are embryonic lethal or arrested at L1. When we tested the available nhx mutants for metformin sensitivity, all showed sensitivity to metformin similar to wild type (Fig. 2A). We tested the sensitivity at 20 °C so that even a small difference can be detected because of longer L1 lifespan at 20 °C. This result supports the inference that among these NHXs, NHX-5 is specific for conferring metformin sensitivity. Because AMPK is one of the known molecular targets of metformin, we tested the L1 longevity of aak-2 mutants. aak-2 encodes an α subunit of C. elegans AMPK. Although aak-2 mutants already have reduced L1 longevity when compared with wild type (12Lee I. Hendrix A. Kim J. Yoshimoto J. You Y.J. Metabolic rate regulates L1 longevity in C. elegans.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e44720Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we could still observe a consistent effect of metformin in L1 longevity of aak-2 mutants (Fig. 2B). Consistent with a previous study, metformin (100 mm) greatly reduced the lifespan of D. melanogaster (11Slack C. Foley A. Partridge L. Activation of AMPK by the putative dietary restriction mimetic metformin is insufficient to extend lifespan in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47699Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). We found that this metformin sensitivity was entirely dependent on NHE3, the fly homolog of worm NHX-5 (Fig. 2C for males, Fig. 2D for females). Remarkably, the nhe3KG08307 mutant flies, which have a P element insertion in the first exon and have no detectable mRNA, are almost completely resistant to metformin, suggesting that NHE3 may be a major molecular target of metformin for metformin-induced lifespan reduction in flies. These results from worms and flies suggest that endosomal NHEs can be a conserved target of metformin action. Although the major site of action for metformin is somewhat controversial (15Foretz M. Guigas B. Bertrand L. Pollak M. Viollet B. Metformin: from mechanisms of action to therapies.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 953-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 16Rena G. Pearson E.R. Sakamoto K. Molecular mechanism of action of metformin: old or new insights?.Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 1898-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), one of the sites is mitochondria, where metformin inhibits complex I, thus increasing AMP levels and reducing oxygen consumption (6El-Mir M.Y. Nogueira V. Fontaine E. Avéret N. Rigoulet M. Leverve X. Dimethylbiguanide inhibits cell respiration via an indirect effect targeted on the respiratory chain complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 223-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). To examine whether an endosomal NHE is involved in the inhibition of mitochondrial function by metformin, we measured oxygen consumption rate in C. elegans in the presence of metformin. It has been shown that metformin indirectly affects C. elegans lifespan via changing the metabolism of bacteria (C. elegans food) (17Cabreiro F. Au C. Leung K.Y. Vergara-Irigaray N. Cochemé H.M. Noori T. Weinkove D. Schuster E. Greene N.D. Gems D. Metformin retards aging in C. elegans by altering microbial folate and methionine metabolism.Cell. 2013; 153: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). To avoid this complication, we treated worms with metformin in the solution in which they were suspended without food for 30 min. We did not treat the animals longer than 30 min to avoid starvation effect. We found that metformin reduced oxygen consumption significantly in wild-type worms, suggesting that metformin inhibits mitochondrial function in C. elegans as it does in mammals (Fig. 2E, shown as +). Next we asked whether this reduction of oxygen consumption rate by metformin is dependent on NHX-5. First we noticed that both nhx-5 mutants showed reduced baseline oxygen consumption, suggesting that endosomal NHEs are important in mitochondrial function (black bars in Fig. 2E). Metformin failed to reduce oxygen consumption rate in the deletion mutant of nhx-5 (shown as Δnhx-5 in Fig. 2E) but still reduced it in the G270E mutant (shown as nhx-5). Because the deletion mutation likely produces no functional NHX-5, whereas the G270E mutation could produce proteins with residual function, this result could suggest that at least a part of metformin action in mitochondria could be mediated by endosomal NHEs. We do not know the reason behind the difference between the two mutations. However, this kind of inconsistency in phenotypes depending on the nature of mutations is not uncommon. One possible interpretation in this case could be that because the deletion mutant of nhx-5 already has low basal O2 consumption without metformin, any further reduction would be harder to detect. The point mutation, however, may have residual function, so it has room for metformin to reduce it further. One of the major catabolic processes necessary for C. elegans L1s to survive long-term starvation is autophagy (18Kang C. You Y.J. Avery L. Dual roles of autophagy in the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whose final step is to fuse autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which degrade organelles as well as macromolecules to acquire energy (19Rubinsztein D.C. Gestwicki J.E. Murphy L.O. Klionsky D.J. Potential therapeutic applications of autophagy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In the absence of lysosomal degradation, autophagy does not progress normally and results in pathologic accumulation of autophagic vesicles, misfolded proteins, and abnormal organelles (2Wilson C.M. Magnaudeix A. Yardin C. Terro F. Autophagy dysfunction and its link to Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes mellitus.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2014; 13: 226-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, knock-out mice that lack NHE6, the mammalian homolog of C. elegans NHX-5, show Angelman-like syndrome (20Gilfillan G.D. Selmer K.K. Roxrud I. Smith R. Kyllerman M. Eiklid K. Kroken M. Mattingsdal M. Egeland T. Stenmark H. Sjøholm H. Server A. Samuelsson L. Christianson A. Tarpey P. et al.SLC9A6 mutations cause X-linked mental retardation, microcephaly, epilepsy, and ataxia, a phenotype mimicking Angelman syndrome.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 1003-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in which the lysosome becomes dysfunctional, mimicking lysosomal storage disorders (21Strømme P. Dobrenis K. Sillitoe R.V. Gulinello M. Ali N.F. Davidson C. Micsenyi M.C. Stephney G. Ellevog L. Klungland A. Walkley S.U.

Christianson syndrome protein NHE6 modulates TrkB endosomal signaling required for neuronal circuit development.Neuron. 2013; 80: 97-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This indicates that NHE6 functions at the interface of late endosomes and lysosomes. We previously showed that too little autophagy in C. elegans during long-term starvation greatly reduces L1 longevity (18Kang C. You Y.J. Avery L. Dual roles of autophagy in the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Based on that and also because the lysosomal dysfunction will affect autophagy, we hypothesized that metformin dysregulated endosome trafficking and autophagy during L1 starvation by regulating NHX-5, which in turn reduced L1 longevity. When we measured autophagosomal puncta using an LC3 homolog fused with GFP (GFP-LGG-1), a marker widely used to label autophagosomes (23Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Obara K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Structure of Atg5·Atg16, a complex essential for autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6763-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Meléndez A. Tallóczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Autophagy genes are essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), we found that the number of puncta increased as starvation continued. However, we found that in the presence of metformin, the number of puncta did not increase but stayed at the basal level as starvation continued (Fig. 3, 4, A and B). This result suggests that in the presence of metformin, the level of autophagy does not increase even if starvation persists, suggesting that metformin inhibits autophagy during starvation. Because autophagy is a continuous process of influx and efflux, measuring GFP puncta at a given time shows only a static state of autophagy level, and therefore it does not rule out the other possibility that metformin might enhance the efflux, i.e. faster degradation of GFP-LGG-1 in the autolysosomes, which in turn causes a lower number of GFP puncta. However, the number of puncta in the metformin-treated animals remains at the basal level (about 10 throughout the starvation period) both in the intestine and in the pharyngeal muscle even if the intestine has a higher autophagy level than the pharyngeal muscle in the absence of metformin (an average of 15 puncta for pharyngeal muscle in Fig. 3C, when compared with an average of 30 puncta for intestine in Fig. 4F on day 5). Also, although the number of puncta continues to increase in non-treated animals as starvation continues, the number of puncta in metformin-treated animals does not change throughout starvation. These two observations suggest that the level of autophagy in the presence of metformin does not increase however long starvation continues, suggesting that the influx of autophagy is inhibited. It would be harder to maintain the consistent level of autophagy by controlling efflux rate throughout the starvation period in the two different organs. Supporting this notion, we were not able to capture an increase in GFP-LGG-1 puncta or any fluctuation in numbers of puncta in metformin-treated animals regardless of how early we looked in the treatment time course. These results suggest that it is unlikely that metformin enhances efflux but more likely that it inhibits influx.FIGURE 4Metformin interferes with autophagy in the intestine during starvation. A–D, after 9 days of starvation, both wild-type worms and nhx-5 mutants showed GFP-LGG-1 puncta in the intestine (A and C, 0 mm metformin). The number of puncta was greatly reduced in wild type by metformin treatment but not as much in nhx-5 mutants (B and D, 100 mm metformin). Yellow arrowheads show that the overall intensity of GFP-LGG-1 in the terminal bulb is not significantly reduced in all the animals. Scale bar = 20 μm. The left panel shows DIC images, and the right panel shows the corresponding GFP images. E, enlarged images of DIC, GFP, and both (from left to right) of the red box in panel A. These images show an example of how individual GFP-LGG-1 puncta looked and how they were counted. The graphic next to the red box in the merged image was drawn to help visualization of individual puncta. A vesicle not labeled by GFP-LGG-1 is marked as a black circle. The yellow arrowhead indicates a birefringent gut granule (no GFP and not an autophagosome), known to be stained with lysosomal dyes (48Hermann G.J. Schroeder L.K. Hieb C.A. Kershner A.M.

GFP-LGG-1 puncta were counted under a GFP filter (GFP, right panel, 63×). DIC (left panel, 63×) is used to show the animals as well as to validate the location of the individual puncta. F, GFP-LGG-1-labeled puncta from starved worms were determined at the given time. Metformin-treated wild type (wt met) showed a significantly reduced number of puncta when compared with the nhx-5 mutants in the presence or absence of metformin (p < 0.05, unpaired two-sample t test). In addition, metformin-treated nhx-5 showed a significantly reduced number of puncta when compared with cohorts in the absence of metformin (p < 0.01). However, wild type and nhx-5 controls are not different in starvation-induced GFP-LGG-1-labeled puncta. To avoid a sampling error, the days were cut off when fewer than 30% of animals were alive because the dead animals did not show autophagy puncta. The numbers are the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metformin treatment did not inhibit autophagy in nhx-5 (ok661) mutants as much as in the wild type, suggesting that metformin affects autophagy mainly through NHX-5 (Fig. 4, C–F). Although metformin-treated nhx-5 mutants showed higher numbers of GFP-LGG-1 puncta than metformin-treated wild type, they showed a significantly lower number of puncta than non-treated wild type, suggesting additional targets for the metformin effect on autophagy. Because the overall intensity of GFP-LGG-1 is not significantly reduced in all the animals (for example, compare the intensity of GFP in the terminal bulb, indicated as dotted circles in Fig. 3, A and B, and yellow arrowheads in Fig. 4, A–D), the reduced number of puncta in intestinal cells in the metformin-treated wild type is unlikely to be due to a reduction in GFP-LGG-1 protein level. Interestingly, most of the GFP-LGG-1-labeled puncta were located specifically on the intestinal lumen side rather than on the hypodermis side or randomly distributed (Fig. 4, A–E). Also they were clustered in one or two regions in an intestinal cell (Fig. 4E). These regions are mostly perinuclear regions where macroautophagy occurs during starvation. nhx-5 mutants do not show any gross abnormality. However, their L1 longevity is slightly shorter than wild type (Fig. 1A), and after long-term starvation as L1s, they recovered more slowly than wild type when they were given food. In addition, the GFP-LGG-1-labeled puncta in wild-type animals disappeared within 6 h after the animals were fed, whereas those in nhx-5 mutants did not. These observations suggest an autolysosomal defect in nhx-5 mutants that could lead to the reduced L1 longevity of nhx-5 mutants in the absence of metformin. Although metformin generally increases autophagy in cancer cell lines or pathological conditions (25Xie Z. Lau K. Eby B. Lozano P. He C. Pennington B. Li H. Rathi S. Dong Y. Tian R. Kem D. Zou M.H.

Metformin inhibits melanoma development through autophagy and apoptosis mechanisms.Cell Death Dis. 2011; 2: e199Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), our results suggested a potentially opposite effect of metformin in autophagy, probably due to the long-term starvation effect. Indeed, metformin treatment combined with 2-deoxyglucose, which could mimic certain aspects of extreme starvation by depleting ATP, inhibits autophagy (27Ben Sahra I. Tanti J.F. Bost F. The combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose inhibits autophagy and induces AMPK-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 670-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, metformin suppresses autophagy in H4IIE cells upon glucose starvation (28Park D.B. Metformin promotes apoptosis but suppresses autophagy in glucose-deprived H4IIE hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Diabetes Metab. J. 2015; 39: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of autophagy and consequential insufficient energy could contribute to the reduced L1 longevity by metformin and that NHX-5 mediates a part of this action. From an unbiased genetic screen in C. elegans, we identified an endosomal NHE as a potential target of metformin."

https://openalex.org/W2490652495,"Acute mesenteric ischemia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In recent studies, we found that the intestine is an important source of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)8 during intestinal injury. We hypothesized that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP8 would reduce intestinal injury in mice subjected to intestinal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. Male mice aged 8–12 wk were subjected to intestinal I/R injury by transient occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min. MMP8 was inhibited by genetic and pharmacological approaches. In vivo10th and 90th percentiles study endpoints included several functional, histological, and biochemical assays. Intestinal sections were assessed for barrier function and expression of tight junction proteins. I/R injury led to increased intestinal and systemic expression of MMP8. This increase was associated with increased intestinal neutrophil infiltration, epithelial injury, and permeability. I/R injury was associated with increased systemic inflammation and weight loss. These parameters were ameliorated by inhibiting MMP8. I/R injury caused a loss of the tight junction protein claudin-3, which was ameliorated by genetic ablation of MMP8. MMP8 plays an important role in intestinal I/R injury through mechanisms involving increased inflammation and loss of claudin-3. Inhibition of MMP8 is a potential therapeutic strategy in this setting.—Daly, M. C., Atkinson, S. J., Varisco, B.M., Klingbeil L., Hake, P., Lahni, P., Piraino, G., Wu, D., Hogan, S.

Sepsis represents a serious risk factor for mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In septic patients with ARDS complement activation products were found to be elevated in the plasma. In single models like LPS or trauma complement has been studied to some degree, however in clinically highly relevant double hit models such as the one used here little data is available. Here, we hypothesized that absence of C5 is correlated with a decreased inflammatory response in trauma induced septic acute lung injury. Methods 12 hrs after DH in mice the local and systemic cytokines and chemokines were quantified by multiplex bead array or ELISA, activated caspase-3 by western blot. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Sidak’s multiple comparison test (significance, p≤ 0.05). Results In lung tissue interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was elevated in both C5-/- mice and wildtype littermates (wt), whereas caspase-3 was reduced in lungs after DH in C5-/- mice. Systemically, reduced keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) levels were observed after DH in C5-/- compared to wt mice. Locally, lung myeloperoxidase (MPO), protein, IL-6, MCP-1 and G-CSF in brochoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were elevated after DH in C5-/- compared to wt.

The specimens were sent to the laboratory for analyses. All specimens that were tested positive for C. trachomatis by the commercial nucleic acid amplification tests were genotyped by MLVA-ompA. Results Fifty-one rectal specimens from MSM and 96 urethral specimens from MSW were identified with C. trachomatis. One hundred and forty-four of the 147 specimens were fully genotyped by MLVA-ompA. Rectal specimens from MSM were divided into four ompA genotypes and urethral specimens from MSW into nine genotypes. No mixed infections were found among all specimens. The most frequent genotypes were D, G, J, E and F. All specimens were further divided into 46 types after ompA genotyping was combined with MLVA. Genotypes D-8.7.1 and G-3.4a.3 were the most frequent among MSM, whereas genotypes D-3.4a.4, E-8.5.1, F-8.5.1, and J-3.4a.2 were the most frequent subtypes among MSW. The discriminatory index D was 0.90 for MLVA, 0.85 for ompA, and 0.95 for MLVA-ompA. Conclusions The most prevalent MLVA-ompA genotypes were significantly different between MSM and MSW from Guangzhou, China. Moreover, MLVA-ompA represented a more favorable degree of discrimination than ompA and could be a reliable complement for ompA for the routine subtypes of C. trachomatis."
https://openalex.org/W2499773533,"Background With declines in development assistance for health and growing interest in country ownership, donors are increasingly faced with the task of transitioning health programs to local actors towards a path to sustainability. Yet there is little available guidance on how to measure and evaluate the success of a transition and its subsequent effects. This study assesses the transition of the Avahan HIV/AIDS prevention program in India to investigate how preparations for transition affected continuation of program activities post-transition. Methods Two rounds of two surveys were conducted and supplemented by data from government and Avahan Computerized Management Information Systems (CMIS). Exploratory factor analysis was used to develop two measures: 1) transition readiness pre-transition, and 2) institutionalization (i.e. integration of initial program systems into organizational procedures and behaviors) post-transition. A fixed effects model was built to examine changes in key program delivery outcomes over time. An ordinary least square regression was used to assess the relationship between transition readiness and sustainability of service outcomes both directly, and indirectly through institutionalization. Results Transition readiness data revealed 3 factors (capacity, alignment and communication), on a 15-item scale with adequate internal consistency (alpha 0.73). Institutionalization was modeled as a unidimensional construct, and a 12-item scale demonstrated moderate internal consistency (alpha 0.60). Coverage of key populations and condom distribution were sustained compared to pre-transition levels (p<0.01). Transition readiness, but not institutionalization, predicted sustained outcomes post-transition. Transition readiness did not necessarily lead to institutionalization of key program elements one year after transition. Conclusion Greater preparedness prior to transition is important to achieve better service delivery outcomes post-transition. This paper illustrates a methodology to measure transition readiness pre-transition to identify less ready organizations or program components in advance, improving the likelihood of service sustainability. Further research is needed around the conceptualization and development of measures of institutionalization and its effects on long-term program sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W2477731438,"A subset of thyroid carcinomas contains a t(2;3)(q13;p25) chromosomal translocation that fuses paired box gene 8 (PAX8) with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ gene (PPARG), resulting in expression of a PAX8-PPARγ fusion protein, PPFP. We previously generated a transgenic mouse model of PPFP thyroid carcinoma and showed that feeding the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone greatly decreased the size of the primary tumor and prevented metastatic disease in vivo. The antitumor effect correlates with the fact that pioglitazone turns PPFP into a strongly PPARγ-like molecule, resulting in trans-differentiation of the thyroid cancer cells into adipocyte-like cells that lose malignant character as they become more differentiated. To further study this process, we performed cell culture experiments with thyrocytes from the PPFP mouse thyroid cancers. Our data show that pioglitazone induced cellular lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte marker genes in the cultured cells, and shRNA knockdown of PPFP eliminated this pioglitazone effect. In addition, we found that PPFP and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) physically interact, and that these transcription factors bind near each other on numerous target genes. TTF-1 knockdown and overexpression studies showed that TTF-1 inhibits PPFP target gene expression and impairs adipogenic trans-differentiation. Surprisingly, pioglitazone repressed TTF-1 expression in PPFP-expressing thyrocytes. Our data indicate that TTF-1 interacts with PPFP to inhibit the pro-adipogenic response to pioglitazone, and that the ability of pioglitazone to decrease TTF-1 expression contributes to its pro-adipogenic action.

https://openalex.org/W2477395557,"Background/Objective The menisci of the mammalian knee joint balance the incongruence between femoral condyle and tibial plateau and thus menisci absorb and distribute high loads. Degeneration processes of the menisci lead to pain syndromes in the knee joint. The origin of such degenerative processes on meniscal tissue is rarely understood and may be described best as an imbalance of anabolic and catabolic metabolism. A standardized animal model of meniscal degeneration is needed for further studies. The aim of the current study was to develop a porcine animal model with early meniscal degeneration. Material and Methods Resection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) was performed on the left knee joints of eight Göttingen minipigs. A sham operation was carried out on the right knee joint. The grade of degeneration was determined 26 weeks after the operation using histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, the expression of 14 genes which code for extracellular matrix proteins, catabolic matrix metalloproteinases and inflammation mediators were analyzed. Results Degenerative changes were detected by a histological analysis of the medial meniscus after ACLR. These changes were not detected by MRI. In terms of their gene expression profile, these degenerated medial menisci showed a significantly increased expression of COL1A1. Conclusion This paper describes a new animal model for early secondary meniscal degeneration in the Göttingen minipig. Histopathological evidence of the degenerative changes could be described. This early degenerative changes could not be seen by NMR imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2493893548,"This paper examines a cognitive mechanism that drives perspective-taking and egocentrism in interpersonal communication. Using a conceptual referential communication task, in which participants describe a range of abstract geometric shapes, Experiment 1 shows that perspective-taking and egocentric communication are frequent communication strategies. Experiment 2 tests a selection heuristic account of perspective-taking and egocentric communication. It uses participants’ shape description ratings to predict their communication strategy. Participants’ communication strategy was predicted by how informative they perceived the different shape descriptions to be. When participants’ personal shape description was perceived to be more informative than their addressee’s shape description, there was a strong bias to communicate egocentrically. By contrast, when their addressee’s shape description was perceived to be more informative, there was a strong bias to take their addressee’s perspective. When the shape descriptions were perceived to be equally informative, there was a moderate bias to communicate egocentrically. This simple, but powerful, selection heuristic may be critical to the cumulative cultural evolution of human communication systems, and cumulative cultural evolution more generally."
https://openalex.org/W2490499758,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a foodborne enteric pathogen and a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. It is known that molecules derived from the human fecal microbiota downregulate S. Typhimurium virulence gene expression and induce a starvation-like response. In this study, S. Typhimurium was cultured in minimal media to mimic starvation conditions such as that experienced by S. Typhimurium in the human intestinal tract, and the pathogen’s virulence in vitro and in vivo was measured. S. Typhimurium cultured in minimal media displayed a reduced ability to invade human epithelial cells in a manner that was at least partially independent of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system. Nutrient deprivation did not, however, alter the ability of S. Typhimurium to replicate and survive inside epithelial cells. In a murine model of S. Typhimurium-induced gastroenteritis, prior cultivation in minimal media did not alter the pathogen’s ability to colonize mice, nor did it affect levels of gastrointestinal inflammation. Upon examining the post-infection fecal gastrointestinal microbiota, we found that specifically in the 129Sv/ImJ murine strain S. Typhimurium cultured in minimal media induced differential microbiota compositional shifts compared to that of S. Typhimurium cultured in rich media. Together these findings demonstrate that S. Typhimurium remains a potent pathogen even in the face of nutritional deprivation, but nevertheless that nutrient deprivation encountered in this environment elicits significant changes in the bacterium genetic programme, as well as its capacity to alter host microbiota composition."
https://openalex.org/W2484789323,"The effects of spermidine analogues [norspermidine (NSPD, 33), spermidine (SPD, 34), homospermidine (HSPD, 44) and aminopropylcadaverine (APCAD, 35)] on cell growth were studied using Escherichia coli polyamine-requiring mutant MA261. Cell growth was compared at 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C. All four analogues were taken up mainly by the PotABCD spermidine-preferential uptake system. The degree of stimulation of cell growth at 32°C and 37°C was NSPD ≥ SPD ≥ HSPD > APCAD, and SPD ≥ HSPD ≥ NSPD > APCAD, respectively. However, at 42°C, it was HSPD » SPD > NSPD > APCAD. One reason for this is HSPD was taken up effectively compared with other triamines. In addition, since natural polyamines (triamines and teteraamines) interact mainly with RNA, and the structure of RNA is more flexible at higher temperatures, HSPD probably stabilized RNA more tightly at 42°C. We have thus far found that 20 kinds of protein syntheses are stimulated by polyamines at the translational level. Among them, synthesis of OppA, RpoE and StpA was more strongly stimulated by HSPD at 42°C than at 37°C. Stabilization of the initiation region of oppA and rpoE mRNA was tighter by HSPD at 42°C than 37°C determined by circular dichroism (CD). The degree of polyamine stimulation of OppA, RpoE and StpA synthesis by NSPD, SPD and APCAD was smaller than that by HSPD at 42°C. Thus, the degree of stimulation of cell growth by spermidine analogues at the different temperatures is dependent on the stimulation of protein synthesis by some components of the polyamine modulon."
https://openalex.org/W2492741204,"Deficiency in methyl donor (folate and vitamin B12) and in vitamin D is independently associated with altered bone development. Previously, methyl donor deficiency (MDD) was shown to weaken the activity of nuclear receptor coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC1α), for nuclear signaling in rat pups, including estrogen receptor-α and estrogen-related receptor-a; its effect on vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling, however, is unknown. We studied bone development under MDD in rat pups and used human MG-63 preosteoblast cells to better understand the associated molecular mechanism. In young rats, MDD decreased total body bone mineral density, reduced tibia length, and impaired growth plate maturation, and in preosteoblasts, MDD slowed cellular proliferation. Mechanistic studies revealed decreased expression of VDR, estrogen receptor-a, PGC1α, arginine methyltransferase 1, and sirtuin 1 in both rat proximal diaphysis of femur and in MG-63, as well as decreased nuclear VDR–PGC1α interaction in MG-63 cells. The weaker VDR–PGC1α interaction could be attributed to the reduced protein expression, imbalanced PGC1α methylation/acetylation, and nuclear VDR sequestration by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). These together compromised bone development, which is reflected by lowered bone alkaline phosphatase and increased proadipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, adiponectin, and estrogen-related receptor-α expression. Of interest, under MDD, the bone development effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were ineffectual and these could be rescued by the addition of S-adenosylmethionine, which restored expression of arginine methyltransferase 1, PGC1α, adiponectin, and HSP90. In conclusion, MDD inactivates vitamin D signaling via both disruption of VDR–PGC1α interaction and sequestration of nuclear VDR attributable to HSP90 overexpression. These data suggest that vitamin D treatment may be ineffective under MDD.—Feigerlova, E., Demarquet, L., Melhem, H., Ghemrawi, R., Battaglia-Hsu, S.-F., Ewu, E., Alberto, J.-M., Helle, D., Weryha, G., Guéant, J.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2491833948,"The human sex ratio at birth (SRB) is approximately 107 boys for every 100 girls. SRB was rising until the World War II and has been declining slightly after the 1950s in several industrial countries. Recent studies have shown that SRB varies according to exposure to disasters and socioeconomic conditions. However, it remains unknown whether changes in SRB can be explained by observable macro-level socioeconomic variables across multiple years and countries. Here we show that changes in disposable income at the macro level positively predict SRB in OECD countries. A one standard deviation increase in the change of disposable income is associated with an increase of 1.03 male births per 1000 female births. The relationship is possibly nonlinear and driven by extreme changes. The association varies from country to country being particular strong in Estonia. This is the first evidence to show that economic and social conditions are connected to SRB across countries at the macro level. This calls for further research on the effects of societal conditions on general characteristics at birth."
