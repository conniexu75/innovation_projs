https://openalex.org/W2011539765,"Demineralized oil shale was oxidized with chromic acid, and C(14) to C(22) isoprenoid fatty acids were isolated and identified. The major components of the branched-chain acid fraction after successive 3-, 6-, and 15-hour oxidations are C(15) and C(16) branched-chain acids; C(17), C(19) (norphytanic acid), and C(20) (phytanic acid) were obtained in lower concentration; no C(18) product was obtained. Separations were effected by column and gas-liquid chromatography, and the structures of individual components were determined by high- and low-resolution mass spectrometry."

https://openalex.org/W1974495687,"Quartz deformation lamellae parallel to c{OOO1} and planar features parallel to omega{10Ä«3} appear to be both characteristic of and reliable criteria for quartz deformed by shock due to impact by meteorite or comet. These features are readily distinguished from microstructures, induced during tectonic deformation, by differences in optical properties or spatial and crystallographic orientations of statistically sound populations, or in both."

https://openalex.org/W1988991983,"When a sufficiently high electric current is passed through a liquid metal, the electromagnetic pressure pinches off the liquid metal and interrupts the flow of current. For the first time the pinch effect has been overcome by use of centrifugal acceleration. By rotation of a pipe of liquid metal, tin or bismuth or their alloys, at sufficiently high speed, it can be heated electrically without intermission of the electric current. One may now heat liquid metallic substances, by resistive (ohmic) heating, to 5000 degrees K and perhaps higher temperatures."
