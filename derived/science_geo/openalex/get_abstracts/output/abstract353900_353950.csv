https://openalex.org/W2014691022,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental program that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. We here report that the induction of an EMT in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLEs) results in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and in the expression of stem-cell markers. Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties."

So far, the Antarctic Vostok and EPICA Dome C ice cores have provided a composite record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past 650,000 years. Here we present results of the lowest 200 m of the Dome C ice core, extending the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From previously published data and the present work, we find that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present. Carbon dioxide levels are below 180 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) for a period of 3,000 yr during Marine Isotope Stage 16, possibly reflecting more pronounced oceanic carbon storage. We report the lowest carbon dioxide concentration measured in an ice core, which extends the pre-industrial range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the late Quaternary by about 10 p.p.m.v. to 172-300 p.p.m.v."
https://openalex.org/W2011518477,"High complementarity between plant microRNAs (miRNAs) and their messenger RNA targets is thought to cause silencing, prevalently by endonucleolytic cleavage. We have isolated Arabidopsis mutants defective in miRNA action. Their analysis provides evidence that plant miRNA–guided silencing has a widespread translational inhibitory component that is genetically separable from endonucleolytic cleavage. We further show that the same is true of silencing mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) populations. Translational repression is effected in part by the ARGONAUTE proteins AGO1 and AGO10. It also requires the activity of the microtubule-severing enzyme katanin, implicating cytoskeleton dynamics in miRNA action, as recently suggested from animal studies. Also as in animals, the decapping component VARICOSE (VCS)/Ge-1 is required for translational repression by miRNAs, which suggests that the underlying mechanisms in the two kingdoms are related."
https://openalex.org/W1998423564,"The inflammatory response of mammalian cells to TNF-alpha can be switched to apoptosis either by cotreatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or Smac mimetic, a small molecule mimic of Smac/Diablo protein. Cycloheximide promotes caspase-8 activation by eliminating endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor, c-FLIP, while Smac mimetic does so by triggering autodegradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 (cIAP1/2), leading to the release of receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK1) from the activated TNF receptor complex to form a caspase-8-activating complex consisting of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8. This process also requires the action of CYLD, a RIPK1 K63 deubiquitinating enzyme. RIPK1 is critical for caspase-8 activation-induced by Smac mimetic but dispensable for that triggered by cycloheximide. Moreover, Smac mimetic-induced caspase-8 activation is not blocked by endogenous c-FLIP. These findings revealed that TNF-alpha is able to induce apoptosis via two distinct caspase-8 activation pathways that are differentially regulated by cIAP1/2 and c-FLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2071555702,"The activation of the tumor suppressor p53 facilitates the cellular response to genotoxic stress; however, the p53 response can only be executed if its interaction with its inhibitor Mdm2 is abolished. There have been conflicting reports on the question of whether p53 posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or acetylation, are essential or only play a subtle, fine-tuning role in the p53 response. Thus, it remains unclear whether p53 modification is absolutely required for its activation. We have now identified all major acetylation sites of p53. Although unacetylated p53 retains its ability to induce the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, loss of acetylation completely abolishes p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis. Notably, acetylation of p53 abrogates Mdm2-mediated repression by blocking the recruitment of Mdm2 to p53-responsive promoters, which leads to p53 activation independent of its phosphorylation status. Our study identifies p53 acetylation as an indispensable event that destabilizes the p53-Mdm2 interaction and enables the p53-mediated stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1973163466,"Resveratrol may protect against metabolic disease through activating SIRT1 deacetylase. Because we have recently defined AMPK activation as a key mechanism for the beneficial effects of polyphenols on hepatic lipid accumulation, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetic mice, we hypothesize that polyphenol-activated SIRT1 acts upstream of AMPK signaling and hepatocellular lipid metabolism. Here we show that polyphenols, including resveratrol and the synthetic polyphenol S17834, increase SIRT1 deacetylase activity, LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser(428), and AMPK activity. Polyphenols substantially prevent the impairment in phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target, ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), elevation in expression of FAS (fatty acid synthase), and lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes exposed to high glucose. These effects of polyphenols are largely abolished by pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SIRT1, suggesting that the stimulation of AMPK and lipid-lowering effect of polyphenols depend on SIRT1 activity. Furthermore, adenoviral overexpression of SIRT1 stimulates the basal AMPK signaling in HepG2 cells and in the mouse liver. AMPK activation by SIRT1 also protects against FAS induction and lipid accumulation caused by high glucose. Moreover, LKB1, but not CaMKKbeta, is required for activation of AMPK by polyphenols and SIRT1. These findings suggest that SIRT1 functions as a novel upstream regulator for LKB1/AMPK signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatocyte lipid metabolism. Targeting SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling by polyphenols may have potential therapeutic implications for dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes and age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1990393476,"The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is essential for the biogenesis of small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the major components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Though it is ubiquitously expressed, SMN deficiency causes the motor neuron degenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show here that SMN deficiency, similar to that which occurs in severe SMA, has unexpected cell type-specific effects on the repertoire of snRNAs and mRNAs. It alters the stoichiometry of snRNAs and causes widespread pre-mRNA splicing defects in numerous transcripts of diverse genes, preferentially those containing a large number of introns, in SMN-deficient mouse tissues. These findings reveal a key role for the SMN complex in RNA metabolism and in splicing regulation and indicate that SMA is a general splicing disease that is not restricted to motor neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2059680729,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) orchestrates progression through mitosis by decorating cell-cycle regulators with ubiquitin chains. To nucleate chains, the APC/C links ubiquitin to a lysine in substrates, but to elongate chains it modifies lysine residues in attached ubiquitin moieties. The mechanism enabling the APC/C, and ubiquitin ligases in general, to switch from lysine residues in substrates to specific ones in ubiquitin remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the topology and the mechanism of assembly for the ubiquitin chains mediating functions of the human APC/C. We find that the APC/C triggers substrate degradation by assembling K11-linked ubiquitin chains, the efficient formation of which depends on a surface of ubiquitin, the TEK-box. Strikingly, homologous TEK-boxes are found in APC/C substrates, where they facilitate chain nucleation. We propose that recognition of similar motifs in substrates and ubiquitin enables the APC/C to assemble ubiquitin chains with the specificity and efficiency required for tight cell-cycle control.

We propose that recognition of similar motifs in substrates and ubiquitin enables the APC/C to assemble ubiquitin chains with the specificity and efficiency required for tight cell-cycle control. In eukaryotes, the posttranslational modification of key regulators with ubiquitin chains plays a crucial role in almost every process (Kerscher et al., 2006Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination can trigger the reorganization of protein complexes, changes in localization, or degradation. The fate of ubiquitinated proteins is determined by adaptors, which recognize ubiquitin chains and deliver the modified substrates to effectors, such as the 26S proteasome (Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). To understand how ubiquitination gains its versatility in signaling, it is pivotal to dissect the mechanisms underlying ubiquitin chain assembly. The formation of ubiquitin chains is carried out by an enzymatic cascade (Dye and Schulman, 2007Dye B.T. Schulman B.A. Structural mechanisms underlying posttranslational modification by ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is initiated by the generation of a thioester between the carboxyl terminus (C terminus) of ubiquitin and a cysteine in ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1). This ubiquitin is transferred to the active site of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), which deliver it to ubiquitin ligases (E3). E3s are classified depending on their catalytic domain: HECT-E3s possess an active-site cysteine and receive ubiquitin from E2s before modifying the substrate. By contrast, RING-E3s simultaneously bind to E2s and substrates and facilitate ubiquitin transfer directly from the E2. All E3s nucleate chain formation by attaching the C terminus of the first ubiquitin to the ɛ-amino group of a substrate lysine. The subsequent chain elongation requires the modification of specific lysine residues in consecutive ubiquitin moieties. In yeast, all seven lysine residues of ubiquitin are used for chain assembly, resulting in chains of different topology (Peng et al., 2003Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). However, only the functions of chains linked through K48 or K63 of ubiquitin have been firmly established. While K48-linked chains trigger proteasomal degradation, K63-linked chains recruit binding partners during inflammation or DNA repair (Kerscher et al., 2006Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Several E3s can assemble specific ubiquitin chains in a single substrate binding event (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

It is not understood how this is accomplished, as lysine residues in substrates and ubiquitin are in different chemical environments and at different positions within the growing chain. The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) has served as a model for the analysis of RING-finger-dependent chain formation (Rape et al., 2006Rape M. Reddy S.K. Kirschner M.W.

Ubiquitin chain formation by the APC/C can trigger protein degradation to control cell-cycle progression (reviewed in Peters, 2006Peters J.M. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), quiescence (Wirth et al., 2004Wirth K.G. Ricci R. Giménez-Abián J.F. Taghybeeglu S. Kudo N.R. Jochum W. Vasseur-Cognet M. Nasmyth K. Loss of the anaphase-promoting complex in quiescent cells causes unscheduled hepatocyte proliferation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and differentiation (Lasorella et al., 2006Lasorella A. Stegmüller J. Guardavaccaro D. Liu G. Carro M.S. Rothschild G. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Pagano M. Bonni A. Iavarone A. Degradation of Id2 by the anaphase-promoting complex couples cell cycle exit and axonal growth.Nature. 2006; 442: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but it can also induce the nonproteolytic disassembly of spindle checkpoint complexes (Reddy et al., 2007Reddy S.K. Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation.Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The APC/C can assemble chains on substrates, such as securin and cyclin B1, rapidly and with high processivity (Carroll and Morgan, 2002Carroll C.W. Morgan D.O. The Doc1 subunit is a processivity factor for the anaphase-promoting complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Rape et al., 2006Rape M. Reddy S.K. Kirschner M.W. The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of substrate degradation.Cell. 2006; 124: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). An in vitro study using frog APC/C suggested that these chains can be linked through K11, K48, or K63 of ubiquitin (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, the topology of the ubiquitin chains mediating the diverse functions of the APC/C has remained unknown, complicating the analysis of APC/C-dependent chain formation and cell-cycle control. Here, we determine the topology of the ubiquitin chains that mediate functions of the human APC/C. We find that the APC/C and its E2 UbcH10 trigger protein degradation preferentially by assembling K11-linked rather than K48-linked chains. K11-linked ubiquitin chains act as efficient proteasomal targeting signals in vitro and in vivo. We identify a surface of ubiquitin, the TEK-box, which is necessary for the elongation of K11-linked chains. Strikingly, similar TEK-boxes are found in APC/C substrates, where they facilitate the transfer of the first ubiquitin to a substrate lysine. We propose a mechanism in which recognition of a TEK-box first aligns a substrate lysine and later K11 of ubiquitin with the active site of UbcH10 to allow the rapid formation of a K11-linked chain by the APC/C. To determine the topology of the ubiquitin chains that mediate functions of the human APC/C, we tested recombinant ubiquitin mutants in in vitro assays recapitulating APC/C activity. We employed mutants that had a single lysine replaced with arginine, such as ubiquitin-K48R (ubi-R48). Alternatively, all lysine residues were mutated except for one, as in ubiquitin with K48 as its only lysine (ubi-K48). Together, these mutants allowed us to assess whether chains of a specific topology are required or sufficient for APC/C functions. We first assayed the ubiquitin mutants for their capacity to support the degradation of a mitotic APC/C substrate, cyclin B1. Addition of UbcH10 and p31comet to extracts of mitotic cells with an activated spindle checkpoint (CP extracts) triggers the APC/C-dependent disassembly of Cdc20/Mad2 complexes (Reddy et al., 2007Reddy S.K. Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation.Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Stegmeier et al., 2007Stegmeier F. Rape M. Draviam V.M. Nalepa G. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Li M.Z. Hannon G.J. Sorger P.K. et al.Anaphase initiation is regulated by antagonistic ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities.Nature. 2007; 446: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This leads to full activation of APC/CCdc20 and, consequently, cyclin B1 ubiquitination and degradation. As reported previously, cyclin B1 is efficiently degraded in UbcH10/p31comet-treated CP extracts containing wild-type (WT) ubiquitin (Figure 1A). Strikingly, cyclin B1 is also turned over in a proteasome-dependent manner, when CP extracts are supplemented with a ubiquitin mutant that has K11 as its only lysine (ubi-K11; Figures 1A and 1B). By contrast, mutation of K11 of ubiquitin (ubi-R11) interferes with cyclin B1 degradation and also with disassembly of Cdc20/Mad2 complexes (Figure 1C and Figure S1A available online). No single-lysine ubiquitin mutant other than ubi-K11, including ubi-K48, supports degradation of cyclin B1, while no mutation other than that of K11 stabilizes cyclin B1. These results suggest that in CP extracts APC/CCdc20 achieves cyclin B1 degradation by decorating it with K11-linked chains. From anaphase until late in G1, Cdc20 is replaced by a homologous coactivator, Cdh1 (Peters, 2006Peters J.M. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). To determine whether the coactivator or cell-cycle stage influence the topology of APC/C-dependent chains, we tested our ubiquitin mutants in degradation assays using extracts with active APC/CCdh1. Consistent with our experiments in mitotic extracts, the APC/C substrate securin is rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome in G1 extracts supplemented with ubi-K11, but it is stabilized if K11 of ubiquitin is absent, such as in ubi-R11 or methyl-ubiquitin (Figures 1D and S1B). No single-lysine mutant other than ubi-K11 fully supports the degradation of securin in G1 extracts. Ubi-K11 allows the degradation of multiple APC/C substrates (Figure S1C) in extracts prepared from cells in G1 or in quiescence, when APC/CCdh1 is also active (Figure S1D). By contrast, inhibiting the formation of K11-linked chains does not impair the ubiquitination or degradation of the SCF substrate Emi1 (Figure S1E). These findings provide evidence that in extracts both APC/CCdc20 and APC/CCdh1 function by decorating substrates with K11-linked chains. To determine the importance of K11-linked chains in mediating APC/C functions in vivo, we overexpressed ubi-R11 in human cells or injected recombinant ubi-R11 into Xenopus tropicalis embryos at the two cell stage. The overexpression of ubi-R11 in human 293T cells impedes the Cdh1-dependent degradation of the APC/C substrates geminin, Plk1, and securinΔD (Figure 1E). Moreover, injection of ubi-R11 into X. tropicalis embryos delays early cell divisions and results in death of injected embryos before gastrulation (Figures 1F and 1G). These phenotypes are less dramatic but similar to those observed after injection of a dominant-negative mutant of the APC/C-specific E2, UbcH10C114S. By contrast, overexpression or injection of WT ubiquitin does not affect the degradation of APC/C substrates, progression through the cell cycle, or development of embryos. Thus, interfering with the formation of K11-linked chains stabilizes APC/C substrates and impairs cell-cycle progression and development in vivo, attesting to the importance of K11-linked chains for APC/C activity. E2s often contribute to the specificity of ubiquitin chain formation (Dye and Schulman, 2007Dye B.T. Schulman B.A. Structural mechanisms underlying posttranslational modification by ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The human APC/C has been reported to cooperate with three E2s, the specific UbcH10 and the more promiscuous UbcH5 and E2-25K. To dissect the mechanism underlying the formation of K11-linked chains, we purified these E2s and tested their specificity in APC/CCdh1-dependent chain assembly. Strikingly, APC/CCdh1 and its specific E2 UbcH10 form long ubiquitin chains only in the presence of ubi-K11 but not with other single-lysine mutants. The same strong preference for formation of K11-linked chains is observed with the distributive substrate cyclin A (Figure 2A), with the processive substrate securin (Figure 2B), and for UbcH10 autoubiquitination (Figure 2C). The mutation of K11 in ubiquitin delays chain formation by APC/CCdh1 and UbcH10 (Figure 2D). Furthermore, as shown below, ubiquitin chains assembled by APC/CCdh1 and UbcH10 using ubi-R11 are not efficiently recognized by proteasomal receptors. These results indicate that UbcH10 endows the APC/C with specificity for assembling functional K11-linked chains. In contrast to UbcH10, UbcH5a and UbcH5c can use ubi-K11, ubi-K48, and ubi-K63 to catalyze the ubiquitination of APC/CCdh1 substrates (Figure 2E; data not shown) and, thus, allow the formation of chains linked through lysine residues other than K11. E2-25K assembles chains very inefficiently, and earlier experiments indicated that these chains are linked through K48 (Figures S2A and S2B; Rodrigo-Brenni and Morgan, 2007Rodrigo-Brenni M.C. Morgan D.O. Sequential E2s drive polyubiquitin chain assembly on APC targets.Cell. 2007; 130: 127-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consistent with the importance of K11-linked chains for APC/C activity, the specific UbcH10 is more potent in promoting the degradation of the APC/CCdh1 substrate securinΔD in G1 extracts than UbcH5 or E2-25K, as observed over a wide range of E2 concentrations (Figures 2F and 2G). These results further suggest that UbcH10, but not UbcH5 or E2-25K, provide the APC/C with specificity for assembling functional K11-linked chains. To determine the molecular basis underlying the specificity of UbcH10, we compared mutants of UbcH10 and UbcH5 in APC/C-dependent assays. The interaction of E2s with the RING finger of E3s requires an aromatic side chain in loop 1 of the E2 (Zheng et al., 2000Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Structure of a c-Cbl-UbcH7 complex: RING domain function in ubiquitin-protein ligases.Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). As expected, mutation of the respective residues in UbcH10 and UbcH5, UbcH10Y91D and UbcH5F62D, inactivates both E2s in degradation and ubiquitination assays dependent on APC/CCdh1 (Figures S2C–S2E). When added to G1 extracts, UbcH10Y91A and UbcH10Y91D, but not UbcH5cF62D, impair degradation of the APC/C substrate securin and thus behave as dominant-negative mutants (Figure S2D). Consistent with this observation in extracts, injection of UbcH10Y91D into X. tropicalis embryos delays cell-cycle progression (Figure S2F). UbcH10Y91D does not interfere with proteasomal degradation, as the SCF substrate Emi1 is ubiquitinated and degraded in its presence (Figure S2G). Therefore, despite a defective RING finger interaction, UbcH10Y91D can bind the APC/C and compete with endogenous E2s in the extracts, suggesting that UbcH10 contains additional APC/C-binding motifs. A likely candidate for a second APC/C-binding site in UbcH10 is helix 1 of its UBC domain, which in other E2s participates in E3 binding (Reverter and Lima, 2005Reverter D. Lima C.D. Insights into E3 ligase activity revealed by a SUMO-RanGAP1-Ubc9-Nup358 complex.Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Zheng et al., 2000Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D.

Structure of a c-Cbl-UbcH7 complex: RING domain function in ubiquitin-protein ligases.Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and is not conserved between UbcH10 and UbcH5. Indeed, mutations in or close to helix 1 (UbcH10K33D and UbcH10D47K) significantly reduce the activity of UbcH10 in degradation and ubiquitination assays (Figures S2H and S2I). In contrast to UbcH10Y91D, UbcH10K33D and UbcH10D47K do not act as dominant negatives, indicating that their binding to the APC/C is disturbed. UbcH10K33D is also less efficiently charged by E1, which is consistent with findings that E1- and E3-binding sites in E2s overlap (Eletr et al., 2005Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. E2 conjugating enzymes must disengage from their E1 enzymes before E3-dependent ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like transfer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results imply that residues in or close to helix 1 constitute part of a second APC/C-binding motif in UbcH10. We suggest that the simultaneous engagement of two binding motifs stabilizes UbcH10 binding to the APC/C to orient UbcH10 in the optimal position for assembling K11-linked chains. Importantly, the assembly of homogenous K11-linked chains by the APC/C and UbcH10 allowed us to determine whether these chains function as proteasomal targeting signals. Indeed, APC/C substrates decorated with K11-linked chains are recognized by the proteasomal substrate receptors Rad23 (Figure 3A) and S5a in vitro (Figure 3B). Consequently, they are efficiently degraded by 26S proteasomes that copurify with the APC/C (Figure 3E; Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Proteasomal proteomics: identification of nucleotide-sensitive proteasome-interacting proteins by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified proteasomes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). APC substrates modified with K11-linked chains are also rapidly turned over by purified 26S proteasomes from human embryonic kidney cells that were added subsequent to the ubiquitination (Figure 3F). Securin can be modified with K11-linked chains and captured by Rad23 also in 293T cells (Figures 3C and 3D). These findings provide strong evidence that K11-linked ubiquitin chains function as efficient proteasomal targeting signals. As described above, the APC/C and UbcH10 are able to modify substrates with ubiquitin chains also in the absence of K11, but this occurs with delayed kinetics. In addition, the affinity of APC/C substrates to Rad23 is reduced, if chains are assembled by UbcH10 using ubi-R11 (Figure 3A), and these chains are less sensitive to proteasome activity in cells (Figure S3A). K11 is not part of the surface of ubiquitin that is recognized by Rad23, as determined by structural analysis (Varadan et al., 2005Varadan R. Assfalg M. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. Structural determinants for selective recognition of a Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain by a UBA domain.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and substrates modified with ubi-R11 by E2s other than UbcH10 are efficiently retained by Rad23 (Figure S3B). This indicates that mutation of K11 alters the structure of ubiquitin chains, which are formed by APC/CCdh1 and UbcH10, thereby impeding recognition by Rad23. We conclude that the APC/C and UbcH10 function by preferentially assembling K11-linked chains, which, as shown here, are efficient proteasomal targeting signals. In addition to the proper orientation of UbcH10, formation of K11-linked chains by the APC/C requires the alignment of K11 in the acceptor ubiquitin relative to the active site of UbcH10. To identify residues in ubiquitin that help present K11, we mutated surface-exposed amino acids to alanine and monitored the capacity of these mutants to support APC/C activity in extracts. Out of a total of 17 ubiquitin mutants, substituting K6, L8, T9, E34, and I36 with alanine strongly stabilizes securin in extracts (Figure 4A). Accordingly, overexpression of ubi-K6A and ubi-L8A in 293T cells interferes with the degradation of the APC/CCdh1 substrate securinΔD to a similar extent as overexpression of ubi-R11 (Figure 4B). Ubiquitination reactions using purified APC/CCdh1 and UbcH10 revealed that the stabilization of APC/C substrates is a consequence of impaired chain formation in the presence of these mutants (Figures 4C–4E). Overexpression of ubi-L8A reduced the modification of securin also in cells (Figure 3C). Interestingly, if the positive charge at position 6 is maintained, as in ubi-R6, neither degradation nor ubiquitination of APC/C substrates is strongly affected (Figure 1D). This suggests that K6 contributes to binding but is unlikely to be ubiquitinated itself. These experiments identify the ubiquitin residues K6, L8, T9, E34, and I36 to be required for the efficient formation of K11-linked chains by the APC/C and UbcH10. Importantly, these residues form a cluster surrounding K11, which we refer to as the TEK-box of ubiquitin (Figure 4F). In contrast to mutating the TEK-box, altering several other positions of ubiquitin does not affect ubiquitination or degradation of APC/C substrates. This includes residues shown to support the formation of K29 linkages by a HECT-E3 (E16A/E18A), the formation of K48 and K63 linkages by several E3s (I44A; K48R; Y59A; K63A/E64A), and ubiquitin recognition (I44A, D58A). Moreover, when UbcH5c is used as E2, mutations in the TEK-box inhibit the APC/C-dependent chain formation less severely (Figure S4A). Only ubi-L8A, and to a lesser extent ubi-I36A, are deficient in supporting chain formation by APC/CCdh1 and UbcH5c. None of the TEK-box residues of ubiquitin is important for the monoubiquitination of an unrelated protein (UEV1A) or for the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin dimers by Ube2N/UEV1A (Figure S4B). All ubiquitin mutants are soluble at high concentrations and, with the exception of the slightly impaired E34A mutant, efficiently loaded onto the active site of UbcH10 (data not shown). These experiments underscore the specific importance of the TEK-box of ubiquitin for UbcH10-dependent chain formation. We conclude that a cluster of residues surrounding K11 of ubiquitin, the TEK-box, is required for the efficient formation of K11-linked chains by the APC/C and UbcH10. Strikingly, we found sequences closely related to the TEK-box of ubiquitin in the APC/C substrate securin. The two TEK-boxes in securin are located immediately downstream of its D-box, which is an APC/C-binding motif responsible for its processive ubiquitination (Figure 5A; Burton et al., 2005Burton J.L.

The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of substrate degradation.Cell. 2006; 124: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Especially the second TEK-box of securin is well conserved (Figure S5A). In analogy to the TEK-box in ubiquitin, TEK-boxes in substrates could facilitate the modification of a substrate lysine, thereby nucleating ubiquitin chain formation. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether the TEK-boxes in securin contribute to APC/C binding. We used a competition assay, in which the ubiquitination and degradation of a radiolabeled APC/C substrate is competitively inhibited by addition of recombinant securin mutants. As expected, WT securin is an efficient competitor of APC/C-dependent degradation in G1 extracts, i.e., it binds well to the APC/C (Figures 5B, S5B, and S5C). Even if both the D-box and a redundant motif, the KEN-box, are deleted (securinΔDΔK), the securin mutant inhibits the APC/C, albeit with reduced efficiency. The same is observed if the D-box, KEN-box, and the first TEK-box of securin are removed by deleting the amino-terminal 78 amino acids (securinΔN78), suggesting that the remaining TEK-box in securinΔN78 is able to mediate APC/C binding. Indeed, the deletion (securinΔN78ΔTEK) or mutation (securinΔN78K91A/K92A) of this TEK-box abolishes competition by securinΔN78. Moreover, when both TEK-boxes are deleted in a securinΔDΔK background, the binding of securin to APC/CCdh1 is strongly impaired (Figure 5C). If more than 78 residues are deleted at the amino terminus, binding of securin to APC/CCdh1 is also lost, but we cannot exclude that this is caused by misfolding of the truncated proteins. Together, these experiments strongly suggest that just like the D-box, TEK-boxes contribute to the binding of securin to APC/CCdh1. To test whether the APC/C recognizes D-boxes and TEK-boxes by using distinct sites, we employed D-box and TEK-box peptides in our competition assay. As expected, the addition of a D-box peptide to G1 extracts stabilizes the labeled APC/C substrate (Figure 5D). This competition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of UbcH10 in the extracts, which allows the APC/C to ubiquitinate weakly bound substrates (Rape et al., 2006Rape M. Reddy S.K. Kirschner M.W. The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of substrate degradation.Cell. 2006; 124: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar; Figure 5D). In a similar manner, competition by the TEK-box peptide securinΔN78 is overcome by addition of UbcH10 (Figures 5D and S5D). In striking contrast, when both the D-box- and TEK-box-binding sites are saturated by the simultaneous addition of the two peptides, even high concentrations of UbcH10 are unable to bypass the competitive inhibition of the APC/C. If the labeled substrate itself does not contain TEK-boxes (securinΔTEK1/ΔTEK2), the D-box peptide alone inhibits the APC/C in the presence of high UbcH10 concentrations (Figure 5E). These results indicate that D-boxes and TEK-boxes are recognized by two nonidentical sites on the APC/C and/or UbcH10. To determine how TEK-box binding affects the UbcH10-dependent degradation of securin, we monitored securin turnover in extracts of quiescent T24 cells (G0 extracts). These extracts have very low levels of UbcH10, and APC/C substrates are degraded rapidly only after recombinant UbcH10 has been added. As expected, WT securin is degraded in G0 extracts supplemented with UbcH10 (Figure 6A). The deletion of both TEK-boxes (securinΔTEK1/ΔTEK2), but not of each TEK-box alone, strongly stabilizes securin under these conditions. If the first TEK-box is deleted, mutation of K91/K92 in the second TEK-box to alanine (securinΔTEK1/K91A/K92A) is sufficient to stabilize securin in G0 extracts. If K91/K92 are replaced by arginine, securin degradation is not affected, indicating that, reminiscent of K6 of ubiquitin, K91/K92 of s"

We propose a scenario in which turbulent-flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks during the formation of the large-scale structure. The turbulence in turn amplifies weak seed magnetic fields of any origin. Supercomputer simulations show that the turbulence is subsonic inside clusters and groups of galaxies, whereas it is transonic or mildly supersonic in filaments. Based on a turbulence dynamo model, we then estimated that the average magnetic field strength would be a few microgauss (microG) inside clusters and groups, approximately 0.1 muG around clusters and groups, and approximately 10 nanogauss in filaments. Our model presents a physical mechanism that transfers the gravitational energy to the turbulence and magnetic field energies in the large-scale structure of the universe."

In eukaryotic cells, the most energy-consuming process is ribosome biosynthesis, which adapts to changes in intracellular energy status. However, the mechanism that links energy status and ribosome biosynthesis is largely unknown. Here, we describe eNoSC, a protein complex that senses energy status and controls rRNA transcription. eNoSC contains Nucleomethylin, which binds histone H3 dimethylated Lys9 in the rDNA locus, in a complex with SIRT1 and SUV39H1. Both SIRT1 and SUV39H1 are required for energy-dependent transcriptional repression, suggesting that a change in the NAD+/NADH ratio induced by reduction of energy status could activate SIRT1, leading to deacetylation of histone H3 and dimethylation at Lys9 by SUV39H1, thus establishing silent chromatin in the rDNA locus.

These findings provide key insight into the mechanisms of energy homeostasis in cells. Ribosome production is a major biosynthetic and energy-consuming activity of eukaryotic cells. Ribosome biosynthesis adapts rapidly to changes in intracellular energy status. Conditions of energy starvation or glucose deprivation—when cellular AMP/ATP ratio is increased—lead to the activation of the LKB1-AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathway (Hardie, 2004Hardie D.G. The AMP-activated protein kinase pathway–new players upstream and downstream.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar); this signaling inhibits mammalian TOR (target of rapamycin)/p70 S6 kinase activity, which is required for rapid and sustained serum-induced ribosome biosynthesis (Bhaskar and Hay, 2007Bhaskar P.T.

USA. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Anaerobic conditions also reduce cellular energy supply. Cells regulate energy demand by sensing the environmental concentration of hydrogen ions. H+ produced under hypoxia promotes interactions between VHL and rDNA to reduce rRNA synthesis (Mekhail et al., 2006Mekhail K. Rivero-Lopez L. Khacho M. Lee S. Restriction of rRNA synthesis by VHL maintains energy equilibrium under hypoxia.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2401-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). rRNA synthesis is tightly regulated in response to metabolic and environmental changes (Grummt, 2003Grummt I.

Exponentially growing cells use no more than half of their total complement of rRNA genes, and it has been shown in both mammalian cells and budding yeast that the number of active genes decreases when cells undergo transition from log to stationary phase (Claypool et al., 2004Claypool J.A.

RPD3 is required for the inactivation of yeast ribosomal DNA genes in stationary phase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4959-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In yeast, this gene inactivation is dependent on the histone deacetylase Rpd3 (Oakes et al., 2006Oakes M.L. Siddiqi I. French S.L. Vu L. Sato M. Aris J.P. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Role of histone deacetylase Rpd3 in regulating rRNA gene transcription and nucleolar structure in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3889-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the chromatin-remodeling complex NoRC recruits HDAC1 and DNA methyltransferases to inactive rRNA gene repeats (Santoro et al., 2002Santoro R. Li J. Grummt I. The nucleolar remodeling complex NoRC mediates heterochromatin formation and silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity level of rRNA genes is correlated with the type and extent of their chromatin modifications. Taken together, these data argue that epigenetic mechanisms control the ratio of active to inactive genes. In yeast, heterochromatin formation at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus is also controlled by Sir2p, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that removes acetyl groups from the N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4 to regulate nucleosome and chromatin structure (Buck et al., 2002Buck S.W. Sandmeier J.J. Smith J.S. RNA polymerase I propagates unidirectional spreading of rDNA silent chromatin.Cell. 2002; 111: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Increasing the expression of Sir2p can extend the life span of yeast by suppressing homologous recombination between rDNA repeat sequences (Guarente, 2000Guarente L. Sir2 links chromatin silencing, metabolism, and aging.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar). In human, the Sir2p homolog SIRT1 deacetylates transcription factors such as FOXOs, p53, and NF-κB (Yang et al., 2006Yang T. Fu M. Pestell R. Sauve A.A. SIRT1 and endocrine signaling.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). SIRT1 is inducibly transcribed in response to calorie restriction (CR) or fasting (Cohen et al., 2004Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A.

Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Nutrient availability regulates SIRT1 through a forkhead-dependent pathway.Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), suggesting a broad role in mammalian physiology as a mediator of adaptation to nutrient deprivation. Here, we identify a protein complex, eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex), that contains a previously uncharacterized protein, termed Nucleomethylin (NML), as well as SIRT1 and SUV39H1. Our results suggest that an energy-dependent change in the NAD+/NADH ratio regulates eNoSC, allowing the complex to couple changing energy status with level of rRNA synthesis. In addition, by limiting ribosome biogenesis, eNoSC promotes the restoration of energy balance and protects cells from energy deprivation-dependent apoptosis. Glucose deprivation activates LKB1-AMPK signaling and leads to the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis (Shaw et al., 2004Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. The tumor suppressor LKB1 kinase directly activates AMP-activated kinase and regulates apoptosis in response to energy stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Glucose deprivation also reduces rRNA synthesis in HeLa cells (Figure 1A). Because HeLa cells do not express LKB1 (Tiainen et al., 1999Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Growth suppression by Lkb1 is mediated by a G(1) cell cycle arrest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), this result raises the possibility that, in addition to the LKB1-AMPK pathway, there are other pathways that control cellular energy balance. The LKB1-AMPK pathway reduces the transcription rate of rRNA genes. In contrast, recent reports mention the importance of epigenetic regulation of rDNA (McStay, 2006McStay B. Nucleolar dominance: a model for rRNA gene silencing.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, we next investigated whether glucose removal affects the chromatin structure on rDNA locus. We analyzed the levels of methylation at Lys9 and acetylation of histone H3 at the rDNA locus by using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with primers that amplify the rRNA genes (H0; Figure 1H). Glucose reduction induced the deacetylation and dimethylation at Lys9 of histone H3 in rRNA genes (Figure 1B). To elucidate the mechanisms which link cellular energy status and epigenetic status of rDNA, we purified proteins that bind to histone H3 dimethylated at Lys9 (H3K9me2) from HeLa nuclear extracts, using differentially modified N-terminal tails of histone H3 peptides. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a protein that specifically binds to the H3K9me2 peptide as KIAA0409 (accession number BC001071, GeneID 23378) (Figure 1C). According to a recent proteomic analysis of nucleolar proteins, KIAA0409 localizes in the nucleolus (Andersen et al., 2005Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K. Ong S.E. Lyon C.E. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nucleolar proteome dynamics.Nature. 2005; 433: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation using the Muramatsu method (Andersen et al., 2005Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W.

Studies on nucleolar Rna of the walker 256 carcinosarcoma and the liver of the rat.Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 1028-1034PubMed Google Scholar) and immunofluoresence studies confirmed that KIAA0409 is present in the nucleoli along with UBF (Figures 1D and 1E). Therefore, we designated KIAA0409 as NML. Western blot analysis with anti-NML antibody (Figure S1 available online) and pull-down experiments revealed that this protein preferentially bound to the H3K9me2 peptide (Figures 1F and S2). NML specifically coimmunoprecipitates with Lys9-dimethylated but not with Lys4-dimethylated histone H3 (Figure 1G). ChIP and re-ChIP analysis using primers that amplify the rRNA gene promoter (H0), the 28S rRNA coding region (H8), or the noncoding region (H23) indicated that NML bound throughout the rDNA locus with H3K9me2 (Figures 1H and 1I). These observations suggest that NML binds to H3K9me2 in the silent rDNA clusters in vivo in the context of native chromatin. Given that NML preferentially binds to silent rDNA clusters, it is possible that NML might have a suppressive function on rRNA transcription. Thus, we next examined pre-rRNA synthesis in various cell lines infected with adenovirus vector containing either NML (ad-NML) or LacZ (ad-LacZ) as a control. Infection of ad-NML resulted in a decrease of pre-rRNA levels in all cell lines tested (Figure 2A). Conversely, the level of pre-rRNA synthesis was increased in cells transfected with small-interfering RNAs against NML (NML siRNAs) (Figures 2B and 2C). We also performed nuclear run-on assays and confirmed that NML reduced the level of transcription (Figure 2D). Next, we generated clones that stably expressed a small hairpin RNA against NML (NML shRNA), control LacZ (control), or FLAG-NML (NML stable) (Figure 2E). The growth rates of these cell lines were almost the same (data not shown). RT quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis confirmed the enhancement of pre-rRNA synthesis in NML shRNA clones and reduction in the NML stable clones (Figure 2F). In addition, NML reduces the level of protein synthesis in an NML-dose-dependent manner (Figure 2G). Taken together, these observations suggest that NML associates with H3K9me2 in heterochromatic clusters in rDNA and suppresses rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. ChIP analysis revealed that increasing levels of NML caused a dose-dependent reduction of the acetylation and elevation of the Lys9 methylation of histone H3 (Figure 2H). These results indicate that alteration of NML levels changes the ratio between active and silent states in the rDNA repeats. To investigate the molecular bases for the functions of NML, control or NML-overexpressing cells were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA) and nicotinamide (NIA). TSA inhibits class I/II HDACs; NIA is known as a class III HDAC inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of SIRT1. As shown in Figure 3A, reduction of pre-rRNA levels by NML overexpression was prevented by NIA, but not by TSA, implicating SIRT1 in the NML-mediated inhibition of rRNA synthesis. Knockdown of endogenous SIRT1 by siRNAs increased pre-rRNA levels and prevented the NML-dependent repression (Figures 3B and 3C). Conversely, expression of SIRT1 decreased pre-rRNA levels and strengthened the NML-dependent repression (Figure 3C). We next tested the interaction between NML and SIRT1 by coimmunoprecipitation and found that SIRT1 interacts with NML (Figure 3D). ChIP analysis using H0, H8, or H23 primers showed that SIRT1 associated with chromatin throughout the rDNA locus (Figure S3). In addition, re-ChIP analysis revealed that a protein complex containing NML and SIRT1 associates with the silent chromatin region of rDNA (Figure 3E). The binding of SIRT1 to rDNA was abrogated by NML siRNA treatment (Figures 3F and S4). Interestingly, SIRT1 siRNA also reduced the binding of NML to the rDNA locus (Figure 3F). These results indicate the coordinate binding of NML and SIRT1 to rDNA. Expression of a deacetylase activity-deficient SIRT1 mutant, SIRT1(H355A), resulted in increased pre-rRNA levels and prevented the NML-dependent reduction of pre-rRNA levels (Figures 3G and S5), indicating that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 is necessary for the repression of rRNA synthesis mediated by NML. SIRT1 preferentially deacetylates core histones H3 Lys9, H3 Lys14, and H4 Lys16 in vitro (Vaquero et al., 2004Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Human SirT1 interacts with histone H1 and promotes formation of facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). A ChIP assay showed that reduction of SIRT1 protein level by siRNA increased the acetylation of histone H3 at the rDNA locus (Figure 3H). Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in Lys9 methylation of H3 as a result of SIRT1 knockdown (Figure 3H). This result implies that deacetylation at Lys9 of H3 is prerequisite for its methylation (Shankaranarayana et al., 2003Shankaranarayana G.D. Motamedi M.R. Moazed D. Grewal S.I. Sir2 regulates histone H3 lysine 9 methylation and heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Considering these results together with the observation that NML knockdown also reduced the Lys9 methylation of H3 (Figure 2H), it appears that histone methyltransferases participate in the NML/SIRT1-mediated rRNA gene silencing. It is known that Lys9 of histone H3 is methylated by histone methyltransferases such as SUV39H1, EZH2, and G9a (Lachner and Jenuwein, 2002Lachner M. Jenuwein T. The many faces of histone lysine methylation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). G9a is involved in the activation of rRNA gene transcription (Yuan et al., 2007Yuan X. Feng W. Imhof A. Grummt I. Zhou Y. Activation of RNA polymerase I transcription by cockayne syndrome group B protein and histone methyltransferase G9a.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility of an interaction between NML and either SUV39H1 or EZH2 and found that NML preferentially associates with SUV39H1 (Figure 4A). SUV39H1 siRNA prevented the NML-dependent repression of rRNA synthesis (Figures 4B and 4C). On the other hand, expression of SUV39H1 decreased pre-rRNA levels (Figure 4D). The SUV39H1-dependent reduction of pre-rRNA levels requires the methyltransferase activity of SUV39H1; overexpression of SUV39H1(R235H), a methyltransferase activity-deficient mutant, resulted in increased pre-rRNA levels (Figures 4D and S6). A ChIP assay showed that reduction of SUV39H1 protein levels decreased the Lys9 methylation and increased the acetylation of histone H3 at the rDNA locus (Figure 4E). Because knockdown of SUV39H1 increased the acetylation of H3, it is possible that SUV39H1 is involved in the recruitment of NML and SIRT1. Consistent with this idea, the binding of NML and SIRT1 to rDNA was abrogated by SUV39H1 siRNA (Figure 4F). These results indicate the coordinate binding of NML, SIRT1, and SUV39H1 to rDNA. To investigate the possibility that these proteins form a single protein complex, the protein complex containing both NML and SUV39H1 was sequentially immunoprecipitated by antibodies. Immunoblotting of the precipitate with anti-SIRT1 antibody demonstrated the presence of SIRT1 (Figure 4G), indicating that NML formed a ternary complex with both SIRT1 and SUV39H1. To confirm this interaction among the endogenous proteins, we immunoprecipitated the protein complex from HeLa cell extracts using anti-NML antibody and identified SIRT1 and SUV39H1 in the precipitates (Figure 4H). In purification experiments using H3K9me2 peptide, NML, SIRT1, and SUV39H1 were copurified (Figure 4I). Our observations indicate that an NML/SIRT1/SUV39H1 protein complex suppresses rRNA gene transcription by establishing silent chromatin at the rDNA locus. In mammalian cells, CR decreases cellular ATP concentration and increases the NAD+/NADH ratio (Guarente and Picard, 2005Guarente L. Picard F. Calorie restriction–the SIR2 connection.Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). According to our observations and the fact that the NAD+/NADH ratio regulates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, it is possible that the NML/SIRT1/SUV39H1 complex participates in CR-induced repression of rRNA gene transcription. ChIP analysis revealed that the binding of NML and SIRT1 to the rDNA locus increased during glucose deprivation (Figure 5A). In addition, neither downregulation of pre-rRNA levels nor alteration of histone modifications induced by glucose deprivation were observed in cells treated with siRNA against NML, SIRT1, or SUV39H1 (Figures 5B and 5C). Thus, the NML/SIRT1/SUV39H1 complex participates in the downregulation of rRNA transcription under CR. Consequently, we designated the NML/SIRT1/SUV39H1 complex as eNoSC. Next, we performed parallel timecourse studies of pre-rRNA levels and total cellular ATP levels in control and NML shRNA cells. As shown in Figure 5D, in the absence of glucose, pre-rRNA levels in NML shRNA cells reduced more slowly than those in the control cells. In contrast, the total cellular ATP levels in NML shRNA cells decreased faster than those in control cells. These observations suggest that eNoSC restores energy levels under low-glucose conditions. TUNEL assay and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) cleavage assay revealed that insufficient intracellular energy induced apoptosis (Figures 5E and 5F). Thus, we next measured the percentage of dead cells in populations of HEK293 cells transfected with either indicated siRNAs or NML expression vector after various intervals of glucose deprivation (Figure 5G). When glucose was withdrawn, cells treated with siRNA against NML, SIRT1, or SUV39H1 died rapidly as compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Figure 5G). Knockdown of the components of eNoSC reduced the tolerance of low-glucose conditions (Figure 5H). The same results were obtained when we used HeLa cells (Figure S7). Conversely, NML expression protected cells from apoptosis (Figures 5G and 5H). These results indicate that eNoSC-mediated rDNA silencing protects cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. Sequence analysis demonstrates that the N-terminal domain of NML shows no obvious domain structure; however, it is required for the specific binding to H3K9me2 peptide (Figure S2). The C-terminal domain of NML contains consensus sequence motifs (I, post-I, II, and III) found in SAM-dependent methyltransferases (SAM-MT) (Schluckebier et al., 1995Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. Universal catalytic domain structure of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Figure 6A). Thus, we have solved the crystal structure of the methyltransferase-like domain of NML(242–456 amino acids [aa]) complexed with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) at 2.0 Å resolution using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction of seleno-methionyl protein crystals (Figure 6B and Table S1). NML(242–456 aa) can be divided into two parts: a large domain and a small domain. The large domain reveals an α/β structure and adopts a well-characterized SAM-MT fold with a seven-stranded β sheet (β1–β7) with two helices (α1, α2) on one side and two helices (α3, α4) on the opposite side. The small domain, comprising three helices (αA–αC), is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and packs against the SAM-MT fold via hydrophobic interactions (Figure 6C). It should be noted that the C-terminal region after β7 turns back toward the molecule and is inserted into the pocket formed by α3 and α4. The SAH molecule is well-ordered in the crystal structure at the carboxyl ends of the parallel strands, and its three moieties are recognizable (Figure 6D). The amino group of the methionine moiety interacts with the oxygen atom of Cys363 and the carboxylate of Asp314 via a water molecule belonging to motif I. Both hydroxyls of the ribose moiety are recognized by Asp334 and His281, which belong to the post-I and small domains, respectively. Finally, the nitrogen atoms of the adenine moiety (N1, N6, and N7) interact, respectively, with the main-chain nitrogen atom of Met347, the carboxylate of Asp346, and (via a water molecule) the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly368. The small domain forms a lid covering the SAH-binding pocket (Figure 6E). As a consequence, the pocket is almost buried, and the sulfur atom in SAH is thus only accessible via a narrow entrance (Figure 6F). Next, to investigate whether SAM binding to NML is essential for its function, we generated two types of mutated NML, NMLm1 and NMLm2, in which the Gly residues in motif I are mutated (G316D and G318R for NMLm1 and G316Q for NMLm2) (Figure 6A). Neither mutant possesses the ability to bind SAM (Figure 6G). The aa substitutions introduced into these mutants do not affect NML binding to either SIRT1, SUV39H1, or chromatin (Figures 7A–7C). However, neither mutant was able to suppress pre-rRNA levels when expressed in HEK293 (Figure 7D) or HeLa cells (data not shown). Consistent with this, expression of the mutants did not alter the modifications of histones in rRNA genes (Figure 7E). Furthermore, NML expression protected cells from energy starvation-induced apoptosis, whereas neither mutant could do so (Figures 7F and S8), suggesting that SAM binding to NML is essential for its function. Considering that NML has a methyltransferase-like domain, it is possible that there may be target molecules of NML that are important for silencing of rDNA locus. Our observations suggest that CR-induced changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio regulate eNoSC, enabling the complex to couple changing energy status with levels of rRNA synthesis and ribosome production. Under standard glucose conditions, the components of eNoSC interact with the rDNA region, and knockdown of these components increases pre-rRNA levels (Figures 5A and 5B). These differences were statistically significant; statistical analysis in Figure 5B by t test revealed that the p value of control (lane 1) versus siRNA transfected cells (lanes 5, 7, and 9) was < 0.05. This result implies that the complex also has a constitutive role in rDNA silencing. In mammals, the effect of sirtuins at the rDNA locus is complex. TAFI68, a basal component of the Pol I transcription apparatus, is a relevant target of SIRT1 (Muth et al., 2001Muth V. Nadaud S. Grummt I. Voit R. Acetylation of TAF(I)68, a subunit of TIF-IB/SL1, activates RNA polymerase I transcription.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also show that SIRT1 suppresses the pre-rRNA levels in the nucleolus. On the other hand, SIRT7 is a nucleolar protein that acts as a positive regulator of Pol I transcription (Ford et al., 2006Ford E. Voit R. Liszt G. Magin C. Grummt I. Guarente L. Mammalian Sir2 homolog SIRT7 is an activator of RNA polymerase I transcription.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our results that NIA, an inhibitor of SIRT family members, abrogates the function of eNoSC raised a possibility that NML could also associate with SIRT7. However, coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that SIRT7 was not able to bind to NML (Figure S9). The steady-state distribution of SIRT1 is essentially nucleoplasmic, showing only a very faint nucleolar localization (Michishita et al., 2005Michishita E. Park J.Y. Burneskis J.M. Barrett J.C. Horikawa I. Evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved cellular localizations and functions of human SIRT proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4623-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In immunostaining using anti-SIRT1 antibody, we observed that a small fraction of SIRT1 is localized in the nucleolus (Figure S10). These observations imply that nucleoplasmic/nucleolar shuttling is required in order for SIRT1 to act in the nucleolus. Recent evidences indicate that the nucleolus is associated with different types of protein dynamics; some nucleolar proteins such as UBF are immobile (Roussel et al., 1993Roussel P. Andre C. Masson C. Geraud G. Hernandez-Verdun D. Localization of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor hUBF during the cell cycle.J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other proteins such as Nucleophosmin/B23 have a steady-state nucleolar distribution but continuously shuttle between nucleolus and nucleoplasm (Colombo et al., 2002Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nucleophosmin regulates the stability and transcriptional activity of p53.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A quantitative analysis of the proteome of nucleoli revealed that some proteins are stably copurified with nucleoli, while many proteins only accumulate transiently in nucleoli (Andersen et al., 2005Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K. Ong S.E. Lyon C.E. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nucleolar proteome dynamics.Nature. 2005; 433: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). This observation also indicates that many nucleolar proteins cycle between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. SIRT1 could be one of these proteins. Our observations demonstrate that SIRT1 functions in the nucleolus; however, we acknowledge that data obtained from overexpression experiments could include artifacts caused by forced recruitment of nucleoplasmic SIRT1 to the nucleolus. SIRT1 has been shown to protect against apoptosis by deacetylating nonhistone proteins such as p53 (Luo et al., 2001Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Negative control of p53 by Sir2alpha promotes cell survival under stress.Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that eNoSC could also inhibit cell death via deacetylating nonhistone proteins. In our hands, SIRT1-dependent p53 deacetylatio"

https://openalex.org/W2067328670,"The cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is initiated by the rapid recruitment of repair factors to the site of DNA damage to form a multiprotein repair complex. How the repair complex senses damaged DNA and then activates the DDR is not well understood. We show that prolonged binding of DNA repair factors to chromatin can elicit the DDR in an ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)– and DNAPK (DNA-dependent protein kinase)–dependent manner in the absence of DNA damage. Targeting of single repair factors to chromatin revealed a hierarchy of protein interactions within the repair complex and suggests amplification of the damage signal. We conclude that activation of the DDR does not require DNA damage and stable association of repair factors with chromatin is likely a critical step in triggering, amplifying, and maintaining the DDR signal."
https://openalex.org/W2073311665,"The Shallow Radar (SHARAD) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has imaged the internal stratigraphy of the north polar layered deposits of Mars. Radar reflections within the deposits reveal a laterally continuous deposition of layers, which typically consist of four packets of finely spaced reflectors separated by homogeneous interpacket regions of nearly pure ice. The packet/interpacket structure can be explained by approximately million-year periodicities in Mars' obliquity or orbital eccentricity. The observed approximately 100-meter maximum deflection of the underlying substrate in response to the ice load implies that the present-day thickness of an equilibrium elastic lithosphere is greater than 300 kilometers. Alternatively, the response to the load may be in a transient state controlled by mantle viscosity. Both scenarios probably require that Mars has a subchondritic abundance of heat-producing elements."
https://openalex.org/W2161112329,"The role of cell size and shape in controlling local intracellular signaling reactions, and how this spatial information originates and is propagated, is not well understood. We have used partial differential equations to model the flow of spatial information from the beta-adrenergic receptor to MAPK1,2 through the cAMP/PKA/B-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in neurons using real geometries. The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated negative regulators, such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains of activated signaling components. The model prediction that negative regulators control the flow of spatial information to downstream components was verified experimentally in rat hippocampal slices. These results suggest a mechanism by which cellular geometry, the presence of regulatory loops with negative regulators, and key reaction rates all together control spatial information transfer and microdomain characteristics within cells."

Better insight in the carbohydrate recognition profile of C-type lectins will ultimately provide relevant information for the development of new drugs targeting specific fungal cell wall antigens. The fungus Candida is the most common cause of opportunistic mycotic infections in severely immunocompromised hosts, such as surgical, cancer, and transplant patients, worldwide (1McNeil M.M.

During infection, the transition from simple yeast form to multicellular filaments (hyphae) plays a fundamental role in evading the host immune defense. C. albicans remains the most common Candida species in human pathology, but the prevalence of other species including C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. dubliniensis, remains significant (2Abi-Said D.

The stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent activation of antifungal host defense depend on specific recognition of the invading fungus. Cells of the innate immune system recognize pathogens by identifying conserved microbial structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 6The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern-recognition receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MMR, macrophage mannose receptor; CLR, C-type lectin receptor; IL, interleukin; DC, dentritic cells; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; MALLS, multi-angle laser light scattering photometry. 6The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern-recognition receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MMR, macrophage mannose receptor; CLR, C-type lectin receptor; IL, interleukin; DC, dentritic cells; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; MALLS, multi-angle laser light scattering photometry. which are structurally distinct from molecules expressed on mammalian cells (4Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6094) Google Scholar). The Candida cell wall is almost exclusively composed of glycans. Glycans are synthesized as polymers of three types of monosaccharides: d-glucose, which forms β-(1,3) and β-(1,6) glucan, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, which forms chitin, and d-mannose, giving rise to mannan (5Masuoka J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 281-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The outer layer of the C. albicans cell wall is enriched in mannoproteins, representing up to 30-40% of the cell wall dry weight (6Klis F.M. de Groot P. Hellingwerf K. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while chitin, β-(1,3)- and β-(1,6)-glucan are more prominent in the inner layer. In addition, the interplay between C. albicans glycans and the host induces modifications in C. albicans morphogenesis that are associated with changes in cell wall composition (7Calderone R.A.

Little is known about the initial interactions between Candida PAMPs and immune cell receptors, because a detailed characterization at the structural level is lacking. The importance of detailed knowledge of the fungal PAMP repertoire and activity is also underscored by the development of more and more fungal glycan-based vaccines (10Bystricky S. Paulovicova E.

Similarly, efforts are aimed at the development of synthetic glyco-conjugates based on fungal glycan structures that provide protection against candidiasis (16Wu X. Bundle D.R. J. Org.

Despite this, the relative contribution of the various Candida PAMPs and their receptors to binding and cytokine stimulation by DCs remains unknown. DCs express several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that specifically recognize distinct PAMPs displayed on fungal surfaces including C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) (21Cambi A. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (22Netea M.G. van der Graaf C. Van der Meer J.W. Kullberg B.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), member of the CLR family, has been shown to recognize C. albicans on DCs (23Newman S.L. Holly A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6813-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and we previously demonstrated that the DC-associated CLR DC-SIGN (CD209) is also involved in binding and internalization of C. albicans by human DCs (24Cambi A.

Despite the progress in understanding the interaction of some of the fungal PAMPs with PRRs expressed on DCs, there is no integrated view of the mechanism(s) by which DCs sense C. albicans PAMPs. We recently showed that recognition of C. albicans by monocytes/macrophages is a multiple step process involving several PRRs recognizing the various layers of the outer portion of the fungal cell wall (25Netea M.G.

Here, by combining a range of C. albicans isogenic glycosylation mutants with receptor-specific blocking and cytokine production assays, we determined the structure of the fungal mannan that is specifically recognized by the CLRs on human DCs and can directly influence the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Our results indicate that different mannan structures may skew the cytokine profile of DCs and differentially modulate the immune response. Therefore, better insight in the carbohydrate recognition profile of CLRs will ultimately provide relevant information for the development of new drugs targeting specific fungal cell wall antigens.

Candida Strains and Culture Conditions—C. albicans, strain UC820, a well described clinical isolate (35Forsyth C.B. Mathews H.L. Cell Immunol. 1996; 170: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was maintained on agar slants at 4 °C. Strain UC820 was inoculated into 100 ml of Sabouraud broth and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. C. albicans serotype B wild-type (LGH 1095) and Δmnn4 were grown as reported elsewhere (36Singleton D.R. Masuoka J. Hazen K.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, starter cultures were grown in 10 ml of Sabouraud broth overnight at 30 °C. 1 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 100 ml of Sabouraud broth and cultured at 30 °C until log phase is reached. After two washes with pyrogen-free saline by centrifugation at 1500 × g, the number of yeast cells was counted in a hemocytometer and resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml. Heat-kill was at 56 °C for 1 h, if it is required. Clinical isolates of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis yeast cells were used for Fig. 1A. Yeast cell suspensions were kept frozen at -80 °C until used. The homozygous null mutants in glycosylation genes were constructed in the C. albicans CAI-4 serotype A background by targeted gene disruption (37Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y.

Candida Binding Studies—The binding of DCs or K-DC-SIGN to Candida yeast cells was measured by flow cytometry using the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and performed as already described (24Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B. Adema G.J. Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Romani L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To test the effect of various reagents on ligand binding the following concentrations were used: different carbohydrates 150 μg/ml (unless otherwise indicated), EGTA 2 mm, isotype control (mouse IgG1), AZN-D1 anti-DC-SIGN, anti-MMR, anti-Dectin-1, anti-DCIR, and anti-DEC-205 (30 μg/ml). Incubations were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin, as already published (24Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B.

After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, cell-yeast conjugates were analyzed by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis—Immature DCs (5 × 105) were allowed to adhere onto fibronectin and subsequently incubated with FITC-labeled C. albicans or C. dubliniensis yeast cells (2.5 × 106) or FITC-labeled C. albicans CAI-4 wild-type and mannosylation mutants (2.5 × 106) for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were fixed in 4% PFA, permeabilized in Triton X-100, and labeled for DC-SIGN and/or the MMR using specific mAb and isotype-specific fluorescent secondary Abs (24Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B. Adema G.J. Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Romani L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Fluorescent Beads Adhesion Assay—The fluorescent beads adhesion assay was performed as described previously (42Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of cells that bound fluorescent beads was determined by flow cytometry. In inhibition studies, the assay was performed in the presence of the inhibitors, as described above for the Candida binding studies. NMR Spectroscopy—The proton and carbon-13 NMR spectra were collected on a JEOL Eclipse+ 600 NMR spectrometer in 5-mm OD NMR tubes at 70 °C in D2O. Internal chemical shift reference was provided by trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-d4-propionic acid (TSP) (43Huckerby T.N. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1983; 21: 67-70Google Scholar, 44Hoffman R.E. Davies D.B. Magn.

Individual solutions of SC-mannan and CA-mannan were prepared at concentrations of 24 and 15 mg per 1 ml of solvent, respectively. GPC/MALLS Methodology—The molecular weight distributions of the mannans were established by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with online multi-angle laser light scattering photometry (MALLS) as described previously (46Muller A.

Stimulation of IL-6 Production in Human DCs—Samples of 3 × 105 immature DCs in 300-μl volume were added to round-bottomed 48-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) and incubated with the various strains of C. albicans (ratio DCs/Candida = 1:10). After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the DCs/C. albicans cell suspensions were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C until assayed. IL-6 concentration was measured by commercial ELISA kits (Sanquin), as already reported (25Netea M.G. Gow N.A. Munro C.A. Bates S. Collins C. Ferwerda G. Hobson R.P. Bertram G. Hughes H.B. Jansen T. Jacobs L. Buurman E.T. Gijzen K. Williams D.L. Torensma R. McKinnon A. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Van der Meer J.W. Brown A.J. Kullberg B.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1642-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN Recognizes Several Species of Candida—We previously demonstrated that DC-SIGN binds and internalizes C. albicans (24Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B. Adema G.J. Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Romani L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Because several distinct Candida species are commonly found in patients with candidiasis (2Abi-Said D. Anaissie E. Uzun O. Raad I. Pinzcowski H. Vartivarian S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 3Coleman D.C. Sullivan D.J. Bennett D.E. Moran G.P. Barry H.J. Shanley D.B. Aids. 1997; 11: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we analyzed the capacity of DC-SIGN to recognize and bind a range of different Candida species (Fig. 1A). K562 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN (K-DC-SIGN) strongly bound C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C. glabrata, but only weakly interacted with C. parapsilosis. In addition, DC-SIGN bound S. cerevisiae-derived zymosan particles. Anti-DC-SIGN mAb and the Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA effectively inhibited the interactions demonstrating the specificity for DC-SIGN. DC-SIGN contributes to the binding and internalization of C. albicans by DCs (24Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B. Adema G.J. Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Romani L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, we compare the binding of DCs isolated from different donors to C. albicans and C. dubliniensis and show that similarly to C. albicans, a significant percentage of the binding to C. dubliniensis was also mediated by DC-SIGN. Moreover, both C. albicans and C. dubliniensis yeast cells were found in DC-SIGN-enriched vesicles (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when zymosan was used (data not shown). These results demonstrate that although the affinity of DC-SIGN varies among Candida species, in DCs DC-SIGN is involved in the uptake of all Candida species tested. DC-SIGN Specifically Interacts with Candida-derived Mannan—The Candida cell wall is primarily comprised of mannan and by a lesser content of glucan and chitin (5Masuoka J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 281-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN is known to bind high mannose moieties (47Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To determine the PAMP structures specifically recognized by DC-SIGN on the C. albicans cell wall, we investigated whether purified S. cerevisiae-derived mannan (SC-mannan) would inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated binding (Fig. 2A). As expected, binding to known DC-SIGN ligands, such as ICAM-3 and gp120 (27Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G.

Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar), coated onto fluorescent beads, as well as to zymosan particles, was inhibited by SC-mannan. Surprisingly, the interactions with both C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were not affected by the pretreatment with SC-mannan (Fig. 2A). To further investigate whether the interaction between DC-SIGN and Candida occurs at the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the receptor, two mutants of DC-SIGN, each carrying a specific point mutation known to affect binding, were compared with the wild-type receptor for their ability to bind to the fungus. The amino acid residue Val351 has been shown to be essential for DC-SIGN-mediated binding, because its mutation to Gly abrogated the interaction with ICAM-3 (49Geijtenbeek T.B. van Duijnhoven G.C. van Vliet S.J. Krieger E. Vriend G. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11314-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and LewisX (50Van Liempt E. Imberty A.

Furthermore, it was reported that mutating the Ca2+-chelating residue Asp324 into Ala resulted in complete loss of ligand binding (49Geijtenbeek T.B. van Duijnhoven G.C. van Vliet S.J. Krieger E. Vriend G. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11314-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The observation that the V351G mutant of DC-SIGN binds to Candida much less efficiently than wild type and that the E324A mutant had totally lost its capacity to interact with the fungus (Fig. 2B) demonstrates that the interaction between DC-SIGN and Candida is specifically mediated by the CRD. It has to be noted that the expression level of these mutated forms of DC-SIGN is comparable to the wild-type (supplemental Fig. S1). To get further insight into the specificity of DC-SIGN recognizing mannan structures from fungi, we analyzed several purified fungal cell wall carbohydrates (supplemental Table S1) for their capacity to inhibit this interaction. Strikingly, CA-mannan was the only fungal cell wall carbohydrate that specifically inhibitedK-DC-SIGNbindingto C. albicans inaconcentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The high specificity of this recognition was further demonstrated by the observation that CA-mannan but not SC-mannan was able to inhibit binding of C. dubliniensis to K-DC-SIGN (supplemental Fig. S1A). The inhibitory effect of SC-mannan on DC-SIGN binding to zymosan (Fig. 2A) suggests that SC-mannan may better represent the structure of the zymosan mannan rather than the mannan structure exposed at the cell wall of Candida. Similarly, we demonstrated that CA-mannan was the only fungal cell wall-derived carbohydrate tested that specifically and significantly abrogated binding of DCs to C. albicans (Fig. 2D). The blockade of binding observed after pretreatment of DCs with CA-mannan but not with other carbohydrates also shows that no significant role is played by glucan receptors on human DCs in binding C. albicans. This notion is further supported by the finding that blocking of DC binding to C. dubliniensis was also detected only in the presence of CA-mannan (supplemental Fig. S1B). In agreement with these observations, when a panel of DC-associated CLRs was blocked, only inhibition of MMR and DC-SIGN significantly affected the recognition of Candida by DCs (Fig. 2E). These data clearly indicate that the PAMP specifically recognized by DCs in the interactions with Candida is mannan. DC-SIGN Recognizes Structural Differences in Fungal N-Mannan—To reveal the differences between CA- and SC-mannan, we next performed a comparative structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (supplemental Fig. S2). All fungal mannans consist of a backbone of α-(1,6)-linked mannosyl repeat units with side chains of α- or β-(1,2)-linked mannosyl repeat units connected to the backbone by a α-(1,2)-linkage as well as phosphate di-mannosyl esters and α-(1,3)-linked mannosyl units at the end of the side chains (51Shibata N.

The α-anomer glycosidic linkage configuration was the major conformation found with a low level of β-anomer glycosidic linkage configuration. Structural characterization of the mannans indicated that CA-mannan better resembles the native mannan from the cell wall of living Candida cells than SC-mannan (supplemental Fig. S2). Molecular weights of the mannans were established by GPC/MALLS analysis. The GPC-determined molecular weight for SC-mannan was 3.7 × 104 g/mol, while for CA-mannan wa"

A major class of pili is assembled via the chaperone/usher pathway.

These structures provide molecular snapshots of a twinned-pore translocation machinery in action. Unexpectedly, only one pore is used for secretion, while both usher protomers are used for chaperone-subunit complex recruitment. The translocating pore itself comprises 24 β strands and is occluded by a folded plug domain, likely gated by a conformationally constrained β-hairpin.

These structures capture the secretion of a virulence factor across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The chaperone/usher (CU) pathway is responsible for the assembly of a major class of adhesive fibers on the outer membrane (OM) of a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria, including important human and animal pathogens (Sauer et al., 2004Sauer F.G. Remaut H. Hultgren S.J. Waksman G. Fiber assembly by the chaperone-usher pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These filamentous extracellular organelles, called pili or fimbriae, form a class of virulence factors responsible for specific host recognition and attachment, invasion, and biofilm formation. CU pilus biogenesis encompasses the ordered noncovalent polymerization of periplasmic chaperone-bound pilus subunits at an OM assembly platform termed the usher (Figure 1) (Sauer et al., 2004Sauer F.G.

The usher catalyzes polymerization and facilitates the translocation of folded subunits across the bacterial OM in the absence of accessory proteins and in a process independent of cellular ATP or the proton motive force (Jacob-Dubuisson et al., 1994Jacob-Dubuisson F.

Type 1 and P pili have served as model systems for the elucidation of the CU biosynthetic pathway. All uropathogenic Escherichia coli produce type 1 pili that are responsible for attachment, invasion, and establishment of biofilms in the bladder (Wright et al., 2007Wright K.J. Seed P.C.

P pili are produced by pyelonephritic strains of E. coli and are required for colonization of the kidney (Roberts et al., 1994Roberts J.A. Marklund B.I. Ilver D. Haslam D. Kaack M.B. Baskin G.

P and type 1 pili are complex extended fibers composed of two distinct subassemblies: (1) a distal tip fibrillum measuring 2 nm in diameter that is connected to a (2) rigid helical rod of 6.8 nm diameter (Jones et al., 1995Jones C.H.

Pilus subunits share a common noncanonical immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold characterized by the absence of its C-terminal β strand (Figure 1B). After translocation of the newly synthesized pilus subunit across the inner membrane into the periplasm, the cognate periplasmic chaperone “donates” part of a β strand for the intermolecular complementation of the incomplete Ig fold of the pilus subunit, a process termed donor-strand complementation (Figure 1B, topology diagram at bottom) (Choudhury et al., 1999Choudhury D.

Polymerization of the subunits at the bacterial OM occurs through a similar fold complementation mechanism, which involves the donation of the N-terminal extension (Nte) peptide of an incoming pilus subunit to complement the incomplete Ig fold of the previously assembled subunit in the growing pilus fiber (Figure 1B, topology diagram at top) (Sauer et al., 2002Sauer F.G.

This process of donor-strand exchange, in which the chaperone donor strand is exchanged for another subunit's Nte, occurs at the OM usher (FimD and PapC for type 1 and P pilus subunits, respectively) (Figure 1B). In sharp contrast to the wealth of information available on chaperone-subunit and subunit-subunit interactions, little is known of the structure or mechanism of action of the usher (Nishiyama et al., 2005Nishiyama M. Horst R. Eidam O. Herrmann T. Ignatov O. Vetsch M. Bettendorff P. Jelesarov I. Grutter M.G.

OM ushers selectively recruit chaperone-bound subunits to the OM, facilitate their ordered polymerization, and translocate the nascent fiber across the OM. They comprise four predicted domains: an N-terminal periplasmic domain (∼125 residues), a central β-barrel domain (predicted residues ∼135 to ∼640) interrupted by a middle domain (predicted residues ∼220 to ∼325), and a C-terminal periplasmic domain (∼170 residues) (Figure 1C) (Capitani et al., 2006Capitani G.

This domain discriminately recognizes different chaperone-subunit complexes by directly binding to the N-terminal domain of the periplasmic chaperone and part of the chaperone-bound subunit (Nishiyama et al., 2005Nishiyama M. Horst R. Eidam O. Herrmann T. Ignatov O. Vetsch M. Bettendorff P. Jelesarov I. Grutter M.G.

Subunit polymerization has been shown to be a concerted process, with a new subunit's Nte binding at an initiation site (called the P5 pocket) on chaperone-bound subunits and gradually displacing the chaperone donor strand (Remaut et al., 2006Remaut H.

Mechanism of fibre assembly through the chaperone-usher pathway.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). How the usher facilitates this process or what parts of the usher are involved is unknown. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of the PapC usher reconstituted in E. coli lipids reveal that ushers form dimeric channels in the OM, compatible in size with the secretion of folded subunits (Li et al., 2004Li H. Qian L. Chen Z. Thibault D. Liu G. Liu T. Thanassi D.G. The outer membrane usher forms a twin-pore secretion complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Complementation studies in PapC loss-of-function mutants confirm OM ushers to be functional as dimers (So and Thanassi, 2006So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Analysis of the requirements for pilus biogenesis at the outer membrane usher and the function of the usher C-terminus.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted central β-barrel domain is likely to form the translocation channel, but the roles of the predicted middle domain or the periplasmically located C-terminal domain in usher function are unclear. The latter is believed to participate in activating the usher for translocation in a process that is initiated by the chaperone-adhesin complex (So and Thanassi, 2006So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Analysis of the requirements for pilus biogenesis at the outer membrane usher and the function of the usher C-terminus.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Understanding the complex multistep processing of CU pilus subunits into a functional, membrane-anchored filamentous organelle has been hampered by the lack of high-resolution structural information on the usher and complexes thereof. Here, we present the crystal structure of the PapC translocation channel and the cryo-EM structure of the closely related FimD usher bound to the translocating FimC:F:G:H quaternary tip complex. These structures capture a twinned-pores usher transporter in action and provide an integrated model of the CU-mediated subunit assembly mechanism. To gain a structural understanding of pilus biogenesis at the OM, we solved the structure of the translocation channel of the PapC usher. The presence of the flexible periplasmic domains in the mature 809-residue PapC prevented growth of crystals of sufficient quality for structure determination of the full-length protein. Through limited proteolysis, we identified a stable 55 kDa fragment (residues 130–640) corresponding to the predicted OM translocation domain and the recently identified middle domain (Capitani et al., 2006Capitani G. Eidam O. Grutter M.G. Evidence for a novel domain of bacterial outer membrane ushers.Proteins. 2006; 65: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As expected, PapC130–640 localized to the OM and the integrity of the β-barrel domain was confirmed by a heat-modifiable mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, typical of folded OM β-barrel proteins (results not shown). Two crystal forms were obtained. The structure of PapC130–640 was determined at 3.4 Å resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method on F222 crystals and refined against 3.2 Å resolution data from crystals in the C2 space group to a final R and free R factor of 25.9% and 29.6%, respectively (see Experimental Procedures, Figure S1, and Table S1). It encompasses the full translocation pore consisting of a kidney-shaped, 24-stranded β-barrel (residues 146–635), ∼45 Å in height and with outer and inner dimensions of 65 Å by 45 Å and 45 Å by 25 Å, respectively (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C). OM ushers therefore correspond to the largest single-protein β-pores observed to date (previously determined β-pore structures contain 22 β strands at most). The β-barrel closes in an end-to-end fashion and positions the N and C termini on the periplasmic side of the membrane. The N- and C-terminal globular domains will thus be juxtaposed and reside in the periplasm, consistent with their role in chaperone-subunit recruitment and adhesin-induced pore activation (Ng et al., 2004Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. The usher N terminus is the initial targeting site for chaperone-subunit complexes and participates in subsequent pilus biogenesis events.J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The predicted middle domain (residues 257–332) is formed by a long sequence between strands β6 and β7 and consists of a six-stranded, β sandwich fold (strands βA–βF; Figure 2C). The domain is positioned laterally inside the β-barrel pore (Figure 2B). As a result, the middle domain, hereafter referred to as the plug domain, completely occludes the luminal volume of the translocation pore, preventing passage of solutes or periplasmic proteins across the channel in its nonactivated form (Figures 2A and 2B). Globular plug or cork domains have also been observed in bacterial siderophore transporters (Ferguson et al., 1998Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Siderophore-mediated iron transport: crystal structure of FhuA with bound lipopolysaccharide.Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Unlike these, however, the PapC plug domain is inserted into the loop connecting two β strands (strands 6 and 7) rather than positioned at the N-terminal extremity of the β-barrel. The plug domain is held in place by a β-hairpin (strands β5 and β6, hereafter referred to as the β5-6 hairpin, Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C) that folds in from the barrel wall into the channel lumen. The inward curvature of the β5-6 hairpin creates a large gap in the side of the β-barrel extending well into the part submerged in the OM bilayer (Figure 2B), a feature unprecedented in previously known OM β-barrel structures. The point where the β5-6 hairpin breaks out of the barrel coincides with a bulge (Ser209-Arg210) in the adjacent strand β4 (Figure 3A). This bulge disrupts the local secondary structure interaction with the hairpin strand β5 and, in combination with a charged residue (Glu228) in β5 that is pointing into the nonpolar bilayer, pushes the β5-6 hairpin into the barrel lumen, leaving the unusual gap in the lining of the transmembrane barrel (Figure 2B). In addition, the luminal part of the β5-6 hairpin is capped from the extracellular side by the only helix in the structure, the α1 helix (residues 448–465). Inside the β-barrel, the β5-6 hairpin interacts with the inner surface of the channel and helix α1 through a patch of hydrophobic interactions formed by Ile231, Phe236 on the hairpin, Trp239, Phe357, and Val377 on the barrel wall, and Met451 on the helix (Figure 3B). In addition, the β5-6 hairpin forms two electrostatic interaction networks that bridge the plug domain with the channel wall (Glu361-Lys339-Asp234-Arg303) and α1 helix (Arg237-Glu467-Arg305-Asp323) and help position the plug domain laterally inside the translocation channel (Figure 3B). Given the conservation in sequence and predicted topologies in usher proteins, the translocator pore structure of the PapC usher can be considered a prototype for all bacterial ushers (sequence alignment; Figure S2).Figure 3Stereo View of the β-Hairpin InteractionsShow full caption(A) Close-up of the site of inward orientation of the β5-6 hairpin.

Available structural and biochemical evidence demonstrates OM ushers function as dimers organized in twinned pores (Li et al., 2004Li H. Qian L. Chen Z. Thibault D. Liu G. Liu T. Thanassi D.G. The outer membrane usher forms a twin-pore secretion complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, So and Thanassi, 2006So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Analysis of the requirements for pilus biogenesis at the outer membrane usher and the function of the usher C-terminus.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both the C2 and F222 crystal forms of PapC130–640 obtained in this study contain similar dimers formed by a crystallographic two-fold axis (Figure 2D). These dimers closely correspond in size and conformation to the twinned pores observed by negative stain EM of full-length PapC (Figure S3) and by cryo-EM imaging on single particles of detergent-solubilized full-length PapC and 2D crystals of PapC reconstituted in E. coli lipids (Li et al., 2004Li H. Qian L. Chen Z. Thibault D. Liu G. Liu T. Thanassi D.G. The outer membrane usher forms a twin-pore secretion complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The dimer interface in the 3D crystals is formed by the flat side of the kidney-shaped β-barrel, encompassing strands β11–β20 (residues 397–573; Figure 2D). However, contrary to what is seen in other oligomerizing OM proteins, the two PapC protomers in the dimer interface make little direct contacts with each other (side chains are typically between 4 and 6 Å apart; Figure 2D). Instead, the electron density at the dimer interface in the PapC130–640 crystals reveals that the interface between protomers is mediated by several detergent molecules. Likely, the extensive detergent wash steps (see Experimental Procedures) preceding PapC130–640 crystallization resulted in the exchange of interface lipids for detergent molecules. In this respect, it is interesting to note the two usher protomers in the PapC130–640 crystals (average Cα-Cα distance of 15 Å) are in somewhat closer proximity than seen in the lipid-reconstituted 2D crystals and in the FimD2:C:F:G:H complex (Cα-Cα distance of 27 Å; see below). Presumably the loss of lipids in the former results in the two protomers being closer to one another. Finally, since the PapC130–640 construct used for crystallization lacks the N- and C-terminal periplasmic domains, it cannot be excluded that parts of these domains are involved in maintaining the usher dimer integrity. To understand the mechanism of pilus subunit translocation by the OM usher, we isolated pilus assembly intermediates by capturing type 1 pilus tip fibers during secretion through the FimD usher. FimD was expressed in bacteria together with the FimH adhesin, FimG and FimF tip subunits, and a His6-tagged FimC chaperone (FimCHis). By not providing the FimA helical rod subunit to the assembly system, pilus production stalls after incorporation of the last tip subunit FimF, resulting in production of quasihomogeneous FimD:tip complexes. Affinity and gel filtration chromatography of the detergent-solubilized OM fraction yielded the type 1 pilus tip complex as a single major peak in the chromatography profile (Figure 4A). Gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining show all expected components (FimD:C:F:G:H) to be present in the complex (Figure 4B). Densitometry of the Coomassie-stained gel suggested a molar ratio for FimD:C:F:G:H of approximately 2:2:1:1:1, calculated by setting FimH equal to 1 mol (Figure 4B). However, since FimC adsorbs Coomassie blue dye twice as strongly as FimH, as demonstrated previously with dissolved 3D crystals of 1:1 FimC:FimH complex (Knight et al., 1997Knight S. Mulvey M.

https://openalex.org/W2046257292,"CA9 is a membrane-tethered, carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme, expressed mainly at the external surface of cells, that catalyzes reversible CO2 hydration. Expression is greatly enhanced in many tumors, particularly in aggressive carcinomas. The functional role of CA9 in tumors is not well established. Here we show that CA9, when expressed heterologously in cultured spheroids (0.5-mm diameter, ∼25,000 cells) of RT112 cells (derived from bladder carcinoma), induces a near-uniform intracellular pH (pHi) throughout the structure. Dynamic pHi changes during displacements of superfusate CO2 concentration are also spatially coincident (within 2 s). In contrast, spheroids of wild-type RT112 cells lacking CA9 exhibit an acidic core (∼0.25 pHi reduction) and significant time delays (∼9 s) for pHi changes in core versus peripheral regions. pHi non-uniformity also occurs in CA9-expressing spheroids after selective pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme. In isolated RT112 cells, pHi regulation is unaffected by CA9 expression. The influence of CA9 on pHi is thus only evident in multicellular tissue. Diffusion-reaction modeling indicates that CA9 coordinates pHi spatially by facilitating CO2 diffusion in the unstirred extracellular space of the spheroid. We suggest that pHi coordination may favor survival and growth of a tumor. By disrupting spatial pHi control, inhibition of CA9 activity may offer a novel strategy for the clinical treatment of CA9-associated tumors.

Intracellular H+ ions are powerful modulators of physiological and biochemical processes, including cell growth, division, and development (1Boron W.F. Adv. Physiol. Educ. 2004; 28: 160-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Isfort R.J. Cody D.B. Asquith T.N. Ridder G.M. Stuard S.B. LeBoeuf R.A. Eur. J.

Many metabolic reactions within the cell generate H+ ions as end-products (4Hochachka P.W. Mommsen T.P. Science. 1983; 219: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Because of their high chemical reactivity, particularly with intracellular proteins, these ions must be removed if normal cell function is to continue. Tumors display a notably high rate of H+ ion production, partly because their growth demands a ready supply of energy, but also because much of the metabolism that supports this is anaerobic (5Warburg O. The Metabolism of Tumours. Arnold Constable, London1930Google Scholar). Energy production via extramitochondrial routes is associated with a larger metabolic flux of acid per ATP molecule (4Hochachka P.W. Mommsen T.P. Science. 1983; 219: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Indeed, growing tumors are typically hypoxic, resulting in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, which up-regulates a variety of proteins, including enzymes that control glycolytic lactic acid production (6Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). If intracellular H+ ions accumulate, intracellular pH (pHi) 3The abbreviations used are: pHi, intracellular pH; pHe, extracellular pH; CA, carbonic anhydrase; ATZ, acetazolamide; 14v, 1-[4-([5-(aminosulfonyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]-3,5-nonylene-2,6-dimethyl pyridinium perchlorate; ROI, regions of interest; EV, empty vector. 3The abbreviations used are: pHi, intracellular pH; pHe, extracellular pH; CA, carbonic anhydrase; ATZ, acetazolamide; 14v, 1-[4-([5-(aminosulfonyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]-3,5-nonylene-2,6-dimethyl pyridinium perchlorate; ROI, regions of interest; EV, empty vector. falls and cellular activity becomes compromised. One solution is for cells to express plasmalemmal ion transport proteins that extrude excess H+ equivalents (7Lee A.H. Tannock I.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1901-1908PubMed Google Scholar). Extrusion is achieved either by expelling H+ ions directly (e.g. via Na+-H+ exchangers, H+-lactate co transporters, and H+-ATPases), or by importing HCO3− anions (e.g. via Na+-dependent HCO3− transporters), to neutralize intracellular H+ ions. The pHi of tumor cells, like that of most other eukaryotic cells, appears to be relatively alkaline (pHi ∼ 7.2), indicating that they possess an efficient system for eliminating H+ ions (8Gillies R. Martinez-Zaguilan R. Peterson E. Perona R. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 2: 159-179Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Swietach P. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Harris A.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In many cell types the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) plays an important role in the regulation of pHi. The α-CA family expressed in eukaryotic cells comprises at least 13 catalytically active isozymes (10Supuran C.T. Nature Rev. 2008; 7: 1-14Google Scholar). These enzymes, in effect, catalyze the reversible buffering of H+ by HCO3− ions. This generates CO2, which is highly membrane-permeant, and therefore diffuses out of the cell. Despite significant contributions from anaerobic metabolism, many growing tumors produce large quantities of CO2, suggesting that chemical buffering by HCO3− is an important strategy for dealing with metabolic acid production (11Holm E.

Generic inhibitors of CA activity, like acetazolamide (ATZ), have been used experimentally to attenuate tumor growth, suggesting an important role for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (29Parkkila S. Rajaniemi H. Parkkila A.K. Kivela J. Waheed A. Pastorekova S. Pastorek J. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Specific targeting of CA9 by RNA interference also reduces growth and survival under hypoxic conditions in cell monolayers (31Robertson N. Potter C. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, the nature and mechanism of CA9 involvement are not well established. The enzyme is anchored principally to the surface membrane of tumor cells, with its active site oriented toward the extracellular space. It is therefore likely to catalyze the hydration of CO2 that emerges from a cell, producing H+ and HCO3− ions. This may then facilitate the diffusion of more CO2 from the cell. Enhanced extracellular CO2 hydration would reduce local extracellular pH (pHe) (19Ivanov S. Liao S.Y. Ivanova A. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Tarasova N. Weirich G. Merrill M.J. Proescholdt M.A. Oldfield E.H. Lee J. Zavada J. Waheed A. Sly W. Lerman M.I. Stanbridge E.J. Am. J.

Indeed, pHe in poorly vascularized tumors is notably acidic (∼6.9), a feature that is thought to encourage host-tissue regression, thereby assisting further tumor development (33Gatenby R.A.

Although possible effects of CA9 on pHe have been recognized, there has been less consideration of its effect on pHi. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that, in heterologous expression systems, CA9 forms a functional transport metabolon with HCO3− transporters (13Morgan P.E. Pastorekova S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Alper S.L. Casey J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: C738-C748Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific role for the enzyme in pHi regulation. In the present work we have explored the contribution of CA9 to the regulation of pHi in three-dimensional multicellular growths. We have developed a system for confocally imaging pHi spatially within cultured spheroids of RT112 cells, using the intracellular pH fluorophore, carboxy-SNARF-1. These cells, derived from bladder tumor cells, do not constitutively express CA9. Multicellular spheroids can therefore be grown that lack CA9, and these can be compared with others grown from RT112 cells stably transfected with the enzyme. We find that, although CA9 does not enhance H+ equivalent transport in isolated RT112 cells, its presence exerts a remarkable effect on the spatial control of pHi within a multicellular spheroid. We develop a three-dimensional computational model to explore the relationship between extracellular CA9 expression and the spatial coordination of pHi. Results of both the experiments and the model suggest a novel role for the enzyme in reducing pHi non-uniformity in multicellular structures. This role may provide insight into the functional importance of CA9 in tumor development. Stable Transfection of RT112 Cells—RT112 cells were transfected with the cDNA of human CA9 (a gift from Dr. J. Pastorek, Bratislava) or empty vector using a published technique (31Robertson N. Potter C. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To grow spheroids, cells were seeded into agarose-coated 96-well plates (∼20,000 cells/well) and cultured for 72 h (36Leek R.D. Stratford I. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4147-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (6.2 m urea, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, protease inhibitor), and the whole cell extract was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry blotter (Wep Company, UK). Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal M75 to CA9 (a gift from Dr. J. Pastorek), CA2 (Abcam, UK), and mouse anti-βtubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactivity was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit serum at 1:1000 and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. Caspase Staining—To assess apoptosis, spheroids were fixed in liquid N2 and labeled immunohistochemically with mouse caspase-3 antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibodies (0.1 μg/ml, R&D Systems, UK). Solutions—0% CO2/0 mm HCO3− buffer: 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with 4 m NaOH. 5% CO2/22 mm HCO3− buffer: 115 mm NaCl, 22 mm NaHCO3, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 by bubbling with 5% CO2/95% air. Solutions containing NH4Cl were based on the above buffer solutions, with an appropriate reduction in [NaCl] to maintain osmolarity at 300 mosm/kg. For Na+-free solutions, Na+ salts were replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine. Drugs—Dimethylamiloride (50 μm, an inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange), 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (0.5 mm, an inhibitor of HCO3− transport), ATZ (100 μm, a membrane-permeant CA inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma. 1-[4-([5-(aminosulfonyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]-3,5-nonylene-2,6-dimethyl pyridinium perchlorate (14v, 200-500 nm, a membrane-impermeant CA inhibitor) was synthesized in-house (37Casey J.R. Morgan P.E. Vullo D. Scozzafava A. Mastrolorenzo A. Supuran C.T. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Measuring Functional CA Activity—This was measured in (i) intact cells suspended in CO2-free, isotonic buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes) or in (ii) whole cell lysates (produced by hypotonic shock in 0.1% Triton X-100, 5-min sonication), suspended in 20 mm Hepes solution. Solution pH was adjusted to 8.0 at 4 °C. 1.5 ml of suspension was added to a stirred reaction vessel, and pH was monitored (Biotrode, Mettler-Toledo, UK). 0.5 ml of 100% CO2-saturated water was added to the cell suspension/lysate, and the rate of acidification was analyzed to obtain the CO2 hydration constant (38Maren T.H. Physiol. Rev. 1967; 47: 595-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Measured rates were normalized to 1 mg of total protein per ml, measured spectrophotometrically (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad). Superfusion and pHi Imaging—A heated superfusion chamber (37 °C, 1 ml) was mounted on an inverted microscope (DMIRBE, Leica), its base (coverslip) was pre-treated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine to aid cell adhesion. Cells/spheroids were exposed to membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester of carboxy-SNARF-1 (20 μm) for 20 min (39Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Intracellular pH was imaged confocally (TCS, Leica) with a 10× lens. Carboxy-SNARF-1 was excited by the 514 nm argon laser line, and fluorescence emission was collected simultaneously at 580 ± 20 nm and 640 ± 20 nm. Acquisition produced 512 × 512 pixel spatial maps of fluorescence every 1.8 s. Fluorescence was offset for background and averaged in regions of interest (ROIs). In experiments involving isolated cells, ROIs were defined as discrete areas of fluorescence that exceeded a threshold of 10% peak fluorescence and of area between 20 and 120 μm2 (equivalent to a cell). In experiments performed on spheroids, the outer boundary of the cluster was used to define six layers of ROIs, with concentric centers. Average ROI fluorescence was ratioed (580 to 640 nm) to eliminate differences in cellular dye-loading, light-path and specimen thickness. This is of particular importance for spheroids, in which peripheral cells tend to concentrate dye more than core cells. Fluorescence ratios were then converted into pHi (39Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The pH signal was intracellular as frame-averaging showed that fluorescence was confined to round objects corresponding to cell outlines. Also, the behavior of the pH signal was consistent with predicted intracellular events. Measuring Cell Dimensions and Buffering Capacity—Cell dimensions were estimated from the mean radius of carboxy-SNARF-1-loaded isolated cells. Intrinsic intracellular H+ buffering capacity (βint) was measured in single cells superfused with 20 mm Hepes-buffered solution (nominally CO2-free). Buffering due to CO2/ HCO3− (βCO2) was measured as the increase in buffering when cells were superfused with 5% CO2/22 mm HCO3−-buffered solution. Cells were first superfused with solution containing 30 mm NH4Cl (generating an alkalosis) and then with a sequence of solutions containing lower doses of NH4Cl (20, 10, 5, and 0 mm). These solution maneuvers produced stepwise decreases of pHi (40Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Buffering capacity was calculated from the quotient of the estimate change in [ NH4+]i and the measured change in pHi (back-extrapolated to the moment of solution change). Inhibitors of H+ equivalent transport were included to inhibit slow pHi changes that could otherwise lead to inaccurate estimates of β. In CO2/ HCO3− buffer, allowance was made (1-2 min) for buffer equilibration (41Leem C.H. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Measuring H+ Equivalent Membrane Transport—Single cells were superfused with solution containing 30 mm NH4Cl for 4-6 min (“prepulse”). Upon returning to solution without NH4Cl, pHi acidifies. This pHi displacement stimulates H+ equivalent transport. At any given pHi, its rate of recovery (dpHi/dt) multiplied by the appropriate buffering capacity gives an estimate of the transmembrane H+ equivalent flux ( JmembH) (39Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Measuring pHi Changes Induced by Changes in Superfusate CO2 Partial Pressure—The catalytic activity of CA can be studied by changing superfusate pCO2 and [ HCO3−] (at a constant pHe of 7.4). Experimentally, this was done by changing superfusate buffer from Hepes to CO2/ HCO3− lowing a rise or fall in pCO2. To obtain a measure of H+ equivalent flux ( JCO2H), the slope was multiplied by βint. CA Expression in RT112 Cells—RT112 cells were chosen for this study, because they do not express CA9 under hypoxia (Fig. 1A). This eliminates the possibility of additional, hypoxia-induced CA9 expression at the core of spheroids, which would introduce unwanted variability into the analysis. Instead, by using a stably transfected clone, comparable levels of CA9 could be introduced uniformly across spheroids, as described below. Western blots (Fig. 1A) indicated CA9 immunoreactivity in RT112 cells transfected with the CA9 gene (CA9 expressor). Based on a comparison with β-tubulin expression, the level of CA9 protein expressed with transfection was of a similar order of magnitude to that induced by hypoxia in breast cancer MDA231 and MDA468 cell lines (31Robertson N. Potter C. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells transfected with empty vector (EV) displayed moderate levels of CA2 (an intrinsic, intracellular CA isoform), but no CA9. Of the clones illustrated in Fig. 1A, EV and CA9 expressor clones #2 were used for subsequent experiments. Cell surface CA9 staining was also detected in multicellular spheroids grown from CA9 expressor but not from EV cells (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated a normal distribution of membrane CA9 in the transfectants (not shown) and, therefore, as expected, some variability in individual cell staining. Surface CA9 was detected throughout the CA9 expressor spheroid, unlike the situation in endogenous growths where hypoxia-induced up-regulation of CA9 typically occurs in the core. Absence of CA9 immunoreactivity in EV spheroids correlated with higher levels of staining for caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis (Fig. 1B). This suggests that CA9 expression may confer a degree of protection against cell death, in agreement with previous studies performed on unclustered cells (31Robertson N. Potter C. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). CA activity was assayed functionally by recording the time course of acidification of medium containing intact or lysed CA9 expressor or EV cells, following addition of CO2-saturated solution (38Maren T.H. Physiol. Rev. 1967; 47: 595-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). An example of the acidification time course (n = 4) with CA9 expressor whole cell lysates is shown in Fig. 1C. The acidification was slowed to a spontaneous (uncatalyzed) rate (Fig. 1D) by adding the CA inhibitors, 14v or ATZ, confirming the presence of catalytic activity. When using non-lysed CA9-expressing cells in the suspension, the acidification was still considerably faster (by 66%) than the spontaneous, uncatalyzed rate, indicative of CA9 activity at the external surface of the cells (Fig. 1D). The enhanced rate was inhibited by the membrane-impermeant CA inhibitor, 14v (200 nm), whereas no effect was seen for EV cell suspensions, confirming that the active site of the transfected CA9 was indeed extracellular. The increase in CO2 hydration rate observed with CA9-expressing RT112 cells (Fig. 1D) is comparable to that reported previously in MDA468 breast cancer cells exposed to hypoxia (31Robertson N. Potter C. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus the functional activity of CA9 in transfected RT112 cells matches that induced in hypoxia-responding tumor cells. Both CA9 protein expression and the resulting functional activity in RT112 expressor cells are therefore comparable to levels in hypoxically responsive tumor cell lines. CA9 Effects on Cell Size and Buffering Capacity—To assess effects of CA9 on pHi regulation, we first examined if its expression altered cell size or cellular H+ buffering capacity. Analysis of fluorescence (carboxy-SNARF-1) images of cells showed no difference between the radii of CA9 expressor cells (4.89 ± 2.14 (S.D.) μm) and EV cells (4.97 ± 1.82 μm). Intracellular buffering capacity was assessed in isolated cells from the rapid fall of pHi (recorded with carboxy-SNARF-1) in response to reductions of extracellular NH4Cl (Fig. 2A) (40Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intrinsic (non-CO2/ HCO3−) intracellular buffering (βint) was estimated in the presence of Hepes-buffered superfusates. Additional buffering due to CO2/ HCO3− (βCO2) was estimated in CO2/ HCO3−-buffered superfusates (which measures βint + βCO2). Values for βint and βCO2 were no different in CA9 expressor and EV cells, indicating that intracellular H+-buffering capacity was not influenced by CA9 (Fig. 2B). CA Activity in Intact Cells—In an isolated cell, switching from Hepes-buffered to CO2/ HCO3−-buffered superfusate caused a fall of pHi, as CO2 entering the cell was hydrated to H+ and HCO3− ions (Fig. 2, C and D). Switching back, after 3 min, reversed this process, causing a rapid intracellular alkalosis (Fig. 2, C and E). To assess CA catalysis, experiments were repeated in the presence of ATZ or 14v. The initial time courses in Fig. 2 (D and E) were analyzed (see supplemental material) to derive the rate constant of intracellular hydration (kf) or dehydration (kr). With ATZ (total CA inhibition), kf was 0.18 ± 0.01 s-1 (n > 50, hence kr was 0.24 μm-1 s-1), in agreement with previous published values for the spontaneous reaction (41Leem C.H. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the absence of drug, kf and kr were 2.09-fold larger in CA9 expressor cells and 2.96-fold larger in EV cells. In contrast, kf and kr were not significantly affected by 14v (catalysis of 2.05-fold and 2.93-fold in CA9 expressor and EV, respectively), indicating that, in superfused single cells, extracellular CA does not contribute catalytically to the reversible hydration of intracellular CO2. These data also confirm that 14v is membrane-impermeant (37Casey J.R. Morgan P.E. Vullo D. Scozzafava A. Mastrolorenzo A. Supuran C.T. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Alvarez B.V. Loiselle F.B. Supuran C.T. Schwartz G.J. Casey J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12321-12329Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as, otherwise, slower pHi changes would have been measured in its presence, because of inhibition of intracellular CA isoforms. The faster rate constants measured in the absence of ATZ indicate that intrinsic intracellular CA activity was functional in both CA9 expressor and EV cells, although it was 33% lower in the former. Thus expressing extracellular CA9 in RT112 cells was associated with a coordinate reduction of intracellular CA activity, in agreement with the observed down regulation of CA2 protein expression (Fig. 1A). CA9 Effects on H+ Equivalent Membrane Transport—We investigated H+ equivalent extrusion by prepulsing isolated cells for 4 min with extracellular NH4Cl (1Boron W.F. Adv. Physiol. Educ. 2004; 28: 160-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This maneuver induces an intracellular acid-load that stimulates plasmalemmal H+ equivalent extrusion and recovery of pHi to resting levels. Recovery of pHi when using Hepes-buffered superfusates was accelerated by changing the buffer to CO2/ HCO3− (Fig. 2F), indicating that an HCO3−-depend"

All CRISPR systems contain proteins of the CAS2 family, suggesting that these uncharacterized proteins play a central role in this process. Here we show that the CAS2 proteins represent a novel family of endoribonucleases. Six purified CAS2 proteins from diverse organisms cleaved single-stranded RNAs preferentially within U-rich regions. A representative CAS2 enzyme, SSO1404 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, cleaved the phosphodiester linkage on the 3'-side and generated 5'-phosphate- and 3'-hydroxyl-terminated oligonucleotides. The crystal structure of SSO1404 was solved at 1.6A resolution revealing the first ribonuclease with a ferredoxin-like fold. Mutagenesis of SSO1404 identified six residues (Tyr-9, Asp-10, Arg-17, Arg-19, Arg-31, and Phe-37) that are important for enzymatic activity and suggested that Asp-10 might be the principal catalytic residue. Thus, CAS2 proteins are sequence-specific endoribonucleases, and we propose that their role in the CRISPR-mediated anti-phage defense might involve degradation of phage or cellular mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2111282994,"The killer lymphocyte protease granzyme A (GzmA) triggers caspase-independent target cell death with morphological features of apoptosis. We previously showed that GzmA acts directly on mitochondria to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupt the transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) but does not permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondrial damage is critical to GzmA-induced cell death since cells treated with superoxide scavengers are resistant to GzmA. Here we find that GzmA accesses the mitochondrial matrix to cleave the complex I protein NDUFS3, an iron-sulfur subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I, after Lys56 to interfere with NADH oxidation and generate superoxide anions. Target cells expressing a cleavage site mutant of NDUFS3 are resistant to GzmA-mediated cell death but remain sensitive to GzmB."

Combining biochemical analyses of the chromatin transition at the transcriptionally induced PHO5 promoter in yeast with modeling based on a small number of simple assumptions, we demonstrate that random removal and reformation of promoter nucleosomes can account for stochastic and kinetic properties of PHO5 expression. Our analysis suggests that the disassembly of promoter nucleosomes is rate limiting for PHO5 expression, and supports a model for the underlying mechanism of promoter chromatin remodeling, which appears to conserve a single nucleosome on the promoter at all times."
https://openalex.org/W2068385982,"Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) regulates neuronal differentiation. To understand the logic underlying decision-making in the signaling network controlling CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth, we profiled the activation of several hundred transcription factors after cell stimulation. We assembled an in silico signaling network by connecting CB1R to 23 activated transcription factors. Statistical analyses of this network predicted a role for the breast cancer 1 protein BRCA1 in neuronal differentiation and a new pathway from CB1R through phosphoinositol 3-kinase to the transcription factor paired box 6 (PAX6). Both predictions were experimentally confirmed. Results of transcription factor activation experiments that used pharmacological inhibitors of kinases revealed a network organization of partial OR gates regulating kinases stacked above AND gates that control transcription factors, which together allow for distributed decision-making in CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth."

MAPK signal transduction cascades are tightly regulated, and individual MAPKs display exquisite specificity in recognition of their target substrates. All MAPK family members share a common phosphorylation site motif, raising questions as to how substrate specificity is achieved. Here we describe a peptide library screen to identify sequence requirements of the DEF site (docking site for ERK FXF), a docking motif separate from the phosphorylation site. We show that MAPK isoforms recognize DEF sites with unique sequences and identify two key residues on the MAPK that largely dictate sequence specificity. Based on these observations and computational docking studies, we propose a revised model for MAPK interaction with substrates containing DEF sites.

Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Canonical MAPKs are classified into three major subfamilies, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), p38 MAPK (p38), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), based on sequence homology, shared upstream kinases, and activating stimuli. In addition, the different MAPK subfamilies phosphorylate a distinct set of protein substrates. These substrates act as the critical effectors that enable cells to mount the appropriate responses to varied stimuli.Analysis of reported MAPK substrate phosphorylation sites suggests a nearly absolute requirement for a Pro residue immediately downstream of the Ser or Thr phosphoacceptor. Extensive peptide library studies on ERK1, ERK2, and p38α have defined a common phosphorylation site motif for these MAPKs. In addition to the requirement for a Pro residue at the +1 position relative to the phosphorylation site, this motif includes a weak preference for Pro and other aliphatic residues at the -2 position (2Songyang Z.

Mutagenesis experiments with the JNK substrate JunB have also suggested additional specificity for JNK family MAPKs at positions downstream of the phosphorylation site (5Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MAPKs have affinities for short peptide substrates that are at least an order of magnitude lower than for full-length protein substrates (4Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E.

Thus although phosphorylation site motifs likely serve to direct the MAPK to phosphorylate a specific serine or threonine residue within a protein, they are insufficient to fully account for protein substrate recognition. Although mechanisms such as subcellular localization and the use of scaffolding proteins can contribute to kinase substrate targeting in vivo, MAPKs also exhibit a high degree of target specificity in vitro (11Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).For MAPKs, substrate specificity is ensured through the use of docking interactions occurring between sequence motifs in the substrate distal from the phosphorylation site and regions of the kinase outside of the active site (1Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 14Biondi R.M. Nebreda A.R. Biochem.

Two common types of docking interactions have been identified between MAPKs and their substrates that serve to enhance affinity and specificity. Both involve interaction of short linear sequence motifs present within substrates with a complementary pocket or groove on the kinase. The best characterized docking site utilized by MAPKs is the D-site (also referred to as the D-domain, δ-domain, or DEJL domain), which consists of two or more basic residues followed by a short linker and a cluster of hydrophobic residues. Interactions between the MAPK and substrate D-sites have been mapped by mutagenesis, hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 17Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol.

A. 2006; 281: 38834-38844Google Scholar). Docking occurs along a groove on the opposite face of the MAPK surface relative to the active site that includes acidic and hydrophobic regions complementary to the D-site. D-sites are present in many ERK, JNK, and p38 substrates and have been implicated in specific targeting by the different subfamilies. In addition, enzymes that regulate MAPKs, including their activating MAPK kinases (MKKs) and inactivating MAPK phosphatases, also contain D-sites that are critical for specific interactions with these kinases (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar).The second major MAPK docking site, known as the DEF site (docking site for ERK FXF, also called the F-site), has been identified in a number of ERK substrates. DEF sites are generally characterized as an FX(F/Y)P sequence, typically located between 6 and 20 amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylation site. Hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry experiments with ERK2 in complex with DEF site peptides have allowed the DEF interaction site on ERK to be mapped to a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the active site cleft (18Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Interestingly, accessibility of this pocket to docking sites is coupled to activation of the kinase. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of closely spaced threonine and tyrosine residues within a conserved region known as the activation loop (15Goldsmith E.J. Akella R. Min X. Zhou T. Humphreys J.M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 5065-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation triggers a conformational rearrangement of the activation loop, aligning residues important for catalysis, forming the phosphoacceptor binding site, and exposing the DEF site interaction pocket (22Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).Most reported substrates bearing DEF sites are transcription factors, including Elk-1, c-Fos, c-Myc, and JunD (23Jacobs D.

However, DEF sites have also been identified in proteins with diverse functions, such as the ERK scaffolding protein KSR1 (23Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K.

In addition to playing a role in substrate recruitment, DEF sites can also mediate interactions with regulators of ERK, including the MKP-1 phosphatase and nucleoporins that facilitate nuclear import of the kinase (18Lee T.

S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although generally described as a docking site for ERK MAPKs, the DEF site within the transcription factor SAP-1 has also been implicated in contributing to efficient phosphorylation by p38α (34Galanis A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).In contrast to its phosphorylation site motif, which has been extensively characterized using peptide libraries, our understanding of DEF site interactions for ERK are based solely on a relatively small number of sites that have been identified in protein substrates. In the absence of a comprehensive analysis, the essential sequence requirements that constitute an optimal DEF site for ERK are not clear. Furthermore, it is unknown if MAPKs other than ERK can interact with DEF sites in substrates, or whether they recognize distinct DEF site sequence motifs. To address these questions, we adapted peptide library screening methods to elucidate consensus sequences for kinase docking sites. We identified significant differences in the DEF site docking motifs recognized by MAPK family members. Peptide library screening with a series of point mutants allowed us to identify critical determinants of specificity within the hydrophobic pocket of the kinase. The distinct sequence motifs recognized by different MAPKs may contribute to targeting these kinases to their unique substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides—Peptides for library screening were synthesized on a 2-mg scale by Sigma Genosys and used without further purification. All peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to confirm identity. The P4 Tyr peptide failed synthesis and was omitted from the final peptide library. Peptides were dissolved in DMSO, adjusted to a concentration of 25 mm based on absorbance at 280 nm, and stored at -20 °C. Working 0.5 mm aqueous stocks were prepared by diluting the DMSO stock rapidly into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Aqueous solutions were aliquoted into 384-well polypropylene stock plates in 40-ml aliquots, sealed with adhesive foil, and stored at -20 °C. Individual peptides were synthesized on a 0.1-mmol scale and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston). Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in DMSO and quantified by absorbance at 280 nm. Stock solutions were adjusted to 10 mm peptide and stored at -20 °C.Plasmids—Full-length ERK2, p38α, p38γ, and p38δ MAPK coding sequences (all from rat) were cloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) for bacterial expression as GST fusion proteins. Coding sequences were cloned as BamHI/NotI fragments with the endogenous initiator methionine codon immediately downstream of the BamHI site and the native stop codon intact. DEF site attenuation and specificity swapping mutations were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis in these expression plasmids. Coding sequences for the constitutively active MKK mutants, MKK1ΔN3 (35Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar) and MKK6 S207E/T211E (36Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), were cloned into pET28a(+) (Novagen) with their initiator methionine codons immediately downstream of the BamHI site. All expression plasmids were confirmed by bidirectional sequence analysis of the full MAPK coding sequence.Expression and Purification of MAPKs—Active MAPKs were produced as GST fusion proteins by co-expression in bacteria with activating kinases similar to Khokhlatchev et al. (37Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. ERK2 was co-expressed with the constitutively active MKK1ΔN3 mutant. Active p38α, p38γ, and p38δ were generated by co-expression with MKK6 S207E/T211E. Bacterially produced p38β (a gift from Stefan Knapp, Oxford University Structural Genomics Consortium) has constitutive activity and was expressed alone. Active His-JNK2 was produced by co-expression in bacteria with MEKK1 and MKK4 and purified as described previously (37Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Full procedures for protein expression and purification are provided in the supplemental material.Peptide Library Screening—Phosphorylation site specificity was determined using a positional scanning peptide library as described previously (38Turk B.E. Hutti J.E. Cantley L.C. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the DEF site library, peptides were reacted in 384-well plates in 10-μl reactions with 10 μm peptide in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μm ATP, 0.25 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and 20 ng of kinase for 2 h at 30 °C. A strip of 24 slotted capillary pins (VP Scientific) was used to spot 1-μl aliquots from each reaction onto streptavidin-coated filters (SAM2® biotin capture membrane, Promega). Reactions were quenched by immediately submerging the membrane in 0.1% SDS in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl). Additional washes were performed for 5 min each to remove unincorporated radiolabel (once in 0.1% SDS/TBS, twice in 2 m NaCl, and once in 1% H3PO4 in 2 m NaCl). After drying, the membrane was exposed to a phosphor storage screen for 1–3 days and scanned on a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Relative phosphorylation rates for each of the amino acid substitutions were quantified by optical densitometry (using ImageQuant 5.0) as the ratio of the individual signal intensity to the average signal intensity for all 19 amino acid substitutions at that DEF site position (P1–P4). Pilot experiments with DEF site peptides were carried out in a similar manner with reactions carried out in microcentrifuge tubes.Consensus Peptide Kinase Assays—The phosphorylation rates of MAPKs for individual consensus peptides was determined by P81 phosphocellulose filter binding assay essentially as described (39Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H.J. Cohen P. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (the detailed procedure is described in the supplemental material). To normalize docking site-independent activity between individual MAPK preparations, we determined the rate of phosphorylation of 100 μm MAPKtide for each kinase. All p38 preparations (WT and DEF site interaction pocket mutants) were re-assayed against 100 μm MAPKtide during each experiment to ensure proper normalization.Elk-1 Phosphorylation Assays—Phosphorylation of Elk-1 and its docking site mutants in vitro was studied using a fragment containing the MAPK phosphorylation sites (residues 307–428) expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein (7Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27256-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 20 μg/ml GST-Elk-1 and were carried out under the same conditions as the peptide phosphorylation assays. Reactions were split and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed either by immunoblotting with antibodies against Elk-1 phosphoserine 383 and phospho-ERK (both from Cell Signaling) or by Coomassie staining and autoradiography to detect total protein phosphorylation.For expression as a GST fusion protein in mammalian cells, the sequence encoding the same fragment of Elk-1 was shuttled into the plasmid pEBG2. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. At 6 h following transfection, cells were washed once with serum-free media, changed into media containing 0.1% calf serum, and incubated for 18 h. Cells were preincubated with either 5 μm U0126 or DMSO carrier for 30 min prior to stimulation with media containing 10% serum plus U0126 or DMSO as indicated. After 15 min, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted into lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.Docking Studies—The DEF site-MAPK interactions were modeled using the automatic molecular docking program Autodock 4 (40Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8960) Google Scholar). AutoDockTools, the graphical interface to Autodock 4, was used to set up the docking and subsequently analyze the clustering after completion of docking. Throughout the docking experiment a rigid receptor and flexible ligand were assumed. The published structure of the active form of ERK2 (Protein Data Bank code 2ERK) was used as the receptor, and a capped pentapeptide sequence, acetyl-SFQFP-amide, was used as the ligand. A grid map of 50 × 50 × 50 points with a spacing of 0.375 Å was centered on the previously identified hydrophobic pocket on the ERK2 surface (18Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We used the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, the default search method of Autodock 4, which combines the traditional genetic algorithm with a local search capacity. The number of runs was set to 256. The remaining docking parameters were set to the default values in AutoDockTools as follows: the number of individuals in population was set to 150; the maximum number of energy evaluations was 2,500,000; and the maximum number of generations was 27,000. The program automatically grouped potential receptor-ligand complex conformations into clusters based on their r.m.s.d. from one another, using the default threshold (2.0 Å r.m.s.d.).RESULTSMAPKs Have a Common Phosphorylation Site Motif—All MAPKs are regarded as proline-directed kinases, in that they have a major preference for Pro at the +1 position at their phosphorylation sites. However, not all members of the family have been fully characterized with respect to active site-mediated specificity, and differences in selectivity at other positions near the phosphorylation site could potentially distinguish MAPKs from one another. We therefore first addressed whether targeting of distinct protein substrates by different MAPKs might be due to differences in their respective phosphorylation site motifs. We screened a positional scanning peptide library that systematically substitutes each of the 20 amino acid residues plus phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine at 9 positions surrounding a central phosphoacceptor (3Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Meth. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Using this approach we found no significant differences among any of four representative MAPKs (ERK2, p38α, p38δ, and JNK2) in their phosphorylation site consensus sequences (Fig. 1). Our results confirm the phosphorylation site consensus motif previously reported for ERK2 and p38α, with a Ser or Thr phosphoacceptor followed by an obligate Pro at the +1 position and a less stringent preference for Pro at -2 (3Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Meth. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Most other residues surrounding the phosphoacceptor are well tolerated with the exception of Pro at the -1 position and aromatic residues at the -2 position. This simple motif is common in eukaryotic proteomes and overlaps with phosphorylation site motifs of more distantly related kinases (e.g. cyclin-dependent kinases) (41Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears unlikely that the phosphorylation site motif contributes to the unique target specificities of the various MAPK isoforms.Identification of MAPK Docking Motifs—We next turned our attention to interactions outside of the kinase active site, and asked whether targeting by specific MAPKs might involve recognition of distinct docking site sequences. The close proximity of the DEF site interacting pocket to the active site cleft on ERK2 means that both a MAPK phosphorylation site and a DEF site docking sequence can be encoded in a single extended peptide (7Fantz D.A.

We therefore developed a substrate optimized for DEF site-dependent phosphorylation using peptides based on amino acids 386–399 of Elk-1 (Fig. 2A). This region encompasses a single ERK phosphorylation site and a functional DEF site (23Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In these peptides, we independently varied the sequence surrounding the phosphoacceptor and the spacing between the phosphorylation site and DEF docking site. In each case, we compared the phosphorylation rate between peptides containing an intact DEF site (FQFP) and those with a point substitution within the site (DQFP). To ensure that ERK phosphorylation was directed exclusively to its endogenous target site (Ser-389), other potential phosphoacceptors (Ser-394 and Ser-399) were changed to Ala. Initial rates of phosphorylation of these peptides were measured at subsaturating concentrations (10 μm). Disruption of the DEF site by changing FQFP to DQFP decreased ERK phosphorylation of the peptide closest to the native Elk-1 sequence (peptide PF) by ∼15-fold (Fig. 2B). Substitution of the nonessential Pro residue at the -2 position with Ala slowed the phosphorylation rate by slightly less than 3-fold (compare the phosphorylation rates of PF and AF). However, disruption of the DEF site in the context of this modification further decreased the phosphorylation rate by 43-fold (AF versus AD). Alternatively, inserting an additional residue between the phosphoacceptor Ser and the DEF site both increased the peptide phosphorylation rate by 7-fold (PF versus PKF) and provided the maximal DEF site dependence (a 47-fold difference between PKF and PKD).FIGURE 2Optimization of peptide substrates containing DEF sites. A, pairs of DEF site peptides based on amino acids 386–399 of human Elk-1 that were evaluated for phosphorylation by ERK2. Peptides contain the endogenous ERK phosphorylation site (Ser-389) and either an intact DEF site (FQFP) or a nonfunctional DEF site with charged residue in position P1 (DQFP). B, extent of phosphorylation was measured by radiolabel incorporation from [γ-33P]ATP. The increase in phosphorylation rate afforded by an intact DEF site is potentiated by incorporating a suboptimal phosphorylation site sequence (peptide AF) or by separating the phosphorylation site from the DEF site by one additional residue (peptide PKF). Error bars reflect the standard deviation of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggested that the increased phosphorylation rate afforded by a functional DEF site is enhanced in peptide substrates bearing either a suboptimal phosphorylation site sequence or having a DEF site that begins seven residues downstream of the phosphorylated Ser residue. Both of these features were incorporated into a positional scanning peptide library designed to determine consensus sequences at the DEF site (Fig. 3A).

Ca(V)1.3-mediated pacemaking determines neuronal vulnerability of dopaminergic striatal neurons affected in Parkinson disease. We have previously found that in Ca(V)1.4 L-type Ca(2+) channels, activation, voltage, and calcium-dependent inactivation are controlled by an intrinsic distal C-terminal modulator. Because alternative splicing in the Ca(V)1.3 alpha1 subunit C terminus gives rise to a long (Ca(V)1.3(42)) and a short form (Ca(V)1.3(42A)), we investigated if a C-terminal modulatory mechanism also controls Ca(V)1.3 gating. The biophysical properties of both splice variants were compared after heterologous expression together with beta3 and alpha2delta1 subunits in HEK-293 cells. Activation of calcium current through Ca(V)1.3(42A) channels was more pronounced at negative voltages, and inactivation was faster because of enhanced calcium-dependent inactivation. By investigating several Ca(V)1.3 channel truncations, we restricted the modulator activity to the last 116 amino acids of the C terminus. The resulting Ca(V)1.3(DeltaC116) channels showed gating properties similar to Ca(V)1.3(42A) that were reverted by co-expression of the corresponding C-terminal peptide C(116). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed an intramolecular protein interaction in the C terminus of Ca(V)1.3 channels that also modulates calmodulin binding. These experiments revealed a novel mechanism of channel modulation enabling cells to tightly control Ca(V)1.3 channel activity by alternative splicing. The absence of the C-terminal modulator in short splice forms facilitates Ca(V)1.3 channel activation at lower voltages expected to favor Ca(V)1.3 activity at threshold voltages as required for modulation of neuronal firing behavior and sinoatrial node pacemaking."
https://openalex.org/W2169018921,"The conjugation of polyubiquitin to target proteins acts as a signal that regulates target stability, localization, and function. Several ubiquitin binding domains have been described, and while much is known about ubiquitin binding to the isolated domains, little is known with regard to how the domains interact with polyubiquitin in the context of full-length proteins. Isopeptidase T (IsoT/USP5) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is largely responsible for the disassembly of unanchored polyubiquitin in the cell. IsoT has four ubiquitin binding domains: a zinc finger domain (ZnF UBP), which binds the proximal ubiquitin, a UBP domain that forms the active site, and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains whose roles are unknown. Here, we show that the UBA domains are involved in binding two different polyubiquitin isoforms, linear and K48-linked. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that IsoT has at least four ubiquitin binding sites for both polyubiquitin isoforms. The thermodynamics of the interactions reveal that the binding is enthalpy-driven. Mutation of the UBA domains suggests that UBA1 and UBA2 domains of IsoT interact with the third and fourth ubiquitins in both polyubiquitin isoforms, respectively. These data suggest that recognition of the polyubiquitin isoforms by IsoT involves considerable conformational mobility in the polyubiquitin ligand, in the enzyme, or in both."

Here we show that small primates (less than 0.5 kilogram) consume the same amount of mass-specific energy (COTTOT) whether climbing or walking a given distance. COTTOT decreases with increasing body size for walking but does not change for climbing. This divergence of COTTOT is likely due to fundamental differences in the biomechanical determinants of the costs of climbing versus walking. These results have important implications for understanding the origins of primates, suggesting that small early primates may have been able to move into a novel arboreal niche without increasing metabolic costs."

https://openalex.org/W2012586415,"Bacteria employ a coordinated SOS response to DNA damage by enhancing transcription, translesion synthesis, and recombination; a similar phenomenon has not been reported in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitination complex Rad6-Rad18 is required for the increased transcription of a large number of yeast genes in response to DNA damage. Rad6-Rad18 promotes DNA-damage-dependent transcriptional induction as well as checkpoint functions by catalyzing monoubiquitination at the K197 residue of the Rad17 subunit of the 9-1-1 complex. Rad17 ubiquitination invokes both DNA damage responsive pathways by promoting efficient Rad53 phosphorylation, possibly through the recruitment or maintenance of the 9-1-1 clamp at sites of lesions. Taken together, the Rad6-Rad18 complex is involved in the control of global gene regulation in a way reminiscent of the bacterial SOS response and plays key roles in coordinating several DNA damage response pathways through ubiquitination of two DNA clamps, PCNA and 9-1-1."
https://openalex.org/W1969597381,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is an important regulator of physiological connective tissue biosynthesis and plays a central role in pathological tissue fibrosis. Previous studies have established that a biologically active lipid mediator, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), mimics some of the profibrotic functions of TGF-beta through cross-activation of Smad signaling. Here we report that another product of sphingosine kinase, dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P), has an opposite role in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling. In contrast to S1P, dhS1P inhibits TGF-beta-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and up-regulation of collagen synthesis. The effects of dhS1P require a lipid phosphatase, PTEN, a key modulator of cell growth and survival. dhS1P stimulates phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of PTEN and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. We demonstrate a novel function of nuclear PTEN as a co-factor of the Smad2/3 phosphatase, PPM1A. Complex formation of PTEN with PPM1A does not require the lipid phosphatase activity but depends on phosphorylation of the serine/threonine residues located in the C-terminal domain of PTEN. Upon complex formation with PTEN, PPM1A is protected from degradation induced by the TGF-beta signaling. Consequently, overexpression of PTEN abrogates TGF-beta-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation. This study establishes a novel role for nuclear PTEN in the stabilization of PPM1A. PTEN-mediated cross-talk between the sphingolipid and TGF-beta signaling pathways may play an important role in physiological and pathological TGF-beta signaling."

The catalytic core of the complex lies on presenilin, a multi-spanning membrane protease, the activity of which depends on two aspartate residues located in transmembrane domains 6 and 7. We have recently shown by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis that these aspartates are facing a water-filled cavity in the lipid bilayer, demonstrating how proteolytic cleavage of the substrates can be taking place within the membrane. Here, we demonstrate that transmembrane domain 9 and hydrophobic domain VII in the large cytoplasmic loop of presenilin are dynamic structural parts of this cavity. Hydrophobic domain VII is associated with transmembrane domain 7 in the membrane, probably facilitating the entrance of water molecules in the catalytic site. Transmembrane domain 9, on the other hand, exhibits a highly flexible structure, potentially involved in the transport of substrates to the catalytic site, as well as in the binding of γ-secretase inhibitors. The conserved proline-alanine-leucine motif at the cytoplasmic part of this domain is extremely close to the catalytic Asp257 and is crucial for conformational changes leading to the activation of the catalytic site.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is characterized by hydrolysis of peptide bonds within the hydrophobic environment of the membrane and is involved in a variety of physiological processes. So far, intramembrane-cleaving proteases have been found to represent three of the four mechanistic classes of proteases known: serine (rhomboids), aspartic (presenilin and signal peptide peptidase), and metalloproteases (site 2 protease) (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Very recently, important insight into the mechanism underlying regulated intramembrane proteolysis came from the high resolution crystal structures of the GlpG rhomboid (2Wang Y. Zhang Y. Ha Y.

Science. 2007; 318: 1608-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A key observation derived from these structures was the spatial arrangement of the transmembrane helices in such a way that the catalytic residues are positioned in a water-containing cavity (rhomboid) or channel (metalloprotease) inside the membrane. The entrance of water in the membrane is facilitated by shorter membrane-crossing helices and re-entrant loops, and lateral gating was proposed as the mechanism for substrate entry into the otherwise secluded catalytic site. These observations suggest that the intramembrane-cleaving proteases, despite their obviously diverse catalytic activities, share common structural features that reflect adaptation to hydrolysis within the membrane.Among the intramembrane-cleaving proteases, presenilin (PS) 2The abbreviations used are: PS, presenilin; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; AICD, APP intracellular domain; TM, transmembrane domain; HD, hydrophobic domain; M2M, 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl dimethanethiosulfonate; M17M, 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-diyl bis-methanethiosulfonate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5)-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; Biotin-HPDP, N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSEA Biotin, 2-((6-(biotinoyl)amino)-hexanoyl)amino)ethylmethanethiosulfonate)); M11M, 3,6,9-trioxaundecane-1,11-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment. 2The abbreviations used are: PS, presenilin; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; AICD, APP intracellular domain; TM, transmembrane domain; HD, hydrophobic domain; M2M, 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl dimethanethiosulfonate; M17M, 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-diyl bis-methanethiosulfonate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5)-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; Biotin-HPDP, N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSEA Biotin, 2-((6-(biotinoyl)amino)-hexanoyl)amino)ethylmethanethiosulfonate)); M11M, 3,6,9-trioxaundecane-1,11-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment. is unique, because its proteolytic activity is directly dependent on its association with three additional membrane proteins, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2.

This cavity is equivalent to the catalytic cavities found in the crystal structures of GlpG and S2P, allowing us for the first time to envisage how hydrolysis of the substrates can take place in the intramembrane catalytic site of PS1.In the present work we investigated the potential contribution of TM9 to this hydrophilic cavity. This domain has been proposed to be important for the initial binding of the substrate to PS1 (26Annaert W.G. Esselens C. Baert V. Boeve C. Snellings G. Cupers P. Craessaerts K. De Strooper B.

Interestingly, it contains the proline-alanine-leucine or PAL motif, completely conserved in all presenilins and their homologues, the signal peptide peptidase family (29Weihofen A. Binns K.

Such experiments can be interpreted in two fundamentally different ways: either PAL is a direct part of the catalytic site, or it is distant from the active site and its mutation affects the conformation of the catalytic site itself. Intriguingly, so far no proof supporting either the former or the latter assumption has been provided.Here we show that TM9 is a structural part of the catalytic cavity of PS1 directly interacting with the catalytic TM6 domain. We prove that this domain has a unique structure, characterized by high flexibility, potentially involved in the translocation of substrates from the initial binding site to the catalytic site of PS1. Extensive functional analysis identified a unique mutant (I437C), which can process Notch but not APP, suggesting that there are structural elements responsible for differential substrate cleavage on PS1. Furthermore, we provide for the first time direct evidence supporting a dual role for the PAL motif in the function of PS1; on one hand, it initiates conformational changes leading to the activation of the catalytic site, and on the other hand, its extremely close proximity to the catalytic Asp257 implies a functional interaction with it. In addition, we show that hydrophobic domain HDVII, located in the loop connecting TMs 6 and 7, is embedded in the membrane, and it most probably facilitates the entrance of water in the catalytic cavity. Based on these observations, we finally propose a model for the architectural organization and activation of the catalytic site of PS1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Cell Lines Stably Expressing PS1 Mutants, Preparation of Cell Lysates, and Immunoblotting—Construction of cell lines stably expressing PS1 mutants, preparation of cell lysates, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (23Tolia A.

For statistical analysis, the data from six independent infection experiments were used for calculations (S.E. values are indicated), which were then subjected to one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni correction to determine their significance.For in vitro generation of AICD, 3 μg of microsomal membranes prepared in buffer B (50 mm PIPES, pH 7, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1% CHAPSO) were incubated with 0.2 μm substrate (C99-3x FLAG purified from overexpressing COS cells), 0.0125% phosphatidylethanolamine, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, and 2.5% Me2SO at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction was terminated with Nu-Page sample buffer, the proteins were separated on a 12% Bis-Tris gel, and AICD production was visualized with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma).RESULTSAmino Acid Residues in TM9 Are Exposed to a Water-containing Cavity in the Membrane—We performed a systematic mutagenesis scan of TM9 by individually replacing most of its amino acid residues with cysteine (Fig. 1A, orange). We stably expressed the mutants in fibroblasts lacking both PS1 and PS2 and found that they were all, apart from G442C, able to restore PS1 endoproteolysis, as well as nicastrin maturation and PEN-2 stabilization, which indicates that they can rescue formation of the γ-secretase complex in the knock-out cells (Fig. 1B).We then probed the microenvironment of the introduced cysteines using different sulfhydryl-specific reagents. These reagents react with a cysteine only when its side chain is an ionized thiolate; this depends on the presence of water, therefore cysteines embedded in the lipid bilayer cannot bind to the reagents. In this context, treatment of intact cells expressing the different cysteine mutants with the membrane-permeable EZ-link Biotin-HPDP reagent resulted in labeling of all cysteines throughout TM9 (Fig. 2A). Some of these cysteines showed quite weak reactivity (i.e. Y446C and F441C) that was still above the background signals of the negative controls (CL PS1, L392C, and wild type PS1). We tend to consider this labeling as positive, and we take it into account in our overall interpretation of the data, although some caution with regard to these weak signals is appropriate. Our results indicate that all of the cysteines in TM9 are exposed to hydrophilic environment, implying that either TM9 does not cross the membrane or the different residues in the region become to variable extents exposed to water within the membrane. The latter is only possible if TM9 adopts distinct conformations within the cell. The fact that some residues are strongly modified by Biotin-HPDP and others not is indeed compatible with such a hypothesis.FIGURE 2TM9 cysteines are accessible to a water-containing cavity within the membrane. A, intact cells were labeled with membrane-permeable Biotin-HPDP, and proteins containing modified cysteines were precipitated with neutravidin beads and visualized by Western blot. Wild type PS1 contains accessible cysteines in NTF (purple in Fig. 1A), whereas Cys-less (CL) PS1 or L392C were previously shown to be inaccessible (23Tolia A. Chavez-Gutierrez L. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27633-27642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and are included here as a negative control. PEN-2 and PS1 NTF serve further as internal positive and negative controls, respectively. B, accessibility of cysteines to membrane-impermeable MTSEA-Biotin at the cell membrane. Note that full-length (FL) PS1 is labeled in some cases, in accordance with the previously reported existence of small amounts of FL protein at the plasma membrane of cells expressing high levels of PS1 (50Kaether C.

MTSET pretreatment abolishes the MTSEA-Biotin binding only to cysteines located in an open hydrophilic space (Y451C, Q454C, and P455C). C, summary of the accessibility results to both Biotin-HPDP and MTSEA-Biotin. Dark and light blue circles represent cysteines with high or low reactivity to Biotin-HPDP, respectively. Cyan rings indicate positions with quantitatively different reactivity toward the two reagents: relatively to L435C (consistently highly accessible to both reagents), Y446C, F447C, and Q454C are much more reactive to MTSEA-Biotin than to Biotin-HPDP, whereas P433C, P436C, and V453C show the reverse image. Red arrows point to cysteines reactive toward the charged MTSET.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate further the two possibilities, we performed a labeling experiment with two additional sulfhydryl-specific reagents, MTSEA-Biotin and MTSET (the chemical structure of the reagents is shown in supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast to Biotin-HPDP, which labels any ionized thiolate in the cell (intracellular, extracellular, or in a water cavity inside the membrane), MTSEA-Biotin cannot cross the plasma membrane, and as a result, in intact cells it binds exclusively to cysteines that are extracellular or located in a water cavity open to the extracellular space. To discriminate between these two positions, bulky charged reagents, such as MTSET, can be used prior to the reaction with MTSEA-Biotin. Because of the charge, these reagents cannot enter deeply into the membrane; therefore a cysteine can react with them only if it is located in open hydrophilic space (such as an extracellular loop or at the borders of a transmembrane domain), and that reaction would prevent subsequent binding to MTSEA-Biotin.We verified this principle by analyzing two mutants we have previously characterized (28Spasic D. Tolia A. Dillen K. Baert V. De Strooper B. Vrijens S. Annaert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26569-26577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), K430C and L460C, located in the loop domains flanking TM9 at the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively. Because K430C is intracellular, it does not react with MTSEA-Biotin (supplemental Fig. S1B). On the contrary, the extracellular L460C not only gets labeled by the reagent, but this labeling is partially blocked when cells are preincubated with MTSET (supplemental Fig. S1C), which verifies that indeed L460C is located in open hydrophilic space. We then proceeded with assessing the accessibility of all cysteines in TM9 to MTSEA-Biotin, with and without preblocking with MTSET. The results depicted in Fig. 2B show that at the cell membrane TM9 is exposed to water all the way up to the PAL motif at the cytoplasmic end of the domain. In agreement with TM9 crossing the membrane, MTSEA modification of only three mutants at the most extracellular part of the domain (Y451C, Q454C, and P455C) is completely blocked by MTSET pretreatment, suggesting that the rest of the domain is located in a closed hydrophilic environment, inside the membrane, restricted to charge. Interestingly, a more quantitative evaluation of the results with all of the reagents (Fig. 2C) revealed positions that show differential accessibility at the cell membrane (MTSEA-Biotin) versus the whole cell (Biotin-HPDP). Overall, it is clear that the residues in TM9 are accessible to water to a variable extent, pointing strongly toward the existence of distinct conformations of the domain.Both TM9 and HDVII Contribute Structurally to the Catalytic Site of PS1—We next investigated whether TM9 is exposed to the same water-containing cavity we previously identified for catalytic domains 6 and 7 (23Tolia A. Chavez-Gutierrez L. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27633-27642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We used PS1 bearing a mutation in TM9 (P433C) in combination with either D257C (TM6) or D385C (TM7) and performed cross-linking experiments on isolated membranes with the homobifunctional cross-linker M2M (Fig. 3A). We observed a specific cross-linking product in the case of the P433C/D257C double mutant, which proves that P433C is located in the same hydrophilic cavity as D257C, with a maximum distance of 5.2 Å between the two sulfhydryl groups. Surprisingly, no cross-linking was observed between TMs 7 and 9 (P433C/D385C), using M2M or the much longer M17M cross-linker (spacer arm length 24.7 Å) (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3TM9 is part of the catalytic site cavity, closely opposed to Asp257 but not to Asp385. A, specific cross-linking of TM9 with TM6 but not with TM7. Membrane fractions from cell lines expressing the indicated double cysteine mutants were treated with cross-linker (M2M or M17M) with and without preblocking the free sulfhydryls with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Protein extracts were separated in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and visualized in Western blot with antibodies toward both PS1 NTF and CTF. A representative experiment using M2M is shown. B, cross-linking of several cysteines in TM9 with D257C. Note that in the A434C/D257C and L435C/D257C double mutants there is an additional band in the control lanes, sensitive to reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (C), which indicates that it represents a spontaneous disulfide bridge between the sulfhydryls. D, overview of all positions in TM9 that could be cross-linked to D257C. The color code corresponds to the intensity of the cross-linked band versus the full-length protein. Dark purple represents >80% of cross-linking, light purple represents 50-80%, and pink represents <50% of cross-linking. The degree of cross-linking is gradually lower as we move from the intracellular to the extracellular part of the domain, suggesting sliding of this domain. No cross-linking is observed between any cysteine tested in TM9 and D385C in TM7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further elucidate the position of TM9 relatively to the catalytic site, we constructed an additional series of double mutants, with either D257C or D385C on one side and a cysteine residue in TM9 on the other side, scanning like this the whole length of TM9. All of the cross-linking results with D257C verified the close proximity of TMs 6 and 9 (Fig. 3B), in contrast to a cysteine pair introduced in TMs 1 and 6 (T90C/D257C), which showed no cross-linking and served as a negative control (supplemental Fig. S2A). Interestingly, the mutants containing D257C and A434C or L435C (located in the PAL motif) displayed an additional band running at the same height as the cross-linked product even in the absence of cross-linker (Fig. 3B, control lanes). This band was sensitive to reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3C), which means that it represents spontaneous cross-linking of the two cysteines. This implies very close opposition of these particular residues (distance ∼2 Å between the two sulfhydryl groups) (34Politzer P. Murray J.S. Lane P. J. Comput.

One member of the family, Ly108, was strongly linked to lupus susceptibility in mice. High expression of a Ly108 isoform, Ly108-1, was observed in lymphocytes of lupus-prone mice. Herein, we examined the molecular basis for the influence of Ly108 on lupus susceptibility by studying Ly108 signal transduction in T cells. We observed that Ly108 was able to mediate a tyrosine phosphorylation signal implicating Ly108, Vav-1, and c-Cbl in a manner strictly dependent on engagement of the extracellular domain of Ly108 and co-expression of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adaptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP). Evaluation of T cells from mice carrying mutations in the SAP-FynT pathway indicated that Ly108-triggered protein tyrosine phosphorylation was due to the capacity of SAP to recruit FynT. Importantly, Ly108-1 was more apt at triggering tyrosine phosphorylation signals in T cells when compared with the predominant Ly108 isoform found in non-lupus-prone mice, Ly108-2. This difference was due in part to the presence in Ly108-1 of a unique intra-cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif that promoted Ly108 signal transduction.

Together these data provided a molecular explanation for the involvement of Ly108 in lupus susceptibility in mice. Susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and diabetes is greatly influenced by genetic factors. In studies of lupus-susceptible mouse strains like NZM2410, several gene loci cooperate toward disease predisposition (1Kumar K.R. Li L. Yan M. Bhaskarabhatla M. Mobley A.B. Nguyen C. Mooney J.M. Schatzle J.D. Wakeland E.K. Mohan C. Science. 2006; 312: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One locus, Sle1, causes a loss of immune tolerance, leading to production of anti-nuclear antibodies. Sle1 is composed of four sub-loci, termed Sle1a–d, that all contribute to disease susceptibility. Of these, the best studied and most influential locus is Sle1b, which corresponds to the slam family locus on mouse chromosome 1 (2Wandstrat A.E. Nguyen C. Limaye N. Chan A.Y. Subramanian S.

Rev. 2005; 203: 180-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SLAM-related receptors (SRRs) possess immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in their extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region bearing multiple tyrosine-based motifs. With the exception of 2B4, which binds CD48, all SRRs are self-ligands. Through tyrosine phosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domain, SRRs associate with the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of adaptors that includes SAP, EAT-2, and ERT (3Veillette A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Nichols K.E. Ma C.S. Cannons J.L. Schwartzberg P.L. Tangye S.G. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 203: 180-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These adaptors are composed primarily of a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and link SRRs to intracellular signals. In the case of SAP, a second binding surface in the SH2 domain enables SAP to couple SRRs to the Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase FynT, thereby triggering protein tyrosine phosphorylation signals (5Latour S.

Interestingly, SAP is mutated in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, a human immunodeficiency characterized by a faulty immune response to Epstein-Barr virus. Ly108/NTB-A (hereafter named Ly108) is a self-ligating member of the SLAM family expressed on T cells, B cells and, at least in humans, natural killer (NK) cells (10Peck S.R. Ruley H.E.

Early studies showed that engagement of Ly108 was able to promote SAP-dependent natural cytotoxicity by human NK cells (11Bottino C. Falco M. Parolini S. Marcenaro E. Augugliaro R. Sivori S. Landi E.

Subsequently, it was shown that stimulation of human CD4+ T cells by an anti-Ly108 monoclonal antibody (mAb) enhanced T helper 1 (TH1) cytokine release (15Valdez P.A. Wang H.

Furthermore, injection of C57BL/6 mice with a Ly108-Fc fusion protein (presumed to block Ly108-Ly108 homotypic interactions) delayed the onset of TH1-dependent autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These observations suggested that Ly108 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases by regulating TH1 cytokine production by CD4+ T cells. Paradoxically, analyses of T cells from mice engineered to lack most of the extracellular domain of Ly108 (ly108ΔE2 + 3) suggested that Ly108 played a role in T helper 2 (TH2) cytokine production (16Howie D. Laroux F.S. Morra M. Satoskar A.R. Rosas L.E. Faubion W.A. Julien A. Rietdijk S. Coyle A.J. Fraser C. Terhorst C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the basis for these contradictory results remains to be established, these data nonetheless offered a compelling indication that Ly108 participates in normal immunity and autoimmune pathologies. Further support for the idea that Ly108 is involved in autoimmune diseases was obtained with the characterization of the Sle1b locus in the lupus-susceptible mouse strain NZM2410 (2Wandstrat A.E. Nguyen C. Limaye N. Chan A.Y. Subramanian S. Tian X.H. Yim Y.S. Pertsemlidis A. Garner Jr., H.R. Morel L. Wakeland E.K. Immunity. 2004; 21: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This study identified several polymorphisms in slam family genes between susceptible and non-susceptible mice. The most statistically significant alteration was a polymorphism in ly108. This polymorphism resulted in up-regulated expression of an alternatively spliced isoform of ly108, ly108-1, as well as downregulated expression of another ly108 isoform, ly108-2, in T cells and B cells of disease-prone animals. In mature T cells these alterations correlated with an enhancement of antigen receptor-triggered responses in vitro. Herein we examined the molecular basis for the greater responsiveness of T cells expressing high levels of the lupus-associated Ly108 isoform, Ly108-1. We found that all Ly108 isoforms were able to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation signals in T cells that involve Ly108 itself, Vav-1, and to a lesser extent, c-Cbl. These signals were dependent on self-engagement of the extracellular domain of Ly108 and co-expression of SAP. In addition, they required the aptitude of SAP to recruit the Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase FynT. Importantly, Ly108-1 was more apt than Ly108-2 at triggering this protein tyrosine phosphorylation signal. This difference was due in part to the presence of an additional tyrosine-based motif in the cytoplasmic domain of Ly108-1. Cells—BI-141 is a mouse T-cell line (17Abraham N. Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R.

Whenever cells were purified, purity was confirmed to be >90% (data not shown). In some cases mice were injected intraperitoneally with the polyclonal NK cell activator poly(I:C) (150 μgin150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Sigma-Aldrich) or PBS alone 24 h before cell isolation (19Fernandez N.C.

Variants in which the sequences encoding the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Ly108 were replaced by those of Tac were created by PCR. For expression in BI-141 T cells or DCEK, cDNAs were cloned in the expression plasmid pSRα-puro, which confers resistance to puromycin. The expression vector encoding SAP (pNT-neo-SAP) was reported elsewhere (6Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat.

The cDNA coding for the Ly108-Fc fusion was produced by PCR using mouse ly108 cDNA and a human IgG1 cDNA (obtained from Dr. Nicole Beauchemin, McGill University) as templates. Point mutations or truncation of the cytoplasmic segment (leaving intact the eight most membrane proximal residues of the cytoplasmic domain) were introduced in ly108 cDNAs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or PCR, respectively. All cDNAs were fully sequenced to make certain that they carried no undesired mutations (data not shown).

A rabbit anti-Tac serum against the extracellular domain of Tac was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. A mAb recognizing mouse Ly108 (mAb 3E11) was generated in rats using the Ly108-Fc fusion protein as immunogen. This antibody recognizes Ly108 but not the other SRRs (supplemental Fig. 1). mAb 3E11 is an IgG2a/κ (data not shown). An isotype control was purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA). For flow cytometry both antibodies were coupled to Alexa 647 according to the protocol outlined by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). mAbs against CD4, CD8, CD28, B220, NKRP1c (NK1.1), CD11c, CD11b, F4/80, and CD49b (mAb DX-5) were obtained from eBioscience or BD Biosciences. Anti-Tac mouse mAb 7G7 and anti-SLAM mAb 12F12 were purified from culture supernatant (24Rubin L.A. Kurman C.C. Biddison W.E. Goldman N.D. Nelson D.L.

Cell Stimulation—Stimulation of Tac chimeras on BI-141 was performed as described (6Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For antibody-mediated ligation of Ly108 on thymocytes, cells (20 × 106 cells) were triggered for the indicated times at 37 °C with rat anti-Ly108 mAb 3E11, biotinylated or not, followed by avidin or rabbit anti-rat IgG (6Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For self-ligation of Ly108 on thymocytes, thymocytes (10 × 106) from wild-type mice were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with adherent DCEK fibroblasts expressing or not a cytoplasmic domain-truncated version of Ly108, previously plated in tissue culture dishes. Stimulation was stopped by harvesting non-adherent cells from the plates. After stimulation, cells were lysed in TNE buffer (1× TNE is 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots were performed as described in an earlier report (26Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive products were detected using either 125I-labeled protein A, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled protein A, 125I-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG, or HRP-sheep anti-mouse IgG. All secondary reagents were purchased from GE Healthcare. Radioactive signals were quantitated using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Mouse Ly108 Is Expressed on T Cells and B Cells but Not on Most Mature NK Cells—Newly generated anti-Ly108 mAb 3E11 was used to study the expression of Ly108 on mouse immune cells (Fig. 1). In thymus, Ly108 was expressed on CD4–CD8–, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8–, and CD4–CD8+ cells (Fig. 1A). Generally, all cells in these subpopulations expressed Ly108, except CD4–CD8– cells, which contained a small (<10%) Ly108-negative subset. Whether these Ly108-negative cells were of lymphoid origin remains to be established. In spleen, all CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells also possessed Ly108 (Fig. 1B). This expression was further augmented when T cells or B cells were activated in vitro (Figs. 1, E and F). In contrast, only a small subset (∼10–20%) of splenic NK cells expressed Ly108 (Fig. 1C). This was true for cells from untreated mice and mice injected with the NK cell activator poly(I:C). These Ly108-positive NK cells were lost when cells were propagated and activated in vitro with IL-2. The absence of Ly108 on most mouse NK cells was surprising given that human NK cells uniformly express high levels of NTB-A, the human Ly108 equivalent (11Bottino C. Falco M. Parolini S. Marcenaro E.

Ly108 was present on all liver NK-T cells, in keeping with a recent report (27Griewank K. Borowski C. Rietdijk S. Wang N. Julien A. Wei D.G. Mamchak A.A. Terhorst C. Bendelac A. Immunity. 2007; 27: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Last, Ly108 was expressed on all splenic DCs but not on macrophages. Thus, in the mouse, Ly108 is expressed on T cells, B cells, NK-T cells, and DCs but not on most NK cells. Ly108 Mediates a SAP-dependent Tyrosine Phosphorylation Signal in T Cells—To elucidate the signals triggered by Ly108, full-length Ly108 (Ly108-1) was expressed in the absence or in the presence of SAP in the mouse T cell line BI-141. This cell line was chosen because it normally lacks both Ly108 and SAP (data not shown). Moreover, it was previously used to define the pathways linked to other SRRs (5Latour S. Roncagalli R. Chen R. Bakinowski M. Shi X. Schwartzberg P.L. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 18Chen R. Relouzat F. Roncagalli R. Aoukaty A. Tan R. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5144-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The impact of Ly108 on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was studied by immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2A, first panel). Without SAP (lane 3), cells containing Ly108 exhibited no increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation compared with cells lacking Ly108 (lane 1). However, with SAP (lane 4), they showed a striking increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of polypeptides of 65 (p65), 95 (p95), and 120 (p120) kDa. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 and, to a lesser extent, p95 was also seen in cells containing SAP alone (lane 2). Although the basis of this observation is not known, this signal may be due to SAP-dependent signaling via Ly-9, a SRR expressed in small amounts in parental BI-141 cells (data not shown). The 65-kDa substrate was consistent with being Ly108 itself. To examine this possibility lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ly108 antibodies and probed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 2B, first panel). The tyrosine-phosphorylated p65 seen in cells expressing Ly108 and SAP (lane 4–6) was efficiently immunoprecipitated with anti-Ly108 (lane 4) but not anti-SLAM (lane 5) or anti-CD4 (lane 6) antibodies. No tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate was noted in cells lacking SAP (lanes 1–3). We also ascertained whether SAP was physically associated with Ly108 by probing Ly108 immunoprecipitates with anti-SAP antibodies (second panel). SAP was present in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Ly108 (lane 4) but not irrelevant (lanes 5 and 6) antibodies. Like human NTB-A, mouse Ly108 is a self-ligand (supplemental Fig. 2). Hence, the data of Fig. 2B did not address whether engagement of Ly108 was required to trigger SAP binding and SAP-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. To ascertain this, we created a chimeric receptor in which the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Ly108 were replaced by those of Tac (human IL-2 receptor α chain). Stimulation with antibodies against Tac induced a tyrosine phosphorylation signal involving polypeptides of 65 (probably Tac-Ly108), 95, and 120 kDa in cells containing Tac-Ly108 (TLy108) and SAP (Fig. 2C, first panel, lane 4) but not Tac-Ly108 alone (lane 2). Importantly, no increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in the absence of anti-Tac stimulation (lane 3), indicating that Ly108 engagement was essential to induce the SAP-dependent signals. Similar results were obtained when Tac-Ly108 was immunoprecipitated (second panel). To address if this reflected the ligand-dependent association of Ly108 with SAP, Tac immunoprecipitates were probed by immunoblotting with anti-SAP antibodies (third panel). In the absence of engagement (lane 3), Tac-Ly108 was minimally associated with SAP. A much more extensive association was observed after Tac stimulation (lane 4). The ligand-inducible nature of the Ly108-SAP interaction was in contrast to the ligand-independent association between SLAM and SAP (6Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ly108 engagement was required to induce full Ly108-SAP association and SAP-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells. Ly108 Signaling Is Caused by the Src-related Protein Tyrosine Kinase FynT—Previous studies indicated that the ability of SLAM and 2B4 to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation signals in the presence of SAP was mediated in large part by the capacity of SAP to bind the Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase FynT (5Latour S.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This function required a second binding surface in the SAP SH2 domain that is centered on Arg-78 of SAP and directly interacts with the SH3 domain of FynT. However, a more recent report suggested that alternative mechanisms can also enable SRRs to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation signals (29Calpe S. Erdos E. Liao G. Wang N. Rietdijk S. Simarro M. Scholtz B. Mooney J. Lee C.H. Shin M.S. Rajnavolgyi E. Schatzle J. Morse III, H.C. Terhorst C. Lanyi A. Immunogenetics. 2006; 58: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To appraise whether SAP-dependent Ly108 signaling was mediated by FynT, Ly108-triggered protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined in T cells from mice carrying mutations in the SAP-FynT pathway, including sap–/–, sapR78A (in which the SAP-FynT interaction was disrupted because of a germ-line mutation of Arg-78 to alanine), and fyn–/– mice (Fig. 3). Thymocytes from these animals were stimulated or not with anti-Ly108 antibodies, and Ly108 tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of Ly108 immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (first panels). The association of Ly108 with SAP was also evaluated by immunoblotting of Ly108 immunoprecipitates with anti-SAP antibodies (third panels). In wild-type thymocytes (Figs. 3, A–C, lanes 1 and 2), there was minimal Ly108 tyrosine phosphorylation (first panels) and no detectable Ly108-SAP interaction (third panels) in the absence of Ly108 stimulation (lane 1). However, ligation of Ly108 evoked strong Ly108 tyrosine phosphorylation and triggered binding of Ly108 to SAP (lane 2). The limited Ly108 tyrosine phosphorylation seen in the absence of Ly108 engagement (lane 1) was at odds with the finding made earlier in BI-141 cells (Fig. 2). Although the basis for this distinction is not known, it may reflect the higher levels of Ly108 achieved in BI-141 cells (data not shown). This feature may facilitate Ly108 self-engagement. As expected, the ability of Ly108 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation was severely compromised in thymocytes lacking SAP (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, it was also markedly reduced in cells expressing the SAP mutant unable to bind FynT (SAP R78A) (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). There was also a reduction of the ability of SAP R78A to interact with Ly108 (third panel, lanes 3 and 4), in comparison to wild-type SAP (lanes 1 and 2). It is unlikely that this reduction was due to a lower affinity of Ly108 toward SAP R78A, since mutation of Arg-78 does not affect the phosphotyrosine-binding fold of the SAP SH2 domain (5Latour S.

This reduced association was probably caused by the attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of Ly108. Finally, in thymocytes lacking FynT (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4), the aptitude of Ly108 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation (first panel) and associate with SAP (third panel) was eliminated. Thus, Ly108-triggered protein tyrosine phosphorylation was largely mediated by the capacity of SAP to bind FynT. We wanted to ensure that Ly108 tyrosine in thymocytes could also be induced by the physiological ligand of Ly108; that is, Ly108 itself. To this end, thymocyte"

It has been reported that arsenic trioxide (ATO), a potent cancer chemotherapeutic agent, in particular for acute promyelocytic leukemia, activates the Chk2/p53 pathway, leading to apoptosis. ATO is also known to activate the p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Here we show that phosphatase activities of purified Wip1 toward phosphorylated Chk2 and p38 in vitro are inhibited by ATO in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 and p38 in cultured cells is suppressed by ectopic expression of Wip1, and this Wip1-mediated suppression can be restored by the presence of ATO. We also show that treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with ATO resulted in induction of phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 and p38 MAPK, which are required for ATO-induced apoptosis. Importantly, this ATO-induced activation of Chk2/p53 and p38 MAPK/p53 apoptotic pathways can be enhanced by siRNA-mediated suppression of Wip1 expression, further indicating that ATO inhibits Wip1 phosphatase in vivo.

Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 2396-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Most APL cases are characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation t(15; 17), which results in the rearrangement of the PML (for promyelocytic leukemia) gene and retinoic acid receptor (RARα) gene and the expression of PML-RARα fusion protein. The PML-RARα fusion protein functions as a constitutive transcriptional silencer in the retinoic acid signaling pathway, thereby inducing a differentiation block (4Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), another drug for APL, directly targets the PML-RARα fusion protein and can induce clinical complete remission in APL patients by degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein and a differentiation process; however, these patients often relapse and are resistant to further treatment with ATRA (5Soignet S.L. Frankel S.R. Douer D. Tallman M.S. Kantarjian H. Calleja E. Stone R.M. Kalaycio M. Scheinberg D.A. Steinherz P. Sievers E.L. Coutre S. Dahlberg S. Ellison R. Warrell Jr., R.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 3852-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). ATO also degrades the PML-RARα fusion protein and induces differentiation with lower concentration, but unlike ATRA, ATO induces a potent apoptosis of the APL cells with higher concentration via a variety of mechanisms, which appear to be independent of the presence of the PML-RARα fusion protein (6Chen G.Q. Shi X.G. Tang W. Xiong S.M. Zhu J. Cai X. Han Z.G. Ni J.H. Shi G.Y. Jia P.M. Liu M.M. He K.L. Niu C. Ma J. Zhang P. Zhang T.D. Paul P. Naoe T. Kitamura K. Miller W. Waxman S. Wang Z.Y. de The H.

It has been well demonstrated that ATO induces high complete remission rates in relapsed APL patients resistant to ATRA as well as in primary APL patients (around 85–90%) (8Zhang T.D. Chen G.Q. Wang Z.G. Wang Z.Y. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7146-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ATO-induced apoptosis is thought to play a major role in the therapeutic effects of ATO (7Miller Jr., W.H. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ATO is of potential therapeutic value for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors in addition to APL (9Dilda P.J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2007; 33: 542-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Arsenic predominantly exists in two oxidation states, As(III) (e.g. As2O3; ATO) and As(V) (e.g. As2O5; arsenic pentoxide; APO). Although high concentrations of As(V) have been shown to substitute for phosphate in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, arsenic toxicity is postulated to be primarily due to the binding of As(III) to target molecules, including sulfhydryl-containing enzymes (10Leonard A. Lauwerys R.R. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Chouchane S. Snow E.T. Chem. Res.

Among these enzymes, protein phosphatases can be targets of As(III). For example, phenylarsine oxide and arsenite were shown to inhibit CD45 tyrosine phosphatase and dual specificity c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase, respectively (13Garcia-Morales P. Minami Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). ATO-induced apoptosis is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent accumulation of H2O2 in several experimental models (15Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 16Jing Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S. Blood. 1999; 94: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATO-induced apoptosis is inhibited when cells are treated with various antioxidants, free radical scavengers, or inhibitors of ROS-producing enzymes (15Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Recently, TrxR (thioredoxin reductase), one of the critical regulators of the cellular redox environment, was identified as a molecular target of ATO (17Lu J. Chew E.H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, other targets of ATO are not known, and molecular mechanisms of ATO-induced apoptosis remain elusive. It has been well appreciated that genotoxic stresses activate cell cycle checkpoint machinery to maintain genomic integrity (18Motoyama N. Naka K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Eyfjord J.E. Bodvarsdottir S.K. Mutat. Res. 2005; 592: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and/or ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases are activated rapidly, and these kinases then phosphorylate and activate checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, thereby amplifying the DNA damage signal to execute cell cycle checkpoint regulation (20Bartek J.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are a family of enzymes that transduce signals from the cell membrane to the cell interior in response to a wide range of stimuli and modulate several important biological functions, including gene expression, mitosis, proliferation, motility, and apoptosis (27Schaeffer H.J.

It has been shown that p38 MAPK stimulates p53 in response to various stress agents, including UV irradiation and anticancer drugs, and regulates both activation of p53-mediated transcription and p53-dependent apoptosis (29Bulavin D.V.

In mammals, the PP2C (protein phosphatase 2C) family of protein phosphatases consists of at least seven distinct isoforms and has been implicated in stress response signaling (36Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

Among the members of the PP2C family protein phosphatases, Wip1 (PPM1D) possesses unique biological characteristics. Wip1 is induced by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner and inhibits UV irradiation-induced activation of p38 MAPK by dephosphorylating Thr180 in p38, thereby inhibiting the function of p53 (38Takekawa M.

It has also been reported that Wip1 dephosphorylates the two ATM/ATR (ATM and Rad-3-related) targets, Chk1 and p53 (40Lu X. Nannenga B. Donehower L.A.

Recently, we have shown that Wip1 inactivates Chk2 kinase by dephosphorylating threonine 68 (Thr68) in activated Chk2, and suppresses Chk2-mediated apoptosis (42Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the Wip1 (PPM1D) gene is amplified or overexpressed in various human cancers, including breast cancers (43Bulavin D.V. Demidov O.N. Saito S. Kauraniemi P.

In addition, a recent study using Wip1-deficient mice has revealed that blocking its function results in enhanced apoptosis in Ras- and Erbb2-induced breast tumors and impairs tumor formation (47Harrison M.

However, the roles of the Wip1 phosphatase in ATO-induced cellular responses remain obscure. In this study, we examined the effect(s) of ATO on APL cells, in particular the roles of Chk2, p38 MAPK, and Wip1 in ATO-induced apoptosis. We show that both Chk2 and p38 MAPK are phosphorylated following ATO stimulation, but not APO or ATRA stimulation, of APL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of either Chk2 or p38 MAPK resulted in suppression of ATO-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of Wip1 resulted in enhancement of ATO-induced apoptosis, indicating that these proteins are involved critically in ATO-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that ATO inhibits phosphatase activities of Wip1, but not kinase activities of Chk2 and p38 MAPK, in vitro, and that Wip1-mediated suppression of phosphorylation of Chk2 and p38 MAPK is inhibited by ATO treatment in vivo. These results support our notion that ATO induces apoptosis by activating Chk2/p53 and p38/p53 pathways, which is enhanced by direct inhibition of Wip1 by ATO.

The sequence of the Chk2 siRNA (number 1 and 2) and Wip1 siRNA (number 1 and 2) oligonucleotides were GAACCUGAGGACCAAGAACCU (Chk2 siRNA 1), CGCCGUCCUUUGAAUAACAAU (Chk2 siRNA 2), UUGGCCUUGUGCCUACUAAUU (Wip1 siRNA 1), and GGCUUUCUCGCUUGUCACCdTdT (Wip1 siRNA 2). The control siRNA oligonucleotide used was GUACCGCACGUCAUUCGUAUC. Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes by electroporation. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with ATO and harvested 24 h after ATO treatment. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Coimmunoprecipitation/Immunoblot Analyses—The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and whole cell lysates (WCLs) were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. WCLs were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatants were then coimmunoprecipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or with antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins either from the coimmunoprecipitation analyses or WCLs were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% PAG) and transferred onto PVDF membrane filters (Immobilon; Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with the respective antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgGs (Bio-Rad) using chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Analyses—NB4 cells were washed twice in RPMI1640 without serum, resuspended in 100 μl of RPMI1640, and attached on coverslips. 293T and HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips coated with rat tail collagen. Fixation, permeabilization, blocking, and staining were performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. For phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) and Wip1 staining, cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed once with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl), and permeabilized with TBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with TBS and washed once with TBS containing freshly prepared 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride to quench reactions. After blocking with PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml NaN3 for 1 h at room temperature, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the respective primary antibodies, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) (1:100) and/or mouse monoclonal anti-Wip1 antibodies (WC10; 1:100), in PBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C.

GST and GST fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were isolated with amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs). GST or MBP fusion proteins were eluted from beads by incubating with 25 mm glutathione (reduced) or 10 mm maltose, respectively, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography using Nick columns (GE Healthcare). To prepare phosphorylated GST-HA-Chk2 (WT or dead kinase (DK)) or phosphorylated GST-p38, 293T cells transfected with the respective expression vectors, encoding GST-HA-Chk2 (WT or DK) or GST-p38, were exposed to γ-irradiation (10 grays) or UV irradiation (50 J/m2), respectively, and were cultured for 1 h prior to harvest. Phosphorylated GST-HA-Chk2 (WT or DK) or phosphorylated GST-p38 in 293T were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and were purified as described above.

The mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C, and 32P-labeled GST-HA-Chk2 proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Phosphatase activities were measured by the release of 32PO4 from 32P-labeled proteins essentially as described previously (52Minami Y. Stafford F.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2071677901,"TRPV1 is a nociceptive, Ca2+-selective ion channel involved in the development of several painful conditions. Sensitization of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA crucially contributes to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. However, the pathways involved in potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA remain largely unknown. Using HEK cells stably expressing TRPV1 and the μ opioid receptor, we demonstrated that treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin significantly increased the multimeric TRPV1 species. Pretreatment with the μ opioid receptor agonist morphine reversed this increased TRPV1 multimerization. FRET analysis revealed that treatment with forskolin did not cause multimerization of pre-existing TRPV1 monomers on the plasma membrane and that intracellular pools of TRPV1 exist mostly as monomers in this model. This suggests that increased TRPV1 multimerization occurred from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. Treatment with forskolin also caused an increase in TRPV1 expression on the plasma membrane not resulting from increased TRPV1 expression, and this rapid TRPV1 translocation was inhibited by treatment with morphine. Thus, potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA involves plasma membrane insertion of functional TRPV1 multimers formed from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. This potentiation occurs rapidly and can be dynamically modulated by activation of the μ opioid receptor under conditions where cAMP levels are raised, such as with inflammation. Increased translocation and multimerization of TRPV1 channels provide a cellular mechanism for finetuning of nociceptive responses that allow for rapid modulation of TRPV1 responses independent of transcriptional changes.

The ability to sensitize or desensitize painful stimuli is fundamental for survival. In inflammation, sensitization of peripheral nociception contributes to the development of hyperalgesia. Pro-inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins mediate an increase in cellular cAMP levels, which in turn leads to sensitization of nociception as a result of activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; TRPV1, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MOP, μ opioid receptor; RTX, resiniferatoxin; PSS, physiological salt solution; FSK, forskolin; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium. 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; TRPV1, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MOP, μ opioid receptor; RTX, resiniferatoxin; PSS, physiological salt solution; FSK, forskolin; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium.

Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7072) Google Scholar). TRPV1 and endovanilloid signaling are implicated in various inflammatory hyperalgesic conditions. The contribution of TRPV1 to inflammatory hyperalgesia has been established through observations that TRPV1 antagonists can dose-dependently reverse both thermal and mechanical inflammatory hyperalgesia (4Pomonis J.D.

Panesar M. Fox A.J. McIntyre P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition, thermal inflammatory hyperalgesia is significantly reduced in TRPV1 knock-out mice (6Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). Several pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, including prostaglandin E2, sensitize TRPV1 responses under inflammatory conditions (7Hu H.J. Bhave G. Gereau R.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7444-7452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the TRPV1 is sensitized directly by cAMP-dependent PKA (8Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D. Oxford G. Gereau R.T. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), making the TRPV1 a direct molecular target for the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia (2Rathee P.K. Distler C. Obreja O. Neuhuber W. Wang G.K. Wang S.Y. Nau C. Kress M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Planells-Cases R. Garcia-Sanz N. Morenilla-Palao C. Ferrer-Montiel A. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA appears crucial in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia, the mechanisms underlying this potentiation are not fully understood. Peripheral sensitization of nociceptive responses represents a cellular process to encourage rest and recovery after injury. The ability to modify responses rapidly, without having to rely on altering expression levels of nociceptive receptors, is essential for rapid adaption to external circumstances. This system is exemplified by the release of endogenous opioids from immune cells, which affects analgesia in inflamed tissues (10Cabot P.J. Carter L. Gaiddon C. Zhang Q. Schäfer M. Loeffler J.P. Stein C. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the increased effectiveness of exogenous opioids in inflammation (11Schafer M. Imai Y. Uhl G.R. Stein C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 279: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The capacity for rapid fine-tuning and modulation of sensitized nociception is further demonstrated by the ability of opioids to inhibit TRPV1-mediated capsaicin responses potentiated by cAMP-dependent PKA (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To date, no mechanism has been proposed to explain how TRPV1 sensitization by cAMP-dependent PKA can be achieved in a manner that provides for rapid potentiation while maintaining the capacity for dynamic modulation. Here, we present evidence for a model that describes how, as a consequence of activation of adenylate cyclase, an intracellular pool of inactive TRPV1 monomers is transported to the plasma membrane where they function as TRPV1 multimers. This mechanism incorporates 2-fold regulation involving both altered multimerization and trafficking. It provides the basis for rapid modulation of nociceptive TRPV1 responses and finetuning of nociception. Modification of this pathway by the opioid receptor agonist morphine can rapidly alter TRPV1 potentiation and thus allows dynamic regulation of nociceptive TRPV1 responses. Microplate Reader Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Responses in TRPV1/MOP HEK Cells—Double stable HEK293 cells expressing the μ opioid receptor (MOP) and TRPV1 (TRPV1/MOP HEK cells) were generated as described (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TRPV1/MOP HEK cells were plated on PDL-coated 96-well plates and loaded with the fluorescent calcium probe Fluo-3-AM (6 μm) as described (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 2–3 times with physiological salt solution (PSS; pH 7.4, composition KCl 5.9 mm, MgCl2 1.5 mm, NaH2PO4 1.2 mm, NaHCO3 5.0 mm, NaCl 140.0 mm, glucose 11.5 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, and HEPES 10.0 mm) and incubated for 15–30 min with pretreatments as appropriate. Preincubation steps and Ca2+ measurement were carried out at 29 °C to avoid dye sequestration. Changes in fluorescence after addition of capsaicin were measured using a fluorescent multi-well plate reader (NOVOstar, BMG Labtechnologies, Victoria, Australia) with the excitation wavelength set at 485 nm and emission recorded at 520 nm. As previously described, calcium responses were represented as ΔF/F values (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Maximum ΔF/F values were used to fit a 4-parameter logistic Hill equation to the data using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA, Version 4.03) to generate dose-response curves. All experiments were designed to include control experiments on the same plate as treated cells. For calcium measurements using the FLIPRTETRA fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), TRPV1/MOP HEK cells were plated on PDL-coated, black-walled 96-well plates (Corning, Lindfield, NSW, Australia). After loading with Fluo-3 AM (6 μm), cells were washed three times with PSS or nominal calcium-free PSS (composition: KCl 5.9 mm, MgCl2 1.5 mm, NaH2PO4 1.2 mm, NaHCO3 5.0 mm, NaCl 140.0 mm, glucose 11.5 mm, and HEPES 10.0 mm) as appropriate. Capsaicin and other reagents were injected from 3–4× concentrated stock solutions prepared in PSS or nominal calcium-free PSS with maximum final ethanol concentrations not exceeding 0.003%. Fluo-3-loaded cells were excited at 470–495 nm, and emission at 515–575 nm was recorded every second using a cooled CCD camera. For experiments requiring no extracellular calcium, BAPTA (final concentration 100 μm) was added 30 s prior to addition of capsaicin. Whole Cell cAMP Accumulation Assay—TRPV1/MOP HEK cells were harvested with Versene (Invitrogen, Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia) to avoid internalization of receptors. Cells were resuspended with anti-cAMP acceptor bead mix yielding final concentrations of 40,000 cells/well and 1 unit/well of anti-cAMP acceptor beads. Cells were incubated for 15–30 min with agonist in triplicate on 384-well plates (OptiPlate-384; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rowville, Victoria, Australia) and the reaction terminated by addition of lysis buffer containing Streptavidin Donor beads (1 unit/well) and biotinylated cAMP (1 unit/well). The plate was incubated under low light conditions for 16 h, and the bioluminescence reaction measured using the Envision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—To assess monomeric and multimeric TRPV1 species, total cell protein was isolated and separated by SDS-PAGE essentially as previously described (13Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to ∼80% confluency and incubated for 25–30 min at 37 °C with the appropriate treatments in PSS. Cells were then immediately placed on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; composition in mm: NaCl 137, KCl 2.7, NaH2PO4 10, KH2PO4 1.8) and dislodged with ice-cold PBS. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) and sonicated briefly on ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and protein estimation carried out using the Bio-Rad protein estimation kit. Protein samples were analyzed on precast 4–20% iGel gradient gels without SDS (Life Therapeutics, Frenchs Forest, NSW, Australia). Total cell protein (20 μg) was mixed with 5× loading buffer (composition: 365 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 37.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% SDS to yield SDS end concentrations of 2%) and denatured at 65 °C for 10 min. Samples were separated at 150 V for ∼60 min and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 300 mA on ice in transfer buffer (composition: 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 15% methanol, pH 8.3). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (composition: 130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% Tween-20, and 10% low-fat skim milk powder) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-rat TRPV1 antibody (1:5,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:20,000, clone AC-15, Sigma Aldrich) was also included for visualization of β-actin to serve as a loading control. After washing in blocking buffer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (both 1:5,000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia). Blots were developed using ECL Plus (GE Life Sciences, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia) for visualization of chemiluminescence by exposure to ECL Hyperfilm (GE Life Sciences). The optical density of bands was determined using MetaMorph Imaging Software (Version 6.2R5; Universal Imaging, Downington, PA). [3H]Resiniferatoxin Binding—For preparation of total cell membranes to assess binding of [3H]resiniferatoxin to the TRPV1, cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator with the appropriate treatment for 20–30 min, subsequently placed on ice, and washed 2–3 times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were dislodged with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of assay buffer (composition: 5 mm KCl, 5.8 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 320 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES; pH 7.4) and sonicated briefly. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and after protein estimation using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, diluted to 20 μg of protein/200 μl with assay buffer containing an additional 0.25 mg/ml BSA. Plasma membrane samples for [3H]resiniferatoxin binding were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with a Plasma Membrane Protein Isolation kit (MBL International Corp, Woburn, MA) based on an aqueous two-phase polymer system of dextran-polyethylene glycol, which isolates plasma membrane proteins specifically with minimal contamination from other intracellular membrane fractions (14Morre D.J. Morre D.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (950-954, 956-958): 946-948PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hong S. Wiley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). TRPV1/MOP HEK cells were incubated with the appropriate treatments in PSS at 37 °C for 20–30 min. Cells were placed on ice immediately, washed with ice-cold PBS, and 5–10 × 107 cells collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of the homogenization buffer included in the kit and briefly sonicated. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant collected for protein estimation. For each treatment group, an identical amount of supernatant protein was utilized to isolate purified plasma membrane fractions. The plasma membrane protein pellet was collected by centrifugation at 44,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in PBS for protein estimation. For [3H]resiniferatoxin binding to the TRPV1, the plasma membrane protein was diluted to 5 μg of plasma membrane protein/200 μl with assay buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml BSA and used fresh. Quantification of TRPV1 binding was performed by homologous competitive binding (16Matsuura B. Dong M. Naik S. Miller L.J. Onji M. J. Biol.

Nonspecific binding was defined as occurring in the presence of 1 μm non-radioactive resiniferatoxin. For total cell binding, 20 μg of protein was used, while for plasma membrane binding, 5 μg of purified plasma membrane fractions were sufficient. Using this protocol, nonspecific binding was generally below 10–20%, as previously reported (18Ross R.A. Gibson T.M. Brockie H.C. Leslie M. Pashmi G. Craib S.J. Di Marzo V. Pertwee R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by placing the assay mixtures on ice. Bound and free fractions were separated with a cell harvester on Whatman GF/B filters that had been soaked in filter buffer (composition: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.5% polyethyleneimine; pH 7.4) at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Samples were read on a liquid scintillation counter after incubation of the filter papers with ∼3 ml of liquid scintillant (OptiPhase HiSafe 3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature for 10–14 h. The analysis of radioligand binding data was performed using GraphPad Prism homologous competitive binding analysis with one class of binding sites. Determination of Cell Viability by MTS Assay—The viability of TRPV1/MOP HEK cells was determined using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Annandale, NSW, Australia) according to the manufacturer's specifications. In brief, cells were grown to ∼80–90% confluency on 96-well plates and treated with varying concentrations of dansylcadaverine in PSS for 30 min. After a wash with PSS, cells were incubated with the MTS reagent for another 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and absorbance measured at 490 nm with a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements—FRET signals from murine homomultimeric TRPV1 channels were determined as previously described (20Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a C-terminal Cerulean fluorescence protein-tagged TRPV1 construct (TRPV1-CFP) and a C-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescence protein-tagged TRPV1 construct (TRPV1-YFP) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Fluorescence imaging was carried out at room temperature 1–2 days after transfection using a fully automated inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-81). For spectroscopic FRET measurements from the plasma membrane, a spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 2150i) was used in conjunction with a Hamamatsu HQ CCD camera. Spectroscopic emission data specifically from the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm was collected by recording fluorescence intensity from the spectrograph slit location corresponding to each cellular structure as previously described (21Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was plotted as a function of the Cerulean to YFP fluorescence intensity ratio (Fc/Fy). Best fit FRET models were fitted to the data as previously described (20Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and were represented as solid or dotted lines. Immunofluorescence—TRPV1/MOP HEK cells were plated on 25-mm PDL-coated glass coverslips and grown to ∼80–90% confluence. Cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the appropriate reagents in PSS and placed immediately on ice to minimize receptor internalization. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS before a light fix with methanol/acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for 30 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X in PBS for 10 min, cells were blocked by immersion in PBS with 3% BSA for 30 min. Rabbit anti-rat TRPV1 primary antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was prepared in PBS containing 3% BSA. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300) under low light for 1 h. Cells were mounted using SlowFade AntiFade (Molecular Probes). Randomly selected images were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted fluorescent microscope (excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm) and recorded with MetaFluor (Molecular Devices) imaging software. Corel Photo-Paint (Corel, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) was used for processing of images. TRPV1 Expression in Calcium-rich Stores—As previously described (22Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), to assess TRPV1 expression in calcium-rich stores, the low affinity calcium probe Fura-FF was sequestered into intracellular stores by loading TRPV1/MOP HEK cells with Fura-FF-AM (12 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by washing with PSS for 15 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were transferred to the recording chamber of an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE 300 fluorescent microscope and viewed under a Nikon 40×/1.3 oil immersion objective lens. Fluorescence signals from single cells were ratio-imaged by recording emission intensity at 510 nm from excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Ratios of F340/F380 were depicted as pseudocolor images. Cells were then lightly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained for TRPV1 expression as described above. Assessment of TRPV1 Multimers and Immunofluorescence in DRG from Animals with Peripheral Inflammation—Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee and experiments carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Adult male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were kept in a controlled environment at a temperature of 22 ± 0.5 °C, relative humidity of 40–60%, and a 12 h (6:30 AM to 6:30 PM) light-dark cycle with free access to standard lab chow and tap water. To induce peripheral inflammation, 100 μl of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA, Sigma) was injected subcutaneously into the right hind paw under light isoflurane anesthesia. L5 DRGs ipsilateral to the inflamed paw were isolated 6–7 days after induction of inflammation. For analysis of TRPV1 multimerization in DRG neurons, individual L5 DRG were placed immediately in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences), minced with surgical scissors and sonicated on ice. Protein samples were collected after centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and 20 μg of protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. For immunofluorescence studies of plasma membrane TRPV1 expression, L5 DRG contralateral and ipsilateral to the inflamed paw were harvested and immediately fixed for 2–3 h in ice-cold paraformaldehyde (4%). DRGs were then transferred to 0.32 m sucrose and cryoprotected at 4 °C for at least 24 h. Tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), cut to 10-μm cryostat sections, and mounted on SuperFrost Ultra Plus® tissue adhesion slides (Menzel GmbH Co KG, Braunschweig, Germany) before immunofluorescence labeling as described above. Data Analysis—Unless otherwise states, all graphs are representative of at least two to three independent experiments with minimum n values for each treatment group being n = 3. Unless individual data points are shown, data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). As mentioned above, statistical analysis and fitting of 4-parameter Hill equations were carried out using GraphPad Prism Version 4.03. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 and determined using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test where appropriate. Calcium traces were analyzed by statistical comparison of maximum ΔF/F values using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. Capsaicin Responses Potentiated by cAMP-dependent PKA Are Inhibited by Morphine—Potentiation of TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ responses to addition of varying concentrations of capsaicin was assessed after a short (15 min) incubation with 0.1% DMSO (control) or forskolin (50 μm, Fig. 1A). Treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin leads to an increase in cellular cAMP levels and resultant activation of cAMP-dependent PKA. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 in turn causes sensitization of TRPV1 responses (23Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50080-50090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). While cAMP analogues acting directly at PKA lead to a similar sensitization, opioids, by virtue of their antihyperalgesic activity resulting from adenylate cyclase inhibition, are unable to prevent TRPV1 sensitization by direct PKA activators (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, to assess the opioid-sensitive mechanisms involved in TRPV1 sensitization by cAMP-dependent PKA, forskolin was used to potentiate TRPV1 responses. Consistent with previously described studies (12Vetter I. Wyse B.D. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Cabot P.J. Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), treatment with forskolin significantly increased TRPV1-mediated capsaicin responses (Fig. 1, A and B, p < 0.001). The (MOP) agonist morphine inhibited this potentiation (Fig. 1B) through inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, which was maximal at 1 μm morphine, although reversal of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by morphine was not complete (Fig. 1B, inset). We then focused on assessing the mechanism of potentiation of TRPV1 by forskolin. Treatment of TRPV1/MOP HEK Cells with the PKA Activator Forskolin Increases TRPV1 Multimerization—Augmentation of TRPV1 responses by forskolin (Fig. 1A) appears consistent with an increase in functional TRPV1 channels. However, it is unclear how forskolin could achieve an increase in functional TRPV1 channels in a way that would be consistent with rapid and dynamic regulation of nociceptive TRPV1 signaling. As functional TRPV1 channels are proposed to exist in homomultimeric form (14Morre D.J. Morre D.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (950-954, 956-958): 946-948PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dutertre S. Croker D.

H2S production in this organism has been proposed to occur via a three enzyme pathway, γ-glutamyltransferase, cysteinylglycinase (CGase), and cystalysin. In this study, we describe the purification and characterization of T. denticola CGase. Standard approaches were used to purify a 52-kDa CGase activity from T. denticola, and high pressure liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this molecule showed that it matches the amino acid sequence of a predicted 52-kDa protein in the T. denticola genome data base. A recombinant version of this protein was overexpressed in and purified from Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly) with the same kinetics as the native protein. Surprisingly, because sequence homology indicates that this protein is a member of a family of metalloproteases called M17 leucine aminopeptidases, the preferred substrate for the T. denticola protein is Cys-Gly (kcat/Km of 8.2 μm–1 min–1) not l-Leu-p-NA (kcat/Km of 1.1 μm–1 min–1). The activity of CGase for Cys-Gly is optimum at pH 7.3 and is enhanced by Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ but not by Zn2+ or Ca2+. Importantly, in combination with the two other previously purified T. denticola enzymes, γ-glutamyltransferase and cystalysin, CGase mediates the in vitro degradation of glutathione into the expected end products, including H2S. These results prove that T. denticola contains the entire three-step pathway to produce H2S from glutathione, which may be important for pathogenesis.

H2S can be produced from the metabolism of several molecules, but glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) is believed to be the major source for H2S production in the oral cavity; human cells, especially polymorphonuclear leucocytes, have high concentrations (up to 4 mm) of glutathione that can be released when host cells are damaged in the periodontal pocket. Although a number of oral bacteria have been tested, only a few of them are able to catabolize glutathione into H2S (3Persson S. Edlund M.B. Claesson R. Oral Microbiol.

Cystalysin (l-cysteine desulfhydrase) is a 46-kDa protein that converts l-cysteine into H2S, ammonia, and pyruvate. However, neither of these enzymes can utilize Cys-Gly as a substrate (18Chu L.

The T. denticola CGase is a 52-kDa protein that should be a leucyl aminopeptidase based upon its sequence homology to members of that protein family (31Seshadri R. Myers G.S. Tettelin H. Eisen J.A.

Characterization of a recombinant version of the T. denticola 52-kDa protein indicates that its preferred substrate is Cys-Gly, not leucine aminopeptides. The T. denticola CGase can, in combination with GGT and cystalysin from T. denticola, catalyze the production of H2S from glutathione in vitro, thus proving that the proposed three-step pathway for glutathione catabolism to H2Sin T. denticola is correct.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Bacterial StrainsUnless otherwise indicated, all of the chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. T. denticola 35404 and other treponema ATCC strains were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the clinic isolates were from Dr. Stanley Holt (32Weinberg A. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the bacteria used in this study were cultured anaerobically in a Coy anaerobic chamber (5% CO2, 10% H2, and 85%N2) at 37 °C in GM-1 broth (33Blakemore R.P. Canale-Parola E. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 616-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 3.4% rabbit serum.Enzyme AssaysThe standard reaction buffer for CGase assays was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) with 0.2 mm MnCl2. Protein samples were incubated in the reaction buffer with 2 mm Cys-Gly, unless another concentration is indicated, for 20 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of the reaction product, l-cysteine, produced was measured as described by Gaitonde (34Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). l-Cysteine concentrations, as the optical density at 560 nm, were calculated from a standard curve with known amounts of l-cysteine, after subtracting a blank.Leucine aminopeptidase activity was measured using l-Leu-p-NA as substrate (35Morty R.E. Morehead J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26057-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction was done in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 0.2 mm MnCl2 and 2 mm l-Leu-p-NA, unless noted otherwise. Enzyme was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before being stopped by cooling on ice. The concentration of the reaction product was measured by the absorbance at 405 nm. All of the enzyme assays were carried out in triplicate unless otherwise indicated.Fractionation and Purification of Native CGase from T. denticolaThe purification of the CGase activity from T. denticola 35404 was carried out in three steps.Step 1: Initial Enrichment of CGase—Briefly, whole cell pellets were diluted with PBS buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The cells were sonicated (Branson Cell Disrupter 200; Sonic Power Co.) for 3 min at maximum output at 4 °C. The soluble material was separated from cell and membrane debris by two consecutive centrifugations at 20,000 × g, 45 min. Stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation (2.0, 2.8, and 3.6 m ammonium sulfate) of the soluble cell fraction was then used to further enrich the CGase activity. The precipitate formed at 3.6 m ammonium sulfate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 15 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.02 mm Mn2+ (final concentrations) for 48 h with three changes of the same buffer.Step 2: Ultrafiltration by Microcon—Approximately 15 ml of the 3.6 m ammonium sulfate fraction (3.5 mg protein/ml) was applied to a Microcon 100 filter device and centrifuged at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The flow-through (<100-kDa proteins) was then put onto a Microcon 50 filter device and centrifuged to remove proteins smaller than 50 kDa and to concentrate the CGase activity. This material was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a large volume of the same buffer containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.2 mm Mn2+.Step 3: Purification by HiTrap Sepharose Q FF Ion Exchange Columns—After centrifugation, 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 15 min, of the dialysate from the previous step to remove precipitated protein, about 5 ml of sample was loaded into a 1-ml HiTrap Sepharose Q FF cation exchange column (GE Healthcare). Chromatography was carried out on a Beckman Coulter System Gold HPLC system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 5 min to remove unbound protein, and then the bound protein, including CGase, was eluted by a 0–0.5 m gradient of NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were monitored by a UV detector at 280 nm. The CGase activity eluted at about 0.18 m NaCl and was usually distributed across one to three fractions.Identification of the Purified T. denticola Protein with CGase ActivityThe three Coomassie-stained bands seen after the final purification step were excised from an SDS gel and identified, after digestion with trypsin, by capillary HPLC electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (36Thomas J.A. Hardies S.C. Rolando M. Hayes S. Lieman K. Carroll C.A. Weintraub S.T. Serwer P. Virology. 2007; 368: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting CID spectra were searched against the NCBI nr data base by means of Mascot (Matrix Science). Cross-correlation with X! Tandem and determination of probabilities of correct protein identification were done with Scaffold (Proteome Software).Cloning and Sequencing of the cga Gene and Purification of Recombinant CGase Protein from Escherichia coliCloning and Sequencing of the cga Gene in E. coli—Based upon the genomic DNA sequence of T. denticola strain 35405 (31Seshadri R. Myers G.S. Tettelin H. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Dodson R.J. Davidsen T.M. DeBoy R.T. Fouts D.E. Haft D.H. Selengut J. Ren Q. Brinkac L.M. Madupu R. Kolonay J. Durkin S.A. Daugherty S.C. Shetty J.

A. 2004; 101: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), two primers, (forward, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGAAATTTAATATTGCAAAAAAAG-3′; reverse: 5′-GGGGTACCATATTTGCTTCCCTGCGGC-3′) were designed to amplify the entire TDE0300 open reading frame, which we will refer to as cga, and to put an XhoI site (forward) and KpnI site (reverse) at the ends of the PCR product. With T. denticola 35404 genomic DNA as template, a 1.6-kb fragment was amplified by PCR, using standard protocols, and ligated into the XhoI/KpnI sites of the expression vector pRsetA (Invitrogen). The insert from a plasmid containing the cga gene of strain 35404 was sequenced, independently from both strands, in the Center for Advanced DNA Technology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.Expression and Purification of Recombinant CGase—To express recombinant CGase, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added to a culture of E. coli cells containing the expression plasmid. After 4 h, the bacterial culture was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min, and the cells were washed once using 20 mm PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were resuspended in 60 ml of PBS and sonicated (Branson Sonifier 450, VWR Scientific) for 5 min on ice. The soluble fraction of the cell sonicate was recovered after centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 30 min. Because the recombinant CGase has a His6 tag, it was purified on a 2.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gel column (Qiagen). After loading 15 ml of the soluble cell material onto the column, it was washed with 20× volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. A step gradient elution with imidazole (40–250 mm in the wash buffer) was used to elute the CGase. The identity of the purified recombinant CGase was confirmed by HPLC ESI-MS/MS as described above for the native protein.Enzymatic Properties of the T. denticola CGase ProteinDetermination of Optimal pH—The effect of pH on CGase activity was determined in the standard reaction buffer, except the pH was varied from pH 5.0 to 9.5 in ∼0.3 to 0.5 pH units. CGase (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) and either 2 mm Cys-Gly or l-Leu-p-NA were added, and the reaction was done at 37 °C for 10 min.Substrate Specificity—To assess the substrate specificity profile of the T. denticola 52-kDa CGase, its activity with a number of different substrates was measured in the standard reaction buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. At the end of the reaction, the concentrations of the appropriate products, l-cysteine, glycine, H2S, pyruvate, or ammonia, were determined (12Chu L. Dong Z. Xu X. Cappelli D. Ebersole J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1113-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 38Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L.

Mosby Company, St. Louis, MO1974: 399-401Google Scholar). Because the pH optima could vary for different substrates, each substrate was tested at two different pH values. Initially, each substrate was used at a concentration of 2 mm; if there was enzyme activity at that concentration, then enzyme activity was measured over a range of substrate concentrations. The Km, Vmax, and kcat values were calculated as previously described (25Kurzben G.P. Chu L. Ebersole J.L. Holt S.C. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 14: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Effect of Cations on CGase Activity—For this set of reactions, the control reaction contained 5 μg/ml (final concentration) of purified recombinant CGase with 2 mm Cys-Gly in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.2 mm MnCl2 and was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. To see whether metal ions were required for enzyme activity, 0.2 mm EDTA was added to one set of tubes. To determine which cations were best at enhancing activity, 2 mm of different cations, MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, CoCl2, or ZnCl2, were preincubated separately with the enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) for 20 min at 37 °C, and then 2 mm Cys-Gly was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 20 min.Antibody Preparation and Immunodepletion of CGase from T. denticola LysateAntibody against the purified recombinant CGase was produced in New Zealand White rabbits (100 μg of purified protein mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant/each injection) as described previously (18Chu L. Ebersole J.L. Kurzben G.P. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-CGase IgG (20 mg) was purified, coupled to activated Sepharose 4B (40Chu L. Kong X. Shao J. Lee M. Xie J. Shanghai J. Immunol. 1986; 6: 243-248Google Scholar), and resuspended in 6 ml of distilled H2O. For immunodepletion, 1 × 1010 T. denticola cells were lysed by 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 2 mm β-ME and 0.2 mm MnCl2. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. One ml of the soluble material was combined with 0.3 ml of anti-CGase-IgG-Sepharose 4B and mixed gently by shaking at 25 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected for analysis of CGase activity. Bacterial lysate that was not put over the Sepharose 4B column and cell supernatant that was depleted on a Sepharose 4B column that had been coupled to preimmune serum IgG were used as controls.Analysis of CGase Enzyme Activity and Gene Distribution in Other T. denticola StrainsAfter 2 days of growth in an anaerobic chamber, cells of various Treponema strains were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and then assayed, at 1 mg protein/ml, for CGase activity. To see whether the cga gene was present in other strains of T. denticola or in other bacteria, genomic DNA was isolated from isolated from several T. denticola, Treponema vincentii, and E. coli strains. The DNAs were used as templates for PCR. Two primers, the forward primer (5′-ATGAAATTTAATATTGCAAAAAAAG-3′), which starts exactly at the first codon of the cga open reading frame, and the reverse primer (5′-ATATTTGCTTCCCTGCGGC-3′), which is 18 bases after the end of the cga open reading frame, were used for DNA amplification using standard reaction conditions.Reconstituting Glutathione Catabolism in vitroRecombinant T. denticola GGT and cystalysin were purified from E. coli cells with the appropriate expression clones, as previously described (18Chu L. Ebersole J.L. Kurzben G.P. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chu L. Xu X. Dong Z. Cappelli D. Ebersole J.D. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified CGase, GGT, and cystalysin, either alone or in various combinations, were added to the standard reaction buffer so that the final concentration of each enzyme was 2 μg/ml. Glutathione was added (final concentration, 2 mm), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched on ice, and then the production of H2S, ammonia, pyruvate, glutamic acid/glutamine and glycine was determined (12Chu L. Dong Z. Xu X. Cappelli D. Ebersole J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1113-11207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 38Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L.

Mosby Company, St. Louis, MO1974: 399-401Google Scholar). As a control, T. denticola 35404 cells, at a final concentration of 0.5 mg protein/ml, were also incubated with 2 mm glutathione under the same conditions as the purified proteins.RESULTSPurification of Cysteinylglycinase from T. denticola—We have proposed that glutathione is catabolized by a three-step pathway in T. denticola and have previously identified and characterized the enzymes involved in steps 1 and 3. However, the T. denticola enzyme (CGase) involved in the proposed second step, cleavage of Cys-Gly into glycine and l-cysteine, has not been identified. To rectify this, we first showed that sonicated extracts of T. denticola strain ATCC 35404 had CGase activity (Table 1). The protein responsible for this activity was then purified more than 120-fold with a 7.5% yield of the initial total enzyme activity. Almost all of the enzyme activity was found in one fraction from the final HPLC ion exchange purification (Fig. 1a). This fraction contained one major protein band, with an approximate molecular mass of 52 kDa, on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1b) and two minor protein bands with molecular masses of 35 and 19 kDa.TABLE 1Purification of CGase from T. denticola 35404FractionationsTotal proteinEnzymatic activityYield of proteinRetained activitymgmmol/mg/min%%Whole cell sonicated425.51.3100.0100Soluble cell fraction250.21.958.8852.8-3.6 m ASP precipitation81.44.519.166Microcon cut-off (50-100 kDa)50.538.2511.949Second HiTrap Q FF column0.25165.40.057.5 Open table in a new tab To determine which of the three proteins was most likely to be the CGase, the three protein species were digested in situ with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were subjected to HPLC ESI-MS/MS analysis. The tandem mass spectra obtained from the 52-kDa major protein band had a significant match to the amino acid sequence of a predicted 52-kDa protein (Gene ID TDE0300) in the genomic data base of T. denticola strain 35405 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) (31Seshadri R.

The two minor protein bands (19 and 35 kDa) also matched up with a part of the amino acid sequence of the predicted TDE0300 protein, suggesting that they are proteolytic fragments of the full-length protein. We concluded that the 52-kDa protein encoded by TDE0300 has CGase activity.Cloning, Sequencing, and Analysis of the 52-kDa CGase Gene of T. denticola—To prove that the correct protein had been identified as a cysteinylglycinase, it is easiest to clone its gene, which we will refer to as cga, in E. coli so that the recombinant gene product can be overexpressed and shown to have CGase activity. To accomplish this, the gene encoding the 52-kDa protein first had to be cloned and sequenced, because we identified the protein in a strain (strain 35404) different from the one whose genome has been sequenced (strain 35405). Thus, PCR with primers designed from the known sequence of strain 35405 (31Seshadri R. Myers G.S. Tettelin H. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Dodson R.J. Davidsen T.M. DeBoy R.T. Fouts D.E. Haft D.H.

This PCR fragment, which contains the entire cga gene, was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame of the T. denticola 35404 cga gene consists of 1428 bp encoding 476 amino acids (predicted molecular mass of 52.2 kDa).

Several members of human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) have been implicated in semen liquefaction, functioning through highly regulated proteolytic cascades. Among these, KLK3 (also known as prostate-specific antigen) is the main executor enzyme responsible for processing of the primary components of semen coagulum, semenogelins I and II. We have recently identified KLK14 as a potential activator of KLK3 and other KLKs. This study aims to elucidate the cascade-mediated role of KLK14 ex vivo. KLK14 expression was significantly lower (p = 0.0252) in individuals with clinically delayed liquefaction. Concordantly, KLK14 expression was significantly (p = 0.0478) lower in asthenospermic cases. Specific inhibition of KLK14 activity by the synthetic inhibitor ACTG9 resulted in a significant delay in semen liquefaction, a drop in the “early” (30 min postejaculation) “chymotrypsin-like” and KLK1 activity, and an increase in the “late” (90 min postejaculation) chymotrypsin-like activity. Conversely, the addition of recombinant active KLK14 facilitated the liquefaction process, augmented the early chymotrypsin-like activity, and lowered late chymotrypsin-like activity. Given that the observed chymotrypsin-like activity was almost completely attributed to KLK3 activity, KLK3 seems to be regulated bidirectionally. Accordingly, a higher level of KLK3 fragmentation was observed in KLK14-induced coagula, suggesting an inactivation mechanism via internal cleavage. Finally, semenogelins I and II were directly cleaved by KLK14. Semenogelins were also able to reverse KLK14 inhibition by Zn2+, providing a novel regulatory mechanism for KLK14 activity. Our results show that KLK14 exerts a significant and dose-dependent effect in the process of semen liquefaction.

Our results show that KLK14 exerts a significant and dose-dependent effect in the process of semen liquefaction. Spermatogenesis, the process of differentiation of testicular stem cells into mature spermatozoa, is initiated in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, which produce immature sperm cells (1Hinrichsen-Kohane A.C.

Subsequent maturation occurs during epididymal transition, where immature spermatozoa acquire motility and fertilizing capacity (4Cosentino M.J. Cockett A.T. Urol.

Sperm motility is particularly important at the time of fertilization, since it facilitates sperm penetration to the zona pellucida of the oocyte and fusion of the two cells (1Hinrichsen-Kohane A.C.

Asthenospermia, described as impaired sperm motility, is considered as one of the main factors of male subfertility or infertility and may be caused by a number of conditions, including incomplete liquefaction, delayed liquefaction, or nonliquefaction of semen (7Mikhailichenko V.V.

Normally, human semen coagulates spontaneously upon mixing of its various glandular fractions in order to form a depository of spermatozoa in the rear vaginal cavity (10Lwaleed B.A. Goyal A.

Subsequent liquefaction of coagulum within minutes (∼5–20 min after ejaculation) allows for a progressive release of motile spermatozoa (10Lwaleed B.A. Goyal A. Delves G.H. Cooper A.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2007; 33: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Daunter B. Hill R. Hennessey J. Mackay E.V. Andrologia. 1981; 13: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Liquefaction is achieved through a stepwise proteolytic cleavage of the gel proteins semenogelin I and II (SgI and -II) into soluble proteins, followed by their peptidic fragmentation. These peptides are eventually degraded into their constituent amino acid residues (14Koren E. Lukac J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1979; 56: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Lukac J.

Abrahamsson P.A. Lundwall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Semen coagulation/liquefaction is under tight regulatory control. For instance, Sg proteins chelate with the excess of free Zn2+ immediately after ejaculation and undergo structural modifications, inducing aggregate complex formation (19Polak B. Daunter B. Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Reprod. Biol. 1990; 35: 223-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20de Lamirande E. Semin. Thromb.

Biomed. Anal. 1994; 12: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sg degradation is mainly modulated through activation of KLK3 (kallikrein-related peptidase 3), also known as prostate-specific antigen (22Lilja H. Oldbring J. Rannevik G. Laurell C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 24Lilja H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 25Robert M. Gibbs B.F. Jacobson E. Gagnon C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3811-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of KLK3 is tightly controlled through a number of endogenous inhibitors and regulatory feedback loops. For instance, along with Sg proteins, the serine protease inhibitor, protein C inhibitor, is secreted from the lumen of seminal vesicles (26Kise H. Nishioka J. Kawamura J. Suzuki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that protein C inhibitor complexes with Sg, preventing its premature hydrolysis by active KLK3 (27Suzuki K. Kise H. Nishioka J. Hayashi T. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2007; 33: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). KLK3 activity is believed to be further inhibited by free Zn2+ in prostatic secretions (25Robert M. Gibbs B.F. Jacobson E. Gagnon C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3811-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Jonsson M. Linse S. Frohm B. Lundwall A. Malm J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sg chelation with free Zn2+ results in an immediate drop in the available Zn2+, which consequently leads to KLK3 activation. Conversely, Zn2+ is released gradually as Sg proteins are fragmented by KLK3. The increased level of Zn2+ serves as a negative feedback loop to prevent excessive proteolysis that may damage the integrity of spermatozoa (29Robert M. Gagnon C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 944-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates an additional level of complexity in the regulation of the proteolytic cleavage of Sg proteins. For instance, in vitro data suggest that other proteases, particularly other members of the kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) 2The abbreviations used are: KLK, human kallikrein-related peptidase; ACT, antichymotrypsin; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; pNA, para-nitroanilide; Sg, semenogelin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Suc, succinyl; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. family (i.e. KLK2 and KLK5), are directly or indirectly involved in Sg processing (30Deperthes D.

Oncol. 2007; 1: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, emerging reports suggest a cascade-mediated protease activation mechanism, regulated by a number of positive and negative feedback loops. For example, KLK5 is suggested to autoactivate and, in turn, activate pro-KLK3 (33Michael I.P. Sotiropoulou G. Pampalakis G. Magklara A. Ghosh M. Wasney G. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14628-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Likewise, although still controversial, KLK2 has been suggested to activate pro-KLK3 (34Kumar A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Goel A.S. Millar L.S. Saedi M.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3111-3114PubMed Google Scholar, 35Vaisanen V. Lovgren J. Hellman J. Piironen T. Lilja H. Pettersson K.

Prostate. 2001; 48: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, our recent work implicates KLK14 as a potential activator of pro-KLK3 as well as several other seminal pro-KLKs (i.e. pro-KLK1 and pro-KLK11) (37Emami N. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3031-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Characteristic to classic proteolytic cascades, we have previously proposed a bidirectional regulatory mechanism of KLK3, in which KLK14-mediated activation is followed by inactivation via internal cleavage of active KLK3 at position Lys145 (37Emami N. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3031-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). KLK14 is a trypsin-like KLK, with preference over P1-Arg (38Borgono C.A. Michael I.P. Shaw J.L. Luo L.Y. Ghosh M.C. Soosaipillai A. Grass L. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol.

Zinc ions have been shown to strongly inhibit KLK14 enzymatic activity (38Borgono C.A. Michael I.P. Shaw J.L. Luo L.Y. Ghosh M.C. Soosaipillai A. Grass L. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol.

In an attempt to delineate a possible function of KLK14 in seminal plasma, this study examines the interaction between this enzyme and other potential components of the seminal proteolytic cascade involved in semen liquefaction. Reagents—The synthetic substrates, Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA·HCl (RPY-pNA) and Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC (PFR-AMC)/Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC (QAR-AMC) were purchased from BACHEM (King of Prussia, PA) and Pharmacia Hepar-Chromogenix (Franklin, OH), respectively. Recombinant pro-KLK3 produced in Escherichia coli, was a gift from Spectral Diagnostic Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Mouse anti-KLK3 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Medix MAB (Kauniainen, Finland). Recombinant KLK1, -4, -5, -11, -12, and -14; KLK14-specific monoclonal (clone 2E9); and rabbit anti-KLK14/KLK3 polyclonal sera were produced in house, as described previously (38Borgono C.A. Michael I.P. Shaw J.L. Luo L.Y. Ghosh M.C. Soosaipillai A. Grass L. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2405-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant KLK2 was a gift from Hybritech Inc. (San Diego, CA). Conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and chemiluminescent substrate for Western blot were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and Diagnostic Products Corp., respectively. N-Hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads were purchased from GE Healthcare. HUK-IgG antibody recognizing KLK1 and purified Sg proteins were kindly provided by Prof. J. Chao (Medical University of South Carolina) and Dr. J. Malm (Malmö University Hospital, Sweden), respectively. ACTG9, a KLK14-specific recombinant mutant inhibitor, was developed in collaboration with Dr. D. Deperthes (Med-Discovery) by replacing the scissile bond of the reactive center loop of the α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) inhibitor with KLK14 phage display-selected G9 (TVDYA) substrate, as described in detail elsewhere (40Felber L.M.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2505-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Materials—Coagulated semen, having a normal liquefaction rate at room temperature, was collected, split into three fractions, and frozen immediately after ejaculation in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80 °C until required. Liquefied semen was obtained from 95 subjects with normal and delayed liquefaction, under informed consent and approval by the Institutional Review Boards of Mount Sinai Hospital and the University Health Network. If required, semen coagula were artificially emulsified, by the addition of a small amount of chymotrypsin enzyme at 37 °C for up to 1 h. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The expression level of KLK14 protein was measured using a sandwich type ELISA, with a mouse monoclonal/rabbit polyclonal configuration, as described previously (38Borgono C.A. Michael I.P. Shaw J.L. Luo L.Y. Ghosh M.C. Soosaipillai A. Grass L. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, 500 ng/well of the monoclonal antibody against KLK14 (clone 2E9), diluted in coating buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, 0.05% sodium azide (pH 7.8)), was immobilized on a 96-well white polystyrene plate overnight at room temperature. The plate was subsequently washed two times with washing buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.8)). Seminal plasma samples were diluted 1:10 in assay buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, 6% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat IgG, 2% mouse IgG, 1% bovine IgG, 0.5 mol/liter KCl, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.8) and were loaded and incubated for 2 h with shaking at room temperature. The plate was then washed six times. 100 μl of rabbit anti-KLK14 polyclonal sera, diluted 1000-fold in assay buffer, were added and incubated for 1 h. The plate was washed six times and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (3000-fold dilution) for 45 min. Finally, diflunisal phosphate (100 μl of a 1 mm solution) in substrate buffer (0.1 mol/liter Tris, pH 9.1, 0.1 mol/liter NaCl, and 1 mmol/liter MgCl2) was added to each well and incubated for 10 min, followed by the addition of developing solution (100 μl, containing 1 mol/liter Tris base, 0.4 mol/liter NaOH, 2 mmol/liter TbCl3, and 3 mmol/liter EDTA) for 1 min. The resultant fluorescence was measured with a time-resolved fluorometer (Envision; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Similarly, the expression levels of KLK1, -2, -4, -5, -11, and -12 were measured using highly specific ELISAs, developed in house and described previously (41Shaw J.L. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 2007; 53: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Measurement of Clinical Parameters of Semen—Liquefaction rate was estimated by attempting to draw the specimen into a Pasteur pipette. Complete liquefaction was achieved when all of the fluid entered the pipette. In addition, liquefaction level was evaluated visually by a phase-contrast microscope as a measure of disappearance of the gel-like coagulum structure. Overall sperm motility (percentage) was determined using automated computer-assisted semen analysis as (a + b/(a + b + c)) × 100, where a, b, and c represent the number of progressively motile sperm, sperms moving in random directions, and nonmotile sperms, respectively. Cases with a percentage of sperm motility equal to or less than 35% were considered as asthenospermic. Cleavage of SgI and -II Proteins—500 ng of purified SgI and SgII were incubated individually with 56 ng of KLK14 in 30 μl of KLK14 optimal assay buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for various time points. Reactions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Gels were silver-stained to visualize fragmentation. Sg-mediated Reversal of Zn2+ Inhibition—To examine Sg-mediated reversal of Zn2+ inhibition, 12 nm KLK14 was incubated with 0 and 120 nm of Zn2+ (in the form of zinc acetate), at a final volume of 100 μl, for 10 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the fluorogenic substrate QAR-AMC was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. Fluorescence release was measured on a Wallac Victor fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), set at 355 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission. Fluorescence was measured for a total of 20 min. Five minutes after initiating the read, a 0.05 μm concentration each of SgI and SgII or 0.01 m EDTA was added to each well. Measurement was resumed as described above. Background fluorescence was subtracted from raw values. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Enzyme Activity Assays—The “chymotrypsin-like” activity of seminal plasma samples (diluted 10 times) was kinetically examined, using 0.8 mm colorimetric substrate RPY-pNA in a final volume of 100 μl of KLK3-optimized assay buffer (0.1 mm Tris, 3 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5). Absorbance was measured on a Wallac Victor Fluorometer at 405 nm. Background absorbance was subtracted from raw values of seminal plasma alone, and samples were treated with either active recombinant KLK14 or ACTG9, described above. Reactions were repeated three times. KLK1-specific activity was measured by fluorescence release of the pulled down KLK1 protein, as previously described (37Emami N. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3031-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ng of KLK1-specific polyclonal antibody (HUK-IgG) were immobilized on a 96-well white polystyrene plate overnight. The plate was washed two times prior to the addition of reaction mixtures. KLK1 activity was measured as an increase in the fluorescence of PFR-AMC substrate after 2 h of sample incubation. Reaction rates (fluorescence units/min) correspond to the slope of the fluorescence release-time plot. KLK3 Depletion from Seminal Plasma—1 mg of monoclonal anti-KLK3 antibody was immobilized on 1 ml of 50% N-Hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose Fast Flow bead slurry, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, beads were equilibrated three times in 2 ml of ice-cold 1 mm HCl. They were then incubated with 1 mg of monoclonal anti-prostate-specific antigen antibody for 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. Residual active groups of beads were subsequently blocked by washing beads sequentially three times with 2 ml each of buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and buffer B (0.1 m acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0). Beads were further washed two times with buffer A and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Further blocking was achieved by sequential incubation of beads three times each with buffer B, A, and B. Beads were equilibrated for protein binding in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). 20 μl of seminal plasma were diluted in TBS in total volume of 1 ml and incubated with beads for 1 h at room temperature, with end-over-end mixing. The flow-through (depleted samples) was collected and further analyzed kinetically. Beads were washed five times in wash buffer (TBS with 2 m urea, pH 7.5) and eluted with 1 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine with 2 m urea, pH 3.0). A mock-depleted sample was prepared in parallel, using beads alone. Percentage of depletion was estimated by measuring KLK3 in flow-through samples, using KLK3-specific ELISA. Collected flow-through samples were concentrated 10 times, using membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 5000. 5 μl of concentrated samples were diluted in 95 μl of KLK3 optimal assay buffer. Enzymatic activity toward the tripeptide RPY-pNA substrate was measured as described above. To ensure that the observed drop of enzymatic activity is due to exclusive depletion of KLK3, two identical reactions of 20 μl of immunodepleted and mock-depleted elutions were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. One gel was silver-stained, and the other was immunoblotted with anti-KLK3 antibody as described below. Western Blotting for Identification of KLK3 Fragmentation in Seminal Plasma—To monitor KLK14-mediated fragmentation of KLK3 ex vivo, semen coagula were spiked for 1 h to various amounts of active recombinant KLK14 and were analyzed by Western blot. Similarly, KLK14-mediated fragmentation of pro-KLK3 was reconfirmed in vitro by incubating recombinant pro-KLK3 with active KLK14 at a 10:1 molar ratio for varying times, in a total volume of 30 μl. Recombinant and seminal proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, using the NuPAGE Bis-Tris, with 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 45 min and transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) at 30 V for 1 h. The membrane was subsequently blocked for 1 h with 5% milk/TBS-Tween (0.1 mol/liter Tris-HCl containing 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C and probed using rabbit anti-KLK3 polyclonal sera (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times for 15 min with TBS-Tween and treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:8000) for 45 min at room temperature. The membrane was rewashed as above, and fluorescence was detected on x-ray film using a chemiluminescent substrate. Clinical Association between KLK14 Expression and Liquefaction Rate—KLK14 concentration in seminal plasma from 95 volunteers (including 34 normal cases and 61 patients with delayed liquefaction) ranged from 0.2 to 181.2 μg/liter, with a mean of 13.2 μg/liter and a median of 6.8 μg/liter. The expression level of KLK14 had a median of 5.2 and 11.55 μg/liter and mean of 12.38 and 12.99 μg/liter in samples with delayed and normal liquefaction, respectively (Fig. 1A). We concluded that KLK14 levels were significantly decreased (p = 0.0252) in the patient group with delayed liquefaction. In addition, KLK14 expression was found to be significantly (p = 0.0478) lower in 70 asthenospermic patients (15 cases with undetermined or inconclusive percentage motility were excluded from the study) (Fig. 1B). The level of KLK14 was dropped to 9.8 μg/liter (mean) and 7.9 μg/liter (median) in asthenospermic cases, as compared with normal individuals with a mean value of 22.5 μg/liter and a median of 13.4 μg/liter. Role of KLK14 as a Seminal Liquefying Protease—To further investigate the possible role of KLK14 in semen liquefaction, the proteolytic activity of the enzyme in seminal plasma was induced and reciprocally inhibited by using either active recombinant KLK14 or the highly specific KLK14 inhibitor ACTG9, respectively. Complete liquefaction ranged from 10 to 20 min in normal samples. The addition of ACTG9 inhibitor to a split fraction of a normal ejaculate sample strongly delayed liquefaction (≥30 min). As expected, the progression of liquefaction was also reduced in inhibitor-treated samples, since the gel-like coagulum structure persisted longer than their untreated control counterparts (Fig. 2). Conversely, liquefaction was accelerated upon the addition of active recombinant KLK14. The gel-like structure of semen coagula seemed to be less dense in KLK14-induced samples (Fig. 2). The coagula of normal liquefying ejaculates were dissolved too fast; for this reason, we could not determine the effect of KLK14 on liquefaction rate. Cleavage of Sg Proteins by KLK14—Given the pronounced effect of KLK14 on semen liquefaction, we next examined whether any of the primary components of semen coagulum function as immediate downstream targets of KLK14. The ability of KLK14 to cleave purified SgI and -II proteins was tested. SgI and -II were incubated with active recombinant KLK14 in separate reactions. KLK14 was able to almost fully cleave both SgI and -II, as quickly as 12 min of incubation (Fig. 3). New fragments were generated as early as 2 min after initiation of the reaction. Reversal of Zn2+ Inhibition by SgI and -II—Zn2+ has previously been proposed to function as a cationic protease inhibitor of KLK14 (38Borgono C.A. Michael I.P. Shaw J.L. Luo L.Y. Ghosh M.C. Soosaipillai A. Grass L. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2405-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, SgI and -II can indirectly regulate the activity of a number of KLKs by binding to Zn2+ molecules, rendering them unable to inhibit KLK activity. To examine whether Sg proteins have the same effect on Zn2+-mediated inhibition of KLK14, KLK14 was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of Zn2+. The enzymatic activity of KLK14 was monitored kinetically as above. The addition of SgII after 5 min of initiation of the reaction rapidly reversed the inhibition (Fig. 4), suggesting a common regulatory mechanism with several other seminal KLKs. No such effect was observed for SgI (data not shown). Correlation between KLK14 and the Chymotrypsin-like Activity—Pro-KLK3 was previously proposed to function downstream of KLK14 in vitro (37Emami N. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3031-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is no tool currently available to specifically quantitate KLK3 enzymatic activity in complex biological samples, such as seminal plasma. However, given, KLK3 shows preference to substrates with P1-tyrosine, P2-proline, and P3-arginine. Given that KLK3 is the major chymotrypsin-like enzyme in seminal plasma and its preferential substrate recognition, we reasoned that KLK3 activity could accurately be estimated in seminal plasma by measuring the chymotrypsin activity toward the RPY-pNA substrate. To corroborate this assumption, a series of ex vivo depletion experiments were performed. Seminal plasma with ∼95% depleted KLK3 exhibited almost zero activity toward the RPY tripeptide substrate, as compared with the mock-depleted control (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition, eluted samples of depleted and mock controls were examined by silver stain and Western blotting against KLK3 (supplemental Fig. 1B). All of the proteins eluted from the immunodepleted sample were successfully identified as full-length KLK3 or KLK3 fragmen"

Src activity is also elevated in the majority of malignant and premalignant tumors of the colon. The development of fibroblasts with the three ubiquitously expressed kinases deleted (SYF cells) has identified the role of Src proteins in the regulation of actin dynamics associated with increased cell migration and invasion. Despite this, unexpectedly nothing is known about the role of the individual Src kinases on intestinal cell cytoskeleton and/or cell migration. We have previously reported that villin, an epithelial cell-specific actin-modifying protein that regulates actin reorganization, cell morphology, cell migration, cell invasion, and apoptosis, is tyrosine-phosphorylated. In this report using the SYF cells reconstituted individually with c-Src, c-Yes, c-Fyn, and wild type or phosphorylation site mutants of villin, we demonstrate for the first time the absolute requirement for c-Src in villin-induced regulation of cell migration. The other major finding of our study is that contrary to previous reports, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Jak3 (Janus kinase 3), does not regulate phosphorylation of villin or villin-induced cell migration and is, in fact, not expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Further, we identify SHP-2 and PTP-PEST (protein-tyrosine phosphatase proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich sequence) as negative regulators of c-Src kinase and demonstrate a new function for these phosphatases in intestinal cell migration. Together, these data suggest that in colorectal carcinogenesis, elevation of c-Src or down-regulation of SHP-2 and/or PTP-PEST may promote cancer metastases and invasion by regulating villin-induced cell migration and cell invasion.

Src proteins play a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of normal intestinal epithelial cells (1Cartwright C.A. Mamajiwalla S. Skolnick S.A. Eckhart W. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar). In the normal intestinal mucosa, proliferative, undifferentiated cells at the base of the crypts express high c-Src activity; in contrast, differentiated cells at the tips of intestinal villi show decreased c-Src activity (1Cartwright C.A. Mamajiwalla S. Skolnick S.A. Eckhart W. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Deregulation of Src leads to constitutive kinase activity, which also leads to cellular transformation (2Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cancer. 2002; 94: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The risk of colon cancer is particularly high in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and elevated c-Src activity has also been noted in neoplastic ulcerative colitis epithelia (6Cartwright C.A. Coad C.A. Egbert B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although up-regulation of c-Yes is less frequent, it has been noted in about 50% of colorectal carcinomas (7Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A.

Despite the fact that there is considerable evidence associating aberrant Src activation in the development and progression of colorectal cancer, and although inhibitors of Src family kinases have entered phase I clinical trials as anticancer agents, surprisingly few investigations have analyzed the consequences of Src activation on intestinal epithelial cell function (11Summy J.M. Gallick G.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1398-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Metastasis is the most lethal property of cancer cells, and critical to this is the increased migratory state of tumor cells. One of the major functions of Src kinases is to modulate the actin cytoskeleton that controls cell migration (12Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). c-Src kinase activity is required for growth factor-induced migration and scattering of epithelial cells (13Emami S. Le Floch N.

Turley E.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2213-2224PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cells deficient in all three Src kinases are unable to migrate into a wound (17Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These studies imply a general role for Src proteins in actin assembly and turnover. However, the exact mechanism by which Src proteins induce remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown. Critical biological processes, such as cellular migration, require a coordinated and constant remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that necessitates the concomitant action of antagonistic enzymes.

Because of structural and functional redundancy among the Src proteins, the role of the individual Src proteins in the function of villin have not been determined unambiguously. The major finding of this study is the identification of the molecular mechanism, namely the stimulatory and inhibitory mechanisms, for the regulation of cell migration by c-Src kinase activation. Our findings provide the first evidence that active c-Src kinase and not c-Yes or c-Fyn directs the phosphorylation of an epithelial cell-specific actin-binding protein, villin, thus guiding cell migration. Our study also demonstrates that the phosphorylation status of villin, which is determined by c-Src kinase activation, can be regulated by inactivation of c-Src catalytic activity by the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-2 and PTP-PEST. In addition, our study provides detailed analysis of the expression of Jak3 in intestinal epithelial cell lines and tissue and disproves previous descriptions of Jak3 expression in intestinal tumor cell lines. Data presented in this report provide a biochemical and cellular model that may help to explain these and other cases of changes in actin dynamics and cell motility by Src activation.

Confluent monolayers were scraped with a sharp blade across the diameter of the well, and images were obtained at the initial time of wounding and at various times postwounding by using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope equipped with a CoolSnap ES charge-coupled device camera, an Optiscan motorized stage system, and an Intel Pentium IV computer with Metamorph image analysis software. Images were collected by programming the x, y, and z coordinates of each wound location, allowing the stage to return to the precise location of the original wound. Cell migration was measured by determining the distance moved (in μm) from the original wound margin 12 or 24 h postwounding, depending on the cell type used. Data were normalized to control values (set as 100) and expressed as percentage change in migration compared with control. For Caco-2 cell migration, control refers to cell migration 24 h post-wounding in the absence of any inhibitors and infected with Ad-EGFP. For all other cell types used in this study, control refers to cell migration 12 h postwounding in cells transfected/infected with vector in the absence of inhibitors. Caco-2 cell migration was measured in the presence of mitomycin C (50 μg/ml). Cell Invasion Assay—HeLa Tet-Off cells stably transfected with villin as described before (32Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were plated in 6-well invasion chambers coated with Matrigel (1 × 105 cells/well). Hepatocyte growth factor (50% conditioned media from MRC-5 cell culture supernatant) was added to the lower chamber, and cells were incubated overnight. Cells that had transmigrated to the lower surface of the membrane were stained using DIFF-Quick, and a total of 20 fields per filter were examined for each cell type. Cell invasion was measured in the absence or presence of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (100 nm). In addition, cell invasion was measured in HeLa cells that were infected with adenovirus to overexpress either DN c-Src or vector alone, essentially as described before (32Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin redistributes to the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the plasma membrane (31Tomar A. George S. Kansal P. Wang Y. Khurana S. J. Biol.

Hence, SYF or SYF cells expressing full-length or mutant villin protein and/or the specific tyrosine kinase/phosphatase were extracted in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl. Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin, c-Src, c-Yes, c-Fyn, Jak3, and Syk2, were immunoprecipitated from the detergent-soluble extracts essentially as described before (31Tomar A. George S. Kansal P. Wang Y. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31972-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase/Phosphatase Assay—To determine if the transfected kinases were catalytically active, the kinases were immunoprecipitated from SYF/c-Src, SYF/c-Yes, SYF/c-Fyn, and SYF/Jak3 cells, respectively, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously in the absence or presence of the appropriate substrate, enolase (0.125 mg/ml) for the Src kinases and recombinant GST-γc (2 μg) for Jak3 (42Narisawa-Saito M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2271-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant villin was tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro using recombinant c-Src kinase, recombinant Jak3, or by immunoprecipitating the specific kinase from transfected/infected SYF cells, as described previously (37Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure dephosphorylation of villin, recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated villin was prepared as described before (37Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated villin was incubated with either immunoprecipitated SHP-2 or PTP-PEST in buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling the sample with Laemmli buffer. Control experiments were done by incubating recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated villin with alkaline phosphatase (2.5 units). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrates was determined by Western analysis using a phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20). To measure the phosphatase activity in SYF cells infected with SHP-2 or PTP-PEST, both phosphatases were immunoprecipitated from these cells, and the activity was measured in phosphate buffer using 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. Phosphatase activity was terminated by the addition of 0.2 n NaOH. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. A molar absorption constant of 18,330 m-1 cm-1 was used to determine the amount of p-nitrophenol released. Immunohistochemistry—C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed, and the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon were removed and fixed in 3.7% buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded sections of 5-μm thickness were prepared and immunostained for Jak3. A negative control lacking the primary antibody was included in each assay. Total RNA and RT-PCR Amplification—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The DNase-treated RNA (2.0 μg) was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) as primer. For PCR amplification, Jak3 (NM_000215)-specific primers were designed to amplify the conserved region from −14 to +745: 5′-GGCAAGTTGCACTCATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTGGATCCAGCCGCTC-3′ (reverse). PCR was performed using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit. RT-PCR was carried out on PTC 200 (MJ Research). The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.7% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. SH2 Domain Array—Tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant villin protein was generated as described previously (37Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated villin with SH2 domain of proteins was checked using an SH2 domain array according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In Vitro Villin Can Be Tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn—We have previously reported that villin is tyrosine-phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo (37Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W.

George S.P. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C1775-C1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M. Khurana S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterize the significance of the three ubiquitously expressed Src kinases in the regulation of villin function by expressing c-Src (SYF/c-Src cells), c-Yes (SYF/c-Yes cells), and c-Fyn (SYF/c-Fyn cells) individually in the c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn null (SYF) cells. To examine if the transfected/infected Src kinases in SYF cells were catalytically active, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using enolase as a substrate with c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn immunoprecipitated from SYF/c-Src, SYF/c-Yes, and SYF/c-Fyn cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three Src kinases phosphorylate enolase in vitro. To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin, recombinant full-length human villin protein was phosphorylated in vitro using Src kinases immunoprecipitated from SYF/c-Src, SYF/c-Yes and SYF/c-Fyn cells, respectively (37Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, all three tyrosine kinases phosphorylated recombinant villin protein (Fig. 1B). Similar data were obtained when c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn were immunoprecipitated from the colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2 (data not shown). Cell lysates immunoprecipitated in the absence of primary antibody (Fig. 1B, from left, lanes 3) and GST protein were used as negative controls (last panel) in this assay.

No one could have predicted then that it would become, arguably, the worst plague in human history. Today, 33 million persons are living with infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, while another 25 million have already died of this disease. In 1981, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) appeared insidiously and mystified doctors and scientists alike. No one could have predicted then that it would become, arguably, the worst plague in human history. Today, 33 million persons are living with infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, while another 25 million have already died of this disease. Early studies suggested that AIDS was a disease transmitted through sex or blood that led to the loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Yet any description of a similar syndrome was nowhere to be found in the medical literature. AIDS was obviously new, and the race was on to find the pathogen responsible. Twenty-five years ago this month, Barré-Sinoussi et al., 1983Barré-Sinoussi F. Chermann J.C. Rey F. Nugeyre M.T. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Dauguet C. Axler-Blin C. Vezinet-Brun F. Rouzioux C. et al.Science. 1983; 220: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (4576) Google Scholar reported the detection of reverse transcriptase activity in a culture of lymph node cells taken from a patient with pre-AIDS syndrome. This finding, and the morphology of viral particles found in the culture and visualized by electron microscopy (Figure 1, inset A), suggested that the etiologic agent may be a retrovirus. A year later, Popovic et al., 1984Popovic M. Sarngadharan M.G. Read E. Gallo R.C. Science. 1984; 224: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar described the isolation, propagation, and characterization of a retrovirus from numerous AIDS patients. They also developed an immunoassay to show that AIDS cases had antibodies to this virus whereas healthy persons did not. Later studies would prove that the retroviruses identified by the two groups were one and the same, and that this new agent, subsequently named HIV-1, was unequivocally the cause of AIDS. HIV-1 has become not only the most studied virus in history but also a model system in virology as well as an important tool for probing the cellular processes manipulated by viruses. The HIV-1 life cycle is simple in concept but enormously complex in detail, in part because it is more elaborate than a typical retrovirus and possesses several auxiliary genes (Muesing et al., 1985Muesing M.A. Smith D.H. Cabradilla C.D. Benton C.V. Lasky L.A. Capon D.J. Nature. 1985; 313: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Years of study have only partly unraveled these details, but en route critical discoveries have enabled antiviral drug development, have illuminated AIDS pathogenesis, and have revealed new concepts in viral and cellular biology. For example, the early realization that HIV-1 binds to, and selectively infects, cells expressing CD4 (Figure 1) provided a satisfying explanation for why AIDS was characterized by a profound loss of CD4+ T cells (Maddon et al., 1986Maddon P.J. Dalgleish A.G. McDougal J.S. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 47: 333-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Moreover, the finding that CD4, while necessary, is insufficient to render a cell permissive for HIV-1 entry led to studies showing that the chemokine receptors CXCR4 or CCR5 were also required as coreceptors for viral entry (Feng et al., 1996Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3558) Google Scholar). As the study of HIV-1 has developed, it has become increasingly evident that the biology of HIV-1 is intimately linked with that of its host cell. This theme is exemplified by the unique ways in which the HIV-1 proteins Tat and Rev modulate viral gene expression. Tat recruits the major host RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase to the 5′ end of the nascent viral RNA (Wei et al., 1998Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), thereby inducing polymerase phosphorylation and efficient elongation of the viral transcript (Figure 1). Conversely, the Rev protein binds to a second cis-acting viral RNA sequence and also contains the prototype CRM1-binding nuclear export signal (Fornerod et al., 1997Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). This links incompletely spliced viral transcripts that serve as mRNAs for several HIV-1 proteins to a host nuclear export pathway, thus enabling the expression of the complete repertoire of viral proteins. These mechanisms result in powerful regulation of viral gene expression and provide an elegant solution to the problem posed by the need to express nine proteins from numerous variably spliced viral mRNAs. Moreover, the discovery of the mechanisms by which Tat and Rev work provided major new insights into how both viral and cellular transcriptional elongation is regulated and how certain viral and cellular proteins and RNAs are moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Other instances of molecular parasitism by HIV-1 have been uncovered—a particularly striking example occurs during the release of virus particles. Normally, the host cell ESCRT proteins function on the cytoplasmic face of cellular membranes to mediate membrane fission during multivesicular body biogenesis and cytokinesis. By mimicking sequences of the host cell proteins that normally recruit the ESCRT complexes, HIV-1 diverts this machinery to sites of viral particle assembly to enable the topologically equivalent fission of cellular and nascent virion membranes (Garrus et al., 2001Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Côté M. Rich R.L. et al.Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), leading to release of viral particles (Figure 1). Subversion of host functions is a recurring theme in HIV-1 replication, and as such there have been numerous reciprocal exchanges of insight between researchers working on HIV-1 and in other areas of molecular and cellular biology. One of the more exciting recent developments in AIDS research comes from the realization that HIV-1 replicates in an intrinsically hostile environment. Evolution has endowed cells with factors that can directly inhibit retrovirus replication (Figure 1), presumably because retroviruses imparted recurrent selective pressures during primate evolution. Moreover, a role for some HIV-1 auxiliary gene products in counteracting host inhibitors has been uncovered. A case in point, APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase of the host cell infiltrates retroviral particles during assembly and induces massive, lethal hypermutation and destabilization of the viral genome during subsequent reverse transcription (Sheehy et al., 2002Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the HIV-1 accessory protein Vif recruits APOBEC3 proteins to a destructive ubiquitin ligase complex, thereby denuding the cell of this critical antiretroviral defense. Additionally, an inducible inhibitor of HIV-1 particle release, termed tetherin, whose activity is neutralized by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu, has recently been discovered (Neil et al., 2008Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Divergence in intrinsic antiretroviral molecules limits cross-species transmission of HIV-1 and other retroviruses; this characteristic has hampered the development of animal models of AIDS. Indeed, the inability of HIV-1 to infect most nonhuman primate cells is determined partly by species-specific variation in TRIM5α proteins that recognize and inactivate incoming retroviral capsids (Stremlau et al., 2004Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Our understanding of several aspects of HIV-1 replication has become highly evolved, and in some cases, structural and biochemical studies of HIV-1 proteins have provided atomic resolution detail. For example, high-resolution imaging and structural studies of HIV-1 Gag have revealed how viral particles assemble, and how the conical core in mature virions is formed (Figure 1, inset B). Structural and biochemical studies of the viral proteins reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase, and envelope have facilitated the development of antiretroviral drugs and provided mechanistic explanations for how certain viral mutations confer drug resistance. Nonetheless, despite the highly detailed understanding of some aspects of HIV-1 biology that have accrued, much remains to be learned. For example, our understanding of the events that occur during and between viral entry into the host cell and integration of the viral DNA into the host cell genome remains somewhat rudimentary. In addition, the precise role of HIV-1 Vpr and Nef continues to be elusive, and structures of viral and relevant host proteins remain to be solved. These are major gaps that need to be filled, if a complete understanding of HIV-1 replication is to be achieved. Much is known about HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo. There is an acute burst of virus replication 2–3 weeks after transmission, when the infected person typically suffers a flu-like illness. As this acute syndrome resolves spontaneously, concurrent with the onset of specific immune responses, the level of viremia is partially down-modulated, reaching a steady state or setpoint within a few months. Variable setpoints are observed among infected individuals, which determine the long-term prognosis of the infected person (Mellors et al., 1996Mellors J.W. Rinaldo C.R. Gupta P. White R.M. Todd J.A. Kingsley L.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 setpoint is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between virus production and virus clearance (Wei et al., 1995Wei X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (2844) Google Scholar, Ho et al., 1995Ho D.D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M. Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). Half of the virus particles in blood are cleared within ∼30 min, whereas half of the productively infected T cells die in ∼0.7 days. To maintain the steady state, these parameters must be equally matched by newly produced virions and newly infected T cells. Such findings reveal extraordinary levels of HIV-1 replication in vivo that are continuous not only for days to months but for years to decades. Therefore, it is not surprising that such a remarkable level of virus replication has serious consequences for the infected person. One adverse outcome is the loss of CD4+ T cells over time because virus replication is tightly coupled to a lymphocyte turnover rate that is heightened several-fold (Mohri et al., 2001Mohri H. Perelson A.S. Tung K. Ribeiro R.M. Ramratnam B. Markowitz M. Kost R. Hurley A. Weinberger L. Cesar D. et al.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations are activated, and the magnitude of this activation is proportional to the viral load in plasma. It should also be noted that most of the T cells are turning over as the result of a generalized lymphocyte activation (that is, apoptosis that follows cellular proliferation) and not as the sequela of direct HIV-1 infection. Another outcome of HIV-1 dynamics is the plasticity of viral sequences. High replication rates, in conjunction with the high error rate of reverse transcription, result in the creation of a massive number of new viral variants each day. Consequently, swarms of diverse yet related viruses, known as quasispecies, appear within each infected person, and distinct HIV-1 subtypes or clades emerge within the global pandemic. This unprecedented degree of viral heterogeneity poses significant problems for immune recognition, antiretroviral therapy, and vaccine development. Our accrued understanding of HIV-1 replication has led to the development of 25 approved antiretroviral drugs (Figure 1) and 5 fixed-dose combinations. Shortly after the discovery of the virus, a number of nucleoside analogs, previously developed for cancer or antibacterial chemotherapy, were screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in vitro. Zidovudine became, in 1987, the first to be approved as an AIDS drug (Figure 1). Didanosine and several more followed, including a nucleotide analog, tenofovir. Essentially, the phosphorylated forms of these drugs serve to terminate DNA elongation during reverse transcription. Beginning in the late 1980s, a class of non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase emerged (Figure 1). Although structurally different, each of these compounds binds to a common site on the reverse transcriptase to block its activity. By the early 1990s, and guided by a crystal structure, potent inhibitors of the HIV-1 protease began to appear. Such small molecules insert into the catalytic site and block polypeptide processing, thereby preventing virion maturation (Figure 1). Nevertheless, prior to 1995, all of the available protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors were used individually or as dual-therapy, with only limited benefit to patients. Antiretroviral therapy took on new life after the unraveling of HIV-1 dynamics (Wei et al., 1995Wei X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (2844) Google Scholar, Ho et al., 1995Ho D.D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M. Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). This knowledge led to calculations that showed the rate of formation and accumulation of mutations was so great that monotherapy and dual-therapy were doomed to fail because of the rapid emergence of drug resistance. On the other hand, the math also predicted that it was highly improbable (<10−8 per day) for HIV-1 to mutate in ≥3 positions, simultaneously, in a single genome. This realization led clinical investigators to pursue the use of three or more drugs in combination, starting in early 1995. By the time of the International AIDS Conference in Vancouver in the summer of 1996, it was clear that such combination antiretroviral therapy resulted in durable control of HIV-1 replication (Perelson et al., 1997Perelson A.S. Essunger P. Cao Y. Vesanen M. Hurley A. Saksela K. Markowitz M. Ho D.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Viremia was reduced to below the level of detection for more than a year, and significant immunological and clinical recovery was observed. Thus, 1996 marked a turning point in the AIDS pandemic. AIDS-associated mortality has since dropped by 80%–90% in the US and Europe and, conservatively, more than 3 million person-years of life have been saved. HIV-1 infection is no longer an automatic death sentence; it is now a manageable disease. The therapeutic arsenal continues to improve with the advent of new reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors, as well as two new classes of drugs targeting viral entry and integration (Figure 1). This remarkable success story has become the model for drug development against other viral pathogens. Several daunting challenges in antiretroviral therapy remain, however. Although current combination therapy allows viral replication to be controlled, HIV-1 is not eradicated. It persists latently in resting memory CD4+ lymphocytes, and a cure is not possible until this reservoir is purged. In addition, there is a larger global problem of social injustice that must be addressed. About 90% of the infected population reside in developing countries where antiretroviral drugs are generally not available. Nascent efforts are now underway, led by the United Nations and the US government, to deliver treatment to poor regions of the world. But much more is needed and, sadly, apathy is a major obstacle to many more lives being saved. The HIV-1 epidemic continues to spread at the alarming rate of 2.5 million new cases per year despite educational efforts worldwide to modify behaviors at risk for infection. The use of topical microbicides to block viral transmission has been met with repeated disappointments. Most distressing, however, has been the inability of the scientific community to come up with a preventive vaccine. Approaches using whole inactivated virus or envelope subunit protein have failed. Live attenuated forms of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have protected monkeys from a genetically matched SIV challenge (Daniel et al., 1992Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F. Czajak S.C. Sehgal P.K. Desrosiers R.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1938-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), but such an approach in humans is generally deemed infeasible for safety reasons. Recently, a recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine, designed to elicit cell-mediated immunity to the viral Gag, Pol, and Nef proteins, has also failed to demonstrate any hint of protection. HIV-1 vaccine development has now stalled and is desperately seeking new directions. In retrospect, it is apparent that the field rushed forward with vaccine development, bypassing a number of warning signs. It is well known that HIV-1 is rarely controlled by immune responses during the natural course of infection, an observation that does not bode well for a protective vaccine. Likewise, patients with superinfection have been well documented, showing that immunity generated against one viral strain is often insufficient to block the transmission of another. Lastly, it has long been appreciated that HIV-1 is relatively resistant to antibody neutralization, the basis of nearly all successful viral vaccines to date. Notwithstanding the tremendous gains in understanding the structure of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Kwong et al., 1998Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar), the scientific community has struggled to come up with any antigen design that will consistently raise antibodies capable of penetrating the protective shield on the envelope glycoprotein created by variable loops, extensive glycosylation, and entropic forces. A protective HIV-1 vaccine will likely remain elusive until this fundamental problem is solved. In the meantime, it should be kept in mind that HIV-1/AIDS is completely preventable. For example, the regular use of a condom during sexual intercourse would go a long way to stem the spread of this epidemic. Redoubling of a worldwide effort to disseminate risk-reduction messages is absolutely essential. It would serve us well to understand the origin of this devastating epidemic. HIV-1 belongs to a large family of primate retroviruses naturally found only in African nonhuman primates (Figure 2). The pandemic strains of HIV-1 (group M) are, in all likelihood, derived from a single transmission event from a chimpanzee carrying SIVcpz to one human, probably in the vicinity of southern Cameroon (Keele et al., 2006Keele B.F. van Heuverswyn F. Li Y. Bailes E. Chen Y. Takehisa J. Santiago M.L. Bibollet-Ruche F. Liegeois F. Loul S. et al.Science. 2006; 313: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Molecular dating studies suggest that such a zoonosis took place some 60 to 80 years ago (Korber et al., 2000Korber B. Muldoon M. Theiler J. Gao F. Hahn B.H. Wolinsky S. Battacharya T. Science. 2000; 288: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). One could only speculate what led to the initial chimp-human transmission, and how its spread then became explosive decades later in Africa and beyond. Yet this example of zoonotic transmission is not alone among primate immunodeficiency viruses. Strains of HIV-1 representing independent cross-species transmission events (groups N and O) are found in Africans living in proximity to chimpanzees harboring highly related SIVcpz (Figure 2). Moreover, HIV-2 in West Africans clearly traces its origins to multiple cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys. Likewise, accidental transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys to Asian macaques (SIVmac) in captivity resulted in infection and disease in the new host (Figure 2). One common theme has become evident: SIV in its natural host is typically nonpathogenic (for example, SIVsmm in sooty mangabeys, SIVagm in African green monkeys, and SIVcpz in chimpanzees), whereas transmission to a new host results in the virus becoming pathogenic (HIV-1 and HIV-2 in humans, SIVmac in macaques). Interestingly, the nonpathogenicity in the natural host is associated with a high efficiency of virus replication that is decoupled, for some unknown reason, from the generalized lymphocyte activation that characterizes pathogenic infections in humans or macaques. Herein lies a clue to the secret of AIDS pathogenesis, perhaps. The AIDS pandemic has presented unprecedented scientific, medical, and moral challenges to humanity. The 25 years since the discovery of HIV-1 have been characterized by remarkable scientific discoveries, as well as dramatic successes and failures in translating science into effective interventions. Overall, significant advances have been made toward effectively tackling this modern-day scourge. However, it is sobering to note that while the AIDS death toll is already staggering, the worst of this epidemic may lie ahead."
https://openalex.org/W2130535660,"RNA polymerase pauses at different DNA sequences during transcription elongation, and this pausing is associated with distinct conformational state(s) of the elongation complex (EC). Transcription termination by the termination factor Rho, an RNA-dependent molecular motor, requires pausing of the EC in the termination zone of Rho-dependent terminators. We hypothesized that the conformational state(s) of the EC associated with this pausing would influence the action of Rho. Analyses of the pausing behavior of the EC at the termination points of two well known Rho-dependent terminators revealed that Rho prefers actively transcribing complexes for termination. RNA release kinetics from stalled ECs showed that the rate of RNA release by Rho was reduced if the EC was irreversibly backtracked, if its RNA exit channel was modified by an RNA hairpin, or the bridge helix/trigger loop movement in its active site was perturbed. These defects were overcome significantly by enhancing the rate of ATP hydrolysis either by increasing the concentration of ATP or by using a Rho mutant with higher ATPase activity. We propose that the force generated from ATP hydrolysis of Rho is the key factor in dislodging the EC through its molecular motor action, and this process is facilitated when the EC is in a catalytically competent state, undergoing rapid “Brownian ratchet” motion.

There are two types of termination signals in Escherichia coli. The intrinsic terminators are characterized by a GC-rich inverted repeat followed by an oligo(dT) stretch that destabilizes the EC and the factor-dependent terminators, which depend on an essential protein, called Rho, for termination (4Richardson J.P.

Rho is a homo-hexameric RNA/DNA helicase or translocase capable of dissociating the elongating RNA polymerase from the template DNA by utilizing its RNA-dependent ATPase activity (6Richardson J.P.

Binding of RNA to the primary binding site of Rho guides the 3′-side of the RNA into the central hole of the hexamer, which constitutes the secondary RNA binding domain. Q-loop and R-loop are the two major RNA binding determinants of Rho at this site. Interaction of the RNA with these two loops activates ATP hydrolysis in the nearby P-loop region (10Wei R.R.

Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2525-2528Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Analyses of Rho-dependent terminators revealed that the position of the rut site determines the location of the downstream termination zone (21Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

Unlike Rho-independent terminators, the termination zone of the well characterized Rho-dependent terminators, such as λ tR1 and trp t′, do not have characteristic signatures, except that the sequences are AU-rich and the termination points are associated with pausing of the EC (25Farnham P.J. Greenblatt J. Platt J. Cell. 1982; 29: 945-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Laus L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9391-9397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, not all pause sites are termination points, and these include some of the strongest pauses along a terminator (27Kassavetis G.A. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2777-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNAP pauses during elongation at different sequences, which provide an adequate time window for different cis and trans factors to act upon the EC (28Landick R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Depending on the pause sequence, the active site of the EC can be in conformationally distinct states (28Landick R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Pausing at Rho-independent terminators is required for the timely formation of an RNA hairpin at the exit channel (29Nudler E. Gottesman M.E. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), although pausing in the termination zone of Rho-dependent terminators is believed to help Rho to “catch up” with the elongating EC (7Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The importance of conformational state(s) of the EC in Rho-dependent termination has not been explored. As pausing of the EC is associated with the termination points in the termination zone (25Farnham P.J. Greenblatt J. Platt J. Cell. 1982; 29: 945-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Laus L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9391-9397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the conformational state(s) associated with pausing would affect the RNA release process by Rho. Quantitative analyses of the EC paused at the termination points, and RNA release kinetics from the stalled ECs with different conformational states show that Rho prefers actively transcribing complexes for termination. These assays also reveal that an enhanced rate of ATP hydrolysis is required to release RNA from the catalytically inactive ECs. We propose that the force generated by ATP hydrolysis of Rho is the key factor in dislodging the EC through its molecular motor action, and the process is facilitated when the EC is in a catalytically competent state undergoing rapid “Brownian ratchet” motion. Materials—NTPs, poly(C), IPTG, lysozyme, dithiothreitol, and bovine serum albumin were from GE Healthcare. Radioisotopes [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]CTP (4500 Ci/mmol) were purchased from either GE Healthcare or Jonaki, BRIT, India. Primers for PCR were obtained either from Sigma or MWG Biotec.

To immobilize the templates on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega), a biotinylated upstream primer RS83 was used in all cases.

The reactions were initiated with 10 nm DNA template, 40 nm WT RNA polymerase, 175 μm ApU, 5 μm each of GTP and ATP, and 2.5 μm of CTP to make a 23-mer elongation complex (EC23). [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added to the reaction to label the EC23. EC23 was then chased with 20 μm NTPs in the presence of 10 μg/ml rifampicin, and aliquots were removed at different time points and mixed with formamide loading dye (Fig. 1, A and B). Transcripts were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 10% sequencing gel, and the gels were scanned and analyzed by Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager. Pausing assays on ops (Fig. 3B) and his (Fig. 4B) pause templates were performed essentially in the same way as described above, except that EC23 was chased with 10 μm GTP and 100 μm other NTPs.FIGURE 4Catalytic inactivation of ECs caused by RNA hairpin at the exit channel affects Rho-dependent RNA release.

The templates were immobilized before starting the reaction. Transcription reactions were initiated as above except that 100 nm of lac repressor was added before making the EC23 complex. EC23 complex was then chased in the presence of 100 μm NTPs and rifampicin for 2 min to make the RB complexes. RB complexes were made in a similar manner on all the templates. These complexes were then immediately washed three times with 150 μl of T buffer to remove the excess NTPs and resuspended in the same buffer. The washing steps were completed within 5 min to avoid long incubation of the stalled ECs. 50 nm Rho in the presence of indicated amounts of ATP (either 25 μm or 1 mm) was then added, and aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at different time points, and supernatant and bead fractions were separated using a magnetic stand. Half of the supernatant (“S”) was added to an equal volume of RNA loading dye (Ambion), and the rest of the reaction (half of the supernatant + pellet; “P”) was phenol-extracted and mixed with the same dye. In the experiments where antibiotics were used, the RB complexes were incubated with either 300 μm streptolydigin or 60 μm tagetitoxin for 5 min before the addition of Rho. GreB and Pyrophosphate Cleavage Assays—To assess the extent of backtracking of the stalled elongation complexes at position +124 (Fig. 2B) and at ops pause site (Fig. 3B), the respective RB complexes were prepared as described above. The backtracked complex at +124 was observed to form readily during the three washing steps, which were completed within 5 min. Then 0.5 μm of GreB was added, and the cleavage reactions were allowed to continue for 3 min. For pyrophosphate (PPi)-mediated cleavage of the RB complex at the his pause site, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate was added, and aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at the indicated (Fig. 4C) time points, and the reaction was stopped by mixing with RNA loading dye. Analyses of the Pausing and RNA Release Kinetics—For the pausing assays, the amount of RNA in each pausing site (Fig. 1) was quantitated using ImageQuant software and plotted against time. The plots were fitted to the equation of exponential decay (y = a exp-(λt)) to calculate the rate (λ) of escape from the paused site and efficiency of pausing (a) at that site (stated as PE in Fig. 1). The intercept of this curve on the y axis gives the value of “t½”, the pausing efficiency. The half-lives (t½) of pausing were calculated from, t½ = ln2/(λln10). To determine the rate of accumulation of Rho-mediated released RNA (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5), the band intensities were quantitated by ImageQuant software, and the fraction of released RNA (2S/S + (S + P)) from each experiment was plotted against time. The plots were fitted to the equation of exponential rise (y = a(1 - exp-λt)) to calculate the rate (λ) and maximum efficiency (a) of RNA release. The error bars were calculated from the standard deviations obtained from at least three measurements. All the curve fittings were performed using Sigmaplot. ATPase Assays—The rate of ATP hydrolysis of WT Rho and Rho P235H was measured by using RNAs containing the region of well known Rho-dependent λ tR1 and trp t′ terminators. DNA templates for transcribing the RNA were prepared by PCR amplification from the plasmid pRS604 using RS139/RS341 oligo pairs, and from the plasmid pRS106 using RS139/RS177 oligo pairs, to make the λ tR1 and trp t′ terminator sequence containing RNA fragments, respectively (Table 1). Both the RNAs were made using the Mega transcript kit from Ambion. The ATP hydrolysis was assayed by monitoring the release of Pi from ATP using polyethyleneimine TLC plates and 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5, as a mobile phase under the following conditions. The assays were performed in T buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. The rate of ATP hydrolysis at 25 μm and 1 mm of ATP together with [γ-32P]ATP (3500 Ci/mmol; BRIT, India) were measured using 25 nm and 50 nm of Rho, respectively. Reaction was started by addition of 0.2 μm of either λ tR1 or trp t′ RNA. Aliquots were removed and stopped with 1.5 m formic acid at various time points depending on the concentrations of ATP. Release of Pi was analyzed by exposing the TLC sheets to a PhosphorImager screen and subsequently by scanning using Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by ImageQuant TL software. The product formation was linear in the time range that we used for calculating the initial rate of the reaction. The initial rates of the reaction were determined by plotting the amount of Pi released versus time using linear regression methods. Pausing of ECs at the Termination Points of Rho-dependent Terminators Is Associated with a Short Half-life—Earlier semi-quantitative studies with two well known Rho-dependent terminators, trp t′ and λ tR1 (24Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Farnham P.J. Greenblatt J. Platt J. Cell. 1982; 29: 945-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), described the pausing of RNAP at the termination points in the termination zone of these two terminators. To further characterize the nature of these pauses, we cloned these two terminators under a strong promoter like T7A1, and we measured pausing kinetics at the major termination points (indicated by * in Fig. 1, A and B). Band intensities corresponding to the pausing sites were plotted against time and fitted to an exponential decay equation to calculate the pause half-lives (t½) and pause efficiencies (Fig. 1, shown below the autoradiograms). We observed that at all the termination points, except at position 124 of trp t′, the half-lives of pausing are very short. This suggests that the nucleotide addition cycle at these points is not hindered significantly, and the ECs are in a catalytically active state. Even though the EC pauses longer at position 124 of trp t′ than the other pausing sites, it retains the competence for elongation at this point. We also observed that the pausing efficiencies at the termination points of the λ tR1 terminator are higher than that of trp t′ terminator. It should be noted that the difference in the RNA sequences between the two terminators may also lead to the difference in the ability of the Rho to act. We concluded that although high efficiency pausing in the termination zone is important for termination to occur, Rho distinctly prefers catalytically active conformational states of the EC. Transient pauses are preferred over long pauses for releasing RNA by Rho. Rationale and Design of RNA Release Assays from Stalled ECs—To gain further insight into the preference of Rho for particular conformational state(s) of the EC, we measured the rates and efficiencies of RNA release by Rho from ECs in different conformational states. We stalled elongation complexes (RB) at desired positions in the termination zone of the trp t′ terminator using lac repressor as a roadblock (Fig. 1C) (32King R.A. Sen R. Weisberg R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) so that the behavior of Rho could be studied uncoupled from transcription elongation. We prepared four different types of stalled ECs as follows: 1) catalytically active EC at position +161 (Fig. 2); 2) an irreversibly backtracked EC at position +124 (Fig. 2); 3) a reversibly backtracked EC at ops pause site introduced at position +155 (Fig. 3) (33Artsimovitch I.

All these stalled ECs were made on immobilized DNA templates attached to magnetic beads, which facilitated the removal of NTPs after formation of the complexes. RNA release by Rho was initiated in the presence of ATP. RNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rho is required for its transcription termination activity (40Shigesada K. Wu C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3355-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Howard B.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2520-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that change in the rate of ATP hydrolysis may have a direct consequence on the rate of RNA release by Rho from the stalled ECs. The ATP hydrolysis rate may be varied by changing the ATP concentration or by using certain Rho mutant(s) with significantly different ATPase activity. We measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis on two RNA fragments containing the λ tR1 and trp t′ terminator sequences under different conditions (Table 2, A and B). Upon increasing the concentration of ATP from 25 μm to 1 mm, the rate of ATP hydrolysis increased to ∼7-fold for λ tR1 and ∼9-fold for trp t′ RNA. We used a Rho mutant, P235H, reported to have a higher rate of ATP hydrolysis compared with WT (42Periera S. Platt T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 36-40Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, we observed that in the presence of 25 μm of ATP, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of this mutant is ∼4-fold higher for λ tR1 and ∼5-fold higher for trp t′ RNA compared with that observed for WT Rho. Therefore, to elucidate the effect of rate of ATP hydrolysis on the rate of RNA release by Rho, we compared the RNA release kinetics from the stalled ECs under conditions of low (25 μm ATP) and high (1 mm ATP/P235H Rho) rates of ATP hydrolysis.TABLE 2ATPase activity under different conditions The errors were calculated from 3 to 4 independent measurements.

https://openalex.org/W1992602187,"Salicyl alcohol oxidase is an extracellular enzyme that occurs in glandular reservoirs of chrysomelid leaf beetle larvae and catalyzes the formation of salicylaldehyde, a volatile deterrent used by the larvae against predators. Salicyl alcohol is the hydrolysis product of salicin, a plant-derived precursor taken up by the beetle larvae from the leaves of willow and poplar trees. The cDNA encoding salicyl alcohol oxidase from two related species Chrysomela tremulae and Chrysomela populi has been identified, cloned, and expressed in an active form in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame of 623 amino acids begins in both enzymes with an N-terminal signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Sequence comparison has revealed that salicyl alcohol oxidase belongs to the family of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase-like sequences with mostly unknown function. Enzymes of this family share similar overall structure with an essentially identical FAD-binding site but possess different catalytic activities. The data suggest that salicyl alcohol oxidase, essential for the activation of the plant-derived precursor salicin, was originally recruited from an oxidase involved in the autogenous biosynthesis of iridoid monoterpenes and found in related chrysomelid leaf beetle species.

The data suggest that salicyl alcohol oxidase, essential for the activation of the plant-derived precursor salicin, was originally recruited from an oxidase involved in the autogenous biosynthesis of iridoid monoterpenes and found in related chrysomelid leaf beetle species. Chrysomelid leaf beetles encompass a taxon of about 40,000 mainly phytophagous species (1Futuyma D.J. Jolivet P. Santiago-Blay J.A. Schmitt M New Developments in the Biology of Chrysomelidae. SPB Academic Publishing, The Hague, The Netherlands2004: xviiGoogle Scholar). Many of them possess conspicuous warning coloration, signaling unpalatability, since they release defensive chemicals from specialized glands upon attack (2Laurent P. Braekman J.-C. Daloze D. Pasteels J.M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 2003: 2733-2743Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Defensive exocrine glands are found in both larval and adult leaf beetles, but these two sets of glands are not homologous (3Pasteels J.M. Braekman J.C. Daloze D. Jolivet P. Petitpierre E. Hsiao T.H. Biology of the Chrysomelidae. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: 233-252Google Scholar). Larvae of species belonging to the subtribe Chrysomelina possess nine pairs of glands on the meso- and metathorax and on the first seven abdominal segments, producing mainly volatiles as irritants and repellents against predators (4Pasteels J.M. Duffey S. Rowell Rahier M. J. Chem. Ecol. 1990; 16: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies showed that the volatile salicylaldehyde disinfects the microenvironment of leaf beetle larvae, preventing the germination of conidia of entomopathogenic fungi on the cuticle of the host plant's leaves (5Gross J. Podsiadlowski L. Hilker M. J. Chem. Ecol. 2002; 28: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Gross J. Schumacher K. Schmidtberg H. Vilcinskas A. J. Chem. Ecol. 2008; 34: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each gland consists of several gland cells that are attached to a glandular reservoir whose content is everted when the larvae is disturbed. The defensive secretions of larvae belonging to the subtribe Chrysomelina have been analyzed, and three strategies have been identified that reflect different degrees of specialization during evolution: first, the de novo production of iridoid monoterpenes from terpenoid precursors, providing an autogenous defense that is completely host plant-independent (7Veith M. Lorenz M. Boland W. Simon H. Dettner K. Tetrahedron. 1994; 50: 6859-6874Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Burse A. Schmidt A. Frick S. Kuhn J. Gershenzon J. Boland W. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 37: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); second, the biosynthesis of the aromatic compound salicylaldehyde from salicin, a phenolic glucoside taken up from the larval host plant, in a strategy that is fully dependent upon the chemistry of the host plant (9Pasteels J.M. Rowell Rahier M. Braekman J.C. Dupont A. Physiol. Entomol. 1983; 8: 307-314Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar); third, the biosynthesis of esters composed of de novo-synthesized butyric acids with the alcohol moiety of leaf alcohol glucosides retrieved from the plant, representing a strategy partially dependent on the chemistry of the host plant (10Schulz S. Gross J. Hilker M. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 9203-9212Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the de novo synthesis of iridoid monoterpenes is the most ancestral type of chemical defense, of which the host-derived salicylaldehyde strategy has evolved at least twice during the evolution of the Chrysomeline leaf beetles. This strategy has itself been replaced in some of the more recent lineages by mixed metabolism involving the synthesis of butyric acids (11Termonia A. Hsiao T.H. Pasteels J.M. Milinkovitch M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3909-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Larvae of Chrysomela tremulae and Chrysomela populi feed on poplar and willow leaves and produce salicylaldehyde, which has been shown to be effective against several generalist predators (9Pasteels J.M. Rowell Rahier M. Braekman J.C. Dupont A. Physiol. Entomol. 1983; 8: 307-314Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Wallace J.B. Blum M.S. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1969; 62: 503-506Crossref Google Scholar). Salicylaldehyde is accumulated in large amounts in the glandular reservoir, forming an organic phase that accounts for ∼15% of the total liquid volume of the secretion (13Brückmann M. Termonia A. Pasteels J.M. Hartmann T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the biosynthesis of salicylaldehyde requires only the hydrolysis of the plant-derived salicin (salicyl alcohol glucoside) and the oxidation of the resulting salicyl alcohol to salicylaldehyde (Fig. 1), the lower costs of this biosynthesis of defense compounds may be one of the advantages of this strategy over the autogenous biosynthesis of iridoid monoterpenes (11Termonia A. Hsiao T.H. Pasteels J.M. Milinkovitch M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3909-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, salicyl alcohol oxidase (SAO) 3The abbreviations used are: SAO, salicyl alcohol oxidase; GMC, glucose-methanol-choline; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; CtSAO, SAO of C. tremulae; CpSAO, SAO of C. populi; CtGMC, GMC oxidoreductase from C. tremulae; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplificatin of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame. has been purified and characterized electrophoretically from larval defense secretions of C. populi and Phratora vitellinae (13Brückmann M. Termonia A. Pasteels J.M. Hartmann T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SAO shows high substrate specificity for salicyl alcohol and has been established to use molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor, thereby yielding hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, SAO has been classified as an aryl-alcohol: oxygen oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.7) (14Webb E.C. Enzyme Nomenclature: Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on the Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc, New York1992Google Scholar). Pasteels et al. (4Pasteels J.M. Duffey S. Rowell Rahier M. J. Chem. Ecol. 1990; 16: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have postulated that the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of salicylaldehyde might have evolved from enzymes catalyzing the final steps in the production of iridoid monoterpenes. As a precursor of iridoid monoterpenes, 8-hydroxygeraniol-8-O-β-d-glucoside is synthesized in the glands from geraniol via 8-hydroxygeraniol (7Veith M. Lorenz M. Boland W. Simon H. Dettner K. Tetrahedron. 1994; 50: 6859-6874Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Daloze D. Pasteels J.M. J. Chem. Ecol. 1994; 20: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Feld B.K. Pasteels J.M. Boland W. Chemoecology. 2001; 11: 191-198Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) before it is secreted into the glandular reservoir. In the reservoir, the glycoside is cleaved by an extracellular β-glucosidase, and the aglycon is subsequently oxidized, yielding the dialdehyde 8-oxocitral. Oxidation is catalyzed by an extracellular dioxygen-dependent oxidase shown to remove stereospecifically the pro-(R)-hydrogen atoms from each of the terminal carbon atoms (17Veith M. Dettner K. Boland W. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 6601-6612Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, the 8-oxocitral is cyclized and transformed to the species-specific iridoids (7Veith M. Lorenz M. Boland W. Simon H. Dettner K. Tetrahedron. 1994; 50: 6859-6874Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Lorenz M. Boland W. Dettner K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1993; 32: 912-914Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Our aim is to understand the evolution of enzymes that have evolved during the adaptation of insects to certain host-plant species and that enable the insects to use plant-derived compounds directly or as precursors for their own defense. Recently, we have been able to show that the senecionine N-oxygenase from larvae of the lepidopteran Tyria jacobaeae is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that has evolved from members of this enzyme family during the adaptation to pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing plants (19Naumann C. Hartmann T. Ober D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Senecionine N-oxygenase allows these insects not only to feed on plants producing toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids but also to sequester these plant toxins for their own defense (20Lindigkeit R. Biller A. Buch M. Schiebel H.M. Boppré M. Hartmann T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 626-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In a similar context, we show here that the extracellular SAO of two related chrysomelid leaf beetles belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of oxidoreductases (21Cavener D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After heterologous expression of the cDNA encoding the SAO of C. tremulae and C. populi in Escherichia coli, the recombinant protein shows all of the main characteristics of the native enzyme previously characterized from C. populi (13Brückmann M. Termonia A. Pasteels J.M. Hartmann T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The function of SAO as an enzyme involved in the chemical defense of leaf beetle larvae against predators by the modification of plant-derived compounds to effective defensive chemicals adds a further facet to the versatile GMC oxidoreductase gene family in insects, of which most members await their functional characterization. Collection and Rearing of Beetle Larvae—Larvae and adults of C. populi were collected in Belgium and in the vicinity of Kiel, Germany, and those of C. tremulae were collected in France. Insects were reared in the laboratory on leaves of Populus nigra and Populus balsamifera. Ammonium sulfate-precipitated defense secretions of Phratora vitellinae and Chrysomela knabi were provided by Jacques Pasteels (Free University of Brussels, Belgium). Purification and Microsequencing of SAO—SAO of C. populi and C. tremulae were purified from defense secretions by electrophoretic methods as described (13Brückmann M. Termonia A. Pasteels J.M. Hartmann T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein spots were cut from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, washed three times with water before being digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were subjected to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) as described by Zorn et al. (22Zorn H. Peters T. Nimtz M. Berger R.G. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For microsequencing of the N terminus, the protein was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by automated Edman degradation in an ABI Protein Sequencer 494. The same method was used for some of the internal peptides of SAO of C. populi; these were digested with endoproteinase LysC before being separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sequenced. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Exocrine glandular secretions were collected in capillary tubes from the larvae of C. tremulae and C. populi after nudging the animals with a pair of foreceps. The larvae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and used directly for the extraction of total RNA with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Up to 5 μg were employed as a template for oligo(T) cDNA synthesis with an oligo(dT)17 primer (0.05 μm; Table 1) by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 55 °C in a total volume of 20 μl.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequence of primers used in PCRsPrimerSequenceCharacteristicsP015′-dTAY GAY GAR TTY ACN GGN GAY AT-3′Degenerate; forP025′-dCCA GTT GTA GTC TGA ATA TT-3′CtSAO 5′-RACEP035′-dCTT CTC CTG CTT CCA GCA GAA GTA TAT-3′CtSAO 5′-RACEP045′-dACC CCG AGG GTC CAG ATC CAA CAA TAT-3′CtSAO 5′-RACEP055′-dATA TAC ATA TGC TTT ACG ATG AAT TTA CAG GTC ACA TAT CG-3′CtSAO expression; forP065′-dATA TAG TCG ACT ATT CCA TAA TCA TTC TTA ATG ATG TCT GAT-3′CtSAO expression; revP075′-dTAY GAY TTY RTH RTI RTI GG-3′Degenerate; forP085′-dAAY TAC ATG MTB TAC RII MGV GG-3′Degenerate; forP095′-dCCB GAY ARC ATH ARI AIY TG-3′Degenerate; forP105′-dGCT TCT TGA GAC GCT TTC CA-3′CpSAO 5′-RACEP115′-dAGT TTA GAT CTA TAA GAC GCA TCA CTA A-3′CpSAO 5′-RACEP125′-dGCC CAT CGC TAT TGT GAT ATC CAT TAT-3′CpSAO 5′-RACEP135′-dTAT ATA ATT AAT GCT TGA TAA TGA GTT GTC CGG AGA TAT ATC GAG C-3′CpSAO expression; forP145′-dTAT ATA GGT CTC CTC GAG CAT TCC ATA ATC TTT TTT AAT GAT GTC TGA TGC TCT CTC TC-3′CpSAO expression; revP155′-dTCT CCC TGT GTT TGA CTT TA-3′CtGMC 5′-RACEP165′-dGAT CTT CCC TCC GGA CCG ATG GAT AT-3′CtGMC 5′-RACEP175′-dCAT CCA CTA CAG GTT CAC CTG ACT CAT ATT-3′CtGMC 5′-RACEOligo(dT)17 primer5′-dGTC GAC TCG AGA ATT C(T)17-3′ Open table in a new tab Generation and Expression of Full-length cDNA Clone Coding for SAO of C. tremulae (CtSAO)—A degenerate primer P01 was constructed according to the N-terminal peptide resulting from sequencing of the SAO of C. tremulae (trem01; Table 2). This primer in combination with the oligo(dT)17 primer (0.8 μm each; Table 1) was used for the amplification of 1 μl of cDNA with AccuTaq LA Polymerase (Sigma) in a total volume of 25 μl. At an annealing temperature of 66 °C, a fragment of ∼1900 bp was amplified, subcloned by using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced. Gene-specific primers were designed against the PCR fragment for 5′-end amplification (primer P02-P04; Table 1) by using the 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For amplification of the open reading frame (ORF) of SAO cDNA without the N-terminal signal peptide, two gene-specific primers were synthesized (P05/P06) and used (0.8 μm each) for amplification with AccuTaq in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing oligo(dT)17-primed cDNA as the template. The resulting 1900-bp fragment was purified by electrophoresis, cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega), and sequenced. The positive construct was digested with NdeI/SalI before the insert was ligated into a NdeI/XhoI-linearized pET-22b(+) vector (Novagen) for expression with the T7 polymerase system (23Studier F.W.

The primer pair P08 and oligo(dT)17 was used to amplify 1 μl of cDNA with AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase (Sigma) at an annealing temperature of 45 °C in 35 cycles. The resulting fragment of ∼1600 bp was subcloned by using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced. The 5′-cDNA fragment was amplified as described for CtSAO but with the gene-specific primers P10–P12 (Table 1). After amplification of the full ORF without the N-terminal signal peptide with the primer pair P13/P14 (Table 1) and at an annealing temperature of 52.1 °C, the resulting fragment was digested with VspI/BsaI, cloned into a NdeI/XhoI-linearized pET22b(+) vector, and expressed with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in E. coli BL21(DE3) in the presence of the pREP4-groESL plasmid as described for CtSAO. Identification of a Full-length cDNA Clone Predicted to Encode a GMC Oxidoreductase of Unknown Function from C. tremulae (CtGMC)—RNA of C. tremulae was used for reverse transcription-PCR in an approach identical to that used for the identification of CpSAO with primer pair P08 and oligo(dT)17 but with an annealing temperature of 60.3 °C in 35 cycles. Gene-specific primers P15–P17 were designed and used for 5′-RACE. Sequence Analysis—cDNA sequences were analyzed by using the SignalP3.0 server (25Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J.

Enzyme Assay and Salicylaldehyde Quantification and Identification by Gas Chromatography (GC) and GC-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)—Standard assays for SAO were performed in a volume of 500 μl containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 10–250 mm salicyl alcohol (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 2–15 min in 2-ml glass vials and stopped by the addition of 250 μl of ethyl acetate containing 0.5 mm phenol (Fluka) as an internal standard, followed by vigorous vortexing for 30 s. By centrifugation (3 min at 5000 rpm), the upper organic phase was separated from the lower aqueous phase. A Shimadzu GC-2010 capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a BP-1 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; SGE Analytical Science Pty. Ltd.) was used to analyze 1 μl of the organic phase for quantification of salicylaldehyde with a split ratio of 2:1 at 250 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas (linear velocity 40 cm s–1). Compounds were separated and eluted under programmed conditions from 70 °C (3 min isothermal) to 200 °C (at 6 °C min–1). Products were detected by flame ionization. As standards, salicyl alcohol and salicylaldehyde (both from Sigma) were used. For unequivocal identification of the reaction product, GC-MS was performed on an Agilent 19091N-216 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent MSD 5975 inert quadrupole mass spectrometer. Aliquots of 200 μl of the aqueous enzyme reaction (not treated with ethyl acetate) and of salicylaldehyde diluted with assay buffer were added to headspace vials and heated up to 70 °C for 5 min in order to generate the headspace. Subsequently, 1 ml of the gas phase was transferred to an HP-INNOWax polyethylene glycol column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm; Agilent) with a split ratio of 5.3:1 and an initial temperature of 260 °C. Separation was achieved under a helium flow (linear velocity 30 cm s–1) with a temperature program of 1 min at 70 °C, followed by a gradient from 70 to 240 °C at 15 °C min–1 with a 4-min hold time at 240 °C. Electron impact mass spectrometry values were recorded at 70 eV. To test substrate specificity of SAO enzyme with various benzyl alcohol derivatives, reactions containing 75 mm substrate were incubated for 15 and 20 min, respectively, before the reactions were stopped and prepared for GC analysis as the standard reactions. For quantification of enzyme activity, only the increase of peak areas was analyzed in comparison with identical incubations in which the enzyme was replaced by buffer. To test the recombinant enzymes for glucose dehydrogenase activity, a spectrophotometric assay was used according to Cavener and MacIntyre (31Cavener D.R. MacIntyre R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6286-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 100 μl of enzyme preparation were added to 400 μl of dichloroindophenol reagent (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 76 mm d-glucose, 48 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol). Reduction of absorption was monitored at 600 nm at 20 °C with an Ultrospec 3100 Pro UV-visible spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). Microsequencing of SAO and Related Enzymes Present in Larval Defense Secretions—For microsequencing, two methods were used: (i) automated Edman degradation of N termini and of HPLC-purified peptides resulting from digestion of proteins with endopeptidase LysC and (ii) ESI-MS/MS spectroscopy of peptides resulting from digestion with trypsin. Use of the latter did not allow the two amino acids Leu and Ile to be distinguished, and hence, in Table 2, these residues are given in parentheses. The purified SAO of C. tremulae, C. populi, and P. vitellinae each showed one dominant protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of ∼75 kDa. These bands were subjected to microsequencing. In the defense secretion of C. knabi, a dominant protein band of comparable size was detected and also applied to further analysis. Microsequencing resulted in N-terminal peptides of 15 and 20 amino acids of SAO from C. tremulae (trem01) and C. populi (pop01), respectively. Several further internal peptides were obtained from all proteins analyzed (Table 2). Identification and Analysis of cDNA Coding for CtSAO—Based on the sequence information of N-terminal peptide trem01 (Table 2), a degenerate oligonucleotide was synthesized (P01; Table 1) and used for reverse transcription-PCR with total RNA of C. tremulae larvae in combination with the oligo(dT)17 primer. Initial experiments never resulted in specific fragments, although RNA degradation was not detectable by gel electrophoresis. Speculating that the aldehyde present in the defense secretions might interact with the RNA of interest during the RNA extraction procedure, we completely removed the glandular secretions before RNA extraction. Hereupon, we succeeded in amplifying a fragment of ∼1900 bp of which the sequence information was used for identification of the 5′-cDNA end by the 5′-RACE technique. The resulting cDNA sequence contained an ORF for a protein of 623 amino acids that contained all four peptides sequenced from the purified SAO (Fig. 2). The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of CtSAO cDNA were 20 and 62 bp in length, respectively. Sequence analysis with various software tools predicted an N-terminal signal peptide for the vesicular pathway with a proposed cleavage site between amino acids 21 and 22. The resulting N terminus of the processed protein matched exactly the N-terminal peptide resulting from microsequencing starting with amino acid 22. Endoplasmatic reticulum retention motifs were not detectable. The encoded protein had a predicted subunit size of 69.3 and 67.1 kDa with and without signal peptide, respectively. The isoelectric point of the processed protein is predicted to be 5.2. The deduced amino acid sequence of CtSAO showed 30–51% identity in data base searches to the GMC oxidoreductases of insects (Table 3) and possessed all the characteristic sequence motifs of this family of FAD-dependent enzymes (Fig. 2).TABLE 3Comparison of amino acid sequences of newly identified GMC-like sequences of Chrysomela with selected GMC-like sequences of insects, fungi, and bacteriaCpSAOCtGMCDm_ninaGDmGLDDmEOAmGOXAnGOXEcCHDTcGMC_I5TcGMC_B5CtSAO89.25 (91.81)35.73 (46.50)29.83 (40.15)39.96 (52.23)31.48 (44.07)37.94 (46.78)31.83 (41.81)34.56 (46.33)51.22 (62.24)37.59 (48.20)CpSAO36.59 (46.18)31.35 (42.35)38.70 (50.74)31.30 (43.90)38.75 (47.60)30.60 (39.55)35.27 (46.32)49.52 (59.55)35.41 (46.46)CtGMC32.05 (41.08)35.35 (46.90)34.85 (44.10)36.99 (45.49)30.07 (37.86)36.33 (45.70)37.12 (46.18)46.73 (57.62) Open table in a new tab Identification of cDNA Coding for CpSAO—Since several peptides resulting from microsequencing showed similarity to GMC oxidoreductase sequences in the data base and since the first efforts to identify an SAO-coding cDNA with degenerate primers designed according to the peptides obtained from microsequencing of SAO were unsuccessful, we decided to use a reverse genetic approach. Based on an alignment of the amino acid sequences of GMC oxidoreductases of D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Candida, the primers P07–P09 (Table 1) were synthesized. Upon using the primer pair P08 and oligo(dT)17, a fragment of ∼1600 bp was identified before the 5′-cDNA end was identified by 5′-RACE with the gene-specific primers P10–P12. The resulting cDNA encoded a protein of 602 amino acids that was predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide of 21 amino acids. As for CtSAO, the resulting N terminus of the native protein matched exactly the N-terminal peptide that resulted from microsequencing. A molecular mass of 69.0 and 66.7 kDa was calculated for CpSAO with and without the signal peptide, respectively; the isoelectric point was predicted to be 6.1. Again, all peptides obtained by microsequencing were verified by the derived amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence showed sequence identity of 89% and 31–50% to CtSAO and to the GMC oxidoreductases of insects, respectively (Table 3). Identification of cDNA Encoding a GMC-like Protein of C. tremulae (CtGMC)—The same strategy as described for the identification of the cDNA encoding CpSAO was used to identify further cDNA sequences of C. tremulae that showing homology to the previously identified CtSAO. The idea was to identify a sequence that shared a common ancestor with CtSAO. With cDNA reverse transcribed from the total RNA of C. tremula"
https://openalex.org/W2045640643,"All phycobiliproteins contain a conserved, post-translational modification on asparagine 72 of their β-subunits. Methylation of this Asn to produce γ-N-methylasparagine has been shown to increase energy transfer efficiency within the phycobilisome and to prevent photoinhibition. We report here the biochemical characterization of the product of sll0487, which we have named cpcM, from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Recombinant apo-phycocyanin and apo-allophycocyanin subunits were used as the substrates for assays with [methyl-3H]S-adenosylmethionine and recombinant CpcM. CpcM methylated the β-subunits of phycobiliproteins (CpcB, ApcB, and ApcF) and did not methylate the corresponding α-subunits (CpcA, ApcA, and ApcD), although they are similar in primary and tertiary structure. CpcM preferentially methylated its CpcB substrate after chromophorylation had occurred at Cys82. CpcM exhibited lower activity on trimeric phycocyanin after complete chromophorylation and oligomerization had occurred. Based upon these in vitro studies, we conclude that this post-translational modification probably occurs after chromophorylation but before trimer assembly in vivo."

A new database aims to foster partnerships among scientists in the developed and developing world and to coordinate science-based activities to help solve some of the big challenges that the developing world faces. This week the New York Academy of Sciences in partnership with many scientific and global health organizations—including the American Society for Cell Biology, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, the Earth Institute at Columbia University, the Pasteur Institute, and many others—is launching the first step in a new initiative called Scientists Without Borders (http://www.nyas.org/programs/borders.asp). Like Doctors Without Borders and Engineers Without Borders, the goal of Scientists Without Borders is to improve quality of life in the developing world. However, unlike these project-based organizations, Scientists Without Borders is planning to build a virtual community that will connect and coordinate science-based activities worldwide so that scientists and institutions working in key research areas connected with health, agriculture, energy, and the environment can share everything from expertise and equipment to specimens and transportation. The initiative will accomplish this task through an interactive website, with a database as its cornerstone. Initially, Scientists Without Borders will concentrate on developing connections to and within sub-Saharan Africa, with help from partners such as the African Centre for Technology Studies, the Information Training and Outreach Centre in South Africa, SciDevNet, and the University of Ghana. Founded with a $300,000 seed grant from the Merck Foundation, Scientists Without Borders has now raised more than one million dollars from many sources including pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer. The Scientists Without Borders database (http://scientistswithoutborders.nyas.org) is designed to facilitate network building that currently depends on personal contacts or literature searches. For scientists in the developed world, identifying collaborators in developing countries can take weeks of phone calls and e-mails. “The multiplicity of programs and needs just doesn't have a place to meet,” says Adel Mahmoud of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and a member of the Scientists Without Borders advisory council. The new database “is an attractive platform from that point of view,” he says. The site has the potential to foster not only “north-south partnerships, but also south-south partnerships,” says fellow advisory council member Peter Hotez, President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Alice Dautry, Director General of the Pasteur Institute and also an advisory council member, says “having a tool that would help people find partners that are complementary when they need it could really be of great use, especially in places where there is not so much information about whatever is going on, including in neighboring countries.” And Mohamed H.A. Hassan, Executive Director of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World and another advisory council member, emphasizes that “many of the countries in Africa—the least developed countries—have a good number of world-class scientists who now work and live in other countries. Such a website may facilitate the linkages between the scientific communities in those countries and the diaspora scientists.” Like other networking websites such as LinkedIn, the Scientists Without Borders database allows users to register and fill out a profile with information such as goals, academic degrees, a biography, publications, practical skills, and experience. In addition, members can list resources: those that they need and those that they are offering. For example, the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Ghana lists a DNA sequencer, PCR machines, and bacteriologists as available resources; meanwhile, the Kenyan Retinoblastoma Strategy (a project run by Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children to help diagnose and treat pediatric retinal tumors) lists a microtome and an automobile as resources it needs. Microbiologist Fitnat Yildiz at the University of California, Santa Cruz has posted a request for stool samples from cholera patients and for environmental samples from endemic areas. Yildiz wants to test whether agents that block the ability of a laboratory strain of Vibrio cholerae to form biofilms act similarly on natural isolates of this bacterial pathogen. And it is not only principal investigators of research labs who are using the database—for example, chemistry graduate student Margaret Mkambankhani at the University of Malawi, who studies amino acids in tuber crops, needs access to equipment such as a HPLC machine and an amino acid analyzer. Profiles can be registered by institutions, projects, or individuals and members can view profiles and send e-mails through the site (although e-mail addresses are protected). Why anyone needs a database like this is “a very easy question to answer,” says Seth Berkley, President and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and an advisory council member. “The harder question is: Will it work?” The site's success will depend upon how many people register and the quality of the information they provide, he emphasizes. “The initial step to fill the database will take some time,” says Dautry. “People tend to be busy with other things. But I understand that [the site] is user friendly and not so difficult…Once it gets going, it will snowball.” In the four months since the site began registration and with very little publicity, hundreds of individuals and more than 60 projects and 100 organizations have created profiles, says Scientists Without Borders Executive Director Evelyn Strauss. Hassan says that numerous parties will benefit from the website. “This matching of the supply and demand can help a lot in creating these linkages and partnerships between countries and institutions and individuals. But hopefully the people who are going to benefit the most from such interactions would be those people who work and live in the science- and technology-lagging countries, those who are really isolated.” The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World has identified 80 such countries, Hassan says, and it is distributing information about the website to all of its networks in those countries. “I'm very optimistic that we will get a good number of institutions and individuals to register.” Members who want to find a match can use the search function to identify profiles based on geographic location, area of expertise, and whether resources are needed or available. The search engine is “pretty smart,” says Strauss. For example, she says, someone who searches for a “teacher” will bring up profiles that have “instructor” or “instruction” in the description. The fields in the database allow users to type in the terms that they want, and the search engine can be customized to accommodate scientific terms. The database's design grew out of Strauss's discussions with researchers, project leaders, and organization heads. “I interviewed dozens of people in the developing world and in the developed world, saying what do you think of this idea in general? How would you use such a site?” she says. “And I tried to translate people's answers into site content and functionality.” For example, those conversations prompted Strauss to add a field to the database called “Lessons Learned” where members can discuss their experiences, thus improving efficiency and preventing duplication of effort. On a trip to the West African nation of Ghana, Strauss realized the practical challenges that the new database would face. Internet connections in Africa can be excruciatingly slow—a webpage might take nearly an hour to load, compared to just a couple of seconds in regions with a high-bandwidth connection. To alleviate that problem, Scientists Without Borders has created a low-bandwidth version of the website without a lot of images and other features that would slow it down. Also, frequent power outages in the developing world interrupt computer usage, so web-based tasks often cannot be completed in one sitting. Hence, database registration forms will allow users to save their information after each page. Information can be entered by e-mail, and the Scientists Without Borders team is also developing a way to access the database via mobile phones. Although not everyone has reliable access to a computer in the developing world, cell phone use is widespread. The high-bandwidth version incorporates features designed to give members a visual representation of the Scientists Without Borders community. A link called “Globe Trekker” overlays profile information on a Google map, showing the geographical location of individuals, projects, and organizations. Members will be able to home in on a particular area of the world and obtain a snapshot of resource needs and availability there. Although Scientists Without Borders has not done any formal marketing, news of the site is spreading by word-of-mouth. When the site goes live this week, it will include a feature familiar to users of social networking sites like LinkedIn, where members can send invitations to others to join and then that connection will be visible on the new user's profile. “We're asking everyone who is involved to reach out to their constituents and their contacts,” Strauss says. Scientists without Borders “belongs to the community. That's who will use it and that's who is creating its content.” In the short term, “success is going to be hearing about connections that were made through the site that would not have been made otherwise,” says Strauss. In the long term, Scientists Without Borders might provide a way for multiple diverse organizations to join forces. In the area of global health, Mahmoud says the database has the potential to change how initiatives are proposed and funded. “The whole culture works on the assumption that what I'm proposing has never been done before, and I'm the only one who can do it,” he says. “The funder wants to say: I am doing something unique.” He hopes that the database will encourage funders to see that there is no single solution and that it will take a multitude of complementary solutions to help solve the most urgent problems of the developing world. According to Hassan, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World has collected more than 300 case studies of successful and innovative applications of science and technology to real-world problems in developing countries. “It would be very useful for those institutions…to register in this website and show their case studies and successful experiences,” he says. “This will be of great benefit, not only in terms of south-south cooperation but also north-south cooperation, because some of our colleagues in the north may also need to know who are the best scientists in the south, what are the best projects, what are the success stories in the south.” Strauss echoes Hassan's view that scientists in both developed and developing countries will benefit from the Scientists Without Borders database. Says Strauss, “In addition to advancing their own research—by gathering samples or developing new collaborations—scientists in the developed world can use their specialized expertise to connect with people across the world. Teaching is one obvious thing to do, but even people who don't want to leave home could make a significant difference by editing one manuscript a year or mentoring a graduate student. The opportunity to contribute to the global scientific community in this way is unusual and could be extremely gratifying.”"
