https://openalex.org/W2055699832,"THE observations reported here were made in the course of preliminary experiments concerned with the electrical changes which vagal and sympathetic nerve impulses produce in the pace-maker region of the heart. The preparation was the sinus venosus of the frog together with its nerve supply (one or both vagi; more recently, the intra-cranial roots and sympathetic components of the vagus were prepared for separate stimulation). A micro-electrode was used for intracellular recording of the membrane potential, the electrode being introduced into the sinus through the exposed sino-auricular ostium or through the cut inferior vena cava. Although the nervous control of the heart is not restricted to its pace-maker region, we were especially interested in the mechanism by which nerve impulses regulate the beat frequency, and an attempt was therefore made to place the recording electrode as close as possible to the point of origin of the rhythmic activity. This place can be recognized by the appearance of a slow depolarization preceding each action potential1,2, and the accompanying records were obtained from such regions."

https://openalex.org/W2050534633,"AMONG the herbaceous plants which Bate-Smith and Lerner1 have recently found to contain leuco-anthocyanins were Impatiens noli-tangere and I. parviflora of the Balsaminaceae. We have been investigating the genetic control of anthocyanin pigmentation in Impatiens balsamina, which has been reported previously to produce glycosides of pelargonidin, peonidin and malvidin2. In the course of these studies we have obtained evidence that the leuco-anthocyanins may serve as precursors for the anthocyanin pigments. In view of current interest in the leuco-anthocyanins, this aspect of the work is presented here."

When coitus occurred between 8 and 10 a.m., nearly 9 per cent of the eggs became polyspermic, whereas after normal mating only a little more than 1 per cent were polyspermic. These results were obtained in Sydney, Australia, with rats of an albino type."

https://openalex.org/W1974217961,"IN this laboratory control hatchings of 95 per cent normal control tadpoles are regularly obtained from cross-fertilized eggs of Ciona intestinalis. The addition of phenylthiourea to the sea water in which they are developing produces a characteristic abnormality, which has been obtained regularly. A concentration of 0.001 per cent is effective, but not 0.0001 per cent. Apart from the interference with melanization of sensory vesicle structures, which is known in vertebrates1, this drug prevents the normal elongation of the notochord. Such tadpoles have short curved tails and do not swim. They remain unchanged after hatching for up to five days, when some attempt metamorphosis, which may be successful in the lower concentrations. Control tadpoles are usually 100 per cent attached and metamorphosing 24 hr. after hatching. When the monsters are placed in normal sea water on hatching, they remain unchanged except for melanization of the sensory vesicle. If, however, they are placed in 0.2 per cent phenylalanine in sea water, the tails are absorbed in 24 hr.; dihydroxyphenylalanine, thyroxine and tyrosine are loss effective, approximately in that order. Glycine and alanine do not have this action."

https://openalex.org/W2007659078,"THE human binocular threshold is more than 10 per cent lower than the monocular one. This finding has been explained on a statistical basis by Pirenne1, who assumed that the two eyes are independent. The extent to which binocular vision lowers the threshold depends on the relation between stimulus and response and on the absolute value of the threshold. The lower the threshold, tho greater is the benefit."

https://openalex.org/W2074541781,"CONANT1 first put forward the idea that the hæms in hæmoglobin are held by two bonds of unequal strength between the iron and groups in the protein on both sides of the hæm disk, the weaker bond breaking when combination with oxygen, carbon monoxide, etc., occurs. This crevice configuration has been elaborated to explain various features of its reactions by Coryell and Pauling, Wyman, and St. George and Pauling; but Keilin has laid stress on other aspects, particularly the combination with large molecules such as nitrosobenzene and 4-methyl imidazole, which suggest that the hæm iron is not embedded in a crevice but is readily accessible2."

https://openalex.org/W2011071557,"A LOWERING of brain potassium has been demonstrated in insulin-induced hypoglycaemic encephalopathy in cats1. As ovine pregnancy toxaemia has been tentatively identified as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy2, determinations were made of the potassium content of slices, approximately 2 mm. thick, taken from the surface of the cerebral cortex of sheep dead, or in extremis, from either pregnancy toxaemia or prolonged insulin hypoglycaemia. Similar samples wore taken from normal sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2053188222,"ALTHOUGH the ferret is widely used as an experimental animal, particularly in the study of virus diseases, very little work has been done on the commensal bacteria of the animal itself. Some work on its pathological conditions has been published by Hughes1, Momberg-Jorgensen2, Symmers and Thomson3, Symmers, Thomson and Iland4, and Skulski and Symmers5; but none has been found concerning the bacterial flora which can commonly be isolated from the mouth and intestine of the healthy ferret. The present investigation was made to study this flora, in a colony of tuberculosis-free ferrets, maintained in first-class conditions, which has its own unit of breeding gills, and is augmented at intervals by fresh stock purchased from breeders in the surrounding area."
