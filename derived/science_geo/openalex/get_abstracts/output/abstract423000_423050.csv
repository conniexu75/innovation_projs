https://openalex.org/W2069045437,"Cytoplasmic inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) or Fused in sarcoma (FUS) are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and several subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FUS-positive inclusions in FTLD and ALS patients are consistently co-labeled with stress granule (SG) marker proteins. Whether TDP-43 inclusions contain SG markers is currently still debated. We determined the requirements for SG recruitment of FUS and TDP-43 and found that cytoplasmic mislocalization is a common prerequisite for SG recruitment of FUS and TDP-43. For FUS, the arginine-glycine-glycine zinc finger domain, which is the protein's main RNA binding domain, is most important for SG recruitment, whereas the glycine-rich domain and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain have a minor contribution and the glutamine-rich domain is dispensable. For TDP-43, both the RRM1 and the C-terminal glycine-rich domain are required for SG localization. ALS-associated point mutations located in the glycine-rich domain of TDP-43 do not affect SG recruitment. Interestingly, a 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43, which is enriched in FTLD/ALS cortical inclusions but not spinal cord inclusions, fails to be recruited into SG. Consistently, inclusions in the cortex of FTLD patients, which are enriched for C-terminal fragments, are not co-labeled with the SG marker poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP-1), whereas inclusions in spinal cord, which contain full-length TDP-43, are frequently positive for this marker protein."
https://openalex.org/W2128073839,"Mutations of clock genes can lead to diabetes and obesity. REV-ERBα, a nuclear receptor involved in the circadian clockwork, has been shown to control lipid metabolism. To gain insight into the role of REV-ERBα in energy homeostasis in vivo, we explored daily metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in chow-fed, unfed, or high-fat-fed Rev-erbα−/− mice and their wild-type littermates. Chow-fed Rev-erbα−/− mice displayed increased adiposity (2.5-fold) and mild hyperglycemia (∼10%) without insulin resistance. Indirect calorimetry indicates that chow-fed Rev-erbα−/− mice utilize more fatty acids during daytime. A 24-h nonfeeding period in Rev-erbα−/− animals favors further fatty acid mobilization at the expense of glycogen utilization and gluconeogenesis, without triggering hypoglycemia and hypothermia. High-fat feeding in Rev-erbα−/− mice amplified metabolic disturbances, including expression of lipogenic factors. Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) gene, critical in lipid utilization/storage, is triggered in liver at night and constitutively up-regulated (∼ 2-fold) in muscle and adipose tissue of Rev-erbα−/− mice. We show that CLOCK, up-regulated (2-fold) at night in Rev-erbα−/− mice, can transactivate Lpl. Thus, overexpression of Lpl facilitates muscle fatty acid utilization and contributes to fat overload. This study demonstrates the importance of clock-driven Lpl expression in energy balance and highlights circadian disruption as a potential cause for the metabolic syndrome.—Delezie, J., Dumont, S., Dardente, H., Oudart, H., Gréchez-Cassiau, A., Klosen, P., Teboul, M., Delaunay, F., Pévet, P., Challet, E.

https://openalex.org/W2098156671,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) develops from birth through late adolescence. This extended developmental trajectory provides many opportunities for experience to shape the structure and function of the PFC. To date, a few studies have reported links between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and prefrontal function in childhood, raising the possibility that aspects of environment associated with SES impact prefrontal function. Considering that behavioral measures of prefrontal function are associated with learning across multiple domains, this is an important area of investigation. In this study, we used fMRI to replicate previous findings, demonstrating an association between parental SES and PFC function during childhood. In addition, we present two hypothetical mechanisms by which SES could come to affect PFC function of this association: language environment and stress reactivity. We measured language use in the home environment and change in salivary cortisol before and after fMRI scanning. Complexity of family language, but not the child's own language use, was associated with both parental SES and PFC activation. Change in salivary cortisol was also associated with both SES and PFC activation. These observed associations emphasize the importance of both enrichment and adversity-reduction interventions in creating good developmental environments for all children."
https://openalex.org/W2049196411,"Members of the Asteroidea (phylum Echinodermata), popularly known as starfish or sea stars, are ecologically important and diverse members of marine ecosystems in all of the world's oceans. We present a comprehensive overview of diversity and phylogeny as they have figured into the evolution of the Asteroidea from Paleozoic to the living fauna. Living post-Paleozoic asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically separate from those in the Paleozoic. Early Paleozoic asteroid faunas were diverse and displayed morphology that foreshadowed later living taxa. Preservation presents significant difficulties, but fossil occurrence and current accounts suggests a diverse Paleozoic fauna, which underwent extinction around the Permian-Triassic interval was followed by re-diversification of at least one surviving lineage. Ongoing phylogenetic classification debates include the status of the Paxillosida and the Concentricycloidea. Fossil and molecular evidence has been and continues to be part of the ongoing evolution of asteroid phylogenetic research. The modern lineages of asteroids include the Valvatacea, the Forcipulatacea, the Spinlosida, and the Velatida. We present an overview of diversity in these taxa, as well as brief notes on broader significance, ecology, and functional morphology of each. Although much asteroid taxonomy is stable, many new taxa remain to be discovered with many new species currently awaiting description. The Goniasteridae is currently one of the most diverse families within the Asteroidea. New data from molecular phylogenetics and the advent of global biodiversity databases, such as the World Asteroidea Database (http://www.marinespecies.org/Asteroidea/) present important new springboards for understanding the global biodiversity and evolution of asteroids."
https://openalex.org/W2131056822,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction and translocation of endotoxins are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Exposure to ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde at relatively high concentrations have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelial tight junctions in the conventional two dimensional cell culture models. The present study investigated quantitatively and qualitatively the effects of ethanol at concentrations detected in the blood after moderate ethanol consumption, of its metabolite acetaldehyde and of the combination of both compounds on intestinal barrier function in a three-dimensional cell culture model.Caco-2 cells were grown in a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel™) to induce spheroid formation and were then exposed to the compounds at the basolateral side. Morphological differentiation of the spheroids was assessed by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. The barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-labeled dextran from the basal side into the spheroids' luminal compartment using confocal microscopy. Caco-2 cells grown on Matrigel assembled into fully differentiated and polarized spheroids with a central lumen, closely resembling enterocytes in vivo and provide an excellent model to study epithelial barrier functionality. Exposure to ethanol (10-40 mM) or acetaldehyde (25-200 µM) for 3 h, dose-dependently and additively increased the paracellular permeability and induced redistribution of ZO-1 and occludin without affecting cell viability or tight junction-encoding gene expression. Furthermore, ethanol and acetaldehyde induced lysine residue and microtubules hyperacetylation.These results indicate that ethanol at concentrations found in the blood after moderate drinking and acetaldehyde, alone and in combination, can increase the intestinal epithelial permeability. The data also point to the involvement of protein hyperacetylation in ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced loss of tight junctions integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2030691215,"Background Since most published articles comparing the performance of artificial neural network (ANN) models and logistic regression (LR) models for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes used only a single dataset, the essential issue of internal validity (reproducibility) of the models has not been addressed. The study purposes to validate the use of ANN model for predicting in-hospital mortality in HCC surgery patients in Taiwan and to compare the predictive accuracy of ANN with that of LR model. Methodology/Principal Findings Patients who underwent a HCC surgery during the period from 1998 to 2009 were included in the study. This study retrospectively compared 1,000 pairs of LR and ANN models based on initial clinical data for 22,926 HCC surgery patients. For each pair of ANN and LR models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) statistics and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired T-tests. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative significance of input parameters in the system model and the relative importance of variables. Compared to the LR models, the ANN models had a better accuracy rate in 97.28% of cases, a better H-L statistic in 41.18% of cases, and a better AUROC curve in 84.67% of cases. Surgeon volume was the most influential (sensitive) parameter affecting in-hospital mortality followed by age and lengths of stay. Conclusions/Significance In comparison with the conventional LR model, the ANN model in the study was more accurate in predicting in-hospital mortality and had higher overall performance indices. Further studies of this model may consider the effect of a more detailed database that includes complications and clinical examination findings as well as more detailed outcome data."
https://openalex.org/W2091434498,"There is growing evidence that genetic risk factors for common disease are caused by hereditary changes of gene regulation acting in complex pathways. Clearly understanding the molecular genetic relationships between genetic control of gene expression and its effect on complex diseases is essential. Here we describe the Brisbane Systems Genetics Study (BSGS), a family-based study that will be used to elucidate the genetic factors affecting gene expression and the role of gene regulation in mediating endophenotypes and complex diseases. BSGS comprises of a total of 962 individuals from 314 families, for which we have high-density genotype, gene expression and phenotypic data. Families consist of combinations of both monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, their siblings, and, for 72 families, both parents. A significant advantage of the inclusion of parents is improved power to disentangle environmental, additive genetic and non-additive genetic effects of gene expression and measured phenotypes. Furthermore, it allows for the estimation of parent-of-origin effects, something that has not previously been systematically investigated in human genetical genomics studies. Measured phenotypes available within the BSGS include blood phenotypes and biochemical traits measured from components of the tissue sample in which transcription levels are determined, providing an ideal test case for systems genetics approaches. We report results from an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using 862 individuals from BSGS to test for associations between expression levels of 17,926 probes and 528,509 SNP genotypes. At a study wide significance level approximately 15,000 associations were observed between expression levels and SNP genotypes. These associations corresponded to a total of 2,081 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) involving 1,503 probes. The majority of identified eQTL (87%) were located within cis-regions."
https://openalex.org/W1986875558,"Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) have stem cell-like features and immunomodulatory properties. Here we show that hAEC significantly suppressed splenocyte proliferation in vitro and potently attenuated a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Central nervous system (CNS) CD3+ T cell and F4/80+ monocyte/macrophage infiltration and demyelination were significantly reduced with hAEC treatment. Besides the known secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), we report the novel finding that hAEC utilize transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) for immunosuppression. Neutralization of TGF-β or PGE2 in splenocyte proliferation assays significantly reduced hAEC-induced suppression. Splenocytes from hAEC-treated mice showed a Th2 cytokine shift with significantly elevated IL-5 production. While transferred CFSE-labeled hAEC could be detected in the lung, none were identified in the CNS or in lymphoid organs. This is the first report documenting the therapeutic effect of hAEC in a MS-like model and suggest that hAEC may have potential for use as therapy for MS."
https://openalex.org/W1998988785,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are one of the groups most at risk for HIV infection in Japan. However, size estimates of MSM populations have not been conducted with sufficient frequency and rigor because of the difficulty, high cost and stigma associated with reaching such populations. This study examined an innovative and simple method for estimating the size of the MSM population in Japan. We combined an internet survey with the network scale-up method, a social network method for estimating the size of hard-to-reach populations, for the first time in Japan.An internet survey was conducted among 1,500 internet users who registered with a nationwide internet-research agency. The survey participants were asked how many members of particular groups with known population sizes (firepersons, police officers, and military personnel) they knew as acquaintances. The participants were also asked to identify the number of their acquaintances whom they understood to be MSM. Using these survey results with the network scale-up method, the personal network size and MSM population size were estimated. The personal network size was estimated to be 363.5 regardless of the sex of the acquaintances and 174.0 for only male acquaintances. The estimated MSM prevalence among the total male population in Japan was 0.0402% without adjustment, and 2.87% after adjusting for the transmission error of MSM.The estimated personal network size and MSM prevalence seen in this study were comparable to those from previous survey results based on the direct-estimation method. Estimating population sizes through combining an internet survey with the network scale-up method appeared to be an effective method from the perspectives of rapidity, simplicity, and low cost as compared with more-conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W2023925184,"Our research on pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis led to the discovery that antibodies specific for Candida albicans cell surface β-1, 2-mannotriose [β-(Man)(3)] protect mice. A 14 mer peptide Fba, which derived from the N-terminal portion of the C. albicans cytosolic/cell surface protein fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, was used as the glycan carrier and resulted in a novel synthetic glycopeptide vaccine β-(Man)(3)-Fba. By a dendritic cell-based immunization approach, this conjugate induced protective antibody responses against both the glycan and peptide parts of the vaccine. In this report, we modified the β-(Man)(3)-Fba conjugate by coupling it to tetanus toxoid (TT) in order to improve immunogenicity and allow for use of an adjuvant suitable for human use. By new immunization procedures entirely compatible with human use, the modified β-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT was administered either alone or as a mixture made with alum or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants and given to mice by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Mice vaccinated with or, surprisingly, without adjuvant responded well by making robust antibody responses. The immunized groups showed a high degree of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans as evidenced by increased survival times and reduced kidney fungal burden as compared to control groups that received only adjuvant or DPBS buffer prior to challenge. To confirm that induced antibodies were protective, sera from mice immunized against the β-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT conjugate transferred protection against disseminated candidiasis to naïve mice, whereas C. albicans-absorbed immune sera did not. Similar antibody responses and protection induced by the β-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT vaccine was observed in inbred BALB/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. We conclude that addition of TT to the glycopeptide conjugate results in a self-adjuvanting vaccine that promotes robust antibody responses without the need for additional adjuvant, which is novel and represents a major step forward in vaccine design against disseminated candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2079645322,"Background Activated endothelial cells release plasma membrane submicron vesicles expressing CD62E (E-selectin) into blood, known as endothelial microparticles (EMPs). We studied whether the levels of endothelial microparticles expressing CD62E+, CD31+/Annexin-V+, or CD31+/CD42− predict cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stroke history. Methods/Principal Findings Patients with stroke history at least 3 months prior to enrolment were recruited. Peripheral blood EMP levels were measured by flow cytometry. Major cardiovascular events and death were monitored for 36 months. Three hundred patients were enrolled, of which 298 completed the study according to protocol. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 29 patients (9.7%). Nine patients died, five from cardiovascular causes. Cumulative event-free survival rates were lower in patients with high levels of CD62E+ microparticles. Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, medications and stroke etiologic groups showed an association between a high CD62E+ microparticle level and a risk of major cardiovascular events and hospitalization. Levels of other kinds of EMPs expressing CD31+/Annexin-V+ or CD31+/CD42− markers were not predictive of cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusion A high level of CD62E+ microparticles is associated with cardiovascular events in patients with stroke history, suggesting that the systemic endothelial activation increases the risk for cardiovascular morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2064518489,"Candida orthopsilosis is closely related to the fungal pathogen Candida parapsilosis. However, whereas C. parapsilosis is a major cause of disease in immunosuppressed individuals and in premature neonates, C. orthopsilosis is more rarely associated with infection. We sequenced the C. orthopsilosis genome to facilitate the identification of genes associated with virulence. Here, we report the de novo assembly and annotation of the genome of a Type 2 isolate of C. orthopsilosis. The sequence was obtained by combining data from next generation sequencing (454 Life Sciences and Illumina) with paired-end Sanger reads from a fosmid library. The final assembly contains 12.6 Mb on 8 chromosomes. The genome was annotated using an automated pipeline based on comparative analysis of genomes of Candida species, together with manual identification of introns. We identified 5700 protein-coding genes in C. orthopsilosis, of which 5570 have an ortholog in C. parapsilosis. The time of divergence between C. orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis is estimated to be twice as great as that between Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis. There has been an expansion of the Hyr/Iff family of cell wall genes and the JEN family of monocarboxylic transporters in C. parapsilosis relative to C. orthopsilosis. We identified one gene from a Maltose/Galactoside O-acetyltransferase family that originated by horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium to the common ancestor of C. orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis. We report that TFB3, a component of the general transcription factor TFIIH, undergoes alternative splicing by intron retention in multiple Candida species. We also show that an intein in the vacuolar ATPase gene VMA1 is present in C. orthopsilosis but not C. parapsilosis, and has a patchy distribution in Candida species. Our results suggest that the difference in virulence between C. parapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis may be associated with expansion of gene families."
https://openalex.org/W1964404485,"Background Farrerol, isolated from rhododendron, has been shown to have the anti-bacterial activity, but no details on the anti-inflammatory activity. We further evaluated the effects of this compound in two experimental models of lung diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings For the asthma model, female BALB/c mice were challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), and then treated daily with farrerol (20 and 40 mg/kg, ip) as a therapeutic treatment from day 22 to day 26 post immunization. To induce acute lung injury, female BALB/c mice were injected intranasally with LPS and treated with farrerol (20 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h prior to LPS stimulation. Inflammation in the two different models was determined using ELISA, histology, real-time PCR and western blot. Farrerol significantly regulated the phenotype challenged by OVA, like cell number, Th1 and Th2 cytokines levels in the BALF, the OVA-specific IgE level in the serum, goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway, airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine and mRNA expression of chemokines and their receptors. Furthermore, farrerol markedly attenuated the activation of phosphorylation of Akt and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunit p65 both in vivo and in vitro. However, farrerol has no effect on the acute lung injury model. Conclusion/Significance Our finding demonstrates that the distinct anti-inflammatory effect of farrerol in the treatment of asthma acts by inhibiting the PI3K and NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1992580566,"Hepatic steatosis is a prominent feature in patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency. The ubiquitin ligase SOCS2 attenuates hepatic GH signaling by inhibiting the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b) axis. Here, we investigated the role of SOCS2 in the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. SOCS2-knockout (SOCS2(-/-)) mice and wild-type littermates were fed for 4 mo with control or high-fat diet, followed by assessment of insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid content, and expression of inflammatory cytokines. SOCS2(-/-) mice exhibited increased hepatic TG secretion by 77.6% (P<0.001) as compared with wild-type control mice and were protected from high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, showing 49.3% (P<0.01) reduction in liver TG levels compared to HFD-fed wild-type littermates. In contrast, we found that HFD-triggered attenuation of systemic insulin sensitivity was more marked in SOCS2(-/-) mice. Livers from the HFD-fed SOCS2(-/-) mice showed increased NF-κB activity as well as elevated expression of genes for the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6. An inhibitory role of SOCS2 on Toll-like receptor 4 signaling was demonstrated in macrophages obtained from the SOCS2(-/-) and wild-type mice. This study identified SOCS2 as an important regulator of hepatic homeostasis under conditions of high-fat dietary stress."
https://openalex.org/W2042791419,"Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of mammary carcinoma. Despite expressing basal markers, typical of mammary stem cells, this tumor has been proposed to originate from luminal progenitors, which are downstream of stem cells along the mammary epithelial hierarchy. This suggests that committed luminal progenitors may reacquire basal, stem-like characteristics, but the mechanisms that regulate this transition remain unclear. Using mouse models, we found that luminal progenitors express high levels of the Met receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as compared with the other mammary epithelial sub-populations. Constitutive activation of Met led luminal progenitors to attain stem cell properties, including enhanced clonogenic activity in vitro and de novo ability to reconstitute mammary glands in repopulation assays in vivo. Moreover, in response to Met signaling, luminal progenitors gave rise to hyperplastic ductal morphogenesis and preferentially underwent basal lineage commitment at the expense of luminal cell-fate specification. Opposite and symmetric results were produced by systemic pharmacological inhibition of Met. Hence, Met signaling targets luminal progenitors for expansion, impairs their differentiation toward the mature luminal phenotype and enables their commitment toward the basal lineage. These results emphasize a critical role for Met in promoting deregulated proliferation and basal plasticity of normal luminal progenitors in the mammary gland, a complex of events that may be required for sustaining the functional and phenotypic properties of basal-like breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1995792248,"Chronic infections resulting from biofilm formation are difficult to eradicate with current antimicrobial agents and consequently new therapies are needed. This work demonstrates that the carbon monoxide-releasing molecule CORM-2, previously shown to kill planktonic bacteria, also attenuates surface-associated growth of the gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by both preventing biofilm maturation and killing bacteria within the established biofilm. CORM-2 treatment has an additive effect when combined with tobramycin, a drug commonly used to treat P. aeruginosa lung infections. CORM-2 inhibited biofilm formation and planktonic growth of the majority of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates tested, for both mucoid and non-mucoid strains. While CORM-2 treatment increased the production of reactive oxygen species by P. aeruginosa biofilms, this increase did not correlate with bacterial death. These data demonstrate that CO-RMs possess potential novel therapeutic properties against a subset of P. aeruginosa biofilm related infections."
https://openalex.org/W2003522581,"A decrease in functional beta-cell mass is a key feature of type 2 diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues induce proliferation of rodent beta-cells. However, the proliferative capacity of human beta-cells and its modulation by GLP-1 analogues remain to be fully investigated. We therefore sought to quantify adult human beta-cell proliferation in vitro and whether this is affected by the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide.Human islets from 7 adult cadaveric organ donors were dispersed into single cells. Beta-cells were purified by FACS. Non-sorted cells and the beta-cell enriched (""beta-cells"") population were plated on extracellular matrix from rat (804G) and human bladder carcinoma cells (HTB9) or bovine corneal endothelial ECM (BCEC). Cells were maintained in culture+/-liraglutide for 4 days in the presence of BrdU.Rare human beta-cell proliferation could be observed either in the purified beta-cell population (0.051±0.020%; 22 beta-cells proliferating out of 84'283 beta-cells counted) or in the non-sorted cell population (0.055±0.011%; 104 proliferating beta-cells out of 232'826 beta-cells counted), independently of the matrix or the culture conditions. Liraglutide increased human beta-cell proliferation on BCEC in the non-sorted cell population (0.082±0.034% proliferating beta-cells vs. 0.017±0.008% in control, p<0.05).These results indicate that adult human beta-cell proliferation can occur in vitro but remains an extremely rare event with these donors and particular culture conditions. Liraglutide increases beta-cell proliferation only in the non-sorted cell population and only on BCEC. However, it cannot be excluded that human beta-cells may proliferate to a greater extent in situ in response to natural stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2018308958,"It is not known why survival differs between men and women in oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present study evaluates differences in comorbidity between men and women, and tests the hypothesis that comorbidity contributes to sex-related differences in mortality in oxygen-dependent COPD.National prospective study of patients aged 50 years or older, starting long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for COPD in Sweden between 1992 and 2008. Comorbidities were obtained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. Sex-related differences in comorbidity were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, smoking status and year of inclusion. The effect of comorbidity on overall mortality and the interaction between comorbidity and sex were evaluated using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, Pa(O2) breathing air, FEV(1), smoking history and year of inclusion.In total, 8,712 patients (55% women) were included and 6,729 patients died during the study period. No patient was lost to follow-up. Compared with women, men had significantly more arrhythmia, cancer, ischemic heart disease and renal failure, and less hypertension, mental disorders, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (P<0.05 for all odds ratios). Comorbidity was an independent predictor of mortality, and the effect was similar for the sexes. Women had lower mortality, which remained unchanged even after adjusting for comorbidity; hazard ratio 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.77; P<0.001).Comorbidity is different in men and women, but does not explain the sex-related difference in mortality in oxygen-dependent COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2062939612,"Mechanical loading of bone induces interstitial fluid flow, leading to fluid shear stress (FSS) of osteoblasts. FSS rapidly increases the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]) and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in osteoblasts and activates the protein kinase Akt. Activated Akt stimulates osteoblast proliferation and survival, but the mechanism(s) leading to Akt activation is not well defined. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in primary human and mouse osteoblasts and mouse MC3T3 osteoblast-like cells, we found that Akt activation by FSS occurred through two parallel pathways; one required calcium stimulation of NO synthase and NO/cGMP/protein kinase G II-dependent activation of Src, and the other required calcium activation of FAK and Src, independent of NO. Both pathways cooperated to increase PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation and were necessary for FSS to induce nuclear translocation of β-catenin, c-fos, and cox-2 gene expression and osteoblast proliferation. These data explain how mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts leads to increased signaling through a growth regulatory pathway essential for maintaining skeletal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2037832236,"Centromeres are specialized chromosome domains that control chromosome segregation during mitosis, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of their integrity. Centromeric ultrafine anaphase bridges are physiological DNA structures thought to contain unresolved DNA catenations between the centromeres separating during anaphase. BLM and PICH helicases colocalize at these ultrafine anaphase bridges and promote their resolution. As PICH is detectable at centromeres from prometaphase onwards, we hypothesized that BLM might also be located at centromeres and that the two proteins might cooperate to resolve DNA catenations before the onset of anaphase. Using immunofluorescence analyses, we demonstrated the recruitment of BLM to centromeres from G2 phase to mitosis. With a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, RNA interference, chromosome spreads and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that both BLM-deficient and PICH-deficient prometaphase cells displayed changes in centromere structure. These cells also had a higher frequency of centromeric non disjunction in the absence of cohesin, suggesting the persistence of catenations. Both proteins were required for the correct recruitment to the centromere of active topoisomerase IIα, an enzyme specialized in the catenation/decatenation process. These observations reveal the existence of a functional relationship between BLM, PICH and topoisomerase IIα in the centromere decatenation process. They indicate that the higher frequency of centromeric ultrafine anaphase bridges in BLM-deficient cells and in cells treated with topoisomerase IIα inhibitors is probably due not only to unresolved physiological ultrafine anaphase bridges, but also to newly formed ultrafine anaphase bridges. We suggest that BLM and PICH cooperate in rendering centromeric catenates accessible to topoisomerase IIα, thereby facilitating correct centromere disjunction and preventing the formation of supernumerary centromeric ultrafine anaphase bridges."
https://openalex.org/W2085608491,"Normal tissue toxicity still remains a dose-limiting factor in clinical radiation therapy. Recently, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) was reported as an essential mediator of late radiation-induced intestinal injury. However, it is not clear whether PAI-1 plays a role in acute radiation-induced intestinal damage and we hypothesized that PAI-1 may play a role in the endothelium radiosensitivity. In vivo, in a model of radiation enteropathy in PAI-1 −/− mice, apoptosis of radiosensitive compartments, epithelial and microvascular endothelium was quantified. In vitro, the role of PAI-1 in the radiation-induced endothelial cells (ECs) death was investigated. The level of apoptotic ECs is lower in PAI-1 −/− compared with Wt mice after irradiation. This is associated with a conserved microvascular density and consequently with a better mucosal integrity in PAI-1 −/− mice. In vitro, irradiation rapidly stimulates PAI-1 expression in ECs and radiation sensitivity is increased in ECs that stably overexpress PAI-1, whereas PAI-1 knockdown increases EC survival after irradiation. Moreover, ECs prepared from PAI-1 −/− mice are more resistant to radiation-induced cell death than Wt ECs and this is associated with activation of the Akt pathway. This study demonstrates that PAI-1 plays a key role in radiation-induced EC death in the intestine and suggests that this contributes strongly to the progression of radiation-induced intestinal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2047669202,"The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is a critical component of the neural circuit regulating fear learning. During fear learning and recall, the amygdala and other brain regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, exhibit phase-locked oscillations in the high delta/low theta frequency band (∼2–6 Hz) that have been shown to contribute to the learning process. Network oscillations are commonly generated by inhibitory synaptic input that coordinates action potentials in groups of neurons. In the rat BLA, principal neurons spontaneously receive synchronized, inhibitory input in the form of compound, rhythmic, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), likely originating from burst-firing parvalbumin interneurons. Here we investigated the role of compound IPSPs in the rat and rhesus macaque BLA in regulating action potential synchrony and spike-timing precision. Furthermore, because principal neurons exhibit intrinsic oscillatory properties and resonance between 4 and 5 Hz, in the same frequency band observed during fear, we investigated whether compound IPSPs and intrinsic oscillations interact to promote rhythmic activity in the BLA at this frequency. Using whole-cell patch clamp in brain slices, we demonstrate that compound IPSPs, which occur spontaneously and are synchronized across principal neurons in both the rat and primate BLA, significantly improve spike-timing precision in BLA principal neurons for a window of ∼300 ms following each IPSP. We also show that compound IPSPs coordinate the firing of pairs of BLA principal neurons, and significantly improve spike synchrony for a window of ∼130 ms. Compound IPSPs enhance a 5 Hz calcium-dependent membrane potential oscillation (MPO) in these neurons, likely contributing to the improvement in spike-timing precision and synchronization of spiking. Activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade enhanced the MPO, and inhibition of this cascade blocked the MPO. We discuss these results in the context of spike-timing dependent plasticity and modulation by neurotransmitters important for fear learning, such as dopamine."

The present study was designed to decipher the impact of perturbation in DevR-mediated signaling on these properties.M. tb complemented (Comp) strains expressing different levels of DevR were constructed in Mut1* background (expressing DevR N-terminal domain in fusion with AphI (DevR(N)-Kan) and in Mut2ΔdevR background (deletion mutant). They were compared for their hypoxia adaptation and virulence properties. Diverse phenotypes were noted; basal level expression (∼5.3±2.3 µM) when induced to levels equivalent to WT levels (∼25.8±9.3 µM) was associated with robust DevR regulon induction and hypoxic adaptation (Comp 9* and 10*), whereas low-level expression (detectable at transcript level) as in Comp 11* and Comp15 was associated with an adaptation defect. Intermediate-level expression (∼3.3±1.2 µM) partially restored hypoxic adaptation functions in Comp2, but not in Comp1* bacteria that co-expressed DevR(N)-Kan. Comp* strains in Mut1* background also exhibited diverse virulence phenotypes; high/very low-level DevR expression was associated with virulence whereas intermediate-level expression was associated with low virulence. Transcription profiling and gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of the phosphate starvation response (PSR) in Mut1* and Comp11* bacteria, but not in WT/Mut2ΔdevR/other Comp strains, indicating a plasticity in expression pathways that is determined by the magnitude of signaling perturbation through DevR(N)-Kan.A minimum DevR concentration of ∼3.3±1.2 µM (as in Comp2 bacteria) is required to support HspX expression in the standing culture hypoxia model. The relative intracellular concentrations of DevR and DevR(N)-Kan appear to be critical for determining dormancy regulon induction, hypoxic adaptation and virulence. Dysregulated DevR(N)-Kan-mediated signaling selectively triggers the PSR in bacteria expressing no/very low level of DevR. Our findings illustrate the important role of appropriate two-component-mediated signaling in pathogen physiology and the resilience of bacteria when such signaling is perturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2014651106,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of acute watery diarrhoea in developing countries. Colonization factors (CFs) on the bacterial surface mediate adhesion to the small intestinal epithelium. Two of the most common CFs worldwide are coli surface antigens 5 and 6 (CS5, CS6). In this study we investigated the expression of CS5 and CS6 in vivo, and the effects of bile and sodium bicarbonate, present in the human gut, on the expression of CS5. Five CS5+CS6 ETEC isolates from adult Bangladeshi patients with acute diarrhoea were studied. The level of transcription from the CS5 operon was approximately 100-fold higher than from the CS6 operon in ETEC bacteria recovered directly from diarrhoeal stool without sub-culturing (in vivo). The glyco-conjugated primary bile salt sodium glycocholate hydrate (NaGCH) induced phenotypic expression of CS5 in a dose-dependent manner and caused a 100-fold up-regulation of CS5 mRNA levels; this is the first description of NaGCH as an enteropathogenic virulence inducer. The relative transcription levels from the CS5 and CS6 operons in the presence of bile or NaGCH in vitro were similar to those in vivo. Another bile salt, sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), previously reported to induce enteropathogenic virulence, also induced expression of CS5, whereas sodium bicarbonate did not."
https://openalex.org/W2009483722,"An essential mode of acquired resistance to radiotherapy (RT) appears to be promotion of tumor cell motility and invasiveness in various cancer types, including glioblastoma, a process resembling ‘evasive resistance’. Hence, a logical advancement of RT would be to identify suitable complementary treatment strategies, ideally targeting cell motility. Here we report that the combination of focal RT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition using clinically relevant concentrations of temsirolimus (CCI-779) prolongs survival in a syngeneic mouse glioma model through additive cytostatic effects. In vitro, the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 exerted marked anti-invasive effects, irrespective of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 status and counteracted the proinvasive effect of sublethal irradiation. Mechanistically, we identified regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) as a novel target of mTOR inhibition and a key driver of glioblastoma invasiveness, sensitive to the anti-invasive properties of CCI-779. Notably, suppression of RGS4-dependent glioma cell invasion was signaled through both mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that high doses of CCI-779 may overcome tumor-cell resistance associated with the sole inhibition of mTORC1. We conclude that combined RT and mTOR inhibition is a promising therapeutic option that warrants further clinical investigation in upfront glioblastoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2009782661,"MKT-077, a rhodacyanine dye, was shown to produce cancer specific cell death. However, complications prevented the use of this compound beyond clinical trials. Here we describe YM-1, a derivative of MKT-077. We found that YM-1 was more cytotoxic and localized differently than MKT-077. YM-1 demonstrated this cytotoxicity across multiple cancer cell lines. This toxicity was limited to cancer cell lines; immortalized cell models were unaffected. Brief applications of YM-1 were found to be non-toxic. Brief treatment with YM-1 restored tamoxifen sensitivity to a refractory tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cell model. This effect is potentially due to altered estrogen receptor alpha phosphorylation, an outcome precipitated by selective reductions in Akt levels (Akt/PKB). Thus, modifications to the rhodocyanine scaffold could potentially be made to improve efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties. Moreover, the impact on tamoxifen sensitivity could be a new utility for this compound family."
https://openalex.org/W1966314637,"All basal ganglia subnuclei have recently been identified in lampreys, the phylogenetically oldest group of vertebrates. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of these nuclei is similar to mammals and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (dopaminergic) fibers have been detected within the input layer, the striatum. Striatal processing is critically dependent on the interplay with the dopamine system, and we explore here whether D2 receptors are expressed in the lamprey striatum and their potential role. We have identified a cDNA encoding the dopamine D2 receptor from the lamprey brain and the deduced protein sequence showed close phylogenetic relationship with other vertebrate D2 receptors, and an almost 100% identity within the transmembrane domains containing the amino acids essential for dopamine binding. There was a strong and distinct expression of D2 receptor mRNA in a subpopulation of striatal neurons, and in the same region tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive synaptic terminals were identified at the ultrastructural level. The synaptic incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive boutons was highest in a region ventrolateral to the compact layer of striatal neurons, a region where most striatal dendrites arborise. Application of a D2 receptor agonist modulates striatal neurons by causing a reduced spike discharge and a diminished post-inhibitory rebound. We conclude that the D2 receptor gene had already evolved in the earliest group of vertebrates, cyclostomes, when they diverged from the main vertebrate line of evolution (560 mya), and that it is expressed in striatum where it exerts similar cellular effects to that in other vertebrates. These results together with our previous published data (Stephenson-Jones et al. 2011, 2012) further emphasize the high degree of conservation of the basal ganglia, also with regard to the indirect loop, and its role as a basic mechanism for action selection in all vertebrates."

In this study, we show that knocking down MSP58 expression caused aneuploidy and led to apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of MSP58 regulated cell proliferation in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, ectopic expression of MSP58 in normal human IMR90 and Hs68 diploid fibroblasts, the H184B5F5/M10 mammary epithelial cell line, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and immortalized NIH3T3 fibroblasts resulted in induction of premature senescence, an enlarged and flattened cellular morphology, and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity.

Therefore, discovering the reason a cell with genetic abnormalities or experiencing different stresses enters a senescent state and identifying the critical molecular events that might counteract this phenomenon appear to be necessary steps toward enhancing our understanding of tumor development. Acquiring greater knowledge of the pathways that modulate senescence can provide a basis for the development of more effective cancer treatments.

In addition, an isoform of human MSP58, MCRS2, was involved in telomere shortening by associating with the telomerase-inhibitory protein, liver-related putative tumor suppressor/PIN2-interacting protein 1, and the catalytic telomerase subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (31Song H.

Lentivirus production and infection with short hairpin (sh) RNA targeting p53 were expressed from the pLKO TRC017 hairpin vector, which harbors an expression cassette for a neomycin resistance gene driven by the human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The shp53 sequence used was 5′-CACCATCCACTACAACTACAT-3′; pLKO.1-shLuc (TRCN0000072243; shLuc) was used as a control. These vectors were obtained from the The RNAi Consortium (TRC) library (National RNAi Core Facility, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide, MDKDSQGLLD, corresponding to amino acids 1–10 of human MSP58 were obtained from AgeneMax (Taipei, Taiwan). The following commercial antibodies were used in this study: FLAG (M2; Sigma), HA (HA.11; Babco/Covance, Berkley, CA), actin (clone AC-74; Sigma), p53 (BP53-12; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), p21 (Upstate Biotechnology), cyclin B1 (Upstate Biotechnology), cyclin D (Upstate Biotechnology), cyclin E (Upstate Biotechnology), cyclin A (BF683; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), cyclin E2 (Cell Signaling Technology), BRG1 (3G4; Upstate Biotechnology), ATM (2C1; GeneTex, San Antonio, TX), acetyl-p53Lys382 (Cell Signaling Technology), and green fluorescent protein (GFP; BD Biosciences Clontech). The Rb[4H1] monoclonal antibody (mAb) and phosphospecific pRbs (pRbSer(P)780, pRbSer(P)870/811, and pRbSer(P)795) were from the PhosphoPlus Rb antibody kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Phospho-ATRSer428, phospho-ATMSer1981, phospho-Chk1Ser296, phospho-Chk2Thr68, phospho-histone H2A.XSer139, and phospho-p53Ser15 antibodies were from the DNA Damage Antibody Sampler kit (Cell Signaling Technology). The normal human mammary epithelial cell line H184B5F5/M10 was purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). All other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from WT (p53+/+) and p53-null (p53−/−) mice were generously provided by Dr. Fung-Fang Wang (National Yang Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan). HeLa, SW-13, Hs68, NIH3T3, p53+/+, and p53−/− MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HT1080, IMR90, and H184B5F5/M10 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. Saos-2 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) with 15% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmids were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). For stable transfection, cells were selected with either 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) or 2 μg/ml puromycin. To generate retrovirus- and lentivirus-producing cell lines, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect 293T cells with a pQCXIP-GFP control, pQCXIP-GFP-MSP58 expression vector, or shRNA lentiviral vector; a murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol packaging vector; and the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein expression vector. Supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered (0.45 μm), and immediately used to infect cells. After viral infection, cells were treated with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) and/or puromycin (1.25 μg/ml) for selection. Neomycin- and/or puromycin-resistant cells were pooled for subsequent analysis. The growth rate of cells was monitored by seeding 2 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes containing 5% FBS. Samples were taken daily and counted using a hemocytometer. For the focus formation assay, cells were plated at a low density onto 100-mm dishes, and the medium was changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks, the number of colonies was counted using the Sigmascan software program after staining with 2% methylene blue. For the soft agar assay, 2000 cells were plated in 1 ml of complete growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and overlaid with 1.5 ml of 0.6% agarose. Cells were fed weekly. After 2–3 weeks, cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet. Cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were harvested, fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer). A terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using an APO-DIRECT TM kit (BD Biosciences). SA-β-gal staining was performed using a Senescence Detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Western blot, coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, luciferase assays, and real time qPCR were performed as described previously (37Lin D.Y. Fang H.I. Ma A.H. Huang Y.S. Pu Y.S. Jenster G.

Nuclear extracts were prepared (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) for the endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments. A real time qPCR was performed using the SYBR Advantage qPCR Premix (Invitrogen). PCRs were then performed using the following conditions for 40 cycles: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The following primer pairs were used: p21, forward (5′-ATGTGGACCTGTCACTGTCTTG) and reverse (5′-CGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATCTG); β-actin, forward (5′-ACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTACGACCAGAGGCATACAG-3′). The real time qPCR analysis was performed using a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science). Relative transcript amounts of the p21 gene, calculated using standard curves of serial cDNA dilutions, were normalized to β-actin. ChIP and re-ChIP assays were performed as described previously (37Lin D.Y. Fang H.I. Ma A.H. Huang Y.S. Pu Y.S. Jenster G. Kung H.J. Shih H.M.

Briefly, sheared chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to FLAG, BRG1, p53, or control immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 4 °C overnight. After dissociating the DNAs from the immunoprecipitated chromatin, the DNAs underwent PCR amplification. The two sequences containing p53-binding sites at −1688/−1335 and −2440/−2195 (respectively named numbers 1 and 2), and the sequence without the p53-binding site at −3558/−3141 (named number 3) were amplified. The following sets of primers were used: number 1, forward (5′-GAAATGCCTGAAAGCAGAGG) and reverse (5′-GCTCAGAGTCTGGAAATCTC); number 2, forward (5′-TGGGCTTTCCACCTTTCACCATTCC) and reverse (5′-CATCCCCTTCCTCACCTGAAAACAG); and number 3, forward (5′-GACATAGCAGGTGTGATGACC) and reverse (5′-GTATTCAGGTGGCTGAGGTG). Yeast two-hybrid screening and analysis were performed as described previously (20Lin D.Y. Shih H.M.

To analyze MSP58 messenger (m) RNA expressions between normal and tumor tissues, a dot-blot assay was purchased (Cancer Profiling Array II, BD Bioscience Clontech). Full-length 32P-labeled human MSP58 cDNA was used for hybridization, and the radioactivity of each dot was visualized and quantitated using a phosphorimaging system (Fujifilm BAS 2500). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with a ubiquitin probe to normalize each signal. IHC staining was performed on US Biomax (Rockville, MD) tissue arrays (catalogue number BCN962) for MSP58. Clinical and pathologic information for individual cancer samples was provided by the array manufacturer. IHC staining was performed as described previously (39Chen C.H. Lu P.J. Chen Y.C. Fu S.L.

Staining results were reviewed and scored by two pathologists (Y.-W. Liu and H.-K. Chen) blinded to each other's scoring. Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. p values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software version 3.03 package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Initially, we generated and characterized polyclonal antibodies against MSP58. A 58-kDa band corresponding to MSP58 was readily detected by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1A).

https://openalex.org/W2003634927,"The impact of synthetic amyloid β (1-42) (Aβ(1-42)) oligomers on biophysical properties of voltage-gated potassium channels Kv 1.3 and lipid bilayer membranes (BLMs) was quantified for protocols using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as solvents prior to initiating the oligomer formation. Regardless of the solvent used Aβ(1-42) samples contained oligomers that reacted with the conformation-specific antibodies A11 and OC and had similar size distributions as determined by dynamic light scattering. Patch-clamp recordings of the potassium currents showed that synthetic Aβ(1-42) oligomers accelerate the activation and inactivation kinetics of Kv 1.3 current with no significant effect on current amplitude. In contrast to oligomeric samples, freshly prepared, presumably monomeric, Aβ(1-42) solutions had no effect on Kv 1.3 channel properties. Aβ(1-42) oligomers had no effect on the steady-state current (at -80 mV) recorded from Kv 1.3-expressing cells but increased the conductance of artificial BLMs in a dose-dependent fashion. Formation of amyloid channels, however, was not observed due to conditions of the experiments. To exclude the effects of HFIP (used to dissolve lyophilized Aβ(1-42) peptide), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (used during Aβ(1-42) synthesis), we determined concentrations of these fluorinated compounds in the stock Aβ(1-42) solutions by (19)F NMR. After extensive evaporation, the concentration of HFIP in the 100× stock Aβ(1-42) solutions was ∼1.7 μM. The concentration of residual TFA in the 70× stock Aβ(1-42) solutions was ∼20 μM. Even at the stock concentrations neither HFIP nor TFA alone had any effect on potassium currents or BLMs. The Aβ(1-42) oligomers prepared with HFIP as solvent, however, were more potent in the electrophysiological tests, suggesting that fluorinated compounds, such as HFIP or structurally-related inhalational anesthetics, may affect Aβ(1-42) aggregation and potentially enhance ability of oligomers to modulate voltage-gated ion channels and biological membrane properties."
https://openalex.org/W2126749307,"Evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations assumes that all mutations are equally likely, i.e., if there are n strategies a single mutation can result in any strategy with probability 1/n. However, in biological systems it seems natural that not all mutations can arise from a given state. Certain mutations may be far away, or even be unreachable given the current composition of an evolving population. These distances between strategies (or genotypes) define a topology of mutations that so far has been neglected in evolutionary game theory. In this paper we re-evaluate classic results in the evolution of cooperation departing from the assumption of uniform mutations. We examine two cases: the evolution of reciprocal strategies in a repeated prisoner's dilemma, and the evolution of altruistic punishment in a public goods game. In both cases, alternative but reasonable mutation kernels shift known results in the direction of less cooperation. We therefore show that assuming uniform mutations has a substantial impact on the fate of an evolving population. Our results call for a reassessment of the ""model-less"" approach to mutations in evolutionary dynamics."

Examination of the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) metabolism of T. gondii reveals that the parasite secretes a soluble form of PtdSer decarboxylase (TgPSD1), which preferentially decarboxylates liposomal PtdSer with an apparent Km of 67 μm. The specific enzyme activity increases by 3-fold during the replication of T. gondii, and soluble phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) accounts for ∼20% of the total PSD, prior to the parasite egress from the host cells. Extracellular T. gondii secreted ∼20% of its total PSD activity at 37 °C, and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) inhibited the process by 50%.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes the human and animal parasites Plasmodium, Eimeria, Neospora, and Babesia (1Kim K. Weiss L.M.

Toxoplasma causes an opportunistic disease, toxoplasmosis, in individuals with immune dysfunction and in developing fetuses and neonates. The tachyzoite stage of T. gondii infects host cells and replicates to high numbers, ultimately lysing the cell, prior to the next round of invasion. Successful intracellular infection by T. gondii tachyzoites depends on its ability to modify the external micro-milieu by secreting a variety of factors (3Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D.

Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a crucial process required for membrane biogenesis by numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (5Voelker D.R.

The PSD enzymes belong to an interesting subgroup of decarboxylases that contain a pyruvoyl prosthetic group constituting an essential part of the catalytic site. The mature enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a large membrane-associated β-subunit and a small pyruvoyl-containing α-subunit (6Schuiki I. Daum G.

Purification and properties of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form is generated by auto-proteolytic cleavage of a single polypeptide producing α- and β-subunits and covalent attachment of the pyruvoyl group in a concerted reaction. The bacterial enzyme is an integral protein present in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli (7Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P.

TgPSD1 is secreted to the vacuole of intracellular parasites and into the external environment of host-free (axenic) parasites.

Anti-TgGra1, anti-TgGra3, and anti-TgGra5 antibodies were gifts of Marie-France Cesbron-Delauw (CNRS, Grenoble, France). Jurkat cells were kindly provided by Carsten G. Lüder (Georg-August-University, Göttingen, Germany). Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, MEM nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 10% CO2 atmosphere (11Gupta N. Zahn M.M. Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Voelker D.R. Selective disruption of phosphatidylcholine metabolism of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii arrests its growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The HFF were passaged by trypsinization at least once a week and used up to the 10th passage. T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH strain were routinely propagated in vitro by serial passage in HFF monolayers at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 4, unless stated otherwise. To purify the axenic parasites, supernatants from freshly lysed monolayers were collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min followed by three subsequent washings with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For some preparations, infected but unlysed HFF monolayers were passed twice through 20- and 22-gauge needles to release tachyzoites. The parasites were used immediately after isolation. Although T. gondii tachyzoites are unable to replicate outside of host cells, they remain viable long enough (t½ ∼10 h) in an extracellular environment to permit experimentation. In the early stages of these studies, we compared parasites purified on Nycodenz gradients (18Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. Toxoplasma gondii exploits host low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis for cholesterol acquisition.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with those prepared by simple centrifugation and PBS washing. We observed no significant differences between the two methods and hence used the simple centrifugation and washing procedure for the experimental manipulations described in this report. Parasite homogenates were prepared from a suspension containing 1–2 × 108 tachyzoites/ml by probe sonication at 0 °C using five 30-s bursts at 50 watts with 30-s cooling intervals between bursts. The homogenates were kept on ice prior to initiating enzyme reactions by pre-mixing all assay components at 0 °C and then shifting to 37 °C. Heat-inactivated (95 °C for 10 min) enzyme extract and/or reactions lacking enzyme were included as negative controls for catalysis in each assay. PSD activity was measured by trapping 14CO2 released from Ptd[U-14C]Ser or Ptd[1′-14C]Ser on filter paper impregnated with 2 m KOH (7Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P. Purification and properties of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dioleoyl-Ptd[U-14C]Ser and Ptd[1′-14C]Ser were synthesized from l-[U-14C]serine or l-[1-14C]serine and dioleoyl-CDP-diacylglycerol using PtdSer synthase. The PtdSer synthase was purified from E. coli strain JA-200 harboring the plasmid pPS3155 as described previously (19Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. Cloning of genes involved in membrane lipid synthesis. Effects of amplification of phosphatidylserine synthase in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in 16 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tubes sealed with an air-tight rubber septum, to which was attached a well holding the 2 m KOH-saturated paper. The parasite extract was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 3 mm EDTA. The 0.8-ml assay mixture contained 60 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.17 m sucrose, 0.35 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm dioleoyl-Ptd[U-14C]Ser (0.1 μCi/μmol), 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.2 ml of parasite extract. In studies using liposomal forms of Ptd[U-14C]Ser, the detergent was omitted. The liposomes were freshly prepared using a LiposoFast (Avestin) and 100-nm filters. The enzyme reactions were terminated at the indicated times by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 m H2SO4, introduced through the rubber septum using a hypodermic needle. The emitted 14CO2 was trapped for 30 min prior to recovering the filter paper for liquid scintillation counting. To measure the PSD expression during intracellular parasite growth, the HFF were infected at a multiplicity of 3. The infected cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested by scraping at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 h post-infection. The crude extract and reactions were prepared as described above. The 0.5-ml reactions contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.125 m sucrose, 0.25 mm PMSF, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25–0.5 mm (0.4–0.8 μCi/μmol) of dioleoyl-Ptd[U-14C]Ser, and 0.2 ml of parasite homogenate and were conducted for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of 1 × 108 parasites were incubated with 1–100 μm (0.1 mCi/reaction) dioleoyl-Ptd[U-14C]Ser in 1 ml of intracellular-type medium (ICM) in 16 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tubes at 37 °C for 1–6 h with shaking. The ICM contained 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamin solution lacking choline, MEM amino acids, and serine-free nonessential amino acids (pH 7.4). The nonessential amino acid mix contained 200 μg/ml of Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Pro, and Asn. The lipid precursors serine, choline, ethanolamine, and inositol (20 μm each) and ATP-Mg (1 mm) were also included. Typically, 1–1.3 × 108 parasites were incubated at 37 °C for 0.25–4 h in 1.3 ml of ICM supplemented with 20 mm each of serine, choline, ethanolamine, and inositol and 0.75 mm freshly prepared ATP-Mg. ATP-depletion experiments were performed in glucose- and pyruvate-free ICM, lacking ATP and supplemented with 7.5 mm NaN3, 7.5 mm NaF, 384 mm NaVO4, 153 mm dinitrophenol, and 7.5 mm oligomycin A. The incubation conditions for 14CO2 trapping and measurements were the same as those described above. A low speed supernatant was prepared by three centrifugations (1500 × g for 15 min). Subsequently, a high speed supernatant (HSS) was prepared by centrifuging the low speed supernatant at 150,000 × g for 45 min. An aliquot of 0.9 ml of HSS was mixed with 0.1 ml of 1% Triton X-100-solubilized or liposomal Ptd[U-14C]Ser. The enzyme reaction was incubated for 1–6 h at 37 °C and then terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 m H2SO4. The 14CO2 was trapped for 30–60 min in the sealed reaction tubes prior to recovering the filter paper for liquid scintillation spectrometry. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42681) Google Scholar). Each 1-ml PSD reaction was terminated by addition of 1.1 ml of CH3OH and 1.1 ml of CHCl3, followed by vigorous mixing and centrifugation. The resultant chloroform phase was washed three times with 2.1 ml of CH3OH/PBS/CHCl3 (10:9:1.5, v/v). The final chloroform phase containing lipids was dried, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Alternatively, lipids were dried under N2 and suspended in 50–100 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1, v/v) for TLC analysis. Lipids were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC on Silica Gel H plates in CHCl3, CH3OH, 2-propanol, KCl (0.25%), triethylamine (90:28:75:18:54, v/v) or by two-dimensional TLC on Sil60 plates (first dimension in CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (65:35:5, v/v) and the second dimension in CHCl3/CH3COOH/CH3OH/H2O (75:25:5:2.2, v/v)). Lipids were visualized by spraying TLC plates with 0.2% (w/v) anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and exposure to UV light, iodine staining, or autoradiography. All lipids were identified based on their co-migration with authentic standards. HFF were infected with T. gondii tachyzoites at an m.o.i. of 3 and cultured for 48 h. Parasites in the early stage of lysis were harvested by scraping cells and then liberated from host cells by two passages through 22- and 27-gauge needles. The parasites were washed by three centrifugations in diethylpyrocarbamate-treated PBS. RNA was isolated using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) and transcribed into first-strand cDNA. The TgPSD1 cDNA containing a C-terminal HA epitope was amplified using the forward (CTCGATATCATGGCTAAGGTTATGAGGCTTATC) and reverse (CTCTTAATTAATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGAGATCCCCATTGGTAAGCA) primers and Pfu-Ultra FusionII polymerase (Stratagene). The cDNA was cloned into the pNTP3 vector using EcoRV and PacI restriction enzyme sites. Purified tachyzoites (1 × 107) of the TaTi strain (21Meissner M. Schlüter D. Soldati D. Role of Toxoplasma gondii myosin A in powering parasite gliding and host cell invasion.Science. 2002; 298: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) were transfected with 50 μg of the TgPSD1-HA construct using the BTX630 instrument (2 kV, 50 ohm, 25 microfarads, 250 μs). The drug-resistant parasites were selected with 1 μm pyrimethamine as described before (22Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Stable molecular transformation of Toxoplasma gondii. A selectable dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase marker based on drug resistance mutations in malaria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and clonal transgenic tachyzoites were analyzed for PSD expression. The indirect immunofluorescence analysis of intracellular and extracellular T. gondii tachyzoites was performed as described previously (23Blume M. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Landfear S. Fleige T. Soldati-Favre D. Lucius R. Gupta N. Host-derived glucose and its transporter in the obligate intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii are dispensable by glutaminolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12998-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, the parasitized HFF monolayers grown on glass coverslips for 24–36 h were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by neutralization in 0.1 m glycine/PBS (5 min). Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% BSA in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Samples were stained with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-HA 1:1500; mouse anti-HA 1:1000; mouse anti-TgGra1 1:500; rabbit anti-TgGra3 1:500; mouse anti-TgGra5 1:500), followed by three washes with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The corresponding secondary antibodies (mouse or rabbit Alexa488 or Alexa594) were applied (1:3000) for 45 min, and after three PBS washes, the slides were mounted in DAPI-Fluoromount G for fluorescent imaging (Apotome, Carl Zeiss, Germany). For immunostaining of the extracellular stage, the parasites were allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips before fixation by paraformaldehyde (4%) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were stained and imaged as described above. Jurkat cells (E6.1 T-lymphocyte derived cells) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For induction of apoptosis, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh RPMI medium containing 0.1% DMSO either with or without 1 μm staurosporine (Invitrogen) for 2 h in a 12-well plate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min at room temperature) and washed twice with fresh medium. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with wild type or a transgenic T. gondii strain overexpressing TgPSD1-HA (m.o.i. ∼30) or with the medium control for 2 h. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V-FLUOS labeling reagent (Roche Applied Science), stained for 15 min in the dark, and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in 200 μl of HEPES buffer for FACS analyses or seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for microscopy. Samples were examined for annexin V staining on an LSRFortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences). The parasites and Jurkat cells were fractionated prior to analyzing the results using FlowJo suite. As an intracellular parasite, T. gondii imports numerous classes of molecules to support its growth. To investigate whether T. gondii can transport and metabolize exogenous phospholipid, we incubated the axenic parasites with unilamellar liposomes of dioleoyl-PtdSer and measured its decarboxylation. Surprisingly, parasites exhibited a high rate of concentration- and time-dependent decarboxylation (Fig. 1, A and B). The presence of high PSD activity in the living parasite is consistent with previous studies conducted with the parasite homogenates (11Gupta N. Zahn M.M. Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Voelker D.R. Selective disruption of phosphatidylcholine metabolism of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii arrests its growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initially, these assays suggested import of PtdSer by the parasite and decarboxylation in T. gondii. However, further analyses did not support this interpretation of the data. We next sought to determine where liposomal PtdSer was being decarboxylated. For these experiments, a defined number of parasites were incubated in ICM followed by preparation of cell-free supernatants. Surprisingly, we observed a time-dependent increase in PSD activity in the HSS indicating the presence of an enzyme that appeared to be secreted by the parasite (Fig. 2A). The secretion was rapid in the 1st h and gradually reached a plateau over the next 3 h. The unexpected presence of PSD in the HSS after parasite incubation demonstrated the soluble nature of the enzyme. Our assays using extracellular-type (high Na+/K+) medium yielded no differences in secretion of PSD compared with ICM (data not shown). To exc"

We identified a homolog of HMGB1 in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The Lampetra japonica HMGB1 gene (Lj-HMGB1) has over 70% sequence identity with its homologs in jawed vertebrates. Despite the reasonably high sequence identity with other HMGB1 proteins, Lj-HMGB1 did not group together with these proteins in a phylogenetic analysis. We examined Lj-HMGB1 expression in lymphocyte-like cells, and the kidneys, heart, gills, and intestines of lampreys before and after the animals were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (ConA). Lj-HMGB1 was initially expressed at a higher level in the heart, but after treatment with LPS and ConA only the gills demonstrated a significant up-regulation of expression. The recombinant Lj-HMGB1 (rLj-HMGB1) protein bound double-stranded DNA and induced the proliferation of human adenocarcinoma cells to a similar extent as human HMGB1. We further revealed that Lj-HMGB1 was able to induce the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory mediator, in activated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. These results suggest that lampreys use HMGB1 to activate their innate immunity for the purpose of pathogen defense."
https://openalex.org/W2062702051,"The genetic tractability and the species-specific association with beetles make the nematode Pristionchus pacificus an exciting emerging model organism for comparative studies in development and behavior. P. pacificus differs from Caenorhabditis elegans (a bacterial feeder) by its buccal teeth and the lack of pharyngeal grinders, but almost nothing is known about which genes coordinate P. pacificus feeding behaviors, such as pharyngeal pumping rate, locomotion, and fat storage.We analyzed P. pacificus pharyngeal pumping rate and locomotion behavior on and off food, as well as on different species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Caulobacter crescentus). We found that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) Ppa-EGL-4 in P. pacificus plays an important role in regulating the pumping rate, mouth form dimorphism, the duration of forward locomotion, and the amount of fat stored in intestine. In addition, Ppa-EGL-4 interacts with Ppa-OBI-1, a recently identified protein involved in chemosensation, to influence feeding and locomotion behavior. We also found that C. crescentus NA1000 increased pharyngeal pumping as well as fat storage in P. pacificus.The PKG EGL-4 has conserved functions in regulating feeding behavior in both C. elegans and P. pacificus nematodes. The Ppa-EGL-4 also has been co-opted during evolution to regulate P. pacificus mouth form dimorphism that indirectly affect pharyngeal pumping rate. Specifically, the lack of Ppa-EGL-4 function increases pharyngeal pumping, time spent in forward locomotion, and fat storage, in part as a result of higher food intake. Ppa-OBI-1 functions upstream or parallel to Ppa-EGL-4. The beetle-associated omnivorous P. pacificus respond differently to changes in food state and food quality compared to the exclusively bacteriovorous C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2046643908,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the prominent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons among other cell types. Here we report a first chemical screen of over 5,000 compounds in zebrafish, aimed at identifying small molecule modulators of DA neuron development or survival. We find that Neriifolin, a member of the cardiac glycoside family of compounds, impairs survival but not differentiation of both zebrafish and mammalian DA neurons. Cardiac glycosides are inhibitors of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity and widely used for treating heart disorders. Our data suggest that Neriifolin impairs DA neuronal survival by targeting the neuronal enriched Na(+)/K(+) ATPase α3 subunit (ATP1A3). Modulation of ionic homeostasis, knockdown of p53, or treatment with antioxidants protects DA neurons from Neriifolin-induced death. These results reveal a previously unknown effect of cardiac glycosides on DA neuronal survival and suggest that it is mediated through ATP1A3 inhibition, oxidative stress, and p53. They also elucidate potential approaches for counteracting the neurotoxicity of this valuable class of medications."
https://openalex.org/W2076672895,"The type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII) is a ubiquitous co-receptor for TGF-β superfamily ligands with roles in suppressing cancer progression, in part through suppressing cell motility. Here we demonstrate that TβRIII promotes epithelial cell adhesion to fibronectin in a β-arrestin2 dependent and TGF-β/BMP independent manner by complexing with active integrin α5β1, and mediating β-arrestin2-dependent α5β1 internalization and trafficking to nascent focal adhesions. TβRIII-mediated integrin α5β1 trafficking regulates cell adhesion and fibronectin fibrillogenesis in epithelial cells, as well as α5 localization in breast cancer patients. We further demonstrate that increased TβRIII expression correlates with increased α5 localization at sites of cell-cell adhesion in breast cancer patients, while higher TβRIII expression is a strong predictor of overall survival in breast cancer patients. These data support a novel, clinically relevant role for TβRIII in regulating integrin α5 localization, reveal a novel crosstalk mechanism between the integrin and TGF-β superfamily signaling pathways and identify β-arrestin2 as a regulator of α5β1 trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W2073772257,"Although many mechanisms that activate ROCK are known, corresponding negative regulatory mechanisms required for cytoskeletal plasticity are poorly understood. We have discovered that Coronin1B is a novel attenuator of ROCK signaling. We initially identified Coronin1A in a proteomics screen for ROCK2-binding proteins, and here we demonstrate that Coronin1A/B bind directly to ROCK2 through its PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain. The consequence of the ROCK2-Coronin1B interaction was tested and revealed that increased expression of Coronin1B inhibited, whereas knockdown of Coronin1B stimulated, phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate myosin light chain phosphatase and subsequently, myosin light chain. Thus, Coronin1B is a previously unrecognized inhibitor of ROCK signaling to myosin. Furthermore, we found that the phosphatase Slingshot IL (SSH1L) was required for Coronin1B to inhibit ROCK signaling. To test the significance of this novel mechanism in tumor cell motility, we investigated its role in neuregulin 1 (NRG-1)-induced cell scattering. Importantly, we found that attenuation of the ROCK signaling by Coronin1B was required for NRG-1 stimulated scattering. Our data support a model in which Coronin1B fine-tunes ROCK signaling to modulate myosin activity, which is important for tumor cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2004268022,"As we begin to understand the signals that drive chemotaxis in vivo, it is becoming clear that there is a complex interplay of chemotactic factors, which changes over time as the inflammatory response evolves. New animal models such as transgenic lines of zebrafish, which are near transparent and where the neutrophils express a green fluorescent protein, have the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the chemotactic process under conditions of wounding and infection from video microscopy data. Measurement of the chemoattractants over space (and their evolution over time) is a key objective for understanding the signals driving neutrophil chemotaxis. However, it is not possible to measure and visualise the most important contributors to in vivo chemotaxis, and in fact the understanding of the main contributors at any particular time is incomplete. The key insight that we make in this investigation is that the neutrophils themselves are sensing the underlying field that is driving their action and we can use the observations of neutrophil movement to infer the hidden net chemoattractant field by use of a novel computational framework. We apply the methodology to multiple in vivo neutrophil recruitment data sets to demonstrate this new technique and find that the method provides consistent estimates of the chemoattractant field across the majority of experiments. The framework that we derive represents an important new methodology for cell biologists investigating the signalling processes driving cell chemotaxis, which we label the neutrophils eye-view of the chemoattractant field."

IspE has been shown to be essential by genetic methods and since it is absent from humans it constitutes a promising target for antimicrobial drug development. Using in silico screening directed against the substrate binding site and in vitro high-throughput screening directed against both, the substrate and co-factor binding sites, non-substrate-like IspE inhibitors have been discovered and structure-activity relationships were derived. The best inhibitors in each series have high ligand efficiencies and favourable physico-chemical properties rendering them promising starting points for drug discovery. Putative binding modes of the ligands were suggested which are consistent with established structure-activity relationships. The applied screening methods were complementary in discovering hit compounds, and a comparison of both approaches highlights their strengths and weaknesses. It is noteworthy that compounds identified by virtual screening methods provided the controls for the biochemical screens."
https://openalex.org/W2085596894,"Functional divergence is the process by which new genes and functions originate through the modification of existing ones. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the evolution of new functions, including gene duplication or changes in the ecological requirements of an organism. Novel functions emerge at the expense of ancestral ones and are generally accompanied by changes in the selective forces at constrained protein regions. We present software capable of analyzing whole proteomes, identifying putative amino acid replacements leading to functional change in each protein and performing statistical tests on all tabulated data. We apply this method to 750 complete bacterial proteomes to identify high-level patterns of functional divergence and link these patterns to ecological adaptations. Proteome-wide analyses of functional divergence in bacteria with different ecologies reveal a separation between proteins involved in information processing (Ribosome biogenesis etc.) and those which are dependent on the environment (energy metabolism, defense etc.). We show that the evolution of pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria is constrained by their association with the host, and also identify unusual events of functional divergence even in well-studied bacteria such as Escherichia coli. We present a description of the roles of phylogeny and ecology in functional divergence at the level of entire proteomes in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2002307217,"14-3-3 proteins are involved in several cellular processes, including the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle transitions. However, their roles during mitosis are not well understood. Here, we showed that depletion of 14-3-3η, a 14-3-3 protein isoform, enhanced mitotic cell death, resulting in sensitization to microtubule inhibitors and inhibition of aneuploidy formation. The enhanced mitotic cell death by depletion of 14-3-3η appeared to be both caspase-dependent and independent. Furthermore, enhanced mitotic cell death and a reduction in aneuploidy following 14-3-3η depletion were independent of the mitotic checkpoint, which is thought to be the primary signaling event in the regulation of the cell death induced by microtubule inhibitors. When 14-3-3η depletion was combined with microtubule inhibitors in HCT116 and U87MG cells, it sensitized both cancer cell lines to microtubule inhibitors. These results collectively suggest that 14-3-3η may be required for mitotic progression and may be considered as a novel anti-cancer strategy in combination with microtubule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2034427600,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord leading to loss of voluntary muscular function and ultimately, death due to respiratory failure.

In spite of the fact that sporadic and familial forms of ALS share many common patho-physiological features, the mechanistic relationship between SOD1-associated and sporadic forms of the disease if any, is not well understood. To better understand any molecular connections, a cell-based protein folding assay was employed to screen a whole genome RNAi library for genes that regulate levels of soluble SOD1. Statistically significant hits that modulate SOD1 levels, when analyzed by pathway analysis revealed a highly ranked network containing TAR DNA binging protein (TDP-43), a major component of aggregates characteristic of sporadic ALS. Biochemical experiments confirmed the action of TDP-43 on SOD1. These results highlight an unexpected relationship between TDP-43 and SOD1 which may have implications in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2118272608,"Kidins220 (Kinase D interacting substrate of 220 kDa)/ARMS (Ankyrin Repeat-rich Membrane Spanning) is a scaffold protein highly expressed in the nervous system. Previous work on neurons with altered Kidins220/ARMS expression suggested that this protein plays multiple roles in synaptic function. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Kidins220/ARMS ablation on basal synaptic transmission and on a variety of short-term plasticity paradigms in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses using a recently described Kidins220 full knockout mouse. Hippocampal neuronal cultures prepared from embryonic Kidins220−/− (KO) and wild type (WT) littermates were used for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked synaptic activity. Whereas glutamatergic AMPA receptor-mediated responses were not significantly affected in KO neurons, specific differences were detected in evoked GABAergic transmission. The recovery from synaptic depression of inhibitory post-synaptic currents in WT cells showed biphasic kinetics, both in response to paired-pulse and long-lasting train stimulation, while in KO cells the respective slow components were strongly reduced. We demonstrate that the slow recovery from synaptic depression in WT cells is caused by a transient reduction of the vesicle release probability, which is absent in KO neurons. These results suggest that Kidins220/ARMS is not essential for basal synaptic transmission and various forms of short-term plasticity, but instead plays a novel role in the mechanisms regulating the recovery of synaptic strength in GABAergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1992278555,"Background To develop a low cost method to screen for virologic failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV-1 drug resistance, we performed a retrospective evaluation of a screening assay using serial dilutions of HIV-1 RNA-spiked blood plasma and samples from patients receiving >6 months of first-line ART. Methods Serial dilution testing was used to assess sensitivity of a simple PCR-based assay (targeted at ≥1,000 HIV RNA copies/mL). We created blood plasma minipools of five samples, extracted HIV RNA from the pools, PCR amplified the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region of the HIV-1 pol gene from extracted RNA, sequenced PCR product of positive pools, and used sequences to determine drug resistance. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined for different levels of virologic failure based on maximum viral loads of individual samples within a pool. Results Of 295 samples analyzed, 43 (15%) had virologic failure at ≥50 copies/mL (range 50–10,500 copies/mL, four at ≥1,000 copies/mL). The assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity to detect virus from these four samples, requiring only one round of PCR, and 56% and 89% sensitivity to detect samples with ≥50 and ≥500 copies/mL using two rounds. Amplified PCR products of all positive pools were successfully sequenced and 30% harbored ≥1 major resistance mutation. This method would have cost 10% of the combined costs of individual viral load and resistance testing. Conclusions We present a novel method that can screen for both virologic failure of first-line ART and drug resistance. The method is much less expensive than current methods, which may offer sustainability in resource-limited settings."

The invariant chain (Ii)-derived peptide CLIP is required for HLA-II-mediated antigen presentation by stabilizing HLA-II molecules before antigen loading through transient and promiscuous binding to different HLA-II peptide grooves. Here, we demonstrate alternative binding of CLIP to surface HLA-I molecules on leukemic cells. In HLA-II-negative AML cells, we found plasma membrane display of the CLIP peptide. Silencing Ii in AML cells resulted in reduced HLA-I cell surface display, which indicated a direct role of CLIP in the HLA-I antigen presentation pathway. In HLA-I-specific peptide eluates from B-LCLs, five Ii-derived peptides were identified, of which two were from the CLIP region. In vitro peptide binding assays strikingly revealed that the eluted CLIP peptide RMATPLLMQALPM efficiently bound to four distinct HLA-I supertypes (-A2, -B7, -A3, -B40). Furthermore, shorter length variants of this CLIP peptide also bound to these four supertypes, although in silico algorithms only predicted binding to HLA-A2 or -B7. Immunization of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with these peptides did not induce CTL responses. Together these data show a remarkable promiscuity of CLIP for binding to a wide variety of HLA-I molecules. The found participation of CLIP in the HLA-I antigen presentation pathway could reflect an aberrant mechanism in leukemic cells, but might also lead to elucidation of novel processing pathways or immune escape mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2004685558,"Climate and weather conditions, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, precipitation and temperature influence the birth sex ratio (BSR) of various higher latitude species, including deer, elephant seals or northern human populations. Although, tropical regions show only little variation in temperature, climate and weather conditions can fluctuate with consequences for phenology and food resource availability. Here, we evaluate, whether the BSR of chimpanzees, inhabiting African tropical forests, is affected by climate fluctuations as well. Additionally, we evaluate, if variation in consumption of a key food resource with high nutritional value, Coula edulis nuts, is linked to both climate fluctuations and variation in BSR. We use long-term data from two study groups located in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire to assess the influence of local weather conditions and the global climate driver El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on offspring sex. Côte d'Ivoire has experienced considerable climate variation over the last decades, with increasing temperature and declining precipitation. For both groups we find very similar time windows around the month of conception, in which offspring sex is well predicted by ENSO, with more males following low ENSO values, corresponding to periods of high rainfall. Furthermore, we find that the time spent cracking and feeding on Coula nuts is strongly influenced by climate conditions. Although, some of our analysis suggest that a higher proportion of males is born after periods with higher nut consumption frequency, we cannot conclude decisively at this point that nut consumption may influence shifts in BSR. All results combined suggest that also chimpanzees may experience climate related shifts in offspring sex ratios as response to climate fluctuation."
https://openalex.org/W1979022943,"How and where object and spatial information are perceptually integrated in the brain is a central question in visual cognition. Single-unit physiology, scalp EEG, and fMRI research suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a critical locus for object-spatial integration. To test the causal participation of the PFC in an object-spatial integration network, we studied ten patients with unilateral PFC damage performing a lateralized object-spatial integration task. Consistent with single-unit and neuroimaging studies, we found that PFC lesions result in a significant behavioral impairment in object-spatial integration. Furthermore, by manipulating inter-hemispheric transfer of object-spatial information, we found that masking of visual transfer impairs performance in the contralesional visual field in the PFC patients. Our results provide the first evidence that the PFC plays a key, causal role in an object-spatial integration network. Patient performance is also discussed within the context of compensation by the non-lesioned PFC."
https://openalex.org/W2148469489,"Attempts to express eukaryotic multi-spanning membrane proteins at high-levels have been generally unsuccessful. In order to investigate the cause of this limitation and gain insight into the rate limiting processes involved, we have analyzed the effect of translation levels on the expression of several human membrane proteins in Escherichia coli (E. coli). These results demonstrate that excessive translation initiation rates of membrane proteins cause a block in protein synthesis and ultimately prevent the high-level accumulation of these proteins. Moderate translation rates allow coupling of peptide synthesis and membrane targeting, resulting in a significant increase in protein expression and accumulation over time. The current study evaluates four membrane proteins, CD20 (4-transmembrane (TM) helixes), the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, 7-TMs) RA1c and EG-VEGFR1, and Patched 1 (12-TMs), and demonstrates the critical role of translation initiation rates in the targeting, insertion and folding of integral membrane proteins in the E. coli membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2073798097,"Arrangements of genes along chromosomes are a product of evolutionary processes, and we can expect that preferable arrangements will prevail over the span of evolutionary time, often being reflected in the non-random clustering of structurally and/or functionally related genes. Such non-random arrangements can arise by two distinct evolutionary processes: duplications of DNA sequences that give rise to clusters of genes sharing both sequence similarity and common sequence features and the migration together of genes related by function, but not by common descent [1], [2], [3]. To provide a background for distinguishing between the two, which is important for future efforts to unravel the evolutionary processes involved, we here provide a description of the extent to which ancestrally related genes are found in proximity. Towards this purpose, we combined information from five genomic datasets, InterPro, SCOP, PANTHER, Ensembl protein families, and Ensembl gene paralogs. The results are provided in publicly available datasets (http://cgd.jax.org/datasets/clustering/paraclustering.shtml) describing the extent to which ancestrally related genes are in proximity beyond what is expected by chance (i.e. form paraclusters) in the human and nine other vertebrate genomes, as well as the D. melanogaster, C. elegans, A. thaliana, and S. cerevisiae genomes. With the exception of Saccharomyces, paraclusters are a common feature of the genomes we examined. In the human genome they are estimated to include at least 22% of all protein coding genes. Paraclusters are far more prevalent among some gene families than others, are highly species or clade specific and can evolve rapidly, sometimes in response to environmental cues. Altogether, they account for a large portion of the functional clustering previously reported in several genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2167173231,"Both atopy and smoking are known to be associated with increased bronchial responsiveness. Fraction of nitric oxide (NO) in the exhaled air (FE(NO)), a marker of airways inflammation, is decreased by smoking and increased by atopy. NO has also a physiological bronchodilating and bronchoprotective role.To investigate how the relation between FE(NO) and bronchial responsiveness is modulated by atopy and smoking habits.Exhaled NO measurements and methacholine challenge were performed in 468 subjects from the random sample of three European Community Respiratory Health Survey II centers: Turin (Italy), Gothenburg and Uppsala (both Sweden). Atopy status was defined by using specific IgE measurements while smoking status was questionnaire-assessed.Increased bronchial responsiveness was associated with increased FE(NO) levels in non-smokers (p = 0.02) and decreased FE(NO) levels in current smokers (p = 0.03). The negative association between bronchial responsiveness and FE(NO) was seen only in the group smoking less <10 cigarettes/day (p = 0.008). Increased bronchial responsiveness was associated with increased FE(NO) in atopic subjects (p = 0.04) while no significant association was found in non-atopic participants. The reported interaction between FE(NO) and smoking and atopy, respectively were maintained after adjusting for possible confounders (p-values<0.05).The present study highlights the interactions of the relationship between FE(NO) and bronchial responsiveness with smoking and atopy, suggesting different mechanisms behind atopy- and smoking-related increases of bronchial responsiveness."
