https://openalex.org/W1978857421,"Measurements with thermocouple psychrometers were made of the water potentials of leaves from sunflower and pepper plants which had stood overnight in the dark in nutrient solutions containing carbowax. Similar measurements on the solutions showed that they had lower water potentials than the leaves, although the plants were measurably transpiring. Evidence that root pressure plays a part in this inversion of water potential gradient is presented."

If the radon and thoron flux from the lunar surface is equal to that measured at the earth's surface, the equilibrium activity of this surface layet is estimated as approximately 1 microcurie per square meter, due to radon and its decay products. This activity consists of alpha particles and gamnmna rays at well-defined energies and of beta rays."
https://openalex.org/W2026261730,"A potassitlim-argon dating method applicable to small quantities of volcanic minerals anid glass has been developed and used to determine the ages of North Pacific sediments. Tertiary sedimentation rates range from less than 1.0 millimeter per 10(3) years for deep-sea ""red clay"" to 1 centimeter per 10: years for calcareotus-siliceous ooze necrer the continent. The potassium-argon ages obtained from different minerals are concordaat, and in samples withl associated fossils, these ages are compatible with the paleontologic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W1999037580,"The source of vertical sustaining force for large insects capable of near-hovering flight is unclear. Induced velocities of a simulation of the insect Melolontha vulgaris in forward flight were measured with a hot-wire anemometer. The results were negative with respect to the drag concept of vertical force, but provided certain support for the circulation concept. Unsteady effects (the effects of variant air velocity) proved significant."
https://openalex.org/W2015461544,Average difference in size between queens and workers of four social Halictinae common to southern Ontario ranges from 6 percent in Augochlorella striata (Prov.) to 15 percent in Evylaeus cinctipes (Prov.). Spring larvae receive. provisions averaging 33.9 milligrams and become small workers; summer larvae consume on average 61.7 milligrams and develop into large queens and males.

https://openalex.org/W1978499400,"The rotation operation of order m operating on a signal removes all spatial frequencies not multiple to m. Anomalous reinforcements, causing misinterpretation, can be discounted without following previously suggested restrictions. The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio is less than m, in contrast to signal averaging of electrophysiology. A dove prism and stroboscope can implement the technique."
