Mutations in the SAMHD1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a genetic disease that mimics congenital viral infection. To determine the physiological function of the SAMHD1 protein, the SAMHD1 gene was cloned, recombinant protein was produced, and the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme was identified. We show that SAMHD1 contains a dGTP-regulated deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase. We propose that Vpx targets SAMHD1 for degradation in a viral strategy to control cellular deoxynucleotide levels for efficient replication.

IntroductionViruses target specific host cell molecules that would otherwise restrict viral propagation. The HIV-1 and other lentiviral genomes encode different sets of accessory proteins directed at eluding host adaptive and innate immune mechanisms to promote viral replication in specific cell environments (1Malim M.H.

Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Vpx accessory protein is found exclusively in HIV-2 and some simian immunodeficiency viruses, and Vpr is found in HIV-1 and HIV-2. Vpx targets a restriction factor that prohibits viral DNA synthesis in monocytic cells (4Wolfrum N. Mühlebach M.D. Schüle S. Kaiser J.K. Kloke B.P. Cichutek K. Schweizer M.

In HIV-1-infected cells, TREX1 degrades nonproductive transcripts to clear excess viral cDNA, preventing innate immune activation (27Yan N. Lieberman J. Curr. Opin.

Thus, SAMHD1, TREX1, and RNase H2 participate in a cellular nucleic acid metabolic pathway that overlaps the interferon-mediated innate antiviral and inflammatory responses.The catalytic activity of SAMHD1 is identified in this study. The SAMHD1 contains an N-terminal putative protein-protein interaction sterile α motif (SAM) 4The abbreviations used are: SAMsterile α motifTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. domain and a C-terminal predicted phosphohydrolase HD (His···His-Asp···Asp) domain. The SAMHD1 was cloned, and bacterially expressed recombinant enzyme was generated in sufficient quantities and purity to perform biochemical studies. The enzymatic properties indicate that the SAMHD1 HIV-1 restriction factor is a dGTP-regulated deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase.DISCUSSIONSAMHD1 is an HIV-1 restriction factor that prohibits efficient viral DNA synthesis. Our investigations of SAMHD1 catalytic function have revealed its deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase activity, uncovering the mechanism of viral restriction. The NMR structure of the SAMHD1 SAM domain has been determined (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2E8O), confirming the presence of this protein-protein interaction domain in the N-terminal region. Sequence alignments identified SAMHD1 genes in diverse eukaryotes, but the lack of biochemical studies limited insight into physiological function. To initiate SAMHD1 functional studies, a structural model was generated using ensemble fold recognition in the program Phyre (36Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 37Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). Using the complete human and mouse SAMHD1 sequences, the apparent homologue Enterococcus faecalis EF1143 protein (PDB 3IRH) was identified (38Vorontsov II, Minasov G. Kiryukhina O. Brunzelle J.S. Shuvalova L. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Efa EF1143 protein is a deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase, and the SAMHD1 HD domain model suggests a high degree of sequence conservation at functional residues throughout the HD domain (supplemental Fig. S4). The likely SAMHD1 active site metal-binding residues His-167, His-206, Asp-207, and Asp-311 (His-66, His-110, Asp-111, and Asp-183 in Efa EF1143 protein) are identified. Also, the proposed nucleophile-generating residues His-210, Asp-218, and His-233 (His-114, Glu-122, and His-129 in Efa EF1143 protein) are conserved. The EF1143 x-ray structure is a tetramer with four dGTP-specific regulatory sites identified (38Vorontsov II, Minasov G. Kiryukhina O. Brunzelle J.S. Shuvalova L. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Importantly, the SAMHD1 model indicates that residues Lys-116, Asp-137, Gln-142, Arg-145, Phe-165, Arg-451, Lys-455, and Lys-556 (Lys-14, Asn-36, Gln-41, Arg-44, Phe-64, Arg-326, Lys-330, and Lys-422 in Efa EF1143 protein) are in direct contact with the dGTP ligand. The model also predicts that residues Gln-149, His-162, Arg-164, Asp-319, His-370, and Tyr-374 (Gln-48, His-61, Arg-63, Asp-191, Tyr-239, and Tyr-243 in Efa EF1143 protein) are likely responsible for conferring deoxyribose substrate specificity. A high-resolution structure of SAMHD1 HD domain will be required to validate this model.The HIV-2 Vpx targeting of SAMHD1 deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase to permit viral replication has a striking parallel in bacteriophage T7 restriction in bacteria. The E. coli mutant strain OptA1 is unable to support replication of bacteriophage T7 gene 1.2 mutants (39Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OptA1 strain is mutated in the upstream region of the dgt gene, causing overproduction of the encoded dGTPase and a reduced cellular level of dGTP (40Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the high triphosphohydrolase activity in the OptA1 strain resulted in cellular nucleotide precursor levels insufficient to support bacteriophage T7 replication. The gene 1.2 protein inhibits the E. coli dGTPase, which raises nucleotide levels and permits T7 bacteriophage replication (42Kornberg S.R. Lehman I.R. Bessman M.J. Simms E.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 159-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting key nucleotide metabolism enzymes to control replication precursor molecule levels represents a mechanistic strategy in viral restriction that is perhaps more common than currently appreciated.The finding of SAMHD1 deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase activity now links this Aicardi-Goutières syndrome enzyme with TREX1 and RNase H2 to various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Dysfunction of SAMHD1, TREX1, and RNase H2 enzymes in the same immune activation disease illustrates the critical nature of proper nucleotide metabolism, polynucleotide degradation, and RNA/DNA hybrid processing. Establishing SAMHD1 as an HIV-1 restriction factor and TREX1 in the degradation of HIV-1 transcripts to prevent innate immune activation places these enzymes at the interface of type I interferon-mediated autoimmunity and the antiviral response. Understanding SAMHD1, TREX1, and RNase H2 in cellular nucleic acid metabolism could provide new therapeutic strategies in autoimmune and viral disease.

Thus, SAMHD1, TREX1, and RNase H2 participate in a cellular nucleic acid metabolic pathway that overlaps the interferon-mediated innate antiviral and inflammatory responses.

The SAMHD1 contains an N-terminal putative protein-protein interaction sterile α motif (SAM) 4The abbreviations used are: SAMsterile α motifTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. domain and a C-terminal predicted phosphohydrolase HD (His···His-Asp···Asp) domain.

The enzymatic properties indicate that the SAMHD1 HIV-1 restriction factor is a dGTP-regulated deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase. sterile α motif N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. DISCUSSIONSAMHD1 is an HIV-1 restriction factor that prohibits efficient viral DNA synthesis. Our investigations of SAMHD1 catalytic function have revealed its deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase activity, uncovering the mechanism of viral restriction. The NMR structure of the SAMHD1 SAM domain has been determined (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2E8O), confirming the presence of this protein-protein interaction domain in the N-terminal region. Sequence alignments identified SAMHD1 genes in diverse eukaryotes, but the lack of biochemical studies limited insight into physiological function. To initiate SAMHD1 functional studies, a structural model was generated using ensemble fold recognition in the program Phyre (36Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 37Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). Using the complete human and mouse SAMHD1 sequences, the apparent homologue Enterococcus faecalis EF1143 protein (PDB 3IRH) was identified (38Vorontsov II, Minasov G. Kiryukhina O. Brunzelle J.S. Shuvalova L. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Efa EF1143 protein is a deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase, and the SAMHD1 HD domain model suggests a high degree of sequence conservation at functional residues throughout the HD domain (supplemental Fig. S4). The likely SAMHD1 active site metal-binding residues His-167, His-206, Asp-207, and Asp-311 (His-66, His-110, Asp-111, and Asp-183 in Efa EF1143 protein) are identified. Also, the proposed nucleophile-generating residues His-210, Asp-218, and His-233 (His-114, Glu-122, and His-129 in Efa EF1143 protein) are conserved. The EF1143 x-ray structure is a tetramer with four dGTP-specific regulatory sites identified (38Vorontsov II, Minasov G. Kiryukhina O. Brunzelle J.S. Shuvalova L. Anderson W.F. J. Biol.

Importantly, the SAMHD1 model indicates that residues Lys-116, Asp-137, Gln-142, Arg-145, Phe-165, Arg-451, Lys-455, and Lys-556 (Lys-14, Asn-36, Gln-41, Arg-44, Phe-64, Arg-326, Lys-330, and Lys-422 in Efa EF1143 protein) are in direct contact with the dGTP ligand. The model also predicts that residues Gln-149, His-162, Arg-164, Asp-319, His-370, and Tyr-374 (Gln-48, His-61, Arg-63, Asp-191, Tyr-239, and Tyr-243 in Efa EF1143 protein) are likely responsible for conferring deoxyribose substrate specificity. A high-resolution structure of SAMHD1 HD domain will be required to validate this model.The HIV-2 Vpx targeting of SAMHD1 deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase to permit viral replication has a striking parallel in bacteriophage T7 restriction in bacteria. The E. coli mutant strain OptA1 is unable to support replication of bacteriophage T7 gene 1.2 mutants (39Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OptA1 strain is mutated in the upstream region of the dgt gene, causing overproduction of the encoded dGTPase and a reduced cellular level of dGTP (40Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the high triphosphohydrolase activity in the OptA1 strain resulted in cellular nucleotide precursor levels insufficient to support bacteriophage T7 replication. The gene 1.2 protein inhibits the E. coli dGTPase, which raises nucleotide levels and permits T7 bacteriophage replication (42Kornberg S.R. Lehman I.R. Bessman M.J. Simms E.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Thus, targeting key nucleotide metabolism enzymes to control replication precursor molecule levels represents a mechanistic strategy in viral restriction that is perhaps more common than currently appreciated.The finding of SAMHD1 deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase activity now links this Aicardi-Goutières syndrome enzyme with TREX1 and RNase H2 to various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Dysfunction of SAMHD1, TREX1, and RNase H2 enzymes in the same immune activation disease illustrates the critical nature of proper nucleotide metabolism, polynucleotide degradation, and RNA/DNA hybrid processing. Establishing SAMHD1 as an HIV-1 restriction factor and TREX1 in the degradation of HIV-1 transcripts to prevent innate immune activation places these enzymes at the interface of type I interferon-mediated autoimmunity and the antiviral response.

https://openalex.org/W2060826509,"Inflammation is one of main mechanisms of autoimmune disorders and a common feature of most diseases. Appropriate suppression of inflammation is a key resolution to treat the diseases. Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) has been shown to play a role in regulation of inflammation. Resveratrol, a potent Sirt1 activator, has anti-inflammation property. However, the detailed mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammation role of Sirt1 in NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in 3T3 cells and resveratrol suppressed overexpression of these pro-inflammatory molecules in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of Sirt1 by RNA interference caused 3T3 cells susceptible to TNF-α stimulation and diminished anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol. We also explored potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms of resveratrol. Resveratrol reduced NF-κB subunit RelA/p65 acetylation, which is notably Sirt1 dependent. Resveratrol also attenuated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) while ameliorating inflammation. Our data demonstrate that resveratrol inhibits TNF-α-induced inflammation via Sirt1. It suggests that Sirt1 is an efficient target for regulation of inflammation. This study provides insight on treatment of inflammation-related diseases."

Most effects of LL-37 are mediated via the activation of the cell surface G protein-coupled receptor FPR2 on leukocytes and endothelial cells.

However, an immature human mast cell line, HMC-1, that lacks functional MrgX2 did not respond to LL-37. shRNA-mediated knockdown of MrgX2 in LAD2 mast cell line and primary CD34+ cell-derived mast cells caused a substantial reduction in LL-37-induced degranulation.

https://openalex.org/W1994844375,"We undertook this study to understand how the transcription factor Sox2 contributes to the malignant phenotype of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor. We initially looked for unbalanced genomic rearrangements in the Sox2 locus in 42 GBM samples and found that Sox2 was amplified in 11.5% and overexpressed in all the samples. These results prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms involved in Sox2 overexpression in GBM. We analyzed the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter because high CpG density promoters are associated with key developmental genes. The Sox2 promoter presented a CpG island that was hypomethylated in all the patient samples when compared to normal cell lines. Treatment of Sox2-negative glioma cell lines with 5-azacitidine resulted in the re-expression of Sox2 and in a change in the methylation status of the Sox2 promoter. We further confirmed these results by analyzing data from GBM cases generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observed Sox2 overexpression (86%; N = 414), Sox2 gene amplification (8.5%; N = 492), and Sox 2 promoter hypomethylation (100%; N = 258), suggesting the relevance of this factor in the malignant phenotype of GBMs. To further explore the role of Sox2, we performed in vitro analysis with brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and established glioma cell lines. Downmodulation of Sox2 in BTSCs resulted in the loss of their self-renewal properties. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Sox2 in established glioma cells was not sufficient to support self-renewal, suggesting that additional factors are required. Furthermore, we observed that ectopic Sox2 expression was sufficient to induce invasion and migration of glioma cells, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that Sox2 was essential for maintaining these properties. Altogether, our data underscore the importance of a pleiotropic role of Sox2 and suggest that it could be used as a therapeutic target in GBM."
https://openalex.org/W1972005136,"The aggresome pathway is activated when proteasomal clearance of misfolded proteins is hindered. Misfolded polyubiquitinated protein aggregates are recruited and transported to the aggresome via the microtubule network by a protein complex consisting of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and the dynein motor complex. The current model suggests that HDAC6 recognizes protein aggregates by binding directly to polyubiquitinated proteins. Here, we show that there are substantial amounts of unanchored ubiquitin in protein aggregates with solvent-accessible C termini. The ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) of HDAC6 binds exclusively to the unanchored C-terminal diglycine motif of ubiquitin instead of conjugated polyubiquitin. The unanchored ubiquitin C termini in the aggregates are generated in situ by aggregate-associated deubiquitinase ataxin-3. These results provide structural and mechanistic bases for the role of HDAC6 in aggresome formation and further suggest a novel ubiquitin-mediated signaling pathway, where the exposure of ubiquitin C termini within protein aggregates enables HDAC6 recognition and transport to the aggresome.

Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 2Tai H.C. Schuman E.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When proteasomal functions are disrupted or overloaded, misfolded proteins cannot be cleared and protein aggregation ensues (3Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). In such cases, the aggresome pathway is activated, and cytoplasmic protein aggregates are transported to the microtubule organizing center, where aggresomes are formed (3Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Aggresomes are dynamic structures that can recruit various chaperones and proteasomes to aid in the disposal of aggregated proteins (4Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Aggresome formation is often considered a cytoprotective response, allowing for sequestration of potentially toxic misfolded proteins and promoting their clearance by autophagy (5Chin L.S. Olzmann J.A. Li L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

HDAC6 modulates a wide range of cellular activities through distinct interactions with cellular components including tubulin, cortactin, HSP90, and other proteins and protein complexes (8Matthias P. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Valenzuela-Fernández A. Cabrero J.R. Serrador J.M. Sánchez-Madrid F.

In the aggresome pathway, HDAC6 plays the key role of gathering scattered polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and transporting them to aggresomes via microtubule tracts. HDAC6 has been shown to bind polyubiquitinated aggregates and dynactin/p150Glued, a component of the dynein motor complex, bridging the ubiquitinated proteins to the dynein motors and promoting transport of the cargo toward the microtubule organizing center to enable aggresome formation (10Dompierre J.P.

HDAC6 is thought to interact with aggregated proteins through its ZnF-UBP domain (11Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), a domain typically found in deubiquitinases capable of binding the unanchored ubiquitin C terminus with high affinity and specificity (12Pai M.T.

However, in polyubiquitinated proteins, ubiquitin moieties are conjugated to target polypeptide chains through C-terminal diglycine motifs (14Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and serve as molecular tags that are usually recognized by downstream proteins through its globular surface, often through a hydrophobic area around Ile-44 (15Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 16Raiborg C. Slagsvold T. Stenmark H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to reconcile how HDAC6 can potentially bind polyubiquitin chains of aggregated proteins through its ZnF-UBP domain. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of how scattered protein aggregates are recognized by HDAC6. First, we show that the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain interacts directly with protein aggregates using immunoprecipitation approaches. Then we solved the crystal structure of the ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 and its complexes with either full-length ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-C-terminal peptide. This structural and biochemical analysis revealed that an intact and unanchored (noncovalently modified) ubiquitin C-terminal diglycine motif is necessary and sufficient for binding to HDAC6 ZnF-UBP. Second, we show that such unanchored ubiquitin C termini are present abundantly in aggresomes. It is the solvent-accessible ubiquitin C termini that tag protein aggregates for HDAC6 recognition. These unanchored C termini are generated by the aggregate-associated deubiquitinase, ataxin-3, which cleaves (poly)ubiquitin moieties in polyubiquitinated proteins to expose their C-terminal diglycine motifs for HDAC6 binding and subsequent transport to the aggresome. Our work thus offers a critical piece of the mechanism underlying how HDAC6 recruits protein aggregates. Purchased protein reagents used in various experiments included: HDAC6 (Biomol), ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), tetraubiquitin (Boston Biochem), and ubiquitin-AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) (Boston Biochem). Peptide RLRGG was synthesized at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston). Antibodies used in various experiments included: anti-GFP antibody (product number A11122; Invitrogen), anti-ataxin3 antibody (product #MABN37; Millipore), anti-HDAC6 antibody (product number AB12173; Abcam), anti-C-terminal ubiquitin antibody (product number 04-454; Millipore), anti-N-terminal ubiquitin antibody (product number AP1228a; Abgent), anti-USP5 antibody (product number AP2134a; Abgent), anti-USP13 antibody (product number AB99421; Abcam), Alexa 555- or Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes); and infrared dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, IR700 and IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences). ZnF-UBP domains of HDAC6 (1109–1215) and USP5 (171–290) were amplified by PCR from the Mammalian Gene Collection clone (with GenBankTM accession numbers BC013737 and BC004889, respectively) and subcloned into a modified pET28a-LIC vector. The mutants were prepared by the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis method. The recombinant proteins were overexpressed in LB medium as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins at 15 °C using Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene). For purification, the cells were lysed by passing through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corporation) at 18,000 p.s.i. The purification procedure comprised of two steps: affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (26/60; GE Healthcare). The His tag was cleaved with thrombin after the affinity column step while dialyzing against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP (Buffer A). Crystals of the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain were grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop method by mixing equal volumes of 3.5 m sodium formate, 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 15 mg/ml protein. Crystals of the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP (15 mg/ml) and monoubiquitin (15 mg/ml) were grown at 28 °C using the sitting drop method by mixing with equal volumes of 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.6. Crystals of the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain and RLRGG complex were grown at 18 °C using the hanging drop method by mixing equal volumes of 20% PEG3350, 0.2 m CaCl2, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 15 mg/ml protein solution with 3 mm peptide. The single wavelength anomalous diffraction data set of HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain was collected at 100 K on BNL Beamline X29 with wavelength of 1.26 Å. The HDAC6 ZnF-UBP with peptide RLRGG data were collected on a Rigaku FR-E super bright rotating anode x-ray generator. Program HKL2000 was used for both data processing and scaling. The HDAC6 ZnF-UBP structure was determined using the anomalous signal from native-bound zinc atoms at 1.26Å. The program SOLVE was used to search the zinc sites, and RESOLVE was used to perform the site refinement and initial model building. ARPwARP was used for model building. The graphics program COOT (17Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) was used for manual model refinement and visualization. Refmac5 was also used to refine the model. The structure of HDAC6 with RLRGG peptide was determined using HDAC6 (3C5K) as a molecular replacement model. Diffraction data on HDAC6 with ubiquitin complex structure was collected on the APS beamline 23ID-B, and the structure was determined using the HDAC6 (3C5K) structure as a model. The program BUSTER (18Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 37-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for structural refinement. Proteins of interest (one of the interacting proteins was His-tagged) at 1 mg/ml in buffer A were incubated at room temperature for 30 min allowing for batch binding before either Ni-NTA (Qiagen) or Talon (Clontech) was added. The resin was washed extensively prior to elution with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). For DLS experiments, equimolar amounts of HDAC6 Zn-UBP domain and ubiquitin or ubiquitin mutants were incubated together at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The final protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were then transferred into 384-well plates for DLS analysis. DLS data were recorded using DynaPro Plate Reader with Dynamics software (Wyatt Technology). 293T cells were transfected with GFP-CFTRΔ508 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with either Me2SO or MG132 (EMD Biosciences). After 16 h of treatment, the cells were lysed, and proteins were quantified. Subsequently, 1 mg of total protein lysate/condition was incubated overnight with 50 μg of recombinant peptide at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of GFP antibody/sample using protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen). For ataxin-3 knockdown experiments, 293T cells were transfected with ataxin-3-specific siRNA (ON_TARGETplus SMARTpool ATXN3 L-012013-00-0005; Dharmacon RNAi Technologies) or scramble control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus nontargeting pool D-001810-10-05; Dharmacon RNAi Technologies), using Dharmafect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h post-transfection, these cells were transfected with GFP-CFTRΔ508, GFP-Atx1-82Q, or GFP and treated as described above. Proteins were extracted from cells with a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1% Triton, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Sample lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-GFP 1:2000, anti-ataxin3 1:1000, anti-HDAC6 1:1000, anti-C-terminal ubiquitin 1:1000, and anti-N-terminal ubiquitin 1:1000. Western blot analysis was performed by incubating with the infrared dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, IR700 and IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature; blots were imaged and processed on an Odyssey® infrared imaging system. Cultured A549 or 293T cells were transfected with respective plasmids and fixed post-treatment with PBS with 3.5% formaldehyde for 15 min and washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked in 5% goat serum (in PBS) for 1 h before incubating in appropriate primary antibody mixtures with mild shaking at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody dilutions used included anti-C-terminal ubiquitin antibody 1:250, anti-ataxin-3 antibody 1:250, anti-HDAC6 antibody 1:100, anti-USP5 antibody 1:250, anti-USP13 antibody 1:250, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 555 or Alexa 647 were used at 1:250. All of the antibody incubations were performed at 4 °C overnight in the presence of 5% normal goat serum. Fluorescence images were acquired on Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope and processed using FluoView10ASW (Olympus). The figure panels were assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS4. An earlier report showed that HDAC6 binds polyubiquitinated protein aggregates through its ZnF-UBP domain (11Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). However, because typical ZnF-UBP domains only bind unanchored ubiquitin C termini (19Bonnet J. Romier C. Tora L. Devys D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 369-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and all the C termini of ubiquitin moieties in polyubiquitinated proteins are conjugated either to protein substrate or other ubiquitin moieties (20Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the ZnF-UBP domain may play a regulatory role rather than bind directly to the aggregates (12Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Kovacs J.J. Keaton M.A. Li S.S. Yao T.P. Zhou P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine the direct interaction between HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain and protein aggregates, we used the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR-ΔF508-induced protein aggregation as a model (3Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 11Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Cultured 293T cells were transfected with GFP-CFTR-ΔF508 and treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, to induce aggresome formation. The interaction between HDAC6 and aggregates was tested by incubating cell lysates with recombinant HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain. The binding activity of the recombinant HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain to ubiquitin was first tested and confirmed by an in vitro pull down assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, when incubated with ubiquitin, His-tagged HDAC6 ZnF-UBP pulled down ubiquitin in a manner similar to the His-tagged UBP domain of USP5, a known ubiquitin-binding protein (13Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We generated an active site mutant R1155A/Y1184A based on homologue analysis (12Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Kovacs J.J. Keaton M.A. Li S.S. Yao T.P. Zhou P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP RY mutant protein was properly folded, as confirmed by one-dimensional proton NMR (supplemental Fig. S1), the binding between mutant HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain and ubiquitin was abolished (Fig. 1A). These results confirmed the specific interaction between HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domains and ubiquitin and the essential role of the predicted ubiquitin-binding site. We next tested the direct binding between HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain and GFP-CFTR-ΔF508 aggregates using immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 1B, when these ZnF-UBP domains were incubated with GFP-CFTR-ΔF508 aggregates, the wild-type HDAC6 ZnF-UBP co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-CFTR-ΔF508 (top panel), whereas the mutant R1155A/Y1184A (middle panel) failed to interact with the protein aggregates. We found that the well characterized homologue ZnF-UBP domain from USP5 also binds these aggregates (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). These observations are consistent with previous reports that the ZnF-UBP is responsible for protein aggregate recognition (11Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 21Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Müller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Boyault C. Sadoul K. Pabion M. Khochbin S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5468-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we used a different ubiquitinating substrate to form aggregates, i.e. human ataxin-1-82Q-GFP, we again observed interactions of USP5-UBP and HDAC6-UBP with these aggregates (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our results suggest that the ZnF-UBP domain alone is sufficient to bind protein aggregates, and the binding is dependent on an intact ubiquitin-binding site. These interactions were specific for GFP-CFTR-ΔF508-induced aggregation, because expression of GFP by itself failed to induce aggresome formation or allow ZnF-UBP binding to any aggregates (Fig. 1D). The next question that needed to be addressed was how HDAC6 ZnF-UBP binds polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. There are two possibilities: the ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 either binds unanchored C-terminal ubiquitin tails similar to other characterized ZnF-UBP domains or binds polyubiquitinated protein in a mode different from known ZnF-UBPs. To differentiate these possibilities, we performed protein-protein interaction assays to examine the direct binding between HDAC6 and ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1E, His-tagged HDAC6 ZnF-UBP interacted only with unconjugated ubiquitin but not C-terminally capped ubiquitin-AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin). When the last one or two glycine residues of ubiquitin were mutated (G76A and G75A/G76A) or deleted (Ub75, one C-terminal glycine deletion; Ub74, two glycine deletions), the interaction with HDAC6 ZnF-UBP was abolished (Fig. 1F). The loss of interaction was further confirmed by gel filtration and DLS experiments (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S1). These results showed that an intact and unanchored (noncovalently modified) ubiquitin C-terminal diglycine motif is necessary for binding to HDAC6 ZnF-UBP. To reveal the structural details of this interaction, we solved the crystal structures of the ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 and its complexes with either full-length ubiquitin or a ubiquitin C-terminal peptide (Table 1). The crystal structure of the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain (residues 1109–1215), determined at 1.55 Å resolution using anomalous signals from natively bound Zn2+ ions, revealed a compact structure consisting of five anti-parallel β-strands, two α-helices, and three Zn2+ ions (Fig. 2A). A distinct pocket was visible on the surface, formed by a cluster of aromatic residues (Fig. 2A). The ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 has similar folds overall to those of USP5 (Protein Data Bank code 2G43) and USP16 (Protein Data Bank code 2I50) (12Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Kovacs J.J. Keaton M.A. Li S.S. Yao T.P. Zhou P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) but with significant differences in structural details. For example, in contrast to HDAC6 ZnF-UBP, the USP5 UBP domain contains only one Zn2+ ion and has a longer loop between β2 and αA (L2A) and a shorter αB helix, which is rotated almost 90° (13Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The USP16 UBP domain has a much longer N-terminal loop that contains a two-turn α-helical conformation in parallel to αB (12Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Kovacs J.J. Keaton M.A. Li S.S. Yao T.P. Zhou P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structure of the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain when in complex with full-length ubiquitin showed that the last three residues of ubiquitin C terminus were bound in an extended conformation within the predicted aromatic pocket. Importantly, and consistent with our previous data, there was no major interaction between the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP and the globular region of ubiquitin, which had weak or missing electron density in parts, presumably because of conformational heterogeneity within the crystal (Fig. 2B and Table 1). A higher resolution (1.7 Å) structure of HDAC6 ZnF-UBP with a bound ubiquitin C-terminal pentapeptide, RLRGG, confirmed such a binding mode (Fig. 2, B, C, and F). Interestingly, significant conformational changes were observed at Arg-1155, whose side chain ϵ-carbon atom (guanidino-C) swings 5.6 Å toward the binding pocket upon peptide binding, enabling hydrogen bond formation between the ω-nitrogen and the carbonyl group of ubiquitin Gly-75. Tyr-1156 was also rotated ∼20° toward the peptide, causing the ubiquitin C-terminal diglycine motif to be completely buried inside the ZnF-UBP domain. Thus, Arg-1155 and Tyr-1156 act as gatekeeper residues that move from an “open” to a “closed” conformation upon ubiquitin binding (Fig. 2D). The HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain and ubiquitin interacted mainly through a hydrogen bond network (Fig. 2E), which was very similar to the one in the USP5 ZnF-UBP and ubiquitin complex (Protein Data Bank code 2G45). However, HDAC6 ZnF-UBP lacks the additional contacts that USP5 ZnF-UBP makes with the globular surface of ubiquitin (13Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Our structural studies therefore demonstrate that the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP domain binds ubiquitin by recognizing the unanchored C-terminal tail, with the vast majority of the interactions made exclusively through the C-terminal diglycine motif. This domain makes no specific interaction with ubiquitin side chains beyond the C-terminal tail; indeed, the ubiquitin residues beyond the diglycine motif became increasingly “mobile” as indicated by their crystallographic B-factors (Fig. 2E).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and phasing statisticsHDAC6HDAC + peptide RLRGGHDAC6 + ubiquitinProtein Data Bank code3C5K3GV43PHDSpace groupP 21 2121P 212121P43212Unit cella = 40.5 b = 45.1 c = 55.8a = 31.7 b = 36.1 c = 89.0a = b = 133.7, c = 118.8BeamlineBNL X29ARIGAKU FR-EAPS,23ID-BWavelengthaApo-structure was collected at peak zinc wavelength.1.261.541.03317Resolution50–1.5550–1.7250–3.0Unique reflections10,03310,86522,204Data redundancy10.8 (6.0)5.8 (3.1)16.2 (16.5)Completeness (%)98.0 (80.5)94.9 (72.5)100 (100)I/σ(I)43.7 (5.8)28.0 (4.3)45.8 (4.7)RsymbRsym = sum(|I − <I>|)/sum(<I>), where I is the observed intensity, and <I> is the average intensity from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.0.071 (0.20)0.073 (0.23)0.091 (0.767)RefinementResolution35.07–1.5533.45–1.7232.7–3.0Reflections used954610,21322,135All atoms (solvent)1000 (156)1010 (205)3331 (2)Rwork/Rfree (%)cRfree value was calculated with ∼5% of the data.17.3/22.717.4/23.023.5 (26.5)Root mean square deviation Bond length0.0080.0100.01 Bond angle1.151.191.12 Mean B factor10.922.072.9Molprobidity Ramachandran plot Favored (%)97.296.093.98 Allowed (%)10010099.8 Outliers (%)001a Apo-structure was collected at peak zinc wavelength.b Rsym = sum(|I − <I>|)/sum(<I>), where I is the observed intensity, and <I> is the average intensity from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.c Rfree value was calculated with ∼5% of the data. Open table in a new tab So far, our work has indicated that HDAC6 ZnF-UBP specifically recognizes ubiquitin C terminus and is capable of binding protein aggregates. This result further suggests that HDAC6 ZnF-UBP interacts with protein aggregates exclusively through unanchored ubiquitin C termini in the aggregates and not through binding polyubiquitinated proteins directly. To detect the presence of unanchored ubiquitin C termini in protein aggregates, we used a ubiquitin C terminus-specific antibody (anti-UbiC) to probe the immunoprecipitated aggregates resolved by SDS-PAGE. The specificity of the anti-UbiC antibody was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. 3A) in which the antibody detected free ubiquitin C-terminal in pure mono- and tetraubiquitin peptides but only poorly detected the C-terminal AFC-conjugated ubiquitin. The low yet visible signal was likely due to contamination by a trace amount of unconjugated mono-ubiquitin, as seen from mass spectrometry analysis of the commercial ubiquitin-AFC sample (supplemental Fig. S3). AFC-conjugated ubiquitin appears as a peak at 8776 Da in the mass spectrum; however, we also detected a peak at 8565 Da that corresponds to unmodified ubiquitin with an unconjugated C terminus. This trace amount of unconjugated ubiquitin contributed to the low signal detected by the anti-UbiC antibody. When the same AFC-conjugated fraction was probed with an antibody specific for the ubiquitin N terminus (anti-UbiN), a robust signal was shown (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the anti-UbiC antibody recognized ubiquitin C-terminal with high preference. To further examine the specificity of anti-UbiC antibody, we probed various ubiquitin mutants with C-terminal truncations or point mutations with anti-UbiC and anti-UbiN antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, anti-UbiN antibody could recognize all the peptides (Fig. 3C, upper panel); however, anti-UbiC antibody failed to recognize Ub71, where the last five amino acids were missing, and only poorly recognized the other truncated (Ub74) or mutant (G75A/G76A) ubiquitin peptides (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Collectively, these experiments demonstrated the specificity of the ubiquitin C-terminal (anti-UbiC) antibody. Next, we used the anti-UbiC antibody to detect the presence of unanchored ubiquitin in aggregates in cultured cells. When GFP-CFTR-ΔF508 mutant protein aggregates formed in cultured 293T cells were pulled down with an anti-GFP antibody, a significant amount of unanchored mono- and polyubiquitin (oligomeric-ubiquitin and higher molecular weight ubiquitins) were detected by anti-UbiC antibody (Fig. 3E, lanes 1–3), and the level of unanchored ubiquitin from mono- and polyubiquitin was enhanced with MG132 treatment (Fig. 3E, lanes 4–6), confirming the presence of unanchored ubiquitin C termini in protein aggregates. Note that the results pertaining to lanes 7–12 in Fig. 3E will be described in the following section. Next, we used the anti-UbiC antibody to examine the distribution of ubiquitin C termini in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2094417413,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute pneumonitis in immunocompromised patients and chronic lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis and other bronchiectasis. Over 75% of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa secrete elastase B (LasB), an elastolytic metalloproteinase that is encoded by the lasB gene. Previously, in vitro studies have demonstrated that LasB degrades a number of components in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. These include surfactant proteins, antibacterial peptides, cytokines, chemokines and immunoglobulins. However, the contribution of LasB to lung infection by P. aeruginosa and to inactivation of pulmonary innate immunity in vivo needs more clarification. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying enhanced clearance of the ΔlasB mutant in mouse lungs. The ΔlasB mutant was attenuated in virulence when compared to the wild-type strain PAO1 during lung infection in SP-A+/+ mice. However, the ΔlasB mutant was as virulent as PAO1 in the lungs of SP-A⁻/⁻ mice. Detailed analysis showed that the ΔlasB mutant was more susceptible to SP-A-mediated opsonization but not membrane permeabilization. In vitro and in vivo phagocytosis experiments revealed that SP-A augmented the phagocytosis of ΔlasB mutant bacteria more efficiently than the isogenic wild-type PAO1. The ΔlasB mutant was found to have a severely reduced ability to degrade SP-A, consequently making it unable to evade opsonization by the collectin during phagocytosis. These results suggest that P. aeruginosa LasB protects against SP-A-mediated opsonization by degrading the collectin."

These same biological processes are also directly influenced by modification of proteins by monosaccharides of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Because the circadian clock and protein O-GlcNAcylation have common regulatory roles in the heart, we hypothesized that a relationship exists between the two. We report that total cardiac protein O-GlcNAc levels exhibit a diurnal variation in mouse hearts, peaking during the active/awake phase. Genetic ablation of the circadian clock specifically in cardiomyocytes in vivo abolishes diurnal variations in cardiac O-GlcNAc levels. These time-of-day-dependent variations appear to be mediated by clock-dependent regulation of O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase protein levels, glucose metabolism/uptake, and glutamine synthesis in an NAD-independent manner. We also identify the clock component Bmal1 as an O-GlcNAc-modified protein. Increasing protein O-GlcNAcylation (through pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAcase) results in diminished Per2 protein levels, time-of-day-dependent induction of bmal1 gene expression, and phase advances in the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock. Collectively, these data suggest that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock increases protein O-GlcNAcylation in the heart during the active/awake phase through coordinated regulation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and that protein O-GlcNAcylation in turn influences the timing of the circadian clock.

https://openalex.org/W2128655917,"Background There has not been sufficient evidence to support the Asians being less susceptible to pulmonary embolism (PE) than other ethnicities, because the prevalence of PE/deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in different racial and ethnic groups has not been carefully studied until recently except in Caucasians. To test the hypothesis that the Chinese population has a lower risk for PE, this study comprehensively assessed the hospital-based incidence and case fatality rates for PE during the 1997–2008 in China. Methods A registration study of patients with suspected PE syndromes admitted to 60 level-3 hospitals involved in the National Cooperative Project for the Prevention and Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism (NCPPT) was conducted from January 1997 to December 2008. The only exclusion criterion was an age of less than 18 years. Helical computed tomography scan, ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy or pulmonary angiography was carried out before or after hospitalization. All images were reviewed and evaluated independently by two specialists. Results A total of 18,206 patients were confirmed with PE from 16,972,182 hospital admissions. The annual incidence was 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1% to 0.2%). The overall incidence of PE in male patients (0.2%, 95% CI: 0.1% to 0.3%) was higher than that in female patients (0.1% and 95% CI: 0.0% to 0.1%). An increasing incidence gradient for PE was noticed from Southern to Northern China. In addition, the case fatality rate was apparently decreasing: 25.1% (95% CI: 16.2% to 36.9%) in 1997 to 8.7% (95% CI: 3.5% to 15.8%) in 2008. Conclusions Our findings suggest the relatively stable PE incidence and decreasing fatality trends in Chinese hospitals may be partially attributable to the implementation of the NCCPT and suggest the government should reevaluate the severity of PE so that health resources for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of PE could be used to their fullest."
https://openalex.org/W2139060426,"At the leading lamellipodium of migrating cells, protrusion of an Arp2/3-nucleated actin network is coupled to formation of integrin-based adhesions, suggesting that Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization and integrin-dependent adhesion may be mechanistically linked. Arp2/3 also mediates actin polymerization in structures distinct from the lamellipodium, in ""ventral F-actin waves"" that propagate as spots and wavefronts along the ventral plasma membrane. Here we show that integrins engage the extracellular matrix downstream of ventral F-actin waves in several mammalian cell lines as well as in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These ""adhesive F-actin waves"" require a cycle of integrin engagement and disengagement to the extracellular matrix for their formation and propagation, and exhibit morphometry and a hierarchical assembly and disassembly mechanism distinct from other integrin-containing structures. After Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, zyxin and VASP are co-recruited to adhesive F-actin waves, followed by paxillin and vinculin, and finally talin and integrin. Adhesive F-actin waves thus represent a previously uncharacterized integrin-based adhesion complex associated with Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2073455865,"Background Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a neuroinvasive virus responsible for several large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region while virulence determinant remains unexplored. Principal Findings In this report, we investigated increased virulence of unadapted EV71 clinical isolate 237 as compared with isolate 4643 in mice. A fragment 12 nucleotides in length in stem loop (SL) II of 237 5′-untranslated region (UTR) visibly reduced survival time and rate in mice was identified by constructing a series of infectious clones harboring chimeric 5′-UTR. In cells transfected with bicistronic plasmids, and replicon RNAs, the 12-nt fragment of isolate 237 enhanced translational activities and accelerated replication of subgenomic EV71. Finally, single nucleotide change from cytosine to uridine at base 158 in this short fragment of 5′-UTR was proven to reduce viral translation and EV71 virulence in mice. Results collectively indicated a pivotal role of novel virulence determinant C158 on virus translation in vitro and EV71 virulence in vivo. Conclusions These results presented the first reported virulence determinant in EV71 5′-UTR and first position discovered from unadapted isolates."

Sedentary behaviours, defined as hours per day spent watching TV, playing video games, recreational computer use and total screen time were measured by self-report. We examined the associations between sedentary behaviours and BP and lipids using multiple linear regression.Seated video gaming was the only sedentary behaviour associated with elevated BP and lipids before and after adjustment for age, sex, pubertal stage, parental education, body mass index (BMI), caloric intake, percent intake in dietary fat, physical activity (PA) duration, and PA intensity. Specifically, video gaming remained positively associated with systolic BP (adjusted r = 0.13, β = 1.1, p<0.05) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (adjusted r = 0.12, β = 0.14, p<0.05).Playing video games was the only form of sedentary behaviour that was independently associated with increased BP and lipids. Our findings provide support for reducing time spent playing seated video games as a possible means to promote health and prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in this high risk group of overweight and obese adolescents. Future research is needed to first replicate these findings and subsequently aim to elucidate the mechanisms linking seated video gaming and elevated BP and lipids in this high risk population.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00195858."
https://openalex.org/W1999360828,"White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is an infectious pathogen of shrimp and other crustaceans, and neither effective vaccines nor adequate treatments are currently available. WSSV is an enveloped dsDNA virus, and one of its major envelope proteins, VP28, plays a pivotal role in WSSV infection. In an attempt to develop a vaccine against WSSV, we inserted the VP28 gene into a baculovirus vector tailored to express VP28 on the baculovirus surface under the WSSV ie1 promoter (Bac-VP28). The Bac-VP28 incorporated abundant quantity (65.3 µg/ml) of VP28. Shrimp were treated by oral and immersion vaccination with either Bac-VP28 or wild-type baculovirus (Bac-wt). The treatment was followed by challenge with WSSV after 3 and 15 days. Bac-VP28 vaccinated shrimp showed significantly higher survival rates (oral: 81.7% and 76.7%; immersion: 75% and 68.4%) than Bac-wt or non-treated shrimp (100% mortality). To verify the protective effects of Bac-VP28, we examined in vivo expression of VP28 by immunohistochemistry and quantified the WSSV copy number by qPCR. In addition to that, we quantified the expression levels shrimp genes LGBP and STAT by real-time RT-PCR from the samples obtained from Bac-VP28 vaccinated shrimp at different duration of vaccine regime. Our findings indicate that oral vaccination of shrimp with Bac-VP28 is an attractive preventative measure against WSSV infection that can be used in the field."

Recently, lysozyme has been found to have anti-HIV and anti-cancer properties in mammals. However, most functional analyses were done in vitro using purified or recombinant lysozyme protein. Here, we used RNA interference to silence c-type lysozyme expression in penaeid shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus, to analyze the function of lysozyme in vivo. Silencing of lysozyme expression by dsRNA lysozyme (dsLYZ) led to 100% mortality without any artificial bacterial infection in 5 days. Lysozyme deficiency caused the number of hemocytes in hemolymph to decrease from 1.3 × 107 to 2.3 × 106 cells/ml and caused the number of bacteria to increase from 78 to 764 colony-forming units/ml. Suppression of bacterial growth using oxytetracycline and kanamycin showed improvement in mortality, suggesting that shrimp mortality post- dsLYZ injection can be attributed to bacterial growth in the shrimp hemolymph. The majority of the bacteria, identified by 16 S rRNA analysis, were Gram-negative species such as Vibrio and Pseudomonas. Furthermore, PKH26 staining showed that the dsLYZ-injected shrimp were unable to eliminate non pathogenic Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus in 24 h.

Aquatic organisms are in constant contact with a plethora of bacteria, many of which are pathogenic. Shrimp are protected from aquatic pathogens by their innate immune system (1Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2002; 12: 421-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The innate immune system in shrimp has both cellular and humoral responses. Although both responses start with the recognition of microbial components, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the cellular response is mediated mainly by hemocytes that directly attack pathogens, whereas the humoral response is mediated by the release of immune components into the hemolymph. The cellular response includes phagocytosis, nodule formation, and encapsulation, whereas the humoral response includes the prophenoloxidase (proPO) 2The abbreviations used are: proPOprophenoloxidaseAMPantimicrobial peptidesds-double-stranded. cascade, blood coagulation, and the release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). prophenoloxidase antimicrobial peptides double-stranded.

Meanwhile, injection of recombinant lysozyme protein protected blue shrimp from white spot syndrome virus, a virulent pathogen in shrimp, infection (29Mai W.J. Wang W.N. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2010; 28: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study we used RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of a c-type lysozyme in shrimp in order to analyze further its function in vivo. Our results on the localization and anti-bacterial function of lysozyme confirm that it has an important role in crustacean immunity. Kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) used in this study were purchased from a commercial shrimp farm in Miyazaki, Japan. All shrimp were screened for signs of infectious diseases and kept for at least 2–3 days in artificial seawater maintained at 25 °C and 30 parts per thousand before all experimental procedures. Shrimp were fed daily with a commercial shrimp feed. Specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was generated in vitro using a T7 RiboMAX Express System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, gene-specific primers with or without the T7 promoter sequence were designed to produce sense and antisense strands separately. The primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. PCR products were purified with GenEluteTM PCR Clean-Up kit (Sigma). The purified products were transcribed to yield single-stranded RNAs. Equal amounts of the single-stranded RNAs were annealed to produce double-stranded RNAs that were further purified and quantified for the in vivo experiment. Thirty μg of dsRNA was injected into a 10-g shrimp. Controls samples were injected with either PBS or GFP-dsRNA. Shrimp tissues (eye, gills, hemocytes, intestine, lymphoid organ, muscle, and stomach) were collected at specified time points. Total RNAs were isolated using RNAiso (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), and cDNAs were synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer instructions. RT-PCR analysis was conducted to check the gene expression patterns and confirm gene silencing. PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 28 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Transcripts were visualized and analyzed in 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For the Western blot analysis, shrimp tissues (gills, hemocytes, and lymphoid organ) were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF), mixed with 2 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and briefly centrifuged. Twenty μl of each sample was separated by 18% SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, Western blotting was performed using mouse anti-shrimp lysozyme serum (1: 5000 in blocking buffer) and HRP-conjugate anti-mouse IgG (Rockland) as a secondary antibody (1:10000 in blocking buffer). Finally, membranes were reacted with a chemiluminescent substrate. The recombinant lysozyme was prepared as described earlier (19Hikima S. Hikima J. Rojtinnakorn J. Hirono I. Aoki T. Gene. 2003; 316: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Lysozyme activity of hemocytes was assayed by the lysoplate method (30Minagawa S. Hikima J. Hirono I. Aoki T. Mori H. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2001; 25: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A gel plate was prepared containing 1% agarose in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and 1 mg/ml Micrococcus luteus (Sigma). Hemocytes were homogenized in PBS. Ten μl of homogenate was applied to a well on a plate, and the plate was incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. Lytic activity was indicated by cleared zones around the well. To suppress bacterial growth, antibiotics (oxytetracycline and kanamycin) were added to 60-liter tanks to a final concentration of 50 mg/liter. Control shrimp were reared in normal water. For each treatment, mortality was recorded daily. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured in LB medium until A600 = 1, fixed with 0.5% formalin solution for 24 h, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline, stained with PKH26 fluorescent dye following the manufacturer's instructions, and injected into shrimp at 1 day post-dsLYZ injection. The number of PKH-stained E. coli or S. aureus in the hemolymph was determined at 3, 6, and 24 h post-injection. Furthermore, to analyze bacterial growth in shrimp, GFP-expressing E. coli was injected to shrimp at 1 day post-dsLYZ injection. The number of GFP-expressing E. coli in the hemolymph was determined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days post-injection. RT-PCR analysis showed that lysozyme gene is expressed in shrimp immune-related organs such as gills, hemocytes, and lymphoid organ (Fig. 1A). All three of these tissues also showed lytic activity against M. luteus (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis detected lysozyme in the hemocytes but not in the serum (Fig. 1B), which explains why no lytic activity was observed in the serum (Fig. 1C). dsGFP injection did not affect lysozyme gene expression (supplemental Fig. S1). RT-PCR showed that injection of dsLYZ suppressed lysozyme mRNA from day 1 (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis also showed that lysozyme protein was suppressed in the gills, hemocytes, and lymphoid organ at day 3 post-dsLYZ injection (Fig. 1E). As expected, suppression of lysozyme gene and protein expression caused the loss of lytic activity against M. luteus (Fig. 1F). Silencing of lysozyme by dsLYZ resulted in 100% mortality within a few days, whereas the dsGFP- and PBS-injected groups suffered little mortality (Fig. 2A). Statistical analysis showed that mortality rates between dsLYZ-injected and control shrimp is highly significant (p = 3.39 × 10−14). In the 3 days after injection of dsLYZ, the number of circulating hemocytes gradually decreased from 1.3 × 107 to 2.3 × 106 cells/ml (Fig. 2B), whereas the number of bacteria in the hemolymph gradually increased from 78 to 764 colony-forming units/ml (Fig. 2C). To analyze the bacterial community present in lysozyme-silenced shrimp, bacterial colonies were sequenced using 16 S rDNA. Although it is not suited for quantitative study, it effectively showed the profile of bacteria in the shrimp hemolymph. From the 918 16 S rRNA fragments that were collected, 774 (84.6%) gene fragments were from Gram-negative bacteria, whereas 60 sequence (6.7%) were from Gram-positive bacteria (supplemental Fig. S2). In Gram-negative bacteria, 162 sequences (17.7%) were found to be from Vibrio sp., and 80 (8.8%) were from Escherichia sp. A small number of Gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria were detected such as Finegoldia sp., Staphylococcus sp., Nocardia sp., and Lyngbya sp. It was also not clear whether shrimp mortality was caused by bacterial growth alone or simply the lack of the lysozyme gene that could be essential to shrimp survival. To address this concern, antibiotics oxytetracycline and kanamycin were added in water. Oxytetracycline is a commonly used antibiotic in shrimp aquaculture. However, drug-resistant bacteria have been reported in shrimp ponds. Therefore, in addition to oxytetracycline, kanamycin, a drug not used in shrimp aquaculture, was used to suppress bacterial growth. DsLYZ injected shrimp kept in water treated with oxytetracycline and kanamycin showed 24–70% improved survival (Fig. 3) and is statistically significantly different from control (p = 0.0001299). To elucidate the role of shrimp lysozyme in vivo, nonpathogenic E. coli (Gram-negative) and (Gram-positive) S. aureus were injected into lysozyme-silenced shrimp. dsLYZ-injected shrimp showed higher E. coli counts and weaker bacterial clearing ability (1.8 × 106 cells/ml at 3 h and 1.8 × 105 cells/ml at 24 h post-injection) than those injected with either PBS or GFP (6.5 × 105 cells/ml at 3 h and 6.0 × 104 cells/ml at 24 h; 3.1 × 105 cells/ml at 3 h and 2.0 × 104 cells/ml at 24 h post-injection, respectively) (Fig. 4A). In the case of S. aureus, the dsLYZ-injected group also showed a much weaker bacterial clearing ability (1.2 × 105 cells/ml at 3 h and 2.0 × 104 cells/ml at 24 h post-injection) than both PBS- and GFP-injected groups (5.3 × 104 cells/ml at 3 h and 2.0 × 104 cells/ml at 24 h; 6.0 × 104 cells/ml at 3 h and 3.3 × 103 cells/ml at 24 h, respectively) (Fig. 4B). Although lysozyme-deficient shrimp were able to clear formalin-killed E. coli and S. aureus, higher numbers of these bacteria were observed in lysozyme-deficient shrimp at each time point. Furthermore, when control and lysozyme-silenced shrimp were injected with GFP-expressing E. coli, the number of E. coli in the hemolymph decreased in the former and gradually increased in the latter (Fig. 4C). RNAi, the introduction of dsRNA into cells to interfere with gene function, was first reported in Caenorhabditis elegans (31Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11740) Google Scholar) and has since been a staple in the analysis of gene function in many organisms. Introduction of dsRNA causes sequence-specific cleavage of target genes or inhibits transcription (32Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J.

Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar). In this study we used dsRNA specific to shrimp lysozyme to suppress lysozyme gene expression and understand the function of this gene in vivo. Shrimp hemocytes play a crucial role in the immune system and are involved in the mediation of both humoral and cellular responses. An earlier in situ hybridization analysis shows that shrimp lysozyme is expressed mainly in granular and semigranular hemocytes (36Burge E.J. Madigan D.J. Burnett L.E. Burnett K.G. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2007; 22: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we showed that shrimp c-type lysozyme was expressed not just in the hemocytes but also in the gills and lymphoid organ. In the shrimp hemolymph, lysozyme expression is confined to the hemocytes. The lymphoid organ is a primary site of bacterial accumulation and bacteriostasis and accommodates hemocytes that in turn facilitates bacterial phagocytosis (37van de Braak C.B. Botterblom M.H. Taverne N. van Muiswinkel W.B. Rombout J.H. van der Knaap W.P. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2002; 13: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Burgents J.E. Burnett L.E. Stabb E.V. Burnett K.G. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2005; 29: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Shrimp gills meanwhile play a multifunctional role and were reported to be a site of the formation of hemocyte nodules during foreign particle injection (39Martin G.G. Quintero M. Quigley M. Khosrovian H. J. Crust. Biol. 2000; 20: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the detection of lysozyme in the gills and lymphoid organ might have been because of the hemocytes present in these tissues. Injection of a dsRNA specific to lysozyme effectively suppressed mRNA and protein expressions of this gene. Along with the silencing of lysozyme expression, dsLYZ-injected shrimp showed decreased lytic activity against M. luteus, suggesting that shrimp lysozyme is involved in bacterial elimination. Silencing of lysozyme also resulted in a decreased number of hemocytes and increased number of bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, leading to shrimp mortality. Silencing of proPO also caused shrimp mortality without bacterial infection (40Fagutao F.F. Koyama T. Kaizu A. Saito-Taki T. Kondo H. Aoki T. Hirono I. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5298-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas suppression of clottable protein and transglutaminase rendered shrimp more susceptible to infection (41Maningas M.B. Kondo H. Hirono I. Saito-Taki T. Aoki T. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the components of shrimp immunity are closely correlated. The presence of bacteria in healthy shrimp is not surprising as bacteria have been found in the hemolymphs of other crustaceans, including horseshoe crab (42Brandin E.R. Pistole T.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 49: 718-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), blue crab (43Tubiash H.S. Sizemore R.K. Colwell R.R. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 388-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Sizemore R.K. Colwell R.R. Tubiash H.S. Lovelace T.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 393-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Davis J.W. Sizemore R.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 43: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and penaeid shrimp (46Gomez-Gil B. Tron-Mayén L. Roque A. Turnbull J.F. Inglis V. Guerra-Flores A.L. Aquaculture. 1998; 163: 1-9Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The interaction between crustaceans and the microorganisms present in their bodies, however, is not yet fully understood. When lysozyme-silenced shrimp were reared in oxytetracycline- and kanamycin-treated water to suppress bacterial growth, shrimp mortality improved. This indicates that the increase of bacteria endemic in shrimp triggered by the absence of lysozyme led to shrimp mortality. We also conducted microarray analysis to analyze the changes in the expression of other shrimp genes after dsLYZ injection. Our results showed that the absence of lysozyme caused the increase in expression of some putative immune-related genes such as histone, double-stranded binding protein, proteases, protease inhibitors, and hemocyanin (supplemental Table S3). On the other hand, not much change was observed in proPO, transglutaminase, and clottable protein (supplemental Table S3). These components are key molecules in melanization and blood coagulation, and their expressions were observed phenotypically because hemolymph of lysozyme-silenced shrimp exhibited melanization and coagulated immediately when withdrawn (supplemental Fig. S3). Suppression of proPO was previously shown to down-regulate the expressions of shrimp antimicrobial peptides such as penaeidin, crustin, and lysozyme (40Fagutao F.F. Koyama T. Kaizu A. Saito-Taki T. Kondo H. Aoki T. Hirono I. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5298-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that suppression of proPO suppresses lysozyme, but lysozyme does not suppress proPO suggests that proPO is a regulator of AMP gene expression. Earlier we mentioned that lysozyme recombinant protein has been shown to exhibit lytic activity against both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, whereas shrimp did not lose bacterial clearance ability, lysozyme-silenced shrimp showed weaker elimination ability to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Incomplete loss of bacterial clearance ability may be explained by the up-regulation of other immune-related genes or the presence of phagocytic activity. Furthermore, our results show that normal shrimp could easily eliminate GFP expressing E. coli, whereas lysozyme-deficient shrimp could not. E. coli also grew in lysozyme-deficient shrimp hemolymph. These results suggest that shrimp lysozyme suppresses a broad range of bacterial species. Furthermore, we conducted alignment analysis to confirm the specificity of c-type lysozyme knockdown. To date, only two lysozyme types (c-type and i-type) have been reported in shrimp. Accordingly, we compared the sequences of the i-type lysozymes (accession numbers GQ478703 and GQ478704) and the dsRNA sequence we used to silence the expression of the c-type lysozyme. The ClustalW result shows that the dsRNA c-type lysozyme sequence is 46 and 45% identical to shrimp i-type lysozyme 1 and 2, respectively. This suggests that silencing of the c-type lysozyme was gene-specific. In summary, the absence of lysozyme led to a decrease in hemocyte counts, increased bacterial counts in the hemolymph, and loss of lytic activity. It also caused the up-regulation of certain immune-related genes. The bacterial profile in lysozyme-deficient shrimp showed a proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria but was also found to have weaker elimination ability against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Taken together, our results show that lysozyme is an essential component of shrimp immunity, particularly in regulating bacterial community in the hemolymph, and suggest that it functions collectively with other immune-related genes in conferring immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2083961441,"Accumulation and deposition of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) are the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane has been shown to induce caspase activation and increase Aβ accumulation. In addition, recent studies suggest that isoflurane may directly promote the formation of cytotoxic soluble Aβ oligomers, which are thought to be the key pathological species in AD. In contrast, propofol, the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic, has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. We therefore set out to compare the effects of isoflurane and propofol alone and in combination on caspase-3 activation and Aβ oligomerization in vitro and in vivo. Naïve and stably-transfected H4 human neuroglioma cells that express human amyloid precursor protein, the precursor for Aβ; neonatal mice; and conditioned cell culture media containing secreted human Aβ40 or Aβ42 were treated with isoflurane and/or propofol. Here we show for the first time that propofol can attenuate isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation in cultured cells and in the brain tissues of neonatal mice. Furthermore, propofol-mediated caspase inhibition occurred when there were elevated levels of Aβ. Finally, isoflurane alone induces Aβ42, but not Aβ40, oligomerization, and propofol can inhibit the isoflurane-mediated oligomerization of Aβ42. These data suggest that propofol may mitigate the caspase-3 activation by attenuating the isoflurane-induced Aβ42 oligomerization. Our findings provide novel insights into the possible mechanisms of isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity that may aid in the development of strategies to minimize potential adverse effects associated with the administration of anesthetics to patients."

Prior work has suggested that a key component of NMO autoantibody (NMO-IgG) pathogenesis is internalization of AQP4 and the associated glutamate transporter EAAT2, leading to glutamate excitotoxicity. Here, we show selective endocytosis of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in transfected cell cultures, but little internalization in brain in vivo. AQP4-dependent endocytosis of NMO-IgG occurred rapidly in various AQP4-transfected cell lines, with efficient transport from early endosomes to lysosomes. Cell surface AQP4 was also reduced following NMO-IgG exposure. However, little or no internalization of NMO-IgG, AQP4, or EAAT2 was found in primary astrocyte cultures, nor was glutamate uptake affected by NMO-IgG exposure. Following injection of NMO-IgG into mouse brain, NMO-IgG binding and AQP4 expression showed a perivascular astrocyte distribution, without detectable cellular internalization over 24 h. We conclude that astrocyte endocytosis of NMO-IgG, AQP4, and EAAT2 is not a significant consequence of AQP4 autoantibody in vivo, challenging generally accepted views about NMO pathogenesis.

A defining feature of NMO is the presence of autoantibodies in serum against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (3Lennon V.A. Kryzer T.J. Pittock S.J. Verkman A.S. Hinson S.R. J. Exp.

NMO autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) are believed to be pathogenic by a mechanism involving complement- and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, elaboration of inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte accumulation (1Jarius S.

NMO lesions are characterized by loss of AQP4 and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), complement deposition, inflammation, and demyelination (1Jarius S. Wildemann B. Nat.

Neurol. August 2, 2011; 10.1002/ana.22551Google Scholar). It is not known how NMO-IgG enters the central nervous system through an initially intact blood-brain barrier or why NMO-IgG does not cause pathology in peripheral tissues where AQP4 is expressed. Another unresolved aspect of NMO pathology is how NMO-IgG-induced primary astrocyte injury leads to demyelination and neuronal impairment.NMO-IgG-dependent astrocyte pathology requires AQP4 exposure on the cell surface to bind and activate complement and cytotoxic leukocytes. Paradoxically, prior studies showed rapid internalization in vitro of AQP4 in response to NMO serum (12Hinson S.R. Pittock S.J. Lucchinetti C.F. Roemer S.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Lennon V.A.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 5730-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which, rather than promoting NMO pathogenesis, would protect astrocytes from cytotoxicity. One study also reported internalization of glutamate transporter EAAT2 together with AQP4 (13Hinson S.R. Roemer S.F. Lucchinetti C.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Chamberlain J.L. Howe C.L. Pittock S.J. Lennon V.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2473-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and concluded that NMO pathogenesis involves glutamate excitotoxicity by a mechanism involving NMO-IgG-induced internalization of EAAT2 and consequent impairment in glutamate uptake from the extracellular space following neuroexcitation. Marignier et al. (15Marignier R. Nicolle A. Watrin C. Touret M. Cavagna S. Varrin-Doyer M. Cavillon G. Rogemond V. Confavreux C. Honnorat J. Giraudon P. Brain. 2010; 133: 2578-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) showed that elevated extracellular glutamate could injure oligodendrocytes in an astrocyte/oligodendrocyte mixed primary cell culture. They suggested glutamate excitotoxicity as a possible cause of demyelination in NMO. Based on this mechanism, ceftriaxone, which up-regulates EAAT2 (16Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C. Huang Y.H. Bergles D.E. Jin L. Dykes Hoberg M. Vidensky S. Chung D.S. Toan S.V. Bruijn L.I. Su Z.Z. Gupta P. Fisher P.B. Nature. 2005; 433: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), has been proposed as a therapy for NMO.Cellular internalization of AQP4, EAAT2, and NMO-IgG, if it occurs in the CNS in vivo, would have important implications for NMO pathogenesis and therapy (see “Discussion”). Here, quantitative biophysical and biochemical assays of internalization were done in cell cultures and in live mice, utilizing for some studies a fluorescently labeled monoclonal recombinant NMO-IgG for real time antibody tracking in live cells. We found rapid and selective internalization of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in transfected cell cultures, but little or no internalization of NMO-IgG, AQP4, or EAAT2 in primary astrocytes, or of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in brain. Our results thus challenge a widely cited view of NMO disease pathogenesis.DISCUSSIONAlthough NMO-IgG binding to AQP4 in transfected cell cultures caused internalization of itself and AQP4 by an endocytic mechanism, little or no internalization was found in astrocyte cultures or in brain. We found that NMO-IgG is internalized in several transfected cell lines expressing M1- or M23-AQP4. These results agree with previous work showing internalization of AQP4 in HEK 293 cells transfected with a GFP-AQP4 chimera (12Hinson S.R. Pittock S.J. Lucchinetti C.F. Roemer S.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Lennon V.A. Neurology. 2007; 69: 2221-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Interestingly, endocytosis of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in cell cultures was rapid and selective, as internalization was not seen of a Myc antibody upon binding to Myc-tagged AQP4. NMO-IgG internalization, like that of many ligands when bound to their receptors (25Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), probably involves transduction of the extracellular binding signal to the cytoplasmic endocytosis machinery.The minimal internalization of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in primary astrocyte cultures found here differs from conclusions of two previous studies (13Hinson S.R. Roemer S.F. Lucchinetti C.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Chamberlain J.L. Howe C.L. Pittock S.J. Lennon V.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2473-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14Vincent T.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 5730-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), where micrographs were reported of a few, fixed/permeabilized cells that were stained for AQP4 after exposure to NMO serum. It is difficult with the prior methods to localize AQP4 confidently, especially in cultured astrocytes that are quite flat, heterogeneous, and have complex morphology. Here, using sensitive, quantitative assays of NMO-IgG-Cy3 internalization and AQP4 surface expression, done on many cells in multiple cell cultures, we found little or no NMO-IgG or AQP4 internalization. The lack of internalization in primary astrocytes was not a consequence of a generally low level of endocytosis because rapid internalization was found for Texas Red hydrazide, a marker of fluid phase endocytosis, and fluorescein-transferrin, a marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings in astrocyte cell culture are supported by the minimal internalization of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in mouse brain in vivo. The localization of rAb-53-Cy3 and AQP4 after intracerebral injection of antibody was strictly perivascular and quite different from that of astrocyte cell bodies as stained by GFAP or internalized Texas Red hydrazide.The minimal internalization of NMO-IgG and AQP4 on astrocytes in vivo and the tight binding of NMO-IgG to AQP4 (22Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16516-16524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) result in prolonged exposure of NMO-IgG at the cell surface. Exposure of NMO-IgG at the astrocyte surface is predicted to exacerbate NMO pathology, as it would promote the binding and activation of complement and cytotoxic leukocytes. The inefficient endocytosis of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in astrocyte cultures and in vivo may be related to astrocyte-specific factors, perhaps the putative macromolecular cell membrane complex containing AQP4, α-syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystroglycans (26Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Ottersen O.P. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14108-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), as well as to AQP4 polarization to astrocyte end feet (26Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Ottersen O.P. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14108-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which do not occur in transfected cell culture models.Loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity is a prominent feature of NMO lesions that is not seen in multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory diseases (28Misu T. Fujihara K. Kakita A. Konno H. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Takahashi T. Nakashima I. Takahashi H. Itoyama Y. Brain. 2007; 130: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanisms of AQP4 loss include its endocytosis and targeting for lysosomal degradation and astrocyte loss following complement and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The parallel loss of GFAP and AQP4 supports the second mechanism, as does our finding of minimal AQP4 internalization in vivo even following exposure to large amounts of NMO-IgG in the form of a pathogenic recombinant monoclonal antibody or of IgG from human NMO sera. Moreover, if coinjected into brain with human complement, the NMO-IgG as used here produces NMO-like lesions with loss of AQP4, GFAP, and myelin, leukocyte infiltration, and deposition of activated complement (7Saadoun S. Waters P. Bell B.A. Vincent A. Verkman A.S. Papadopoulos M.C. Brain. 2010; 133: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, intracerebral injection of NMO-IgG without complement does not cause loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity (7Saadoun S. Waters P. Bell B.A. Vincent A. Verkman A.S. Papadopoulos M.C. Brain. 2010; 133: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A therapy-relevant consequence of our findings is that NMO pathology is predicted to be reduced by maneuvers that lower expression of AQP4 on the astrocyte surface or promote its internalization following NMO-IgG binding, perhaps by interfering with polarization mechanisms.We found no significant internalization of glutamate transporter EAAT2 on astrocytes after exposure to high concentrations of NMO-IgG, both by EAAT2 immunofluorescence and by functional assay of glutamate uptake. EAAT2 and AQP4 cointernalization were previously demonstrated in AQP4-transfected HEK-293 cells (13Hinson S.R. Roemer S.F. Lucchinetti C.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Chamberlain J.L. Howe C.L. Pittock S.J. Lennon V.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2473-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Perhaps AQP4 overexpression in HEK-293 cells produced interactions between EAAT2 and AQP4 that do not occur in astrocytes. In the same study (13Hinson S.R. Roemer S.F. Lucchinetti C.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Chamberlain J.L. Howe C.L. Pittock S.J. Lennon V.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2473-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the reported reduction in EAAT2 and AQP4 expression in spinal cord of NMO patients may be related to astrocyte loss rather than cointernalization of AQP4 and EAAT2. Although we think it unlikely, our data do not rule out the involvement of glutamate excitotoxicity in NMO because impaired glutamate uptake might occur by astrocyte loss rather than EAAT2 internalization. Mice deficient in EAAT2 show lethal spontaneous seizures and increased susceptibility to acute cortical injury due to elevated levels of glutamate in brain (20Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K. Iwama H. Nishikawa T. Ichihara N. Kikuchi T. Okuyama S. Kawashima N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Wada K. Science. 1997; 276: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). EAAT2 internalization, if it occurred, would be predicted to produce a seizure phenotype, which is not found clinically in NMO. We conclude that EAAT2 up-regulation by ceftriaxone would not have therapeutic utility in NMO.In conclusion, our data challenge two widely cited mechanisms of NMO disease pathogenesis: NMO-IgG-induced AQP4 internalization and NMO-IgG-induced EAAT2 internalization. The continued exposure of NMO-IgG-bound AQP4 at the astrocyte cell surface in NMO is likely an important mechanism in NMO pathogenesis because it provides a continued focus for cytotoxic complement and leukocyte interactions.

A defining feature of NMO is the presence of autoantibodies in serum against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (3Lennon V.A. Kryzer T.J. Pittock S.J. Verkman A.S. Hinson S.R. J. Exp.

NMO autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) are believed to be pathogenic by a mechanism involving complement- and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, elaboration of inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte accumulation (1Jarius S.

NMO lesions are characterized by loss of AQP4 and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), complement deposition, inflammation, and demyelination (1Jarius S. Wildemann B. Nat.

Neurol. August 2, 2011; 10.1002/ana.22551Google Scholar). It is not known how NMO-IgG enters the central nervous system through an initially intact blood-brain barrier or why NMO-IgG does not cause pathology in peripheral tissues where AQP4 is expressed. Another unresolved aspect of NMO pathology is how NMO-IgG-induced primary astrocyte injury leads to demyelination and neuronal impairment.NMO-IgG-dependent astrocyte pathology requires AQP4 exposure on the cell surface to bind and activate complement and cytotoxic leukocytes. Paradoxically, prior studies showed rapid internalization in vitro of AQP4 in response to NMO serum (12Hinson S.R. Pittock S.J. Lucchinetti C.F. Roemer S.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Lennon V.A.

One study also reported internalization of glutamate transporter EAAT2 together with AQP4 (13Hinson S.R. Roemer S.F. Lucchinetti C.F. Fryer J.P. Kryzer T.J. Chamberlain J.L. Howe C.L. Pittock S.J.

Marignier et al. (15Marignier R. Nicolle A. Watrin C. Touret M. Cavagna S. Varrin-Doyer M. Cavillon G. Rogemond V. Confavreux C. Honnorat J. Giraudon P.

They suggested glutamate excitotoxicity as a possible cause of demyelination in NMO. Based on this mechanism, ceftriaxone, which up-regulates EAAT2 (16Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C.

Here, quantitative biophysical and biochemical assays of internalization were done in cell cultures and in live mice, utilizing for some studies a fluorescently labeled monoclonal recombinant NMO-IgG for real time antibody tracking in live cells. We found rapid and selective internalization of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in transfected cell cultures, but little or no internalization of NMO-IgG, AQP4, or EAAT2 in primary astrocytes, or of NMO-IgG and AQP4 in brain. Our results thus challenge a widely cited view of NMO disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973417048,"The vascular fibrinolytic system is crucial for spontaneous lysis of blood clots. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), the principal inhibitor of the key fibrinolytic enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), is present in platelets at high concentrations. However, the majority of PAI-1 stored in platelets has been considered to be inactive. Our recent finding (Brogren H, et al. Blood 2004) that PAI-1 de novo synthesized in platelets remained active for over 24 h, suggested that PAI-1 stored in the α-granules might be active to a larger extent than previously reported. To re-evaluate this issue, we performed experiments where the fraction of active PAI-1 was estimated by analyzing the tPA-PAI-1 complex formation. In these experiments platelets were lysed with Triton X-100 in the presence of serial dilutions of tPA and subsequently the tPA-PAI-1 complex was evaluated by Western blot. Also, using a non-immunologic assay, tPA was labeled with 125I, and 125I-tPA and 125I-tPA-PAI-1 was quantified by scintigraphy. Interestingly, both methods demonstrated that the majority (>50%) of platelet PAI-1 is active. Further analyses suggested that pre-analytical procedures used in previous studies (sonication or freezing/thawing) may have substantially reduced the activity of platelet PAI-1, which has lead to an underestimation of the proportion of active PAI-1. Our in vitro results are more compatible with the role of PAI-1 in clot stabilization as demonstrated in physiological and pathophysiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W1988203287,"Background Microsatellites, a special class of repetitive DNA sequence, have become one of the most popular genetic markers for population/conservation genetic studies. However, its application to endangered species has been impeded by high development costs, a lack of available sequences, and technical difficulties. The water deer Hydropotes inermis is the sole existing endangered species of the subfamily Capreolinae. Although population genetics studies are urgently required for conservation management, no species-specific microsatellite marker has been reported. Methods We adopted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to elucidate the microsatellite markers of Korean water deer and overcome these impediments on marker developments. We performed genotyping to determine the efficiency of this method as applied to population genetics. Results We obtained 98 Mbp of nucleotide information from 260,467 sequence reads. A total of 20,101 di-/tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were identified; di-repeats were 5.9-fold more common than tri-repeats. [CA]n and [AAC]n/[AAT]n repeats were the most frequent di- and tri-repeats, respectively. Of the 17,206 di-repeats, 12,471 microsatellite primer pairs were derived. PCR amplification of 400 primer pairs yielded 106 amplicons and 79 polymorphic markers from 20 individual Korean water deer. Polymorphic rates of the 79 new microsatellites varied from 2 to 11 alleles per locus (He: 0.050–0.880; Ho: 0.000–1.000), while those of known microsatellite markers transferred from cattle to Chinese water deer ranged from 4 to 6 alleles per locus (He: 0.279–0.714; Ho: 0.300–0.400). Conclusions Polymorphic microsatellite markers from Korean water deer were successfully identified using NGS without any prior sequence information and deposited into the public database. Thus, the methods described herein represent a rapid and low-cost way to investigate the population genetics of endangered/non-model species."
https://openalex.org/W2055666931,"Well balanced novelty seeking and exploration are fundamental behaviours for survival and are found to be dysfunctional in several psychiatric disorders. Recent studies suggest that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is an important control system for investigatory drive. Pharmacological treatment of rodents with cannabinergic drugs results in altered social and object investigation. Interestingly, contradictory results have been obtained, depending on the treatment, drug concentration and experimental conditions. The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, a central component of the eCB system, is predominantly found at the synapses of two opposing neuronal populations, i.e. on inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. In the present study, using different transgenic mouse lines, we aimed at investigating the impact of CB1 receptor inactivation in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons on investigatory behaviour. We evaluated animate (interaction partner) and inanimate (object) exploratory behaviour in three different paradigms. We show that exploration was increased when CB1 receptor was deleted from cortical and striatal GABAergic neurons. No effect was observed when CB1 receptor was deleted specifically from dopamine receptor D1-expressing striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons. In contrast, deletion of CB1 receptor from cortical glutamatergic neurons resulted in a decreased exploration. Thus, our results indicate that exploratory behaviour is accurately balanced in both, the social and non-social context, by the eCB system via CB1 receptor activation on cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. In addition, the results could explain the contradictory findings of previous pharmacological studies and could further suggest a possibility to readjust an imbalance in exploratory behaviour observed in psychiatric disorders."

Despite extensive research, the molecular basis for the broad specificity of SULTs is still not understood. Here, structural, protein engineering and kinetic approaches were employed to obtain deep understanding of the molecular basis for the broad specificity, catalytic activity and substrate inhibition of SULT1A1. We have determined five new structures of SULT1A1 in complex with different acceptors, and utilized a directed evolution approach to generate SULT1A1 mutants with enhanced thermostability and increased catalytic activity. We found that active site plasticity enables binding of different acceptors and identified dramatic structural changes in the SULT1A1 active site leading to the binding of a second acceptor molecule in a conserved yet non-productive manner. Our combined approach highlights the dominant role of SULT1A1 structural flexibility in controlling the specificity and activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2055161360,"Initial rates of E1-catalyzed E2 transthiolation have been used as a reporter function to probe the mechanism of 125I-ubiquitin transfer between activation and ligation half-reactions of ubiquitin conjugation. A functional survey of 11 representative human E2 paralogs reveals similar Km for binding to human Uba1 ternary complex (Km(ave)=121±72 nm) and kcat for ubiquitin transfer (kcat(ave)=4.0±1.2 s(-1)), suggesting that they possess a conserved binding site and transition state geometry and that they compete for charging through differences in intracellular concentration. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis localize this binding motif to three basic residues within Helix 1 of the E2 core domain, confirmed by transthiolation kinetics. Partial conservation of the motif among E2 paralogs not recognized by Uba1 suggests that another factor(s) account for the absolute specificity of cognate E2 binding. Truncation of the Uba1 carboxyl-terminal β-grasp domain reduces cognate Ubc2b binding by 31-fold and kcat by 3.5×10(4)-fold, indicating contributions to E2 binding and transition state stabilization. Truncation of the paralogous domain from the Nedd8 activating enzyme has negligible effect on cognate Ubc12 transthiolation but abrogates E2 specificity toward non-cognate carrier proteins. Exchange of the β-grasp domains between ubiquitin and Nedd8 activating enzymes fails to reverse the effect of truncation. Thus, the conserved Helix 1 binding motif and the β-grasp domain direct general E2 binding, whereas the latter additionally serves as a specificity filter to exclude charging of non-cognate E2 paralogs in order to maintain the fidelity of downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2099803153,"The distribution of parasites among hosts is often characterised by a high degree of heterogeneity with a small number of hosts harbouring the majority of parasites. Such patterns of aggregation have been linked to variation in host exposure and susceptibility as well as parasite traits and environmental factors. Host exposure and susceptibility may differ with sexes, reproductive effort and group size. Furthermore, environmental factors may affect both the host and parasite directly and contribute to temporal heterogeneities in parasite loads. We investigated the contributions of host and parasite traits as well as season on parasite loads in highveld mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus pretoriae). This cooperative breeder exhibits a reproductive division of labour and animals live in colonies of varying sizes that procreate seasonally. Mole-rats were parasitised by lice, mites, cestodes and nematodes with mites (Androlaelaps sp.) and cestodes (Mathevotaenia sp.) being the dominant ecto- and endoparasites, respectively. Sex and reproductive status contributed little to the observed parasite prevalence and abundances possibly as a result of the shared burrow system. Clear seasonal patterns of parasite prevalence and abundance emerged with peaks in summer for mites and in winter for cestodes. Group size correlated negatively with mite abundance while it had no effect on cestode burdens and group membership affected infestation with both parasites. We propose that the mode of transmission as well as social factors constrain parasite propagation generating parasite patterns deviating from those commonly predicted."
https://openalex.org/W2094823189,"Tuberculosis is still a leading cause of death worldwide. The selection and spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR-TB) is a severe public health problem. Recently, two different classes of chemical series, the benzothiazinones (BTZ) and the dinitrobenzamide (DNB) derivatives have been found to be highly active against M. tuberculosis, including XDR-TB strains. The target of BTZs is DprE1 protein which works in concert with DprE2 to form the heteromeric decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose 2′-epimerase, involved in Decaprenyl-Phospho-Arabinose (DPA) biosynthesis. Interestingly, it has been shown that the DNBs block the same pathway thus suggesting that both drugs could share the same target. Moreover, in Mycobacterium smegmatis the overexpression of the NfnB nitroreductase led to the inactivation of the BTZs by reduction of a critical nitro-group to an amino-group. In this work several spontaneous M. smegmatis mutants resistant to DNBs were isolated. Sixteen mutants, showing high levels of DNB resistance, exhibited a mutation in the Cys394 of DprE1. Using fluorescence titration and mass spectrometry it has been possible to monitor the binding between DprE1 and DNBs, achieving direct evidence that MSMEG_6382 is the cellular target of DNBs in mycobacteria. Additionally, M. smegmatis mutants having low levels of resistance to DNBs harbor various mutations in MSMEG_6503 gene encoding the transcriptional repressor of the nitroreductase NfnB. By LC/MS2 analysis it has been demonstrated that NfnB is responsible for DNB inactivation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both DNB and BTZ drugs share common resistance mechanisms in M. smegmatis."

Objectives To determine compliance to isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy (IPT) and its effectiveness in preventing (TB) disease in children in contact with adults with pulmonary TB (PTB). Design This was a prospective cohort study of children <15 years old in contact with adults with smear-positive PTB. Asymptomatic children ≤5 years were provided IPT independently of their Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) status and children >5 years old were given advice but did not receive IPT, as recommended by the National TB control programme. Compliance to IPT and incidence of clinical TB were determined monthly for six months and then quarterly for up to 30 months. Results One hundred and eighty four children in contact with 83 smear-positive PTB cases were identified. Eighty two were ≤5 and 102>5 years old. Only 27 (33%) of 82 children given IPT took it for >4 months and 10 (12%) completed the 6-month course. The main reason for non-compliance was the perception that drugs were not necessary when the child was healthy. Eleven children (all except one >5 years old) developed symptoms of TB disease and initiated treatment, resulting in an incidence of 28.6 cases for all and 53.5 for children >5 years old per 1000 children-year. Conclusion Compliance to IPT in children is poor in Southern Region of Ethiopia and this was associated with the parents' perception of the low importance of chemoprophylaxis in asymptomatic children. Poor compliance might be an important barrier for the wider implementation of IPT. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00456469"
https://openalex.org/W2083112131,"PDZ domains recognise short sequence motifs at the extreme C-termini of proteins. A model based on microarray data has been recently published for predicting the binding preferences of PDZ domains to five residue long C-terminal sequences. Here we investigated the potential of this predictor for discovering novel protein interactions that involve PDZ domains. When tested on real negative data assembled from published literature, the predictor displayed a high false positive rate (FPR). We predicted and experimentally validated interactions between four PDZ domains derived from the human proteins MAGI1 and SCRIB and 19 peptides derived from human and viral C-termini of proteins. Measured binding intensities did not correlate with prediction scores, and the high FPR of the predictor was confirmed. Results indicate that limitations of the predictor may arise from an incomplete model definition and improper training of the model. Taking into account these limitations, we identified several novel putative interactions between PDZ domains of MAGI1 and SCRIB and the C-termini of the proteins FZD4, ARHGAP6, NET1, TANC1, GLUT7, MARCH3, MAS, ABC1, DLL1, TMEM215 and CYSLTR2. These proteins are localised to the membrane or suggested to act close to it and are often involved in G protein signalling. Furthermore, we showed that, while extension of minimal interacting domains or peptides toward tandem constructs or longer peptides never suppressed their ability to interact, the measured affinities and inferred specificity patterns often changed significantly. This suggests that if protein fragments interact, the full length proteins are also likely to interact, albeit possibly with altered affinities and specificities. Therefore, predictors dealing with protein fragments are promising tools for discovering protein interaction networks but their application to predict binding preferences within networks may be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2012112040,"RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that spatially and temporally regulates numerous signaling cascades. We previously found that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway induces the translocation of RACK1 to the nucleus. We further showed that nuclear RACK1 is required to promote the transcription of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we set out to elucidate the mechanism underlying cAMP-dependent RACK1 nuclear translocation and BDNF transcription. We identified the scaffolding protein 14-3-3ζ as a direct binding partner of RACK1. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3ζ was necessary for the cAMP-dependent translocation of RACK1 to the nucleus. We further observed that the disruption of RACK1/14-3-3ζ interaction with a peptide derived from the RACK1/14-3-3ζ binding site or shRNA-mediated 14-3-3ζ knockdown inhibited cAMP induction of BDNF transcription. Together, these data reveal that the function of nuclear RACK1 is mediated through its interaction with 14-3-3ζ. As RACK1 and 14-3-3ζ are two multifunctional scaffolding proteins that coordinate a wide variety of signaling events, their interaction is likely to regulate other essential cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2169912468,"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, the bone marrow niche is widely known to be an important element of treatment response and relapse. Furthermore, a characteristic liver pathology observed in ALL patients implies that the hepatic microenvironment provides an extramedullary niche for leukemic cells. However, it remains unclear whether the liver actually provides a specific niche. The mechanism underlying this pathology is also poorly understood. Here, to answer these questions, we reconstituted the histopathology of leukemic liver by using patients-derived primary ALL cells into NOD/SCID/Yc null mice. The liver pathology in this model was similar to that observed in the patients. By using this model, we clearly demonstrated that bile duct epithelial cells form a hepatic niche that supports infiltration and proliferation of ALL cells in the liver. Furthermore, we showed that functions of the niche are maintained by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, proposing a novel therapeutic approach targeting the extramedullary niche by inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the liver dissemination of leukemia is not due to nonselective infiltration, but rather systematic invasion and proliferation of leukemic cells in hepatic niche. Although the contribution of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is reported in some cancer cells or leukemic niches such as bone marrow, we demonstrated that this axis works even in the extramedullary niche of leukemic cells. Our findings form the basis for therapeutic approaches that target the extramedullary niche by inhibiting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2026205554,"Background The study aimed to quantify changes of the optic nerve head (ONH) during exposure to high altitude and to assess a correlation with acute mountain sickness (AMS). This work is related to the Tuebingen High Altitude Ophthalmology (THAO) study. Methodology/Principal Findings A confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO, Heidelberg Retina Tomograph, HRT3®) was used to quantify changes at the ONH in 18 healthy participants before, during and after rapid ascent to high altitude (4559 m). Slitlamp biomicroscopy was used for clinical optic disc evaluation; AMS was assessed with Lake Louise (LL) and AMS-cerebral (AMS-c) scores; oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored. These parameters were used to correlate with changes at the ONH. After the first night spent at high altitude, incidence of AMS was 55% and presence of clinical optic disc edema (ODE) 79%. Key stereometric parameters of the HRT3® used to describe ODE (mean retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness, RNFL cross sectional area, optic disc rim volume and maximum contour elevation) changed significantly at high altitude compared to baseline (p<0.05) and were consistent with clinically described ODE. All changes were reversible in all participants after descent. There was no significant correlation between parameters of ODE and AMS, SpO2 or HR. Conclusions/Significance Exposure to high altitude leads to reversible ODE in the majority of healthy subjects. However, these changes did not correlate with AMS or basic physiologic parameters such as SpO2 and HR. For the first time, a quantitative approach has been used to assess these changes during acute, non-acclimatized high altitude exposure. In conclusion, ODE presents a reaction of the body to high altitude exposure unrelated to AMS."
https://openalex.org/W2078631508,"Background In most animal species, males and females exhibit differences in behavior and morphology that relate to their respective roles in reproduction. DM (Doublesex/MAB-3) domain transcription factors are phylogenetically conserved regulators of sexual development. They are thought to establish sexual traits by sex-specifically modifying the activity of general developmental programs. However, there are few examples where the details of these interactions are known, particularly in the nervous system. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we show that two C. elegans DM domain genes, dmd-3 and mab-23, regulate sensory and muscle cell development in a male neural circuit required for mating. Using genetic approaches, we show that in the circuit sensory neurons, dmd-3 and mab-23 establish the correct pattern of dopaminergic (DA) and cholinergic (ACh) fate. We find that the ETS-domain transcription factor gene ast-1, a non-sex-specific, phylogenetically conserved activator of dopamine biosynthesis gene transcription, is broadly expressed in the circuit sensory neuron population. However, dmd-3 and mab-23 repress its activity in most cells, promoting ACh fate instead. A subset of neurons, preferentially exposed to a TGF-beta ligand, escape this repression because signal transduction pathway activity in these cells blocks dmd-3/mab-23 function, allowing DA fate to be established. Through optogenetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that the sensory and muscle cell characteristics controlled by dmd-3 and mab-23 are crucial for circuit function. Conclusions/Significance In the C. elegans male, DM domain genes dmd-3 and mab-23 regulate expression of cell sub-type characteristics that are critical for mating success.

Homologous interactions between vertebrate counterparts could regulate sex differences in neuron sub-type populations in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2080108288,"HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) mediate virus entry by fusing the viral and target cell membranes, a multi-step process that represents an attractive target for inhibition. Entry inhibitors with broad-range activity against diverse isolates of HIV-1 may be extremely useful as lead compounds for the development of therapies or prophylactic microbicides. To facilitate the identification of such inhibitors, we have constructed a cell-cell fusion system capable of simultaneously monitoring inhibition efficiency and specificity. In this system, effector cells stably express a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) that enables tightly inducible expression of both HIV-1 Env and the Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) reporter protein. Target cells express the HIV-1 receptors, CD4 and CCR5, and carry the firefly luciferase (F-Luc) reporter gene under the control of a tTA-responsive promoter. Thus, Env-mediated fusion of these two cell types allows the tTA to diffuse to the target cell and activate the expression of the F-Luc protein. The efficiency with which an inhibitor blocks cell-cell fusion is measured by a decrease in the F-Luc activity, while the specificity of the inhibitor is evaluated by its effect on the R-Luc activity. The system exhibited a high dynamic range and high Z'-factor values. The assay was validated with a reference panel of inhibitors that target different steps in HIV-1 entry, yielding inhibitory concentrations comparable to published virus inhibition data. Our system is suitable for large-scale screening of chemical libraries and can also be used for detailed characterization of inhibitory and cytotoxic properties of known entry inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1968020127,"T46I is the second mutation on the hVAPB MSP domain which was recently identified from non-Brazilian kindred to cause a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here using CD, NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we characterized the structure, stability, dynamics and binding capacity of the T46I-MSP domain. The results reveal: 1) unlike P56S which we previously showed to completely eliminate the native MSP structure, T46I leads to no significant disruption of the native secondary and tertiary structures, as evidenced from its far-UV CD spectrum, as well as Cα and Cβ NMR chemical shifts. 2) Nevertheless, T46I does result in a reduced thermodynamic stability and loss of the cooperative urea-unfolding transition. As such, the T46I-MSP domain is more prone to aggregation than WT at high protein concentrations and temperatures in vitro, which may become more severe in the crowded cellular environments. 3) T46I only causes a 3-fold affinity reduction to the Nir2 peptide, but a significant elimination of its binding to EphA4. 4) EphA4 and Nir2 peptide appear to have overlapped binding interfaces on the MSP domain, which strongly implies that two signaling networks may have a functional interplay in vivo. 5) As explored by both H/D exchange and MD simulations, the MSP domain is very dynamic, with most loop residues and many residues on secondary structures highly fluctuated or/and exposed to bulk solvent. Although T46I does not alter overall dynamics, it does trigger increased dynamics of several local regions of the MSP domain which are implicated in binding to EphA4 and Nir2 peptide. Our study provides the structural and dynamic understanding of the T46I-causing ALS; and strongly highlights the possibility that the interplay of two signaling networks mediated by the FFAT-containing proteins and Eph receptors may play a key role in ALS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004297097,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-clamping using blocking primer and DNA-analogs, such as peptide nucleotide acid (PNA), may be used to selectively amplify target DNA for molecular diet analysis. We investigated PCR-clamping efficiency by studying PNA position and mismatch with complementary DNA by designing PNAs at five different positions on the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1 of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica in association with intra-specific nucleotide substitutions. All five PNAs were observed to efficiently inhibit amplification of a fully complementary DNA template. One mismatch between PNA and template DNA inhibited amplification of the template DNA, while two or more mismatches did not. DNA samples extracted from dorsal muscle and intestine of eight wild-caught leptochephalus larvae were subjected to this analysis, followed by cloning, nucleotide sequence analysis, and database homology search. Among 12 sequence types obtained from the intestine sample, six were identified as fungi. No sequence similarities were found in the database for the remaining six types, which were not related to one another. These results, in conjunction with our laboratory observations on larval feeding, suggest that eel leptocephali may not be dependent upon living plankton for their food source."
https://openalex.org/W2079400568,"Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a clinically severe type of liver injury with an extremely high mortality rate. Although the pathological mechanisms of FHF are not well understood, evidence suggests that the complement system is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of liver disorders. In the present study, to investigate the role of complement in FHF, we examined groups of mice following intraperitoneal injection of LPS/D-GalN: wild-type C57BL/6 mice, wild-type mice treated with a C3aR antagonist, C5aR monoclonal antibody (C5aRmAb) or CR2-Factor H (CR2-fH, an inhibitor of the alternative pathway), and C3 deficient mice (C3−/− mice). The animals were euthanized and samples analyzed at specific times after LPS/D-GalN injection. The results show that intraperitoneal administration of LPS/D-GalN activated the complement pathway, as evidenced by the hepatic deposition of C3 and C5b-9 and elevated serum levels of the complement activation product C3a, the level of which was associated with the severity of the liver damage. C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5a receptor (C5aR) expression was also upregulated. Compared with wild-type mice, C3−/− mice survived significantly longer and displayed reduced liver inflammation and attenuated pathological damage following LPS/D-GalN injection. Similar levels of protection were seen in mice treated with C3aR antagonist,C5aRmAb or CR2-fH. These data indicate an important role for the C3a and C5a generated by the alternative pathway in LPS/D-GalN-induced FHF. The data further suggest that complement inhibition may be an effective strategy for the adjunctive treatment of fulminant hepatic failure."
https://openalex.org/W1996069328,"Enroute to mapping QTLs for yield components in oil palm, we constructed the linkage map of a FELDA high yielding oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), hybrid cross. The parents of the mapping population are a Deli dura and a pisifera of Yangambi origin. The cross out-yielded the average by 8–21% in four trials all of which yielded comparably to the best current commercial planting materials. The higher yield derived from a higher fruit oil content. SSR markers in the public domain - from CIRAD and MPOB, as well as some developed in FELDA - were used for the mapping, augmented by locally-designed AFLP markers. The female parent linkage map comprised 317 marker loci and the male parent map 331 loci, both in 16 linkage groups each. The number of markers per group ranged from 8–47 in the former and 12–40 in the latter. The integrated map was 2,247.5 cM long and included 479 markers and 168 anchor points. The number of markers per linkage group was 15–57, the average being 29, and the average map density 4.7 cM. The linkage groups ranged in length from 77.5 cM to 223.7 cM, with an average of 137 cM. The map is currently being validated against a closely related population and also being expanded to include yield related QTLs."
https://openalex.org/W2006698149,"Reported values of extracellular glutamate concentrations in the resting state depend on the method of measurement and vary ∼1000-fold. As glutamate levels in the micromolar range can cause receptor desensitization and excitotoxicity, and thus affect neuronal excitability, an accurate determination of ambient glutamate is important. Part of the variability of previous measurements may have resulted from the sampling of glutamate in different extracellular compartments, e.g., synaptic versus extrasynaptic volumes. A steep concentration gradient of glutamate between these two compartments could be maintained, for example, by high densities of glutamate transporters arrayed at the edges of synapses. We have used two photon laser scanning microscopy and electrophysiology to investigate whether extracellular glutamate is compartmentalized in acute hippocampal slices. Pharmacological blockade of NMDARs had no effect on Ca(2+) transients generated in dendritic shafts or spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons by depolarization, suggesting that ambient glutamate is too low to activate a significant number of NMDARs. Furthermore, blockade of transporters did not flood the synapse with glutamate, indicating that synaptic NMDARs are not protected from high concentrations of extrasynaptic glutamate. We suggest that, in the CA1 region of hippocampus, glutamate transporters do not create a privileged space within the synapse but rather keep ambient glutamate at very low levels throughout the neuropil."
https://openalex.org/W2042990570,"Actin-like bacterial cytoskeletal element MreB has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of rod cell shape in many bacteria. MreB forms rapidly remodelling helical filaments underneath the cell membrane in Bacillus subtilis and in other bacterial cells, and co-localizes with its two paralogs, Mbl and MreBH. We show that MreB localizes as dynamic bundles of filaments underneath the cell membrane in Drosophila S2 Schneider cells, which become highly stable when the ATPase motif in MreB is modified. In agreement with ATP-dependent filament formation, the depletion of ATP in the cells lead to rapid dissociation of MreB filaments. Extended induction of MreB resulted in the formation of membrane protrusions, showing that like actin, MreB can exert force against the cell membrane. Mbl also formed membrane associated filaments, while MreBH formed filaments within the cytosol. When co-expressed, MreB, Mbl and MreBH built up mixed filaments underneath the cell membrane. Membrane protein RodZ localized to endosomes in S2 cells, but localized to the cell membrane when co-expressed with Mbl, showing that bacterial MreB/Mbl structures can recruit a protein to the cell membrane. Thus, MreB paralogs form a self-organizing and dynamic filamentous scaffold underneath the membrane that is able to recruit other proteins to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2139282117,"Recent advancements in genomics provide new tools for evolutionary ecological research. The paper wasp genus Polistes is a model for social insect evolution and behavioral ecology. We developed RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing to explore proposed connections between expression of hexameric storage proteins and worker vs. gyne (potential future foundress) castes in naturally-founded colonies of P. metricus. We extended four fragments of putative hexamerin-encoding P. metricus transcripts acquired from a previous study and fully sequenced a gene that encodes Hexamerin 2, one of two proposed hexameric storage proteins of P. metricus. MALDI-TOF/TOF, LC-MSMS, deglycosylation, and detection of phosphorylation assays showed that the two putative hexamerins diverge in peptide sequence and biochemistry. We targeted the hexamerin 2 gene in 5th (last)-instar larvae by feeding RNAi-inducing double-stranded hexamerin 2 RNA directly to larvae in naturally-founded colonies in the field. Larval development and adult traits were not significantly altered in hexamerin 2 knockdowns, but there were suggestive trends toward increased developmental time and less developed ovaries, which are gyne characteristics. By demonstrating how data acquisition from 454/Roche pyrosequencing can be combined with biochemical and proteomics assays and how RNAi can be deployed successfully in field experiments on Polistes, our results pave the way for functional genomic research that can contribute significantly to learning the interactions of environment, development, and the roles they play in paper wasp evolution and behavioral ecology."
https://openalex.org/W1995513161,"-barrel membrane proteins play an important role in controlling the exchange and transport of ions and organic molecules across bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes. They are also major regulators of apoptosis and are important determinants of bacterial virulence. In contrast to -helical membrane proteins, their evolutionary pattern of residue substitutions has not been quantified, and there are no scoring matrices appropriate for their detection through sequence alignment. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo estimator, we have calculated the instantaneous substitution rates of transmembrane domains of bacterial -barrel membrane proteins. The scoring matrices constructed from the estimated rates, called bbTM for -barrel Transmembrane Matrices, improve significantly the sensitivity in detecting homologs of -barrel membrane proteins, while avoiding erroneous selection of both soluble proteins and other membrane proteins of similar composition. The estimated evolutionary patterns are general and can detect -barrel membrane proteins very remote from those used for substitution rate estimation. Furthermore, despite the separation of 2–3 billion years since the proto-mitochondrion entered the proto-eukaryotic cell, mitochondria outer membrane proteins in eukaryotes can also be detected accurately using these scoring matrices derived from bacteria. This is consistent with the suggestion that there is no eukaryote-specific signals for translocation. With these matrices, remote homologs of -barrel membrane proteins with known structures can be reliably detected at genome scale, allowing construction of high quality structural models of their transmembrane domains, at the rate of 131 structures per template protein. The scoring matrices will be useful for identification, classification, and functional inference of membrane proteins from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. The estimated substitution pattern will also help to identify key elements important for the structural and functional integrity of -barrel membrane proteins, and will aid in the design of mutagenesis studies."
https://openalex.org/W1994341999,"Recurrent tuberculosis suggests potentially modifiable gaps in tuberculosis treatment and control activities. The frequency of late recurrences following treatment completion has not been well-studied. We determined the frequency of, and risk factors associated with, tuberculosis that recurs at least one year after completion of anti-tuberculosis therapy in California.The study population included culture-positive, pulmonary tuberculosis patients reported to the California tuberculosis case registry from 1993 to 2007 who completed anti-tuberculosis therapy. A person with late recurrent tuberculosis was defined as an individual that appeared in the registry more than once, determined by match on name and date-of-birth, with at least one year between treatment completion of the first episode and treatment initiation of the second episode.Among 23,517 tuberculosis patients, 148 (0.63%) had a late recurrence. Independent risk factors for recurrence included: infection with a pyrazinamide mono-resistant isolate (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.93; p = 0.019); initiation of an isoniazid- and rifampin-only treatment regimen (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.55; p = 0.0412); sputum smear-positive disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.96; p = 0.0003); human immunodeficiency virus infection (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.81; p = 0.0149); and birth in the United States (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.88; p = 0.0002). Infection with an isoniazid mono-resistant isolate was protective (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.25; p = 0.0171).The low frequency of late recurrent tuberculosis in California suggests that local TB control programs are largely successful at preventing this adverse outcome. Nonetheless, we identified subpopulations at increased risk of late tuberculosis recurrence that may benefit from additional medical or public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1973298938,"Fat tailed statistics and power-laws are ubiquitous in many complex systems. Usually the appearance of of a few anomalously successful individuals (bio-species, investors, websites) is interpreted as reflecting some inherent ""quality"" (fitness, talent, giftedness) as in Darwin's theory of natural selection. Here we adopt the opposite, ""neutral"", outlook, suggesting that the main factor explaining success is merely luck. The statistics emerging from the neutral birth-death-mutation (BDM) process is shown to fit marvelously many empirical distributions. While previous neutral theories have focused on the power-law tail, our theory economically and accurately explains the entire distribution. We thus suggest the BDM distribution as a standard neutral model: effects of fitness and selection are to be identified by substantial deviations from it."
https://openalex.org/W2087788439,"Background Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major protein of the lipoprotein transport system that plays important roles in lipid homeostasis and protection from atherosclerosis. ApoE is characterized by structural plasticity and thermodynamic instability and can undergo significant structural rearrangements as part of its biological function. Mutations in the 136–150 region of the N-terminal domain of apoE, reduce its low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding capacity and have been linked with lipoprotein disorders, such as type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in humans. However, the LDL-receptor binding defects for these apoE variants do not correlate well with the severity of dyslipidemia, indicating that these variants may carry additional properties that contribute to their pathogenic potential. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we examined whether three type III HLP predisposing apoE3 variants, namely R136S, R145C and K146E affect the biophysical properties of the protein. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that these mutations do not significantly alter the secondary structure of the protein. Thermal and chemical unfolding analysis revealed small thermodynamic alterations in each variant compared to wild-type apoE3, as well as effects in the reversibility of the unfolding transition. All variants were able to remodel multillamelar 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) vesicles, but R136S and R145C had reduced kinetics. Dynamic light scattering analysis indicated that the variant R136S exists in a higher-order oligomerization state in solution. Finally, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding suggested that the variant R145C exposes a larger amount of hydrophobic surface to the solvent. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our findings suggest that single amino acid changes in the functionally important region 136–150 of apoE3 can affect the molecule's stability and conformation in solution and may underlie functional consequences. However, the magnitude and the non-concerted nature of these changes, make it unlikely that they constitute a distinct unifying mechanism leading to type III HLP pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069377492,"Wnt proteins comprise a large family of secreted ligands implicated in a wide variety of biological roles. WntD has previously been shown to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of Dorsal/NF-κB protein during embryonic dorsal/ventral patterning and the adult innate immune response, independent of the well-studied Armadillo/β-catenin pathway. In this paper, we present a novel phenotype for WntD mutant embryos, suggesting that this gene is involved in migration of primordial germ cells (PGC) to the embryonic gonad. Additionally, we describe a genetic suppressor/enhancer screen aimed at identifying genes required for WntD signal transduction, based on the previous observation that maternal overexpression of WntD results in lethally dorsalized embryos. Using an algorithm to narrow down our hits from the screen, we found two novel WntD signaling components: Fz4, a member of the Frizzled family, and the Drosophila Ceramide Kinase homolog, Dcerk. We show here that Dcerk and Dmulk (Drosophila Multi-substrate lipid kinase) redundantly mediate PGC migration. Our data are consistent with a model in which the activity of lipid phosphate phosphatases shapes a concentration gradient of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), the product of Dcerk, allowing proper PGC migration."
https://openalex.org/W1968790397,"Background We had previously reported that the Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) approach was relevant for the isolation of new mammalian genes involved in oogenesis and early follicle development. Some of these transcripts might be potential new oocyte and granulosa cell markers. We have now characterized one of them, named TOPAZ1 for the Testis and Ovary-specific PAZ domain gene. Principal Findings Sheep and mouse TOPAZ1 mRNA have 4,803 bp and 4,962 bp open reading frames (20 exons), respectively, and encode putative TOPAZ1 proteins containing 1,600 and 1653 amino acids. They possess PAZ and CCCH domains. In sheep, TOPAZ1 mRNA is preferentially expressed in females during fetal life with a peak during prophase I of meiosis, and in males during adulthood. In the mouse, Topaz1 is a germ cell-specific gene. TOPAZ1 protein is highly conserved in vertebrates and specifically expressed in mouse and sheep gonads. It is localized in the cytoplasm of germ cells from the sheep fetal ovary and mouse adult testis. Conclusions We have identified a novel PAZ-domain protein that is abundantly expressed in the gonads during germ cell meiosis. The expression pattern of TOPAZ1, and its high degree of conservation, suggests that it may play an important role in germ cell development. Further characterization of TOPAZ1 may elucidate the mechanisms involved in gametogenesis, and particularly in the RNA silencing process in the germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2039882809,"Orange petals of calendula (Calendula officinalis) accumulate red carotenoids with the cis-configuration at the C-5 or C-5' position (5-cis-carotenoids). We speculated that the orange-flowered calendula is a carotenoid isomerase (crtiso) loss-of-function mutant that impairs the cis-to-trans conversion of 5-cis-carotenoids. We compared the sequences and enzyme activities of CRTISO from orange- and yellow-flowered calendulas. Four types of CRTISO were expressed in calendula petals. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of these genes (CoCRTISO1) was different between orange- and yellow-flowered calendulas, whereas the sequences of the other three CRTISOs were identical between these plants. Analysis of the enzymatic activities of the CoCRTISO homologs showed that CoCRTISO1-Y, which was expressed in yellow petals, converted carotenoids from the cis-to-trans-configuration, whereas both CoCRTISO1-ORa and 1-ORb, which were expressed in orange petals, showed no activity with any of the cis-carotenoids we tested. Moreover, the CoCRTISO1 genotypes of the F2 progeny obtained by crossing orange and yellow lines linked closely to petal color. These data indicate that CoCRTISO1 is a key regulator of the accumulation of 5-cis-carotenoids in calendula petals. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the deletion of Cys-His-His at positions 462-464 in CoCRTISO1-ORa and a Gly-to-Glu amino acid substitution at position 450 in CoCRTISO1-ORb abolished enzyme activity completely, indicating that these amino acid residues are important for the enzymatic activity of CRTISO."
https://openalex.org/W1984613512,"APOE plays a well established role in lipid metabolism. Animal model evidence suggests APOE may also be associated with adiposity, but this has not been thoroughly investigated in humans. We measured adiposity (BMI, truncal fat mass, waist circumference), physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness and APOE genotype (E2, E3, E4) in 292 8-year-old children from the Tasmanian Infant Health Survey (TIHS), an Australian population-based prospective birth cohort. Our aims were to examine the association of APOE with child adiposity, and to examine the interplay between this association and other measured factors. We found that APOE was associated with child lipid profiles. APOE was also associated with child adiposity measures. The association was E4 allele-specific, with adiposity lower in the E4-containing group (BMI: Mean difference -0.90 kg/m²; 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.51, -0.28; p = 0.004). The association of APOE4 with lower BMI differed by fitness status (difference in effect p = 0.002), and was more evident among the less fit (mean difference -1.78 kg/m²; 95% CI -2.74, -0.83; p<0.001). Additionally, associations between BMI and lipids were only apparent in those of lower fitness who did not carry APOE4. Similar overall findings were observed when truncal fat mass and waist circumference were used as alternative adiposity measures. APOE4 and cardiorespitatory fitness could interact to influence child adiposity. In studies addressing the genetic determinants of childhood obesity, the context of child fitness should also be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2022994290,"We evaluate hypotheses for meso-scale spatial structure in an orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) stock using samples collected during research trawl surveys off the east coast of New Zealand. Distance-based linear models and generalised additive models were used to identify the most significant biological, environmental, and temporal predictors of variability in diet, proportion of stomachs containing prey, standardised weight of prey, fish somatic weight, fish total weight, and reproductive activity. The diet was similar to that observed elsewhere, and varied with ontogeny, depth, and surface water temperature. Smaller sized and female orange roughy in warmer bottom water were most likely to contain food. Fish condition and reproductive activity were highest at distances more than 20 km from the summit of the hills. Trawl survey catches indicated greater orange roughy densities in hill strata, suggesting hill habitat was favoured. However, analyses of feeding, condition, and reproductive activity indicated hill fish were not superior, despite fish densities on hills being reduced by fishing which, in principle, should have reduced intra-specific competition for food and other resources. Hypotheses for this result include: (1) fish in relatively poor condition visit hills to feed and regain condition and then leave, or (2) commercial fishing has disturbed feeding aggregations and/or caused habitat damage, making fished hills less productive. Mature orange roughy were observed on both flat and hill habitat during periods outside of spawning, and if this spatial structure was persistent then a proportion of the total spawning stock biomass would remain unavailable to fisheries targeting hills. Orange roughy stock assessments informed only by data from hills may well be misleading."

A person-visit analysis was used to determine frequency of ALT elevation (≥ 2.5×ULN) at each visit. Factors associated with ALT elevation were determined using multivariate logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to account for correlated data. The median time on HAART at the end of follow-up was 5.6 years (range 0.4-13.3) years. During follow-up, median ALT was 36 U/L with 10.6% of person-visits classified as having ALT elevation. Most ALT elevations were grade 2 (86.5%), with only 13.5% of all ALT elevations grade 3 or higher. Univariate associations with ALT elevation (p<0.05) included history of AIDS, HBV DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/ml, HBeAg positive, study visit CD4 <200 cells/ml and nadir CD4 <200 cells/ml. In the multivariate analysis, only study visit CD4 <200 cells/ml (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.04-4.11, p = 0.04) and HBeAg positive status (OR 2.22, 95%CI 1.03-4.79, p = 0.04) were independently associated with ALT elevation.In this HIV-HBV co-infected cohort, elevated ALT after >1 year of HAART was uncommon, and severe ALT elevations were rare. HIV-HBV co-infected patients on long-term HAART who are either HBeAg positive or have a CD4 count of <200 cells/ml are at increased risk for ALT elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2076774832,"Various research projects often involve determining the relative position of genomic coordinates, intervals, single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions, deletions and translocations with respect to genes and their potential impact on protein translation. Due to the tremendous increase in throughput brought by the use of next-generation sequencing, investigators are routinely faced with the need to annotate very large datasets. We present Segtor, a tool to annotate large sets of genomic coordinates, intervals, SNVs, indels and translocations. Our tool uses segment trees built using the start and end coordinates of the genomic features the user wishes to use instead of storing them in a database management system. The software also produces annotation statistics to allow users to visualize how many coordinates were found within various portions of genes. Our system currently can be made to work with any species available on the UCSC Genome Browser. Segtor is a suitable tool for groups, especially those with limited access to programmers or with interest to analyze large amounts of individual genomes, who wish to determine the relative position of very large sets of mapped reads and subsequently annotate observed mutations between the reads and the reference. Segtor (http://lbbc.inca.gov.br/segtor/) is an open-source tool that can be freely downloaded for non-profit use. We also provide a web interface for testing purposes."

The mechanism of transcription termination in eukaryotes has been difficult to elucidate, in part due to temporally overlapping post-transcriptional modifications. Much of the current understanding of transcription termination mechanisms comes from studies of bacterial systems. In bacteria, two distinct types of transcription termination have been identified as follows: intrinsic and factor-dependent (1Henkin T. Transcription Termination Control in Bacteria. Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK2002: 149-153Google Scholar). Intrinsic termination relies only on cis-acting elements, including a GC-rich stem-loop followed by 7–9 U residues in the nascent transcript, whereas factor-dependent termination requires trans-acting ATPases, such as the Rho protein (1Henkin T. Transcription Termination Control in Bacteria. Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK2002: 149-153Google Scholar). One model, known as forward translocation, suggests that these two termination methods use the same underlying mechanism to cause termination (2Santangelo T.J. Roberts J.W. Mol.

Vaccinia early gene transcription termination provides a unique model system to examine eukaryotic termination possessing both cis- and trans-acting components that is uncoupled from splicing and polyadenylation (6Broyles S.S.

Vaccinia is a cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA pox virus that encodes most of the proteins needed for gene transcription and mRNA processing (7Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Monath T.P. Melnick J.L. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2007: 2905-2946Google Scholar). Vaccinia genes are categorized into three temporal classes based on time of expression, regulatory sequences, and transcription factors (6Broyles S.S. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Early gene transcription occurs in the virion core immediately following infection and employs a virion-specific form of RNAP (vRNAP), which contains one subunit (called Rap94 or H4, which is the product of the H4L gene) in addition to the other eight subunits present in all forms of vaccinia RNAP (8Ahn B.Y.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Termination of early gene transcription is dependent on a UUUUUNU signal in the nascent RNA, and termination occurs within a 10-base range, 30–50 bases downstream of the signal (10Rohrmann G. Yuen L.

Two virally encoded termination factors are also required for early gene transcription termination as follows: vaccinia termination factor (VTF) (13Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I) (15Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). VTF is multifunctional, catalyzing the first three steps in viral mRNA cap formation, as well as transcription initiation of intermediate genes (18Hirschmann P. Vos J.C. Stunnenberg H.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shatzer A.N. Kato S.E. Condit R.C. Virology. 2008; 375: 236-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). VTF binds to the U5NU termination signal in the ternary transcription complex (20Christen L.A. Piacente S. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21253-21262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rap94 is an integral component of the virion form of vaccinia RNAP and is also required for early gene transcription through its association with NPH I (17Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rap94 was demonstrated to cross-link to the U5NU signal in the presence of VTF indicating that Rap94 may also play a direct role in termination (20Christen L.A. Piacente S. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). NPH I is required for release of the terminated nascent transcripts (15Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and belongs to the DEXH-box family of helicases (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, analysis of NPH I activity in vitro has not revealed helicase activity (15Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NPH I hydrolyzes either ATP or deoxy-ATP (dATP) in a single-stranded DNA-dependent fashion (23Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 866-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity is essential for NPH I-mediated transcript release of early genes (15Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in early gene termination transcription, NPH I has been shown to be a positive transcription elongation factor (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Evidence for this activity comes from the observation that NPH I allows vRNAP stalled at a run of A residues on the template strand to resume elongation (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NPH I functions in termination is not known. We assessed the function of NPH I in transcription elongation and in termination using two assays referred to as either termination or transcript release. Termination assays assess the production of released transcripts from actively elongating vRNAP, whereas transcript release assays evaluate transcript release from artificially stalled vRNAP. Prior studies have demonstrated the requirement of VTF and the termination signal for both termination and transcript release activity when NPH I is stimulated with ATP (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that NPH I-mediated transcript release can occur independent of VTF and U5NU when NPH I is stimulated with dATP, as opposed to ATP. We also provide evidence that NPH I uses the mechanism of forward translocation to release transcripts. In addition to NPH I, transcript release can also be stimulated by antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the nascent transcript in the absence of NPH I ATPase activity. Similar to NPH I, these oligonucleotides also appear to stimulate transcript release using the mechanism of forward translocation. We also present data indicating that NPH I acts as a positive elongation factor by preventing vRNAP from backtracking The Ter29 plasmid used in these studies was designed by Dr. Stewart Shuman (Memorial Sloan Kettering) as a template for in vitro transcription termination and transcript release assays (Fig. 2A) (25Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This template consists of a strong early gene promoter fused to a 20-bp G-less cassette followed by four Gs and then a 57-bp A-less cassette, in pBlueScript (Stratagene). The A-less cassette contains a stretch of nine Ts beginning at +29 that functions as a signal for termination. The A-less cassette is followed by four A residues and then 108 bp of random sequence. Templates used in EcoRI Q111E roadblock experiments were created by site-directed mutagenesis of Ter29. The EcoRI sites flanking the promoter were first removed, and an EcoRI site was then created at the desired location on the template. Templates lacking the termination signal had the T9 termination sequence replaced with 5′-CGTGTGTTC-3′ and were designed and provided by Dr. Edward Niles (24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transcription templates were generated by PCR amplification of the appropriate plasmids using the M13 forward and reverse primers with the latter containing biotin at the 5′ end (IDT). The amplified linear double-stranded templates were purified by electrophoresis on agarose gels and then extracted from the gel using a Qiagen spin-column purification kit. Purified templates were then bound to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Promega or Dynal) and stored in water at 4 °C. Transcription extracts were prepared from purified virions as described previously (10Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virions were a generous gift from Dr. Edward Niles. Approximately 5 mg of purified virions were incubated on ice in 500 μl of Buffer A (250 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) containing 0.2% sodium deoxycholate for 1 h. The virion extract was then passed through a 25-gauge needle six times to shear DNA and reduce viscosity. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with Buffer A. 500-μl fractions were collected of the flow-through and assayed for transcriptional activity (10Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A plasmid with the gene for the cleavage-deficient EcoRI E111Q (EcoRI*) protein was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Modrich (Duke University) (37Pavco P.A. Steege D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9960-9969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coding sequence for both EcoRI* and the associated methylase were amplified by PCR and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-cut pET17b (Novagen). Six histidine (His) codons were added to the amino terminus of the EcoRI* gene using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. In addition, the methylase gene was amplified by PCR separately and ligated into the tetracycline resistance (tet) gene of pACYC184 using BamHI and SalI such that the methylase gene is expressed from the tet gene promoter. Both plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The resulting strain was grown in LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, at which point isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and broken with a French pressure cell, and EcoRI* was purified using nickel-agarose as per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Transcription termination assays involved a two-step pulse-chase reaction as described previously (21Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Step 1 of transcription was conducted with 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 0.25 mm 3′O-methyl-GTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, 100 fmol of template, and 0.5 μl of virion extract in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 8% glycerol). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Step 1 of transcription allows initiation and elongation to the end of the G-less cassette to yield a stable transcription elongation complex (TEC) with a 21-base radiolabeled nascent transcript (see Fig. 2A). Where indicated, transcription complexes were stripped of NPH I with heparin (625 ng/μl) (26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transcription complexes were washed three times in transcription buffer by drawing the bead-bound templates to the side of the tube with a magnet, removing the reaction buffer, and resuspending the beads. Step 2 contained 1 mm of all four NTPs in 20 μl of transcription buffer. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Where indicated, 2 pmol of VTF and/or NPH I were added at the start of Step 2. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 95% formamide, boiled, and examined on a 12% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Gels were exposed to a phosphor storage screen (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using a Storm Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare), and the RNA products were quantified using ImageQuant software. Step 2 of transcription yields a 189 nucleotide readthrough transcripts and/or terminated transcripts of ∼75 nucleotides in length. Transcript release assays from stalled TECs were carried out in a three-step process. The first two steps were done as described for termination assays, except that ATP was omitted from Step 2, which results in the TECs stalling at C77 at the end of the A-less cassette (see Fig. 2A). These stalled TECs were washed three times with transcription buffer and then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min (Step 3). Where indicated, 1 mm ATP or deoxy-ATP, 17 ng of oligonucleotide, and/or 1 nm VTF was added in Step 3. Transcripts were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% (19:1) polyacrylamide 8 m urea gel. The RNA was visualized by autoradiography as described for transcription termination assays, and the fraction of released transcripts was calculated by dividing the amount of released RNA by the sum of the RNA released and that remaining in the ternary complex. For experiments with EcoRI Q111E, 15 ng (484 fmol) of EcoRI* was added per 100 fmol of DNA template and incubated in transcription buffer for 10 min at 30 °C prior to transcription. We analyzed early gene transcription in vitro using bead-bound dsDNA templates based on the synthetic Ter29 template (Fig. 2A) (25Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ter29 contains a strong early promoter immediately followed by a 20-bp G-less cassette, which lies upstream of a 57-bp A-less cassette containing a run of 9 Ts within the nontemplate strand. Once transcribed into RNA, these nine Us constitute the termination signal. Transcription reactions were generally performed in two steps. In Step 1, transcription initiates at the early promoter, and in the absence of GTP and the presence of 3′O-methyl-GTP, transcription continues to the end of the G-less cassette to yield stable TECs containing a 21-base radiolabeled nascent RNA (G21) (26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some cases (where indicated), endogenous VTF was washed away with transcription buffer, and endogenous NPH I was stripped from the TECs by heparin treatment following Step 1 (26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The second step of the transcription assay consisted of a single round of elongation of the template-bound TEC by addition of all four NTPs. The intrinsic hydrolytic activity of vRNAP cleaves the 3′O-methyl-GMP from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA to regain productive elongation complexes (27Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual reactions were supplemented with VTF and/or NPH I prior to Step 2. Transcription reactions yielded 189-base readthrough transcripts or ∼75 nucleotide terminated transcripts (Fig. 2A). As seen previously, with the template encoding the U5NU termination signal, terminated transcripts are only observed when both VTF and NPH I are present (Fig. 2B) (24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Hagler J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10099-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation also demonstrates that endogenous VTF and NPH I were efficiently removed from the TECs by the washing steps after Step 1 of the transcription assay. In the absence of the termination signal (CGUGUGUUC-3′ in place of 5′-UUUUUUUUU-3′), only read-through transcripts were produced in the absence or presence of VTF and/or NPH I (Fig. 2B). As seen previously (24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Hagler J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10099-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these results highlight the requirement for all termination factors (U5NU, VTF, (d)ATP, and NPH I) to achieve early gene transcription termination in a standard transcription reaction. To specifically examine the function of NPH I in the termination process, we employed an assay for NPH I-mediated transcript release (N-MR) independent of VTF and the U5NU termination signal. For this transcript release assay, VTF and NPH I were removed from the TECs at the end of the G-less cassette. Step 2 of transcription was performed with GTP, CTP, and UTP in the absence of ATP, which results in vRNAP stalling at the end of the A-less cassette at residue C77 (Fig. 2A). These stalled TECs are stable and competent to resume transcription, with only ∼10% of the transcripts being released into the supernatant after 10 min at 30 °C. Step 3 of transcription involved an additional incubation of the TECs stalled at C77 in the presence of dATP and either in the presence or absence of NPH I and/or VTF. When dATP was added in the absence of NPH I, only 10–20% of the transcripts were released regardless of the presence of VTF (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). This low amount of transcript release likely occurs from a small fraction of TECs from which NPH I was not removed by the heparin treatment after Step 1. These observations are consistent with prior studies showing that transcript release is dependent on NPH I ATPase activity (15Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When WT NPH I was added in the presence of dATP during Step 3, ≥50% of the transcripts were released from the ternary complex when the TEC stalled at C77 (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6). Under these conditions, transcript release was not dependent on VTF, although a slight difference is observed in this particular gel (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). Similarly, the U5NU termination signal is not required for transcript release under these conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 15–18). Addition of the ATPase-deficient NPH I mutant, K61A (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), resulted in background level of transcript release (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10, and 19 and 20). Together these observations support the conclusion that when vRNAP is stalled on the template, NPH I can mediate transcript release through its ATPase activity independent of VTF or the U5NU sequence. Our results indicate that the requirements for transcript release from a stalled TEC (Fig. 2C) differ from those to induce transcription termination from an actively elongating TEC (Fig. 2B). Specifically, transcription termination requires the U5NU signal and VTF in addition to NPH I activity, whereas transcript release requires only NPH I activity and is independent of the termination signal and VTF. Our results also differ from previously published studies of transcript release from vRNAP stalled at the end of the A-less cassette of Ter29, which demonstrated a requirement for VTF and the U5NU sequence in the nascent transcript in addition to NPH I (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However in those experiments, ATP was used to activate NPH I rather than dATP. We therefore compared NPH I-mediated transcript release (N-MR) in the presence of ATP to that seen above with dATP (Fig. 2C). In these release assays, the first two steps of the transcription reactions were carried out as described above. Following Step 2, the TECs were washed with transcription buffer and then incubated for an additional 10 min (Fig. 2A, Step 3) in the absence or presence of dATP, ATP, and/or VTF (Fig. 3). When TECs stalled at C77 were incubated in transcription buffer alone or with VTF in the absence of dATP or ATP, a broad band stretching between approximately +72 and +77 nts was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). The cause of this heterogeneous mixture of transcripts instead of the more homogeneous 77-nt terminated transcripts seen in Fig. 2C will be examined below. This broad band, however, represents stable TECs as indicated by their presence in the DNA-bound fractions (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). As seen above (Fig. 2C), when dATP was used as the NPH I substrate during Step 3, ∼75% of the transcripts were released into the supernatant in either the absence (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) or presence of VTF (Fig. 3A, lanes 11 and 12). In addition, the bands observed in these lanes are more homogeneous than those seen in Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4. In contrast, when ATP was used as the NPH I substrate, transcript release occurred only in the presence of VTF (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 7 and 8 with 13 and 14). These observations are consistent with those reported previously for transcript release under similar reaction conditions (16Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Piacente S. Christen L. Dickerman B. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2008; 376: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the absence of VTF, the presence of ATP resulted in production of some transcripts that are shorter than C77 and others that elongated past C77, presumably to A81 by addition of four A residues (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). All of these transcripts remain stably bound to the DNA template and are not released by ATP-activated NPH I. When these elongated transcripts were allowed to form in the presence of ATP followed by activation of NPH I with dATP, transcript release was still not observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). This result indicates that these TECs are incompetent for release. To examine the role of the U5NU sequence in transcript release under these conditions, these experiments were repeated with a template lacking the T5NT sequence (Fig. 3B). The appearance of the shorter bands was less evident using this template, which may be the result of different template sequence at the end of the A-less cassette. The last 10 templated residues of the A-less cassette in Ter29 are 5′-GGUCGCUGUC-3′, whereas the last 10 residues in the template lacking the termination signal are 5′-GUUCCUCGUU-3′. In general, a similar pattern of transcript release was observed on the template lacking the termination signal (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–12) as on the template containing the termination signal (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–12). However, in this case ATP no longer stimulated transcript release at C77 on the −U5NU template in the presence of VTF compared with the +U5NU template (compare Fig. 3B, lanes 13 and 14, with A, lanes 13 and 14). These observations confirm that both U5NU and VTF are required for transcript release when vRNAP is stalled at the end of the A-less cassette and when ATP is used as a substrate for NPH I. Some transcript release from this template is seen beyond A81 in the presence VTF and ATP (Fig. 3B, lane 14). One possible explanation for the different requirements for transcript release in the presence of dATP as opposed to ATP is that although both nucleotides activate NPH I, only ATP serves as a substrate for RNAP. This difference is particularly relevant when the TEC is stalled at C77 in Ter29 because the next four templated residues to extend the RNA are A residues (Fig. 2A). Examination of the results in Fig. 3A shows that in the presence of ATP a significant fraction of the TECs that were stalled at C77 become elongated in the absence of VTF or the U5NU signal (presumably to A81), and these transcripts remain bo"
https://openalex.org/W2126420893,"Transcriptional regulation depends upon the binding of transcription factor (TF) proteins to DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. Although many experimental methods address the interaction between DNA and proteins, they generally do not comprehensively and accurately assess the full binding repertoire (the complete set of sequences that might be bound with at least moderate strength). Here, we develop and evaluate through simulation an experimental approach that allows simultaneous high-throughput quantitative analysis of TF binding affinity to thousands of potential DNA ligands. Tens of thousands of putative binding targets can be mixed with a TF, and both the pre-bound and bound target pools sequenced. A hierarchical Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach determines posterior estimates for the dissociation constants, sequence-specific binding energies, and free TF concentrations. A unique feature of our approach is that dissociation constants are jointly estimated from their inferred degree of binding and from a model of binding energetics, depending on how many sequence reads are available and the explanatory power of the energy model. Careful experimental design is necessary to obtain accurate results over a wide range of dissociation constants. This approach, which we call Simultaneous Ultra high-throughput Ligand Dissociation EXperiment (SULDEX), is theoretically capable of rapid and accurate elucidation of an entire TF-binding repertoire."
