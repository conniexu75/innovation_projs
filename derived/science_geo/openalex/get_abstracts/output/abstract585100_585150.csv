However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease."

Here, we report that human microglial-like cells (iMGLs) can be differentiated from iPSCs to study their function in neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that iMGLs develop in vitro similarly to microglia in vivo, and whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrates that they are highly similar to cultured adult and fetal human microglia. Functional assessment of iMGLs reveals that they secrete cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli, migrate and undergo calcium transients, and robustly phagocytose CNS substrates. iMGLs were used to examine the effects of Aβ fibrils and brain-derived tau oligomers on AD-related gene expression and to interrogate mechanisms involved in synaptic pruning. Furthermore, iMGLs transplanted into transgenic mice and human brain organoids resemble microglia in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate that iMGLs can be used to study microglial function, providing important new insight into human neurological disease."

https://openalex.org/W2605615531,"Behavior depends on coordinated activity across multiple brain regions. Within such networks, highly connected hub regions are assumed to disproportionately influence behavioral output, although this hypothesis has not been systematically evaluated. Previously, by mapping brain-wide expression of the activity-regulated gene c-fos, we identified a network of brain regions co-activated by fear memory. To test the hypothesis that hub regions are more important for network function, here, we simulated node deletion in silico in this behaviorally defined functional network. Removal of high degree nodes produced the greatest network disruption (e.g., reduction in global efficiency). To test these predictions in vivo, we examined the impact of post-training chemogenetic silencing of different network nodes on fear memory consolidation. In a series of independent experiments encompassing 25% of network nodes (i.e., 21/84 brain regions), we found that node degree accurately predicted observed deficits in memory consolidation, with silencing of highly connected hubs producing the largest impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2606443114,"The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is thought to regulate behavioral responses under emotionally arousing conditions. Reward-associated cues activate PVT neurons; however, the specific PVT efferents regulating reward seeking remain elusive. Using a cued sucrose-seeking task, we manipulated PVT activity under two emotionally distinct conditions: (1) when reward was available during the cue as expected or (2) when reward was unexpectedly omitted during the cue. Pharmacological inactivation of the anterior PVT (aPVT), but not the posterior PVT, increased sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Consistent with this, photoactivation of aPVT neurons abolished sucrose seeking, and the firing of aPVT neurons differentiated reward availability. Photoinhibition of aPVT projections to the nucleus accumbens or to the amygdala increased or decreased, respectively, sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Our findings suggest that PVT bidirectionally modulates sucrose seeking under the negative (frustrative) conditions of reward omission."

We propose that selective axonal cargo trafficking requires the MAP2-defined pre-axonal filtering zone and the ability of cargos to switch between distinct kinesin motor activities. Highly polarized cells like neurons require the accurate control of selective cargo trafficking pathways. However, how changes in individual vesicle motility properties translate into cargo distributions at the full-scale cellular level remains unknown. Recently, several local microtubule and kinesin-based mechanisms of axonal cargo transport in neurons have been elucidated, albeit their significance for global cargo distribution patterns is unclear (Song et al., 2009Song A.-H. Wang D. Chen G. Li Y. Luo J. Duan S. Poo M.-M. A selective filter for cytoplasmic transport at the axon initial segment.Cell. 2009; 136: 1148-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Likewise, the dynamic compartmentalized movement of neuronal cargos has been described, although the precise mechanism underlying their distributions remains elusive (Wong et al., 2012Wong M.Y. Zhou C. Shakiryanova D. Lloyd T.E. Deitcher D.L. Levitan E.S. Neuropeptide delivery to synapses by long-range vesicle circulation and sporadic capture.Cell. 2012; 148: 1029-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it is critical to determine the minimal basic mechanism required for the regulation of gross polarized axonal transport, from a molecular perspective. Cytoskeleton-based motor proteins can drive selective axonal cargo transport in a regulated manner (Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011Kapitein L.C. Hoogenraad C.C. Which way to go? Cytoskeletal organization and polarized transport in neurons.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Several regulatory mechanisms have been described that control the selective entry of cargos into the axon. Most studies have focused on the axon initial segment (AIS) as a specialized compartment in the proximal axon that plays a critical role in filtering intracellular trafficking (Leterrier and Dargent, 2014Leterrier C. Dargent B. No Pasaran! Role of the axon initial segment in the regulation of protein transport and the maintenance of axonal identity.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 27: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In multipolar hippocampal neurons, vesicles containing somatodendritic cargos are selectively halted at the proximal axon, whereas cargos transporting axonal proteins are allowed to proceed through the AIS into more distal parts (Song et al., 2009Song A.-H. Wang D. Chen G. Li Y. Luo J. Duan S. Poo M.-M. A selective filter for cytoplasmic transport at the axon initial segment.Cell. 2009; 136: 1148-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Adult peripheral sensory neurons are widely used as model systems for the study of axonal regeneration and transport mechanisms (Maday et al., 2014Maday S. Twelvetrees A.E. Moughamian A.J. Holzbaur E.L.F. Axonal transport: cargo-specific mechanisms of motility and regulation.Neuron. 2014; 84: 292-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying selective cargo transport and distribution in these neurons are completely unexplored. For instance, it is unknown why organelles such as lysosomes or most neuronal mRNAs are selectively retained in the cell body (Gumy et al., 2011Gumy L.F. Yeo G.S.H. Tung Y.-C.L. Zivraj K.H. Willis D. Coppola G. Lam B.Y.H. Twiss J.L. Holt C.E. Fawcett J.W. Transcriptome analysis of embryonic and adult sensory axons reveals changes in mRNA repertoire localization.RNA. 2011; 17: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), while adhesion molecules or secretory vesicles are actively transported into the axonal domain (Zhao et al., 2011Zhao B. Wang H.-B. Lu Y.-J. Hu J.-W. Bao L. Zhang X. Transport of receptors, receptor signaling complexes and ion channels via neuropeptide-secretory vesicles.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Defining how compartmentalized cargo movement is regulated in sensory neurons may thus provide a general mechanism for polarized cargo transport in neurons. It has been speculated that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) might act as master regulators of axonal cargo transport. MAPs are strongly compartmentalized in neurons and could play an important role in regulating selective axonal cargo transport by controlling the activity of specific motor proteins (Atherton et al., 2013Atherton J. Houdusse A. Moores C. MAPping out distribution routes for kinesin couriers.Biol. Cell. 2013; 105: 465-487PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of specific MAPs in regulating axonal cargo trafficking and their further impact on cargo distribution. Classical MAPs are involved in many microtubule-related processes, such as microtubule assembly, stabilization, and cross-linking, and can interact with other cytoskeletal components or cellular proteins (Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015Kapitein L.C. Hoogenraad C.C. Building the Neuronal Microtubule Cytoskeleton.Neuron. 2015; 87: 492-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). MAP2 is structurally related to Tau, containing similar microtubule-binding regions but different projection domains that extend from the microtubule surface (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005Dehmelt L. Halpain S. The MAP2/Tau family of microtubule-associated proteins.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). MAP2 and Tau are very well known for their strict segregation into somatodendritic and axonal compartments, respectively. A set of in vitro studies have demonstrated that in the presence of MAP2, kinesin-1 motility is inhibited (Hagiwara et al., 1994Hagiwara H. Yorifuji H. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Competition between motor molecules (kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein) and fibrous microtubule-associated proteins in binding to microtubules.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether MAP2 regulates motor activity in neurons and, if so, what processes controls. Given the ubiquitous presence of MAP2 in many neuronal cell types, the ability of MAP2 to regulate motor activity makes it a likely candidate for providing local signals to control specific transport routes. So far, the role of MAP2 in regulating cargo trafficking has not been investigated. We have tested whether MAP2-dependent regulation of motor activity could underlie the basic principles of selective cargo sorting and distribution in neurons. In this study, we used a combination of immunohistochemical, biochemical, cell biological, live-cell imaging, quantitative microscopy, and mathematical modeling approaches to determine the mechanisms underlying axonal cargo entry and transport in full-length sensory axons. We found that, despite the absence of a structured AIS, MAP2 specifically localizes to the soma and proximal axon of sensory neurons and defines a unique axonal cargo filtering zone. Here, MAP2 selectively retains lysosomes in the cell body, while promoting the axonal entry and distribution of secretory or dense core vesicles (DCVs). MAP2 promotes the axonal entry of secretory vesicles by regulating the cooperative action of “fast” kinesin-3 (KIF1) and “slow” kinesin-1 (KIF5) motors. In the proximal axon, non-microtubule-bound MAP2 inhibits slow kinesin-1 motor activity and allows fast kinesin-3 motors to drive robust DCV transport from the soma into the axon. In the distal axon where the inhibitory action of MAP2 dissipates, enhanced kinesin-1 activity results in the long-range distribution of DCVs along the axon. In this way, MAP2 controls the axonal entry and global distribution of cargos that contain distinct sets of kinesin motors. We propose a novel mechanism for selective axonal cargo entry and reveal a critical role for MAP2 as the gatekeeper of axonal cargo trafficking in sensory neurons. To gain more insight into the axonal cargo entry mechanisms in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, we first compared the localization of several AIS markers, including AnkyrinG (AnkG), βIV-spectrin, neurofascin (NF)-186, and voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in mature hippocampal and adult DRG neurons in culture. Consistent with previous studies (Hedstrom et al., 2008Hedstrom K.L. Ogawa Y. Rasband M.N. AnkyrinG is required for maintenance of the axon initial segment and neuronal polarity.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), all tested markers stained the proximal region of hippocampal axons outlining the AIS (Figures 1A and 1B ). In addition, the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a well-known somatodendritic marker in multipolar neurons, was also detected in the initial part of the proximal axon but did not overlap with the AIS (Figures 1A and 1B). In contrast, in DRG neurons, we were unable to detect marked enrichment of AnkG, NF-186, βIV-spectrin, or Nav channels in the proximal axon (Figures 1C and S1A). For instance, NaV channels were detected along the whole length of DRG axons (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistently, AnkG was enriched in the proximal axons of hippocampal neurons in juvenile and adult brains (Figure S1D) but was not detected in the proximal axon of DRG neurons in sections from rat and mouse whole DRGs (Figures S1E and S1F). In DRG sections, AnkG appeared largely enriched at the nodes of Ranvier (Figures S2E and S2F). The MAP2B isoform (from here on referred to as MAP2) was abundantly expressed in mature hippocampal neurons and in adult DRG neurons (Figures S1B and S1C) and localized to the soma and initial part of the DRG axon in vitro and in vivo (Figures 1C, 1D, 1G, 1J, and S1E–S1G). At various days in culture, DRG neurons displayed different number of neurites that markedly changed over time before they formed one to two axons at 8 days in vitro (DIV8) (Figure S1H). MAP2 localized to the proximal part of every single neurite, regardless of the days in culture (Figure S1I). These findings are in line with a previous study where MAP2 was described to localize to the proximal axon during DRG neuron maturation in vitro (Hernández et al., 1989Hernández M.A. Avila J. Moya F. Alberto C. Rearrangement of microtubule associated protein parallels the morphological transformation of neurons from dorsal root ganglion.Neuroscience. 1989; 29: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To compare the specific staining pattern of MAP2 with other MAPs, cultured DRG neurons were immunostained for MAP1A, MAP1B, MAP4, MAP7, and MAP9. Quantitative analysis showed that most of the MAPs tested were equally distributed along the full axonal length, whereas MAP2 specifically localized to the proximal axon (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1J). The results demonstrate that adult DRG neurons in vitro and in vivo lack the enrichment of classic AIS markers but contain MAP2 in the initial part of proximal axon. We recently found that TRIM46 defines a specialized microtubule region in the proximal axon (van Beuningen et al., 2015van Beuningen S.F.B. Will L. Harterink M. Chazeau A. van Battum E.Y. Frias C.P. Franker M.A. Katrukha E.A. Stucchi R. Vocking K. et al.TRIM46 controls neuronal polarity and axon specification by driving the formation of parallel microtubule arrays.Neuron. 2015; 88: 1208-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TRIM46 partly overlaps with MAP2 in the proximal axon of hippocampal neurons (Figure S1D). As in multipolar hippocampal neurons, TRIM46 specifically labeled the proximal axon of DRG neurons in vitro and in vivo (Figures 1G–1J and S1E). MAP2 and TRIM46 labeled partly overlapping compartments in cultured DRG neurons: MAP2 localized to the initial part of the proximal axon, whereas TRIM46 defined the more distal part of the proximal axon in vitro (Figures 1G–1I). Immunostained sections of DRGs in vivo showed a very similar MAP2 and TRIM46 distribution pattern (Figures 1J, S1E, and S1F). Since TRIM46 regulates the compartmentalization of MAP2 in hippocampal neurons, we hypothesized that TRIM46 might also be involved in restricting the localization of MAP2 to the proximal axon in DRG neurons. Consistent with the data from hippocampal neurons, TRIM46 depletion caused the redistribution of MAP2 into the distal part of the axon, losing its characteristic proximal axon enrichment (Figures 1G and 1H). In contrast, MAP2 depletion caused a marked shift of TRIM46 toward the cell soma (Figures 1G and 1I). These results demonstrate that MAP2 localization in the proximal axon of DRG neurons depends on TRIM46. To test the physiological function of MAP2 in adult DRG neurons, we knocked down MAP2, which caused a strong increase in the length of axons at DIV1 compared to controls (Figures S2A and S2B). To verify that the increase in axonal length was due to loss of MAP2 function, we cultured adult DRG neurons from MAP2 knockout (KO) mice and analyzed them at DIV1. Significantly, murine MAP2 KO DRG neurons also grew much longer axons compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figures S2C and S2D). The strong increase in axonal length was also observed in TRIM46-depleted DRG neurons where MAP2 is no longer enriched in the proximal axon (Figures S2E and S2F) and in MAP2-depleted hippocampal neurons (Figures S2G and S2H). Interestingly, MAP2 knockdown also affected the number of neurites per neuron. MAP2 depletion in adherent DRG neurons induced the outgrowth of new neurites from the cell body (Figure S2I). To establish the effects of MAP2 on neurite outgrowth, we depleted MAP2 in DRG neurons in suspension and subsequently plated these cells. Compared with the control, MAP2 depletion increased the percentage of neurons displaying multiple neurites, as well as in the overall mean neurite number (Figures S2J–S2L). In contrast, overexpression of MAP2 did not affect neurite outgrowth (Figure S2L). The efficiency of MAP2 knockdown or KO was confirmed by western blotting (Figure S2M). These results show that MAP2 localization to the proximal axon regulates the axonal growth potential of neurons. On the basis of both its marked enrichment in the proximal axon and its effect on kinesin-1 motor activity in vitro (Hagiwara et al., 1994Hagiwara H. Yorifuji H. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Competition between motor molecules (kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein) and fibrous microtubule-associated proteins in binding to microtubules.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that MAP2 controls axonal cargo sorting and trafficking. Therefore, we expressed various specific organelle markers, such as peroxisomes (PEX-RFP), Vamp2-labeled membranes (Vamp2-GFP), lysosomes (Lamp1-GFP, GFP-Lamp3), RNA granules (GFP-ZBP1), synaptic vesicles (Synaptophysin-GFP), and secretory or dense core vesicles (DCVs) (TagRFP-Rab6, NPY-venus) and examined their distribution in the cell bodies and axonal growth cones of control and MAP2 knockdown neurons (Figures 2A and S3A). MAP2 depletion had no effect on the localization of peroxisomes and Vamp2-positive vesicles (Figure 2B). However, it strongly increased the axonal fraction of lysosomes and RNA granules and, in contrast, reduced the amount of synaptic vesicles and DCVs into the axon (Figure 2B). These data suggest that in DRG neurons MAP2 plays a role in specific cargo sorting by providing signals to retain vesicles in the cell body or by promoting cargo entry and distribution into the axon. To further elucidate the role of MAP2 in selective axonal cargo entry, we focused on Rab6-positive secretory or dense core vesicles (DCVs). DCVs are generated in the cell body within the trans-Golgi network and are important for the delivery and rlease of neuopepties and other factors along axons and in the growth cones (Schlager et al., 2010Schlager M.A. Kapitein L.C. Grigoriev I. Burzynski G.M. Wulf P.S. Keijzer N. de Graaff E. Fukuda M. Shepherd I.T. Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Pericentrosomal targeting of Rab6 secretory vesicles by Bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) regulates neuritogenesis.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Also in DRG neurons, Rab6 colocalizes with the well-characterized DCV marker Neuropeptide Y (NPY) (Figures S3B–S3D). We depleted MAP2 and analyzed TagRFP-Rab6 transport in the proximal axon of DRG neurons. Live-cell imaging and kymograph analysis showed that the number of static and non-motile TagRFP-Rab6 vesicles increased in MAP2 knockdown neurons compared to controls (Figures 2C and 2D). To specifically visualize TagRFP-Rab6 vesicle dynamics in the initial part of the axon, the proximal axon was first photobleached and directly after imaged with fast acquisition (Figure 2E). Kymographs were used to quantify the number of entries of motile TagRFP-Rab6 vesicles into the photobleached area (Figures 2F and 2G). MAP2 depletion impaired the number of anterograde and, to a smaller degree, also retrograde moving Rab6 vesicles in the proximal axon (Figure 2H; Movie S1). Consistently, the number of anterograde NPY-venus and TagRFP-Rab6 entries from the soma into the axon was strongly reduced in MAP2 and TRIM46 knockdown DRG neurons, respectively, compared to the controls (Figures S3E–S3H). To assess a more general role of MAP2 in axonal cargo entry, we next analyzed TagRFP-Rab6 vesicle transport in hippocampal neurons after photobleaching. MAP2 knockdown significantly decreased the number of TagRFP-Rab6 axonal entries in hippocampal axons (Figures 2I and 2J). In control neurons, ∼87% of Rab6 vesicles that entered the axon proceeded through the AIS, and ∼6% reversed direction or paused (∼6%) (Figure 2K). In MAP2 knockdown neurons, only ∼46% of Rab6 vesicles proceeded through the AIS, while ∼16% paused and ∼38% of vesicles reversed direction (Figures 2K). Thus, also in hippocampal neurons, MAP2 in the proximal axon is required to allow the axonal entry of DCVs. We next tested whether the axonal transport phenotype was due to indirect changes in cytoskeletal organization. We observed a slight increase in the number of growing microtubule plus-ends and microtubule growth velocity in MAP2-depleted DRG neurons (Figures S4A–S4E), consistent with the role of MAP2 as a microtubule stabilizer (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005Dehmelt L. Halpain S. The MAP2/Tau family of microtubule-associated proteins.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). However, MAP2 depletion did not impair the orientation of plus-end out microtubules in DRG axons (Figure S4F), nor the organization of neurofilaments (Figures S4G and S4H). Furthermore, depletion of neurofilament L chain did not alter MAP2 localization in the proximal axon compared to controls (Figures S4I–S4K). These results suggest that MAP2 directly regulates DCV trafficking in the proximal axon of neurons. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in DRG neurons, plays an important role in the transmission of diverse stimuli, and is involved in nociceptive or neuropathic pain (Malet and Brumovsky, 2015Malet M. Brumovsky P.R. VGLUTs and glutamate synthesis-focus on DRG neurons and pain.Biomolecules. 2015; 5: 3416-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies showing that glutamatergic activity regulates the phosphorylation of MAP2 suggested that changes in its phosphorylation state might regulate diverse functions such as the transport of organelles or the interaction with microtubules (Quinlan and Halpain, 1996Quinlan E.M. Halpain S.

Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 133-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We first determined whether glutamate stimulation affects overall MAP2 localization. We treated DRG neurons with 100 μM glutamate for 1 min, followed by extensive washout and fixation after 10 min. Quantification of total MAP2 distribution in the proximal axon showed no differences between control and glutamate-treated neurons (Figures 3A and 3B ). We next examined the distribution of phosphorylated MAP2 (P-MAP2) after glutamate treatment. Addition of glutamate strongly decreased P-MAP2 signal in the proximal axon, in line with previous reports showing that glutamatergic treatment induces MAP2 dephosphorylation (Figures 3C and 3D) (Kapitein et al., 2011Kapitein L.C. Yau K.W. Gouveia S.M. van der Zwan W.A. Wulf P.S. Keijzer N. Demmers J. Jaworski J. Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. NMDA receptor activation suppresses microtubule growth and spine entry.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8194-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To verify whether activity-dependent MAP2 dephosphorylation regulates DCV axonal entry, we analyzed the behavior of TagRFP-Rab6 vesicles in the proximal axon of control versus glutamate-treated and MAP2 knockdown glutamate-treated DRG neurons. Glutamate treatment significantly increased the number of Rab6 axonal entries in both anterograde and retrograde directions, whereas MAP2 depletion prevented the glutamate-induced increase in trafficking (Figures 3E and 3F). These results demonstrate that MAP2 is required for mediating activity-dependent axonal DCV trafficking. Previous reports have shown that kinesin-1 (KIF5) and kinesin-3 (KIF1) family members are involved in the transport of DCVs in hippocampal neurons (Schlager et al., 2010Schlager M.A. Kapitein L.C. Grigoriev I. Burzynski G.M. Wulf P.S. Keijzer N. de Graaff E. Fukuda M. Shepherd I.T. Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C.

Lett. 2011; 491: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To test whether these two kinesin family members are also required for DCV transport in DRG neurons, we examined the distribution of TagRFP-Rab6 in the cell body and axonal growth cone in KIF1- or KIF5-depleted neurons. Quantitative immunofluorescence was used to assess KIF1 knockdown efficiency in DRG neurons (Figures S4L and S4M). Similar to the MAP2 knockdown phenotype, simultaneous depletion of KIF1A/B/C strongly blocked DCV trafficking and led to vesicle accumulation in the cell body (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, when the KIF5B-tail region was used as a dominant negative to impair KIF5 activity (van Spronsen et al., 2013van Spronsen M. Mikhaylova M. Lipka J. Schlager M.A. van den Heuvel D.J. Kuijpers M. Wulf P.S. Keijzer N. Demmers J. Kapitein L.C. et al.TRAK/Milton motor-adaptor proteins steer mitochondrial trafficking to axons and dendrites.Neuron. 2013; 77: 485-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), Rab6 vesicles strongly accumulated at the growth cone, leaving the cell body depleted of vesicles (Figures 4A and 4B). The distal Rab6 vesicle accumulations were reversed by knockdown of KIF1 isoforms (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting that KIF1 and KIF5 work together to drive DCV transport. We next determined the dynamic behavior of Rab6 vesicles in the proximal axon of KIF1- or KIF5-depleted neurons. Kymograph analysis showed that knockdown of KIF1 severely inhibited Rab6 vesicle movements (Figures 4C and 4D). KIF5 dominant-negative constructs led to strong accumulation of Rab6 vesicles in the growth cone with concomitant vesicle depletion from the cell body (Figures 4A and 4B). Under this condition, no Rab6 vesicle movement was observed in the proximal axon (Figure 4D). Together these results show that both KIF1 and KIF5 control DCV transport in adult DRG axons. To further investigate how these two kinesin motors cooperate to drive DCV transport, we turned to MRC5 human lung fibroblasts, which lack endogenous MAP2 (Figure 4E). We first measured the single-molecule speeds of KIF5B-MDC(1–560)-GFP (1.24 ± 0.20 μm/s) and KIF1C-MDC(1–397)-GFP (2.58 ± 0.68 μm/s) (motor domain and coiled-coil dimerization region, MDC; Lipka et al., 2016Lipka J.

These data show that distinct kinesin proteins have different velocities: KIF1 is a relatively fast motor and KIF5 a slow motor. In MRC5 control cells, Rab6 vesicles moved with a velocity of 1.60 ± 0.74 μm/s, which roughly falls between the single-molecule speeds of KIF5 and KIF1 (Figures 4F and 4G; Table S1A). Interestingly, expression of GFP-MAP2B in MRC5 cells strongly increased the velocity of Rab6 vesicles to 2.23 ± 1.07 μm/s (Figures 4E and 4G; Table S1A). These data are consistent with MAP2 as a promoting factor for DCV trafficking where it might modulate the activity of kinesin motors attached to Rab6 vesicles. To test this idea, we used the rapamycin FRB-FKBP inducible cargo trafficking assay, where we triggered the binding of KIF5B-MDC(1–807) or KIF1C-MDC(1–397) to Rab6 vesicles (Schlager et al., 2014Schlager M.A. Serra-Marques A.

However, expression of MAP2 had no effect on KIF1-driven motility. We next investigated whether MAP2 affected KIF5-driven cargo transport. Rab6 vesicles bound to KIF5B-MDC(1–807) moved with a relatively slow velocity of 1.0 ± 0.26 μm/s (Figure 4H; Table S1A). Strikingly, after addition of MAP2, the velocity of Rab6 vesicles increased to 1.89 ± 0.39 μm/s (Figure 4H; Table S1A). We interpreted this as an effect of MAP2 strongly blocking KIF5 motor activity, allowing other fast endogenous motors, also attached to the vesicle and not affected by MAP2, to drive the vesicle’s motility. We next mapped which KIF5 region (amino acids 1–807) is implicated in this effect. To this end, we truncated the coiled-coil region in the KIF5B tail domain, KIF5B-MDC(1–560) and KIF5B-MDC(1–370). Interestingly, MAP2 did not affect the velocity of Rab6 vesicles attached to either of these two KIF5B truncations (Figure 4H; Table S1A), suggesting that the second coiled-coil region (560–807) in the KIF5B tail domain is required for MAP2-induced KIF5 motor activity inhibition on vesicles. In favor of an interplay between MAP2 and KIF5B-MDC(1–807), we observed that rapalog-induced binding of KIF5B-MDC(1–807) recruited cytoplasmic GFP-MAP2"

The mechanisms by which injury unlocks mature neurons' intrinsic axonal growth competence are not well understood. Here, we show that peripheral sciatic nerve lesion in adult mice leads to elevated levels of Tet3 and 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Functionally, Tet3 is required for robust axon regeneration of DRG neurons and behavioral recovery. Mechanistically, peripheral nerve injury induces DNA demethylation and upregulation of multiple regeneration-associated genes in a Tet3- and thymine DNA glycosylase-dependent fashion in DRG neurons. In addition, Pten deletion-induced axon regeneration of retinal ganglion neurons in the adult CNS is attenuated upon Tet1 knockdown. Together, our study suggests an epigenetic barrier that can be removed by active DNA demethylation to permit axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system."

Key predictions from this model were confirmed with behavioral data from non-human primates. Overall, our results suggest that metaplasticity can provide a neural substrate for adaptive learning and choice under uncertainty. Our knowledge of the world is continuously modified by the outcomes of a myriad of decisions we make over time. For this learning to be successful, the brain has to adjust the way it responds to and integrates each reward outcome, since stimulus-reward or action-reward contingencies can unpredictably change over time in natural environments. For example, in an environment where reward probability associated with alternative choices changes frequently (i.e., volatile environment), learning should be fast so that only the most recent outcomes are considered in the estimation of reward probabilities. By contrast, in a stable environment where reward probabilities do not change very often, learning should be slow to obtain a more accurate estimate of reward values. Indeed, it has been experimentally demonstrated that humans are able to adjust their learning or learning rates based on the reward uncertainty and volatility in a given environment (Behrens et al., 2007Behrens T.E.J.

However, neural mechanisms underlying these adjustments are relatively unknown. Some reinforcement learning (RL) models assume that the proper learning rates in a given environment can be estimated using optimization processes. An example of such an optimization process is meta-learning, which maximizes the average of reward via modification of the learning rates based on a comparison between the medium-term and long-term running averages of the reward rate (Doya, 2002Doya K.

However, it is unclear whether such an algorithm can determine the proper learning rates in dynamic tasks because the time constants for computing these reward averages also have to be adjusted according to the uncertainty and volatility of the environment. In contrast, model-based or Bayesian approaches try to learn the structure of the environment and its parameters in order to optimally integrate reward feedback (Behrens et al., 2007Behrens T.E.J.

Despite the success of these Bayesian models in capturing behavioral data and observation of neural correlates of variables in these models, it is unclear how the correct model of the environment can be learned or how different components of these models can be implemented in the brain. We hypothesized that certain brain areas might be endowed with synaptic mechanisms that use reward history to determine the level of synaptic plasticity and, therefore, adjust learning in the absence of any explicit optimization, or before a model of the environment can be fully learned. Specifically, we assumed that such adjustment of learning can be implemented via synaptic metaplasticity. Metaplasticity refers to experimentally observed changes in the synaptic state that shape the direction, magnitude, and duration of future synaptic changes without any observable change in the efficacy of synaptic transmission (Abraham, 2008Abraham W.C.

Here, we present a biophysically plausible model based on reward-dependent metaplasticity (RDMP) that can adjust learning according to reward uncertainty. In our model, metaplastic synapses have multiple levels of stability (meta-states) associated with two levels of synaptic efficacy and undergo reward-dependent changes. To test our model, we simulated choice behavior during a dynamic learning and decision-making task known as probabilistic reversal learning (PRL), which has been extensively used to study adaptive learning and decision making in health and disease (Cools et al., 2001Cools R. Barker R.A. Sahakian B.J. Robbins T.W. Enhanced or impaired cognitive function in Parkinson’s disease as a function of dopaminergic medication and task demands.Cereb.

In this study, we demonstrate that based on reward feedback, RDMP allows synapses to occupy states with different levels of stability and thus can adjust learning according to the uncertainty and volatility of the environment. We show that a model endowed with RDMP not only can perform the PRL task over a wide range of model and task parameters, but also provides specific predictions that differ from those of heuristic RL models, and Bayesian models that require explicit knowledge of the task structure. Using an extensive set of behavioral data from a recent study in non-human primates during the PRL task (Donahue and Lee, 2015Donahue C.H. Lee D. Dynamic routing of task-relevant signals for decision making in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we provide experimental evidence for some of the model’s predictions and thus, the contribution of metaplasticity to behavior. Finally, we show that changes in the activity of reward-encoding neurons with metaplastic synapses can be used to estimate reward volatility for which a neural correlate has been observed (Behrens et al., 2007Behrens T.E.J. Woolrich M.W. Walton M.E. Rushworth M.F.S. Learning the value of information in an uncertain world.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Overall, our results suggest that reward-dependent metaplasticity can provide a robust neural substrate for adaptive learning and choice under uncertainty, and moreover, enables computations of high-level signals such as volatility. As a platform to study learning and choice under reward uncertainty, we focused on behavior during a PRL task. In this task, the subject selects between two alternative options (e.g., colored targets), which deliver reward probabilistically (Figure 1A). The probabilities of reward on the green and red options are complementary, for example 0.8 on the green and 0.2 on the red target. However, unknown to the subject, these probabilities switch after a certain number of trials referred to as the block length, L. The combination of reward probability on the better (more rewarding) and worse (less rewarding) options, pR(B) and pR(W), and block length defines an environment in this task (e.g., 0.8/0.2 schedule with L = 80). Performing this task requires selection of the better option within a given block of trials, which is complicated due to two factors: (1) the probabilistic nature of reward assignment or expected “uncertainty”; and (2) switches in reward probabilities between blocks of trials (reversals), resulting in unexpected uncertainty, also referred to as “volatility.” To detect the better option within each block of trials in the PRL task, the subject has to continuously update the estimates for reward value of the two options based on reward feedback. However, for models with constant learning rates, such as a simple RL model with one learning parameter (RL(1)), the optimal learning rates depend on the levels of uncertainty and volatility in the environment (Figures 1B and 1C). In a relatively stable environment with reward probabilities far from 0.5 (0.8/0.2 schedule with L = 80), a moderate value of the learning rate produces optimal performance (Figure 1B). However, in a more volatile environment (0.8/0.2 schedule with L = 20), a higher learning rate is more desirable. Finally, in an environment with greater uncertainty (0.6/0.4 schedule with L = 80), a lower learning rate is required to obtain a better estimate of reward value. Overall, the optimal learning rate of RL(1) increases as the environment becomes more volatile and slightly decreases when the environment becomes more uncertain (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate an inherent tradeoff between adaptability (i.e., fast response to changes in the environment) and precision (i.e., correct estimation of reward probabilities) during learning and choice under uncertainty. Tackling this tradeoff requires the brain to adjust the learning rate either across time or across environments since the optimal learning rate could vary substantially depending on the levels of uncertainty and volatility present. Here, we suggest that RDMP can provide a plausible mechanism for learning and choice under uncertainty and simulate the behavior of an example model based on RDMP during the PRL task. We compare the behavior of this model with three sets of models that rely on different mechanisms to deal with uncertainty and volatility in the PRL task (see STAR Methods). In our model, neurons encoding the reward value of different options (value-encoding neurons) receive their inputs via metaplastic synapses that undergo a stochastic RDMP learning rule. These metaplastic synapses have multiple meta-states with different levels of stability associated with two levels of synaptic efficacy: weak and strong. The output of value-encoding neurons associated with a given option reflects the overall synaptic efficacy of metaplastic synapses onto them. Because there are two levels of synaptic efficacy, the overall synaptic efficacy for each set of metaplastic synapses can be quantified as the fraction of synapses in strong meta-states, which we refer to as the “synaptic strength.” Importantly, the RDMP learning rule enables the synaptic strengths to estimate the probability of reward for alternative options, whereas the model selects between the two options stochastically based on a probability given by the difference in synaptic strengths for the two options (see STAR Methods). Metaplastic synapses can change their states stochastically depending on the choice and reward outcome at the end of each trial. We assumed that synapses associated with the chosen option are potentiated on rewarded trials and depressed on unrewarded trials (Figure 2A; see STAR Methods). Because only one of the two options is assigned with reward on each trial of the PRL task, we also assumed that synapses associated with the unchosen option are depressed on rewarded trials and potentiated on unrewarded trials. Due to the stochastic nature of synaptic transitions, potentiation or depression events may or may not change synaptic efficacy of a particular synapse, but at the population level, result in a well-defined learning rule (Equations 3 and 4 in STAR Methods). We simulated the behavior of the model in a few environments with different levels of uncertainty and volatility, using the same set of parameters. Toward the end of each block in the stable environment, synapses associated with the better option increasingly occupied more stable strong meta-states, while a small fraction of them occupied the most unstable weak meta-states (W1; Figure 2B). The volatile environment, on the other hand, made these synapses occupy mainly unstable strong meta-states or the most unstable weak meta-states (Figure 2C). This happened because, in the volatile environment, there was not enough time for synapses undergoing potentiation to occupy stable strong meta-states, whereas this was possible in the stable environment. In addition to the block length, the fractions of synapses in different meta-states were also influenced by reward probabilities (hence uncertainty). As the reward probabilities became closer to 0.5, thus increasing uncertainty, more synapses occupied more unstable weak meta-states and the fractions of synapses in strong meta-states monotonically decreased for more stable meta-states (Figure 2D). This happened because with more variable reward assignment, synapses associated with the better option were less likely to transition to stable (deep) meta-states. Overall, these results indicate that metaplastic synapses can adjust to reward statistics in the environment, in terms of both the volatility and uncertainty. The fractions of synapses in different meta-states show how metaplastic synapses adjust to reward statistics in a given environment. Because different meta-states have different transition probabilities, those fractions also determine the speed of learning at a given point in time. To illustrate these, we calculated the “effective” learning rates as a function of the trial number after a reversal for the two possible outcomes of reward assignment. For any point during a block, the effective learning rates provide a single set of learning rates by considering the total change in the efficacy over all meta-states (see STAR Methods). By definition, the product of the effective learning rate and the fraction of synapses in weak (strong) meta-states are equal to the increase (decrease) in synaptic strength. We found that the effective learning rates changed over time and depended on whether the reward was assigned to the better or worse option. For synapses associated with the better option, the effective learning rate on trials when the worse option was assigned with reward, KB-(t), monotonically decreased over time after a reversal (solid cyan curve in Figure 3A). At the same time, however, the effective learning rate on trials when the better option was assigned with reward, KB+(t), monotonically increased. The amount of changes in the effective learning rates depended on the uncertainty and volatility such that these changes were larger for more certain and stable environments (see below). At the beginning of each reversal in the stable environment, synapses associated with the better option in the new block were mainly in stable weak meta-states or unstable strong meta-states since these synapses were associated with the worse option in the previous block (Figure 2B). On trials when reward was assigned to the better option, synapses in the stable weak meta-states slowly transition to strong meta-states, resulting in a small effective learning rate at the beginning of each block (solid gold curve, Figure 3A). In contrast, on trials when reward was assigned to the worse option, synapses in the unstable strong meta-states quickly transition to weak meta-states resulting in a large value for the effective learning rate on those trials. Both of these effective learning rates change over time as the distribution of synapses in different meta-states adjusts to the recent reward statistics (Figures 2B–2D). The change in the effective learning rates over time as well as the difference between the two learning rates were sensitive to reward uncertainty and volatility in the environment. Specifically, the difference between KB+(t) and KB-(t) was more pronounced in a more certain environment than in an uncertain one (compare solid and dashed curves in Figure 3A). Moreover, KB+(t) rose to a higher value while KB-(t) fell to a lower value in a stable than in a volatile environment (compare solid curves in Figure 3A and its inset). The time-dependent adjustment to reward statistics was not specific to the example environments and was observed over a large set of environments with different levels of uncertainty and volatility. At the beginning of each block, KB+(t) was smaller than KB-(t) and this difference was stronger (more negative) for more certain or stable environments (Figure 3B). Over time, KB+(t) increased while KB-(t) decreased such that (KB+ − KB-) becomes positive later in the block (Figures 3C and 3D). The difference between the steady state of the two learning rates increased as uncertainty and/or volatility decreased. Although our model based on RDMP suggests that learning rates depend on whether the reward outcome supports the better or worse choice alternative, these rates are often estimated in empirical studies based on the reward outcomes independently of choice alternatives. To estimate such learning rates in our model, we computed the effective learning rates on rewarded and unrewarded trials, Krew(t) and Kunr(t), by averaging the effective learning rates based on the reward outcome on a given trial (Equation 8 in STAR Methods). We found that Krew(t) was smaller than Kunr(t) at the beginning of each block (Figure S1). However, as the model spent more time in a block, Krew(t) increased, whereas Kunr(t) decreased such that Krew(t) became larger than Kunr(t) later in a block. These changes resulted in an overall larger learning rate for rewarded than unrewarded trials, as observed in previous experiments (Donahue and Lee, 2015Donahue C.H. Lee D.

In addition to changes in the learning rates over time (i.e., trial to trial), our model also predicts that the difference between the overall learning rates on rewarded and unrewarded trials should decrease with the uncertainty in the environment (Figure S1F). This prediction can be tested in future experiments. Overall, these results show that metaplastic synapses adjust to reward statistics in the environment. This gives rise to time-dependent learning rates that are different for synapses associated with the two alternative options (i.e., learning rates are choice specific), and on rewarded and unrewarded trials. For simplicity, here we used a specific implementation of RDMP (Equation 2 in STAR Methods), which guarantees that at the steady state, the effective learning rate for reward assignment on the better option is larger than the one on the worse option. Nevertheless, we found that most RDMP models with different formulations of transition probabilities exhibit such behavior, as long as there is an order in the transitions between meta-states resulting in shallow and deep meta-states (data not shown). We next examined how the model endowed with metaplasticity can adjust its response according to the uncertainty and volatility in the environment. To do so, we computed changes in the model’s response to reward feedback over time. Because choice behavior is determined by the synaptic strengths (Equation 1 in STAR Methods), we first computed changes in the synaptic strengths due to the two types of reward feedback at different time points within a block of the PRL task. We found that the change in the synaptic strength when reward was assigned to the better option, ΔFB+(t), was large immediately after a reversal, but then it slowly decreased over time (red curves in Figure 3E). This happens because immediately after a reversal, a large fraction of synapses associated with the currently better (previously worse) option is in weak meta-states, and the transition of these synapses due to a potentiation event results in a large ΔFB+(t). The ΔFB+(t) gradually decreases as fewer synapses remain in weak meta-states. On the other hand, the change in the synaptic strength when reward was assigned to the worse option, ΔFB-(t), became stronger (more negative) over the span of about ten trials after a reversal, and later gradually became weaker (blue curves in Figure 3E). Importantly, the starting points of ΔFB+(t) and ΔFB-(t) were farther from zero but changed less over time in the uncertain compared to stable environment (compare dashed and solid curves in Figure 3E). In contrast, we observed larger changes in response to reward feedback over trials within each block of the volatile environment (data not shown). To measure the model’s overall response to both types of reward feedback, we also computed a weighted average of the values of ΔFB+(t) and ΔFB-(t) based on the reward probability in a given block (see STAR Methods). In the stable environment, ΔF(t) slowly decreased to zero after each reversal as the model reached the steady state within each block (solid black curve in Figure 3E). In the uncertain environment, however, ΔF(t) was initially lower and decreased to zero more slowly (dashed black curve in Figure 3E). These results demonstrate the overall ability of our model to adjust its response based on reward uncertainty in the environment. To further examine adjustments due to metaplasticity, we simulated our model in various environments with different levels of uncertainty and volatility using one set of parameters. Immediately after each reversal, the model showed the greatest overall response to reward fe"

Here, we examine the morphologies, wiring, and architectures of single synapses of projection neurons in the murine hippocampus that developed in virtually complete absence of vesicular glutamate release. While these neurons had smaller dendritic trees and/or formed fewer contacts in specific hippocampal subfields, their stereotyped connectivity was largely preserved. Furthermore, loss of release did not disrupt the morphogenesis of presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines, suggesting that glutamatergic neurotransmission is unnecessary for synapse assembly and maintenance. These results underscore the instructive role of intrinsic mechanisms in synapse formation."

At the moment, however, this important debate is hampered by the fact that there is relatively little data available concerning what patients actually experience following DBS treatment. There are a few qualitative studies with patients with Parkinson's disease and Primary Dystonia and some case reports, but there has been no qualitative study yet with patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we present the experiences of 18 patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) who are undergoing treatment with DBS. We will also discuss the inherent difficulties of how to define and assess changes in personality, in particular for patients with psychiatric disorders. We end with a discussion of the data and how these shed new light on the conceptual debate about how to define personality."

However, little is known about the role of this system in oocyte maturation. In a mouse model, we observed that activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) during in vitro oocyte maturation modulated the phosphorylation status of Akt and ERK1/2 and enhanced the subsequent embryo production. In the absence of CB1, in vivo oocyte maturation was impaired and embryo development delayed. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) was unable to rescue these effects. Finally, we confirmed abnormal oocyte maturation rather than impaired embryonic transport through the oviduct in CB1 knockouts. Our data suggest that cannabinoid agonists may be useful in vitro maturation supplements.

https://openalex.org/W2607432382,"The MRI environment restricts the types of populations and tasks that can be studied by cognitive neuroscientists (e.g., young infants, face-to-face communication). FNIRS is a neuroimaging modality that records the same physiological signal as fMRI but without the constraints of MRI, and with better spatial localization than EEG. However, research in the fNIRS community largely lacks the analytic sophistication of analogous fMRI work, restricting the application of this imaging technology. The current paper presents a method of multivariate pattern analysis for fNIRS that allows the authors to decode the infant mind (a key fNIRS population). Specifically, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) employs a correlation-based decoding method where a group model is constructed for all infants except one; both average patterns (i.e., infant-level) and single trial patterns (i.e., trial-level) of activation are decoded. Between subjects decoding is a particularly difficult task, because each infant has their own somewhat idiosyncratic patterns of neural activation. The fact that our method succeeds at across-subject decoding demonstrates the presence of group-level multi-channel regularities across infants. The code for implementing these analyses has been made readily available online to facilitate the quick adoption of this method to advance the methodological tools available to the fNIRS researcher."
https://openalex.org/W2605866045,"Stunting and underweight among under-five children in Indonesia are common, raising public health concerns. Whether inappropriate complementary feeding (CF) practices compromise optimal growth during late infancy in Indonesia is uncertain. Therefore we characterized and evaluated CF practices in Indonesian infants and investigated their relationship with subsequent growth. We enrolled breastfed infants at 6 months of age (n = 230); and followed them at 9 (n = 202) and 12 months of age (n = 190). We collected socio-demographic and anthropometric data and two-day in-home weighed food records. Relations between WHO CF indicators, sentinel foods, and energy and micronutrient intakes at 9 months and growth at 12 months were explored using multiple linear regression. Stunting and underweight increased from 15.8% and 4.4% at 6 months to 22.6% and 10.5% at 12 months, respectively. Median intakes of calcium, iron, zinc, and riboflavin were below WHO recommendations. Infants consuming fortified infant foods (FIFs) at 9 months had diets with a lower dietary diversity (DD) score (2.3 vs.3.0), energy density, median energy (250 vs. 310 kcal/d) and protein (6.5 vs. 9.1 g/d) intake than non-consumers (p<0.01), despite higher intakes of calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C (p<0.001). Positive relations existed for 9-month consumption of iron-rich/iron fortified infant foods with length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at 12 months (β = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.44; P = 0.04), and for fortified infant foods alone with both LAZ (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.48; P = 0.04) and weight-for-age Z-score (β = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.26; P = 0.02) at 12 months. The positive association of FIFs with subsequent growth may be attributed to their content of both powdered cow’s milk and multi-micronutrient fortificants. Nonetheless, mothers should not be encouraged to over-rely on FIFs as they reduce DD."

We draw upon representative sample surveys in Europe and North America, fielded in 2005 and find that the majority of people in Europe, Canada and the United States supported stem-cell research, providing it was tightly regulated, but that there were key differences between the geographical regions in the relative importance of different types of ethical position. In the U.S., moral acceptability was more influential as a driver of support for stem-cell research; in Europe the perceived benefit to society carried more weight; and in Canada the two were almost equally important. We also find that public opinion on stem-cell research was more strongly associated with religious convictions in the U.S. than in Canada and Europe, although many strongly religious citizens in all regions approved of stem-cell research.

We applied TDA to study denaturation of β-lactoglobulin, transferrin, and human insulin by anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). A series of measurements at constant protein concentration (for transferrin was 1.9 x 10-5 M, for β- lactoglobulin was 7.6 x 10-5 M, and for insulin was 1.2 x 10-4 M) and varying SDS concentrations were carried out in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The structural changes were analyzed based on the diffusion coefficients of the complexes formed at various surfactant concentrations. The concentration of surfactant was varied in the range from 1.2 x 10-4 M to 8.7 x 10-2 M. We determined the minimum concentration of the surfactant necessary to change the native conformation of the proteins. The minimal concentration of SDS for β-lactoglobulin and transferrin was 4.3 x 10-4 M and for insulin 2.3 x 10-4 M. To evaluate the TDA as a novel method for studying denaturation of proteins we also applied other methods i.e. electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the same phenomenon.

Artificial liver support systems (ALSS) may improve outcome and avoid liver transplantation, but predicting short-term prognosis in such patients is difficult. This study aimed to determine whether the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammation marker, predicted mortality in patients treated with ALSS. Methods A total of 560 patients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure were enrolled, 338 were treated with ALSS and the others treated with standard of care(SOC). Clinical variables and the NLR were evaluated for prognostic value. Results Thirty-day mortality was 28.4% in ALSS and 55.4% in SOC patients. The NLR was lower in survivors than in ALSS or SOC patients who died. Univariate and multivariate analysis found that NLR and the chronic liver failure sequential organ failure assessment scores(CLIF-SOFA) were independently associated with 30-day mortality. Among patients with NLRs ≤ 3, 3–6, and >6, 30-day mortality was 7.7%,23.1%, and 69.2% in ALSS and 25.5%, 50.0%, and 75.0% in SOC patients. Among patients with NLRs ≤ 3 or 3–6, mortality was lower in ALSS than in SOC patients (P < 0.01). Mortality rates of ALSS and SOC patients with NLRs > 6 did not different (P >0.05). The area under curve of NLR and CLIF-SOFA was 0.82 and 0.88 in ALSS group, 0.78 and 0.86 in SOC group. The results suggest that liver function in most patients with NLRs ≤ 3 recovered with ALSS treatment, and patients with NLRs > 6 needed emergency liver transplantation. Conclusion NLR was an independent predictor of mortality in ALSS patients and may assist physicians in determining treatment options."

It is a critical regulator of RA-FLS migration and invasion and therefore represents an attractive target for the therapy of RA. However, the molecular mechanisms by which KCa1.1 regulates RA-FLS invasiveness have remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KCa1.1 regulates RA-FLS adhesion through controlling the plasma membrane expression and activation of β1 integrins, but not α4, α5, or α6 integrins. Blocking KCa1.1 disturbs calcium homeostasis, leading to the sustained phosphorylation of Akt and the recruitment of talin to β1 integrins. Interestingly, the pore-forming α subunit of KCa1.1 coimmunoprecipitates with β1 integrins, suggesting that this physical association underlies the functional interaction between these molecules.

This study presents a novel approach to search on the potential plasticity of Fervidobacterium genomes using putative transposase-encoding genes as the target of analysis. Transposases are key proteins involved in genomic DNA rearrangements. A comprehensive comparative analysis, including phylogeny, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies, repetitive flanking sequences and divergence estimates, was performed on the transposase genes detected in four Fervidobacterium genomes: F. nodosum, F. pennivorans, F. islandicum and a new isolate (Fervidobacterium sp. FC2004). Transposase sequences were classified in different groups by their degree of similarity. The different methods used in this study pointed that over half of the transposase genes represented putative HGT events with closest relative sequences within the phylum Firmicutes, being Caldicellulosiruptor the genus showing highest gene sequence proximity. These results confirmed a direct evolutionary relationship through HGT between specific Fervidobacterium species and thermophilic Firmicutes leading to potential gene sequence and functionality sharing to thrive under similar environmental conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2607246927,"Through centuries of both natural and artificial selection, a variety of local cattle populations arose with highly specific phenotypes. However, the intensification and expansion of scale in animal production systems led to the predominance of a few highly productive cattle breeds. The loss of local populations is often considered irreversible and with them specific qualities and rare variants could be lost as well. Over these last years, the interest in these local breeds has increased again leading to increasing efforts to conserve these breeds or even revive lost populations, e.g. through the use of crosses with similar breeds. However, the remaining populations are expected to contain crossbred individuals resulting from introgressions. They are likely to carry exogenous genes that affect the breed's authenticity on a genomic level. Using the revived Campine breed as a case study, 289 individuals registered as purebreds were genotyped on the Illumina BovineSNP50. In addition, genomic information on the Illumina BovineHD and Illumina BovineSNP50 of ten breeds was available to assess the current population structure, genetic diversity, and introgression with phenotypically similar and/or historically related breeds. Introgression with Holstein and beef cattle genotypes was limited to only a few farms. While the current population shows a substantial amount of within-breed variation, the majority of genotypes can be separated from other breeds in the study, supporting the re-establishment of the Campine breed. The majority of the population is genetically close to the Deep Red (NL), Improved Red (NL) and Eastern Belgium Red and White (BE) cattle, breeds known for their historical ties to the Campine breed.

https://openalex.org/W2605813280,"Connexin26 (Cx26) is a gap junction protein that oligomerizes in the cell to form hexameric transmembrane channels called connexons. Cell surface connexons dock between adjacent cells to allow for gap junctional intercellular communication. Numerous autosomal dominant mutations in the Cx26-encoding GJB2 gene lead to many skin disorders and sensorineural hearing loss. Although some insights have been gained into the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is not fully understood how distinct GJB2 mutations result in hearing loss alone or in skin pathologies with comorbid hearing loss. Here we investigated five autosomal dominant Cx26 mutants (N14K, D50N, N54K, M163V, and S183F) linked to various syndromic or nonsyndromic diseases to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning these disease links. We demonstrated that when gap junction-deficient HeLa cells expressed the N14K and D50N mutants, they undergo cell death. The N54K mutant was retained primarily within intracellular compartments and displayed dominant or transdominant properties on wild-type Cx26 and coexpressed Cx30 and Cx43. The S183F mutant formed some gap junction plaques but was largely retained within the cell and exhibited only a mild transdominant reduction in gap junction communication when co-expressed with Cx30. The M163V mutant, which causes only hearing loss, exhibited impaired gap junction function and showed no transdominant interactions. These findings suggest that Cx26 mutants that promote cell death or exert transdominant effects on other connexins in keratinocytes will lead to skin diseases and hearing loss, whereas mutants having reduced channel function but exhibiting no aberrant effects on coexpressed connexins cause only hearing loss. Moreover, cell death-inducing GJB2 mutations lead to more severe syndromic disease."

These contrasting hypotheses are developed in the present study for the giant columnar cactus Cephalocereus columna-trajani in the intertropical Mexican drylands where the effects of Late Quaternary climatic changes on phylogeography of cacti remain largely unknown. In order to determine if the historic demography and phylogeographic structure of the species are consistent with either hypothesis, sequences of the chloroplast regions psbA-trnH and trnT-trnL from 110 individuals from 10 populations comprising the full distribution range of this species were analysed. Standard estimators of genetic diversity and structure were calculated. The historic demography was analysed using a Bayesian approach and the palaeodistribution was derived from ecological niche modelling to determine if, in the arid environments of south-central Mexico, glacial-interglacial cycles drove the genetic divergence and diversification of this species. Results reveal low but statistically significant population differentiation (FST = 0.124, P < 0.001), although very clear geographic clusters are not formed. Genetic diversity, haplotype network and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) demographic analyses suggest a population expansion estimated to have taken place in the Last Interglacial (123.04 kya, 95% CI 115.3-130.03). The species palaeodistribution is consistent with the ABC analyses and indicates that the potential area of palaedistribution and climatic suitability were larger during the Last Interglacial and Holocene than in the Last Glacial Maximum. Overall, these results suggest that C. columna-trajani experienced an expansion following the warm conditions of interglacials, in accordance with the GRH."

We applied an ex vivo technique for cultivating gonads in hanging droplets of media that were supplemented with vivo-morpholinos to knockdown WT1 and GATA4 either alone or in combination at the same developmental stage. We show that WT1 is equally important for both, the initial establishment and the maintenance of the sex-specific gene expression signature in testes and ovaries. We further identified Foxl2 as a novel putative downstream target gene of WT1. Moreover, knockdown of WT1 reduced mRNA levels of several molecular components of the hedgehog signaling pathway in XY gonads, whereas Gata4 vivo-morpholino treatment increased transcripts of Dhh and Ptch1 in embryonic testes. The data suggest that for its proper function, WT1 relies on the correct expression of the GATA4 protein. Furthermore, GATA4 down-regulates several ovarian promoting genes in testes, such as Ctnnb1, Fst, and Bmp2, suggesting that this repression is required for maintaining the male phenotype. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the role of WT1 and GATA4 during the sex differentiation phase and represents an approach that can be applied to assess other proteins with as yet unknown functions during gonadal development."

https://openalex.org/W2607103621,"Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. Recent studies have implicated TH signaling in cone photoreceptor viability. Using mouse models of retinal degeneration, we demonstrated that antithyroid drug treatment and targeting iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) to suppress cellular tri-iodothyronine (T3) production or increase T3 degradation preserves cones. In this work, we investigated the effectiveness of inhibition of the TH receptor (TR). Two genes, THRA and THRB, encode TRs; THRB2 has been associated with cone viability. Using TR antagonists and Thrb2 deletion, we examined the effects of TR inhibition. Systemic and ocular treatment with the TR antagonists NH-3 and 1–850 increased cone density by 30–40% in the Rpe65‒/‒ mouse model of Leber congenital amaurosis and reduced the number of TUNEL + cells. Cone survival was significantly improved in Rpe65‒/‒ and Cpfl1 (a model of achromatopsia with Pde6c defect) mice with Thrb2 deletion. Ventral cone density in Cpfl1/Thrb2‒/‒ and Rpe65‒/‒/Thrb2‒/‒ mice was increased by 1- to 4-fold, compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, the expression levels of TR were significantly higher in the cone-degeneration retinas, suggesting locally elevated TR signaling. This work shows that the effects of antithyroid treatment or targeting DIOs were likely mediated by TRs and that suppressing TR protects cones. Our findings support the view that inhibition of TR locally in the retina is a therapeutic strategy for retinal degeneration management.—Ma, H., Yang, F., Butler, M. R., Belcher, J., Redmond, T.

https://openalex.org/W2606630446,"Objective We aimed to assess the role of procalcitonin (PCT) to guide the initial selection of the antibiotic regimen for low-risk community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods A single-arm clinical trial was conducted including outpatients with CAP and Pneumonia Severity Index risk classes I-II. Antimicrobial selection was based on the results of PCT measured with a rapid point-of-care testing. According to serum PCT levels, patients were assigned to two treatment strategies: oral azithromycin if PCT was <0.5 ng/ml, or levofloxacin if levels were ≥0.5 ng/ml. Primary outcome was clinical cure rate. Short-term and long-term outcomes were assessed. Results were compared with those of a historical standard-of-care control-group treated in our centre. Results Of 253 subjects included, 216 (85.4%) were assigned to azithromycin. Pneumococcal infection was diagnosed in 26 (12%) and 21 (56.8%) patients allocated to azithromycin and levofloxacin groups, respectively. No patients in the azithromycin group developed bacteraemia. Atypical organisms were more common in patients given azithromycin (18.5% vs 8.1%, respectively). The majority (93%) of patients with atypical pneumonia had low PCT levels. Clinical cure rates were 95.8% in the azithromycin group, 94.6% in the levofloxacin group, and 94.4% in the historical control group. No 30-day mortality or recurrences were observed, and the 3-year rates of recurrence and mortality were very low in both groups. Adverse events occurrence was also infrequent. Conclusion A PCT-guided strategy with a rapid point-of-care testing safely allowed selecting empirical narrow-spectrum antibiotics in outpatients with CAP.

https://openalex.org/W2607410968,"Background and aims Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a non-invasive method for measuring hepatic steatosis (HS). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of NAFLD in hemodialysis patients. Method We prospectively enrolled patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, as well as patients with normal renal function who served as controls. The control group patients were referred by an endocrinologist to be tested for NAFLD; most of these patients had diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. We excluded those with excess alcohol intake, use of drugs known to induce HS, chronic viral hepatitis, or CAP failure. CAP ≥ 238 dB/m was used as a cutoff suggesting HS. An increased liver kidney contrast, as defined by ultrasound, was used to make the diagnosis of HS. Results Three hundred and forty-three hemodialysis patients and 252 control group patients were enrolled. Among the hemodialysis patients, 192 (56.0%) had CAP- or ultrasound-identified HS compared with 91 (26.5%) who only had ultrasound-identified HS (P<0.001). Among the control group patients, 212 (84.1%) had CAP- or ultrasound-identified HS compared with 180 (71.4%) who only had ultrasound-identified HS (P<0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of NAFLD in the hemodialysis patients was 56%. The number of diagnoses of NAFLD made by using CAP combined with ultrasound was more than 2 times the number made with ultrasound alone in the hemodialysis patients. Therefore, we suggest the use of CAP combined with ultrasound to screen for NAFLD in hemodialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2607075065,"ΔNp63αplays key roles in cell survival and proliferation. So its expression is always tightly controlled in cells. We previously reported that DNA damage down-regulates transcription of ΔNp63αin FaDu and HaCat cells, which contributes to cell apoptosis. In the present study, we found that DNA damage induces down-regulation of ΔNp63αvia facilitating its proteasomal degradation in cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A. Further investigation revealed that transcription of WWP1 is stimulated by DNA damage in these cells. Knock-down of WWP1 abrogates DNA damage-induced down-regulation of ΔNp63αand partially rescues cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DNA damage may stimulate WWP1 through different mechanisms in different cell types: it up-regulates transcription of WWP1 in a p53-dependent manner in MCF10A and HEK293 cells, while miR-452 may be involved in DNA damage-induced up-regulation of WWP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our study demonstrates a novel pathway which regulates ΔNp63αupon cellular response to chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2605581922,"Despite longstanding efforts to develop cytoprotective drugs against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injuries, there remains no effective therapeutics to treat hypoxic injury. The failure of traditional strategies at solving this problem suggests the need for novel and unbiased approaches that can lead to previously unsuspected targets and lead compounds. Towards this end, we report here a unique small molecule screen in the nematode C. elegans for compounds that improve recovery when applied after the hypoxic insult, using a C. elegans strain engineered to have delayed cell non-autonomous death. In a screen of 2000 compounds, six were found to produce significant protection of C. elegans from delayed death. Four of the compounds were tested in an ex vivo mouse heart ischemia/reperfusion model and two, meclocycline and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, significantly reduced infarction size.

The described method was optimised with the aim to provide a fast and robust tool for the detection of DNA synthesis with minimal impact on the cellular structures using image and flow cytometry. The approach is based on the introduction of breaks into the DNA by the low concentration of hydrochloric acid followed by the subsequent enzymatic extension of these breaks using exonuclease III. Our data showed that the method has only a minimal effect on the tested protein localisations and is applicable both for formaldehyde- and ethanol-fixed cells. The approach partially also preserves the fluorescence of the fluorescent proteins in the HeLa cells expressing Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicator. In the case of the short labelling pulses that disabled the use of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine because of the low specific signal, the described method provided a bright signal enabling reliable recognition of replicating cells.

https://openalex.org/W2605756613,"Background PROUD participants were randomly assigned to receive pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) immediately or after a deferred period of one-year. We report on the acceptability of this open-label wait-listed trial design. Methods Participants completed an acceptability questionnaire, which included categorical study acceptability data and free-text data on most and least liked aspects of the study. We also conducted in-depth interviews (IDI) with a purposely selected sub-sample of participants. Results Acceptability questionnaires were completed by 76% (415/544) of participants. After controlling for age, immediate-group participants were almost twice as likely as deferred-group participants to complete the questionnaire (AOR:1.86;95%CI:1.24,2.81). In quantitative data, the majority of participants in both groups found the wait-listed design acceptable when measured by satisfaction of joining the study, intention to remain in the study, and interest in joining a subsequent study. However, three-quarters thought that the chance of being in the deferred-group might put other volunteers off joining the study. In free-text responses, data collection tools were the most frequently reported least liked aspect of the study. A fifth of deferred participants reported ‘being deferred’ as the thing they least liked about the study. However, more deferred participants disliked the data collection tools than the fact that they had to wait a year to access PrEP. Participants in the IDIs had a good understanding of the rationale for the open-label wait-listed study design. Most accepted the design but acknowledged they were, or would have been, disappointed to be randomised to the deferred group. Five of the 25 participants interviewed reported some objection to the wait-listed design. Conclusion The quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that in an environment where PrEP was not available, the rationale for the wait-listed trial design was well understood and generally acceptable to most participants in this study."

The study of those global phenomena and the simulation of those diffusion processes frequently require a good model of the global network. However, survey data and data from online sources are often restricted to single social groups or features, such as age groups, single schools, companies, or interest groups. Hence, a modeling approach is required that extrapolates the locally restricted data to a global network model. We tackle this Missing Data Problem using Link-Prediction techniques from social network research, network generation techniques from the area of Social Simulation, as well as a combination of both. We found that techniques employing less information may be more adequate to solve this problem, especially when data granularity is an issue. We validated the network models created with our techniques on a number of real-world networks, investigating degree distributions as well as the likelihood of links given the geographical distance between two nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2609405229,"(Neuron 94, 266–270; April 19, 2017) In this issue, we, the editors of Neuron, are publishing a Matters Arising from Dubin, Murthy, and colleagues (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039) and Matters Arising Responses from Zhao and colleagues (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.040) and Hong and colleagues (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.038). The Matters Arising raises concerns with two Neuron papers published in March and July in 2016 by Zhao, Wu, Geng, Chi, and colleagues (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.046) and Hong, Lee, and colleagues (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.05.029), respectively. The Neuron papers examine the mechanical activation of two different channels: Piezo1 and Tentonin 3(TTN3)/TMEM150c. Zhao et al. defined the features of Piezo1 that allows for ion permeation and mechanotransduction (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.046), while Hong et al. identified TTN3 as a component of a mechanosensitive channel expressed in muscle spindle afferents and contributes to motor coordination (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.05.029). The Matters Arising article from the labs of Ardem Patapoutian, Jorg Grandl, and Bertrand Coste highlights a potential confound common to both papers, the influence of endogenous Piezo1 in demonstrating the mechanical activation of the ion channels (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039). Although Dubin et al. observe mechanically activated currents with expression of Piezo1-ASIC1 (chimera used to define region of Piezo1 sufficient to confer mechanosensitivity) or TTN3 when expressed in naive cells, the mechanically activated currents are absent when expressed in cells deficient of endogenous Piezo1. The dependence of the mechanically activated currents of Piezo-1-ASIC1 and TTN3 on endogenous Piezo1 is the focus of the Matters Arising and the Matters Arising Responses. Before going into the specifics behind the decision to publish this Matters Arising and Matters Arising Responses, we would like to provide a general summary of how we consider refutations of Neuron papers. The Matters Arising format is specifically meant for articles that call into question the validity of a published Neuron paper, usually with new data or analyses. Matters Arising submissions are initially evaluated by the editors to determine whether the primary concern brought forward is of significant impact and interest to the field and should be brought to the attention to the authors, reviewers, and potentially the larger community. Following editorial review, authors of the paper being questioned are given the opportunity to provide a written Response to the Matters Arising. Both this Response and the Matters Arising are peer reviewed. Based on the reviewers’ feedback and our editorial evaluation of the case, there is a range of potential outcomes, including not publishing the case; publishing the critique and response; correction of the original paper; or retraction of the paper. If a Matters Arising is published, all authors are typically given the opportunity to revise based on the reviewers’ feedback. Three external reviewers representing a subset of the original review panel of both Neuron manuscripts reviewed the Matters Arising and both Matters Arising Responses. In this case, the reviewers recommended publication of the manuscripts. The reviewers agree that with the data from the three labs in the Matters Arising, it is clear that the Piezo1-ASIC1 and TTN3 mechanically activated currents are dependent on endogenous Piezo1 in HEK293T cells. However, the reviewers also concur that given the caveats of the system as expressed in the Matters Arising Responses, it is not possible to unequivocally exclude that Piezo1-ASIC1 and TTN3 are mechanically activated channels. Future experiments will be necessary to define how endogenous Piezo1 in HEK293T influences the mechanically activated responses of Piezo1-ASIC1 and TTN3 and/or to test the mechanical activation in a reduced setting. With this in mind, as the Matters Arising and the Responses do not resolve the debate, we do not feel that a formal Retraction or Correction of the Zhao et al. or Hong et al. is warranted. However, because whole-cell recording of heterologous cells is considered the gold standard for this line of research and is not limited to the two Neuron papers in question, the reviewers and we, the editors at Neuron, feel that it is critical to air the concern and caveats highlighted by publishing the Matters Arising and the Matters Arising Responses.

Now, it is increasingly seen as a crop, to be grown in quantity and engineered for better traits—not just pharmacological effects, but also fiber content and the rapid, efficient growth that makes a plant useful for biofuels. This month, in a special issue of Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences , researchers delve into all aspects of cannabis biology and ecology. The work sheds light on how the plant has diversified since it was first grown 8500 years ago in Eurasia. As they play catch-up with this previously neglected crop, plant biologists are revealing the genetic basis of key traits, such as chemical content, and are figuring out how to make the most out of hemp for various purposes.

https://openalex.org/W2606335368,"AmyR is a stress and virulence associated protein from the plant pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae species Erwinia amylovora, and is a functionally conserved ortholog of YbjN from Escherichia coli. The crystal structure of E. amylovora AmyR reveals a class I type III secretion chaperone-like fold, despite the lack of sequence similarity between these two classes of protein and lacking any evidence of a secretion-associated role. The results indicate that AmyR, and YbjN proteins in general, function through protein-protein interactions without any enzymatic action. The YbjN proteins of Enterobacteriaceae show remarkably low sequence similarity with other members of the YbjN protein family in Eubacteria, yet a high level of structural conservation is observed. Across the YbjN protein family sequence conservation is limited to residues stabilising the protein core and dimerization interface, while interacting regions are only conserved between closely related species. This study presents the first structure of a YbjN protein from Enterobacteriaceae, the most highly divergent and well-studied subgroup of YbjN proteins, and an in-depth sequence and structural analysis of this important but poorly understood protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2607200844,"Current through the σ-pore was first detected in hKv1.3_V388C channels, where the V388C mutation in hKv1.3 channels opened a new pathway (σ-pore) behind the central α-pore. Typical for this mutant channel was inward current at potentials more negative than -100 mV when the central α-pore was closed. The α-pore blockers such as TEA+ and peptide toxins (CTX, MTX) could not reduce current through the σ-pore of hKv1.3_V388C channels. This new pathway would proceed in parallel to the α-pore in the S6-S6 interface gap. To see whether this phenomenon is restricted to hKv1.3 channels we mutated hKv1.2 at the homologue position (hKv1.2_V370C). By overexpression of hKv1.2_V370C mutant channels in COS-7 cells we could show typical σ-currents. The electrophysiological properties of the σ-pore in hKv1.3_V388C and hKv1.2_V370C mutant channels were similar. The σ-pore of hKv1.2_V370C channels was most permeable to Na+ and Li+ whereas Cl- and protons did not influence current through the σ-pore. Tetraethylammonium (TEA+), charybdotoxin (CTX) and maurotoxin (MTX), known α-pore blockers, could not reduce current through the σ-pore of hKv1.2_V370C channels. Taken together we conclude that the observation of σ-pore currents is not restricted to Kv1.3 potassium channels but can also be observed in a closely related potassium channel. This finding could have implications in the treatment of different ion channel diseases linked to mutations of the respective channels in regions close to homologue position investigated by us."

Now, researchers fear that the rock formation may be pulverized, along with its cargo of fossils, before scientists can pin down the creatures9 identity and what they may reveal about the evolution of animals. A massive phosphate mining operation in southern China could wipe out the entire site, including a wealth of as-yet-undiscovered fossils. Scientists are sounding the alarm, urging the Chinese government to step in to protect the rare fossils."
