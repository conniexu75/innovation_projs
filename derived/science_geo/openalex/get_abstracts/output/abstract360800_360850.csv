https://openalex.org/W2150626351,"The cellular heterogeneity of the brain confounds efforts to elucidate the biological properties of distinct neuronal populations. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice that express EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein L10a in defined cell populations, we have developed a methodology for affinity purification of polysomal mRNAs from genetically defined cell populations in the brain. The utility of this approach is illustrated by the comparative analysis of four types of neurons, revealing hundreds of genes that distinguish these four cell populations. We find that even two morphologically indistinguishable, intermixed subclasses of medium spiny neurons display vastly different translational profiles and present examples of the physiological significance of such differences. This genetically targeted translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methodology is a generalizable method useful for the identification of molecular changes in any genetically defined cell type in response to genetic alterations, disease, or pharmacological perturbations."

As demonstrated in the accompanying paper, translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) permits comprehensive studies of translated mRNAs in genetically defined cell populations after physiological perturbations. To establish the generality of this approach, we present translational profiles for 24 CNS cell populations and identify known cell-specific and enriched transcripts for each population. We report thousands of cell-specific mRNAs that were not detected in whole-tissue microarray studies and provide examples that demonstrate the benefits deriving from comparative analysis. To provide a foundation for further biological and in silico studies, we provide a resource of 16 transgenic mouse lines, their corresponding anatomic characterization, and translational profiles for cell types from a variety of central nervous system structures. This resource will enable a wide spectrum of molecular and mechanistic studies of both well-known and previously uncharacterized neural cell populations."

The functional significance of this widespread noncoding transcription is mostly unknown. We show that Arabidopsis RNA polymerase IVb/Pol V, a multisubunit nuclear enzyme required for siRNA-mediated gene silencing of transposons and other repeats, transcribes intergenic and noncoding sequences, thereby facilitating heterochromatin formation and silencing of overlapping and adjacent genes. Pol IVb/Pol V transcription requires the chromatin-remodeling protein DRD1 but is independent of siRNA biogenesis. However, Pol IVb/Pol V transcription and siRNA production are both required to silence transposons, suggesting that Pol IVb/Pol V generates RNAs or chromatin structures that serve as scaffolds for siRNA-mediated heterochromatin-forming complexes. Pol IVb/Pol V function provides a solution to a paradox of epigenetic control: the need for transcription in order to transcriptionally silence the same region."

Recently, oxidative stress has been implicated as one of the mechanisms whereby bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria. Here, we use systems-level approaches and phenotypic analyses to provide insight into the pathway whereby aminoglycosides ultimately trigger hydroxyl radical formation. We show, by disabling systems that facilitate membrane protein traffic, that mistranslation and misfolding of membrane proteins are central to aminoglycoside-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Signaling through the envelope stress-response two-component system is found to be a key player in this process, and the redox-responsive two-component system is shown to have an associated role. Additionally, we show that these two-component systems play a general role in bactericidal antibiotic-mediated oxidative stress and cell death, expanding our understanding of the common mechanism of killing induced by bactericidal antibiotics.

Aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin and gentamicin, are a powerful class of bactericidal antibiotics that target the 30S subunit of the ribosome (Davis, 1987Davis B.D. Mechanism of bactericidal action of aminoglycosides.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aminoglycoside family of antibiotics falls into the larger aminocyclitol group of 30S ribosome inhibitors, which also includes the bacteriostatic antibiotic spectinomycin. Protein mistranslation through tRNA mismatching is one of the hallmark phenotypes separating the bactericidal aminoglycosides from the other classes of ribosome inhibitors, including spectinomycin, which are bacteriostatic against Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Davis, 1987Davis B.D. Mechanism of bactericidal action of aminoglycosides.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weisblum and Davies, 1968Weisblum B. Davies J. Antibiotic inhibitors of the bacterial ribosome.Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 493-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other phenotypes associated with aminoglycoside uptake and lethality include changes in membrane potential and permeability (Bryan and Kwan, 1983Bryan L.E. Kwan S.

Bacterial uptake of aminoglycoside antibiotics.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 439-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lethal mode of action of aminoglycosides is thought to be due to either insertion of misread proteins into the inner membrane of E. coli (Bryan and Kwan, 1983Bryan L.E. Kwan S. Roles of ribosomal binding, membrane potential, and electron transport in bacterial uptake of streptomycin and gentamicin.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 23: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Davis et al., 1986Davis B.D. Chen L.L. Tai P.C.

USA. 1986; 83: 6164-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or irreversible uptake of aminoglycosides leading to complete inhibition of ribosome function (Davis, 1987Davis B.D. Mechanism of bactericidal action of aminoglycosides.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is still unclear how this latter proposed mechanism contributes to aminoglycoside-mediated killing (Vakulenko and Mobashery, 2003Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Versatility of aminoglycosides and prospects for their future.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 430-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the mechanism of aminoglycoside-induced lethality is a function of more than ribosome inhibition and may be due to inhibition of multiple cellular targets (Hancock, 1981Hancock R.E. Aminoglycoside uptake and mode of action-with special reference to streptomycin and gentamicin. II. Effects of aminoglycosides on cells.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1981; 8: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a correlation between abnormal protein synthesis, such as mistranslation, and protein carbonylation, a form of oxidative stress (Dukan et al., 2000Dukan S. Farewell A. Ballesteros M. Taddei F. Radman M. Nystrom T. Protein oxidation in response to increased transcriptional or translational errors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 5746-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have proposed that bactericidal antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, induce reactive oxygen species formation, which contributes to drug-mediated cell death (Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). In this proposed model, bactericidal antibiotics perturb metabolism and respiration, leading to increased superoxide production and release or exposure of ferrous iron, which interacts with endogenous hydrogen peroxide to form lethal hydroxyl radicals (Dwyer et al., 2007Dwyer D.J. Kohanski M.A. Hayete B. Collins J.J. Gyrase inhibitors induce an oxidative damage cellular death pathway in Escherichia coli.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The sequence of events following the initial drug-target interaction that generate an intracellular environment promoting hydroxyl radical formation remains unknown for the different classes of bactericidal antibiotics. In this study, we have elucidated the biological events following aminoglycoside interaction with the ribosome that lead to reactive oxygen species formation and contribute to cell death. Through systems-level approaches together with phenotypic and biochemical studies, we show that the protein translocation machinery and the Cpx envelope stress-response two-component system play important roles in oxidative stress-related cell death induced by aminoglycosides. We present evidence that the redox-responsive Arc two-component system is involved in this event, possibly via crosstalk between the Cpx and Arc two-component systems. Our results indicate that aminoglycoside-induced free radical formation is triggered by two-component stress-response system sensing of misfolded proteins in the membrane and periplasmic space, which shifts the cell into a state that stimulates and fuels oxygen radical generation and ultimately results in cell death. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the envelope stress-response and redox-responsive two-component systems are broadly involved in bactericidal antibiotic-mediated oxidative stress and cell death, providing additional insight into the common mechanism of killing induced by bactericidal antibiotics. We utilized gene expression microarrays and statistical analyses (see the Experimental Procedures) to compare gene expression profiles of wild-type (MG1655) E. coli treated with the aminoglycoside gentamicin to expression profiles after treatment with the bacteriostatic ribosome inhibitor spectinomycin (Table S1 available online). Statistically significant changes in expression (z score) were determined on a gene-by-gene basis by comparison of mean expression levels to a large (∼525) compendium of E. coli microarray data collected under a wide variety of conditions (see the Experimental Procedures). We then examined the relative changes in z score between bactericidal- and bacteriostatic-treated samples. This allowed us to separate gene expression changes related to aminoglycoside lethality and hydroxyl radical formation from aminoglycoside effects on cell growth. To identify networks related to aminoglycoside lethality, we filtered the set of significantly changing genes through an E. coli gene connectivity map generated using the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm (Faith et al., 2007Faith J.J. Hayete B. Thaden J.T. Mogno I. Wierzbowski J. Cottarel G. Kasif S. Collins J.J. Gardner T.S. Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Among the CLR-predicted connections, only those between genes that were significantly perturbed (on the basis of z score changes) and connections where one nonperturbed gene connected two significantly perturbed genes were maintained. This allowed us to extract groups of functionally related genes (Figure 1) and gave us greater ability to focus on specific pathways related to aminoglycoside mode of action. We also examined previously collected expression profiles (Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) after treatment with the aminoglycoside kanamycin and compared these to expression profiles after treatment with spectinomycin. Among the gene networks identified, there were six in common between gentamicin and kanamycin treatment (Figure 2 and Figure S1), and these networks were analyzed for pathway and transcription factor enrichment (see the Experimental Procedures) (Table S2). In addition to our gene expression analysis, we also utilized a high-throughput screen of an E. coli single-gene deletion library (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: The Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006.0008Crossref PubMed Scopus (4705) Google Scholar) treated with gentamicin (Table S3; see the Experimental Procedures) to identify potential gene targets with increased sensitivity to gentamicin (Table S4). The gene networks (Figure 2 and Figure S1) were further enriched with the growth data derived from the high-throughput screen of the E. coli single-gene deletion library.Figure 2CLR-Based Networks of Genes Whose Expression Changed Significantly Because of Gentamicin or Kanamycin TreatmentShow full captionIn this figure, upregulated gene expression is shown in green, downregulated gene expression is shown in yellow, and nonperturbed gene expression is shown in light blue.

(B) Network of genes showing pathway enrichment for the response to misfolded proteins (p = 1 × 10−17) and the heat shock sigma factor, σH (RpoH: p = 1.2 × 10−11). Among the networks related to aminoglycoside lethality, one (Figure 2A) showed enrichment (p < 10−11) for ArcA-regulated elements of the electron transport chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and respiration. ArcA is part of the Arc two-component system. In general, two-component systems, which take part in important bacterial processes such as the cell cycle and virulence (Hoch, 2000Hoch J.A. Two-component and phosphorelay signal transduction.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), consist of a sensor protein and a cognate transcription factor; the activity of the transcription factor is modulated by the sensor protein. The Arc two-component system consists of a quinone-sensitive sensor kinase, ArcB, which responds to the redox state of the cellular quinone pool by regulating the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor, ArcA (Georgellis et al., 2001Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Quinones as the redox signal for the arc two-component system of bacteria.Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Malpica et al., 2004Malpica R. Franco B. Rodriguez C. Kwon O. Georgellis D. Identification of a quinone-sensitive redox switch in the ArcB sensor kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 13318-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, ArcA activation leads to changes in expression of many genes involved in respiration and metabolism (Liu and De Wulf, 2004Liu X. De Wulf P. Probing the ArcA-P modulon of Escherichia coli by whole genome transcriptional analysis and sequence recognition profiling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12588-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that deletion of some of the TCA cycle genes in this metabolism-related network (Figure 2A) attenuate bactericidal antibiotic-mediated cell death (Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Many of these single-deletion knockouts exhibit increased growth in the presence of gentamicin (Figure 2A). In addition, we found, via qPCR, that the vast majority of ArcA-regulated TCA cycle genes tested exhibited a significant spike in gene expression within the first 30 min after exposure to gentamicin (Figure S2A). Importantly, the changes in expression among the genes in this ArcA-regulated metabolic gene network are consistent with the previously described roles of metabolism and respiration in bactericidal antibiotic-induced hydroxyl radical formation and cell death (Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Our systems-level analysis also highlighted a network related to protein mistranslation, which is one of the phenotypes specifically associated with the aminoglycoside family of ribosome inhibitors (Davis, 1987Davis B.D. Mechanism of bactericidal action of aminoglycosides.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weisblum and Davies, 1968Weisblum B. Davies J. Antibiotic inhibitors of the bacterial ribosome.Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 493-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This network (Figure 2B) showed significant enrichment for the response to misfolded proteins (p = 1 × 10−17) by proteases regulated by the heat shock sigma factor, σH (RpoH). These proteases were significantly upregulated in response to bactericidal aminoglycoside treatment (Figure 2B). This suggests that aminoglycoside-driven protein mistranslation and subsequent misfolding may be a necessary component required to drive lethal hydroxyl radical formation. In addition to a metabolic network and a protease network, the gentamicin and kanamycin treatments brought to light a large network of transport protein-related genes (p < 0.05) (Table S2). This network contains genes associated with electrochemical gradient-driven transport across the cell membrane, including genes involved in sugar and phosphate transport (Table S2). This transport-related network may reflect aminoglycoside-specific protein mistranslation and subsequent misfolding of membrane proteins, which would have a cumulative effect on the electrochemical potential and integrity of the membrane. On the basis of our expression analysis, we focused our attention on genes and pathways associated with fidelity of membrane proteins to determine whether these systems are functionally linked to aminoglycoside-induced oxidative stress and lethality. An analysis of our high-throughput growth screen (Table S3) revealed 11 single-gene knockouts exhibiting significant decreases in growth after gentamicin treatment (Table S4). Among these 11 genes, three of the gene products, HflK, HflC, and SecG, are involved in the regulation of membrane proteins, and two of the genes, hflK and hflC, show a significant increase in expression after aminoglycoside treatment (Tables S5 and S6). In E. coli, protein trafficking through the inner membrane occurs via multiple pathways, including the Sec and signal recognition particle (SRP) translocation systems. The Sec and SRP pathways utilize a chaperone-based system to shuttle immature proteins to the SecYEG translocase protein complex for transport across the inner membrane (Danese and Silhavy, 1998bDanese P.N.

Dislocation of membrane proteins in FtsH-mediated proteolysis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether translocation of mistranslated proteins across or into the inner membrane specifically enhances killing by aminoglycosides, we initially focused on three single-gene knockouts—ΔsecG, ΔhflK, and ΔhflC. We treated them with the mistranslation-inducing aminoglycoside gentamicin, the DNA gyrase inhibitor norfloxacin, the cell wall synthesis inhibitor ampicillin, and the bacteriostatic, mistranslation-free aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (see the Supplemental Data for results with spectinomycin), respectively. Additionally, we examined survival at both a clinically relevant level of gentamicin (5 μg/ml) and at a substantially higher concentration (15 μg/ml) (Zaske et al., 1982Zaske D.E. Cipolle R.J. Rotschafer J.C. Solem L.D. Mosier N.R. Strate R.G. Gentamicin pharmacokinetics in 1,640 patients: Method for control of serum concentrations.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ΔsecG, ΔhflK, and ΔhflC treated with 5 μg/ml gentamicin each exhibited a significant increase in both the rate of killing and overall cell death relative to wild-type E. coli treated with gentamicin (Figure 3A). In contrast, when these single-deletion strains were treated with 100 ng/ml norfloxacin (Figure 3B) or 3 μg/ml ampicillin (Figure 3C), cell killing was quite similar to that seen with the wild-type. This demonstrates that the increase in cell death observed in ΔsecG, ΔhflK, and ΔhflC is specific to the lethal mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Treatment of ΔsecG, ΔhflK, or ΔhflC with a higher concentration of gentamicin (15 μg/ml) significantly reduced the difference in viability between these strains and the wild-type (Figure S4). It is worth noting that the remainder of the single-gene deletions identified in Table S4 did not display increased efficacy of killing by gentamicin (Figures S5 and S6; see the Supplemental Data for further discussion). SecG has a known role in promoting efficient protein translocation (Matsumoto et al., 1998Matsumoto G. Mori H. Ito K. Roles of SecG in ATP- and SecA-dependent protein translocation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas the HflKC complex regulates FtsH, thereby affecting the degradation of membrane-associated proteins (Akiyama et al., 1996Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. FtsH (HflB) is an ATP-dependent protease selectively acting on SecY and some other membrane proteins.J. Biol.

Dislocation of membrane proteins in FtsH-mediated proteolysis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Changes to these SecG- or HflKC-regulated functions affect movement of mistranslated proteins across the membrane, which may account for the observed increase in cell death (Figure 3A) after aminoglycoside treatment of ΔhflK, ΔhflC, or ΔsecG; see the Supplemental Data for further discussion. We examined how these single-gene deletions affect hydroxyl radical formation and membrane depolarization to determine whether there is a relationship between these phenomena and an increase in translocation of mistranslated proteins across the inner membrane. Both radical formation (Kohanski et al., 2007Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J.

Consistent with the increase in killing efficacy and trafficking of mistranslated membrane proteins after aminoglycoside treatment, we found that there was significantly more hydroxyl radical formation [measured with the dye 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) (Setsukinai et al., 2003Setsukinai K. Urano Y. Kakinuma K. Majima H.J. Nagano T. Development of novel fluorescence probes that can reliably detect reactive oxygen species and distinguish specific species.J. Biol.

In addition, hydroxyl radical formation occurred by 1 hr after addition of gentamicin in these three mutants, compared to 2 hr in the wild-type (Figure 4A). If aminoglycoside-induced hydroxyl radical formation is in fact related to disruption of the electrochemical gradient because of improper trafficking of corrupt membrane proteins, the changes in membrane potential associated with aminoglycoside treatment should reflect changes in hydroxyl radical formation. We observed a gradual increase in membrane depolarization [measured with the dye DIBAC4(3), which differs from fluorescent intercalating dyes in that it can diffuse across depolarized yet intact cell membranes (Jepras et al., 1997Jepras R.I. Paul F.E. Pearson S.C. Wilkinson M.J. Rapid assessment of antibiotic effects on Escherichia coli by bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol and flow cytometry.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2001-2005PubMed Google Scholar)] in wild-type E. coli by 2 hr (Figure 4B), which was consistent with the onset of cell death (Figure 3A) and hydroxyl radical formation (Figure 4A). ΔhflK, ΔhflC, and ΔsecG all exhibited a significant increase in membrane depolarization by 1 hr (Figure 4B), which correlates with the significant increase in hydroxyl radical formation beyond wild-type levels (Figure 4A). The spikes in depolarization observed at 1 hr for ΔhflK, ΔhflC, and ΔsecG (Figure 4B) suggest a more complex role for membrane potential as related to membrane protein trafficking and the increases in cell death and radical formation. Our results with ΔsecG, ΔhflK, and ΔhflC point toward a relationship among aminoglycoside-induced changes in membrane protein translocation, membrane depolarization, and hydroxyl radical form"
https://openalex.org/W1999382756,"Osteoarthritis is a multifactorial disease characterized by destruction of the articular cartilage due to genetic, mechanical and environmental components affecting more than 100 million individuals all over the world. Despite the high prevalence of the disease, the absence of large-scale molecular studies limits our ability to understand the molecular pathobiology of osteoathritis and identify targets for drug development.In this study we integrated genetic, bioinformatic and proteomic approaches in order to identify new genes and their collaborative networks involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis. MicroRNA profiling of patient-derived osteoarthritic cartilage in comparison to normal cartilage, revealed a 16 microRNA osteoarthritis gene signature. Using reverse-phase protein arrays in the same tissues we detected 76 differentially expressed proteins between osteoarthritic and normal chondrocytes. Proteins such as SOX11, FGF23, KLF6, WWOX and GDF15 not implicated previously in the genesis of osteoarthritis were identified. Integration of microRNA and proteomic data with microRNA gene-target prediction algorithms, generated a potential ""interactome"" network consisting of 11 microRNAs and 58 proteins linked by 414 potential functional associations. Comparison of the molecular and clinical data, revealed specific microRNAs (miR-22, miR-103) and proteins (PPARA, BMP7, IL1B) to be highly correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI). Experimental validation revealed that miR-22 regulated PPARA and BMP7 expression and its inhibition blocked inflammatory and catabolic changes in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.Our findings indicate that obesity and inflammation are related to osteoarthritis, a metabolic disease affected by microRNA deregulation. Gene network approaches provide new insights for elucidating the complexity of diseases such as osteoarthritis. The integration of microRNA, proteomic and clinical data provides a detailed picture of how a network state is correlated with disease and furthermore leads to the development of new treatments. This strategy will help to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of multifactorial diseases such as osteoarthritis and provide possible novel therapeutic targets."

To functionally identify tumor suppressor genes relevant to human cancer, we compiled pools of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the mouse orthologs of genes recurrently deleted in a series of human hepatocellular carcinomas and tested their ability to promote tumorigenesis in a mosaic mouse model. In contrast to randomly selected shRNA pools, many deletion-specific pools accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Through further analysis, we identified and validated 13 tumor suppressor genes, 12 of which had not been linked to cancer before.

Our results establish the feasibility of in vivo RNAi screens and illustrate how combining cancer genomics, RNA interference, and mosaic mouse models can facilitate the functional annotation of the cancer genome. Diversity and complexity are hallmarks of cancer genomes. Even tumors arising from the same cell type or tissue harbor a range of genetic lesions that facilitate their uncontrolled expansion and eventual metastasis. As a consequence, the behavior of individual tumors—how they progress and ultimately respond to therapy—is heterogeneous and unpredictable. To date, many cancer genes have been identified, and through characterization of their action, new treatment strategies have been established. It follows that a further understanding of cancer genetics will improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Recent technological advances have greatly increased the resolution and depth at which cancer cell genomes can be examined, making it possible to envision the cataloging of every gene whose mutation or alteration occurs in human tumors (Velculescu, 2008Velculescu V.E. Defining the blueprint of the cancer genome.Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, regions of copy number alteration can be identified by high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH); in many cases, regions of chromosomal amplification harbor oncogenes, whereas deleted regions harbor tumor suppressor genes (Chin and Gray, 2008Chin L. Gray J.W. Translating insights from the cancer genome into clinical practice.Nature. 2008; 452: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, somatic point mutations potentially selected for during tumor evolution can be identified by high-throughput sequencing (Wood et al., 2007Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Jones S. Lin J. Sjoblom T. Leary R.J. Shen D. Boca S.M. Barber T. Ptak J. et al.The genomic landscapes of human breast and colorectal cancers.Science. 2007; 318: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, Greenman et al., 2007Greenman C. Stephens P.

Stevens C. et al.Patterns of somatic mutation in human cancer genomes.Nature. 2007; 446: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). However, owing to the inherent genomic instability of cancer cells, gene linkage, and spontaneous mutagenesis, cancers also contain somatically acquired “passenger” mutations that may not confer a selective advantage to the developing tumor. Moreover, some genes are haploinsufficient tumor suppressors, such that loss of even one allele can promote tumorigenesis—even without a corresponding mutation in the remaining wild-type allele—making it difficult to pinpoint relevant tumor suppressors in large deletions. Therefore, candidate genes identified through genomic approaches require functional validation before they are useful for clinical applications. Functional characterization of cancer genes is often tedious, and it is not always obvious which assays will reveal the putative oncogenic activity of relatively uncharacterized genes. Moreover, although cell culture systems are tractable, in vitro models do not recapitulate all features of the tumor microenvironment and so do not survey all relevant gene activities. Currently, a “gold-standard” approach for studying candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors involves the production of transgenic and knockout mice that contain germline alterations in the candidate oncogenic lesion (Van Dyke and Jacks, 2002Van Dyke T. Jacks T. Cancer modeling in the modern era: Progress and challenges.Cell. 2002; 108: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These strains have proven invaluable for validating cancer genes and create powerful models for subsequent studies. Nevertheless, their generation and analysis is time consuming and expensive. To facilitate a more rapid and cost-effective analysis of cancer gene action in vivo, we developed a “mosaic” mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (Zender et al., 2006Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.T. Luk J.M. Wigler M.

Weinmann A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Galle P.R. Genetics of hepatocellular carcinoma.World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). In our mouse model, hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with different oncogenic lesions can be rapidly produced by genetic manipulation of cultured embryonic liver progenitor cells (hepatoblasts) followed by their retransplantation into the livers of recipient mice (Zender et al., 2006Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.T. Luk J.M. Wigler M.

Generation and analysis of genetically defined liver carcinomas derived from bipotential liver progenitors.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have previously used this model to characterize the gene products contained in the 11q22 amplicon observed in human tumors and showed that both YAP1 and cIAP1 cooperate to promote tumorigenesis in particular genetic contexts (Zender et al., 2006Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.T. Luk J.M. Wigler M. Hannon G.J. et al.Identification and validation of oncogenes in liver cancer using an integrative oncogenomic approach.Cell. 2006; 125: 1253-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). To further accelerate the study of cancer genes in vivo, our laboratory has adapted stable RNA interference (RNAi) technology to downregulate tumor suppressor genes in mice (Hemann et al., 2003Hemann M.T. Fridman J.S. Zilfou J.T. Hernando E. Paddison P.J. Cordon-Cardo C. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. An epi-allelic series of p53 hypomorphs created by stable RNAi produces distinct tumor phenotypes in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We utilize microRNA-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAmir, hereafter referred to as shRNAs) that are potent triggers of the RNAi machinery and can efficiently suppress gene expression when expressed from a single genomic copy (Dickins et al., 2005Dickins R.A. Hemann M.T. Zilfou J.T. Simpson D.R. Ibarra I. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Probing tumor phenotypes using stable and regulated synthetic microRNA precursors.Nat.

Schlabach M.R. et al.Second-generation shRNA libraries covering the mouse and human genomes.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We previously used this technology in our mosaic mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma to show that stable knockdown of the p53 tumor suppressor by RNAi can mimic p53 gene loss in vivo (Zender et al., 2005Zender L. Xue W. Cordon-Cardo C. Hannon G.J. Lucito R. Powers S. Flemming P. Spector M.S. Lowe S.W. Generation and analysis of genetically defined liver carcinomas derived from bipotential liver progenitors.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that regulated RNAi can reversibly modulate endogenous p53 expression to implicate the role of p53 loss in tumor maintenance (Xue et al., 2007Xue W. Zender L. Miething C. Dickins R.A. Hernando E. Krizhanovsky V. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Senescence and tumour clearance is triggered by p53 restoration in murine liver carcinomas.Nature. 2007; 445: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). We also used similar approaches to rapidly validate Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) as a potent tumor suppressor gene (Xue et al., 2008Xue W. Krasnitz A. Lucito R. Sordella R. Vanaelst L. Cordon-Cardo C. Singer S. Kuehnel F. Wigler M. Powers S. et al.DLC1 is a chromosome 8p tumor suppressor whose loss promotes hepatocellular carcinoma.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to integrate cancer genomics, RNAi technology, and mouse models to rapidly discover and validate cancer genes. Our approach was based on the premise that genomic deletions occurring in human tumors should be enriched for tumor suppressor genes. We therefore produced a focused shRNA library targeting the mouse orthologs of genes deleted in human hepatocelluar carcinoma and screened this for shRNAs that would promote tumorigenesis in our mosaic model of HCC. Our approach proved to be highly effective, resulting in the functional validation of 13 tumor suppressor genes. In addition to identifying new genes and pathways relevant to liver cancer and other tumor types, our study provides one blueprint for functionally annotating the cancer genome. Tumor suppressor gene inactivation is often due to homozygous or hemizygous chromosomal deletions. To identify genomic regions potentially containing tumor suppressor genes, we analyzed approximately 100 human hepatocellular carcinomas of different etiologies (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or ethyltoxic liver cirrhosis) for DNA copy number alterations using representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA), a high-resolution array-based CGH platform (Lucito et al., 2003Lucito R. Healy J. Alexander J. Reiner A. Esposito D. Chi M. Rodgers L. Brady A. Sebat J. Troge J. et al.Representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis: A high-resolution method to detect genome copy number variation.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2291-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Raw data were converted into segmented profiles (Hicks et al., 2006Hicks J. Krasnitz A. Lakshmi B. Navin N.E. Riggs M. Leibu E. Esposito D. Alexander J. Troge J. Grubor V. et al.Novel patterns of genome rearrangement and their association with survival in breast cancer.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1465-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and segments that showed significant decrease from the ground state were identified (Figure 1A). We then computationally estimated genetic events so that a homozygous deletion within a heterozygous deletion would be scored as two deletion events rather than one (A.K., J.H., and M.W., unpublished data) and plotted the resulting deletion event frequency across the entire genome (Figure 1B). Among the many deletions detected, only a fraction were less then 5MB. We hypothesized that these focal deletions were most likely to be enriched for tumor suppressor genes. To develop an initial gene list for further studies, we identified all of the genes embedded in recurrent focal deletions or in unique focal deletions whose gene content was also contained in broader deletions that were recurrent. On the basis of these criteria, we identified 58 deletions ranging in size from 98 kb to 2.6 Mb, containing 1 to 46 genes, respectively (see, for example, Figure 1C). Of the 362 annotated genes identified in total (Table S1 available online, see red circles in Figure 1B), we were able to bioinformatically identify 301 mouse orthologs. We next obtained all 631 of the mir30-based shRNAs from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory RNAi CODEX library. Thus, on average, each deleted gene was represented by approximately 2 murine shRNAs (see workflow in Figure S1A). We recently developed a “mosaic” mouse model in which liver carcinomas can be rapidly produced by genetic manipulation of liver progenitor cells followed by their retransplantation into recipient mice (Zender et al., 2006Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.T. Luk J.M. Wigler M. Hannon G.J. et al.Identification and validation of oncogenes in liver cancer using an integrative oncogenomic approach.Cell. 2006; 125: 1253-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Since systemic delivery of RNAi currently does not enable efficient and stable knockdown of genes in tissues, we decided to introduce pools of shRNAs into premalignant progenitor cells and select for those that promote tumor formation after transplantation. We previously generated immortalized lines of embryonic hepatocytes lacking p53 and overexpressing Myc that were not tumorigenic in vivo (Zender et al., 2005Zender L. Xue W. Cordon-Cardo C. Hannon G.J. Lucito R. Powers S. Flemming P. Spector M.S. Lowe S.W. Generation and analysis of genetically defined liver carcinomas derived from bipotential liver progenitors.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); since over 40% of all human HCCs are overexpressing MYC and many harbor p53 mutations or deletions (Teufel et al., 2007Teufel A. Staib F. Kanzler S. Weinmann A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Galle P.R. Genetics of hepatocellular carcinoma.World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that these cells would provide a “sensitized” background where a single additional lesion might trigger tumorigenesis (Figure 2A). We hypothesized that shRNAs targeting negative regulators of WNT signaling would provide positive controls to model or “reconstruct” our screen, as this pathway is deregulated in a significant percentage (30%–40%) of human hepatocellular carcinomas because of activating mutations in β-catenin or inactivating mutations or promoter hypermethylation of the AXIN and APC tumor suppressors (Teufel et al., 2007Teufel A. Staib F. Kanzler S. Weinmann A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Galle P.R. Genetics of hepatocellular carcinoma.World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore introduced mir30-design shRNAs targeting Axin or Apc into p53−/−;Myc hepatocytes and transplanted the resulting cell populations subcutaneously into nude mice or into the liver by intrasplenic injection (Zender et al., 2005Zender L. Xue W. Cordon-Cardo C. Hannon G.J. Lucito R. Powers S. Flemming P. Spector M.S. Lowe S.W. Generation and analysis of genetically defined liver carcinomas derived from bipotential liver progenitors.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Of note, all of the shRNAs used in this study were cloned into pLMS, a vector optimized for in vivo use, which coexpresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Dickins et al., 2005Dickins R.A. Hemann M.T. Zilfou J.T. Simpson D.R. Ibarra I. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Probing tumor phenotypes using stable and regulated synthetic microRNA precursors.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Myc transgene coexpresses a luciferase reporter to facilitate monitoring of tumors with bioluminescence. Although a negative control shRNA (targeting human RB1 but not mouse) did not trigger tumor growth, the positive control shRNAs targeting Axin or Apc gave rise to tumors within 1–2 months both subcutaneously and in situ (Figures 2A–2D). The resulting tumors were classified as aggressive solid, sometimes pseudoglandular, hepatocellular carcinomas (Figure 2D, top panel). They also displayed high levels of nuclear β-catenin by immunohistochemistry, indicating that the shRNAs were deregulating the predicted biochemical pathway (Figure 2D, bottom panel). In order to determine the complexity of shRNA pools that could be screened, we tested one Apc shRNA for its ability to accelerate tumorigenesis when diluted 1:10 to 1:100. In addition, we tested a pool of 48 shRNAs targeting various murine genes that also contained two distinct Apc shRNAs. In both situations, the diluted shRNAs produced tumors rapidly, albeit with a delay relative to the pure Apc shRNA (Figure 2E). Moreover, sequencing of PCR-amplified shRNAs obtained from tumors triggered by the shRNA pool indicated that the two Apc shRNAs were enriched during tumor expansion, comprising the majority of shRNAs present in the resulting tumors (data not shown). Thus, pools of 48 shRNAs can be readily screened to identify those with tumor promoting activities similar to an Apc shRNA. Although 1:100 dilutions still enhanced tumor growth (data not shown), we concluded that screening of low complexity pools was feasible and would maximize our chances of identifying weaker shRNAs that might otherwise be outcompeted by stronger ones in more complex pools. To screen our shRNA library targeting deletion-associated genes, we pooled individual shRNAs randomly into pools of 48 and transferred them in bulk into pLMS (see also Figure S1B). Selected shRNA library pools were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm that clone representation was maintained (data not shown). As controls, we also produced 10 pools of randomly selected shRNAs from the mouse CODEX RNAi library (i.e., not based on genomic location). Each pool, in parallel with a negative shRNA control, was introduced into p53−/−;Myc hepatocytes at a low multiplicity of infection and the resulting cell populations were transplanted subcutaneously into both flanks of four immunocompromised mice. Animals were subsequently monitored for tumor development. The results of these experiments were striking: while mice injected with cells transduced with randomly produced shRNA pools did not develop tumors over background (Figure 3A and Figure S2A), most mice transplanted with cells harboring the deletion-focused shRNA pools developed tumors, some within 3–4 weeks (Figure 3B and Figure S2B). Many tumors appeared to be multifocal and all were GFP positive, indicating that the tumor cells expressed at least one shRNA. These observations validate our enrichment strategy and suggest that deletion-focused shRNA libraries are enriched for tumor promoting shRNAs. To identify shRNAs present in tumors, we isolated genomic DNA from GFP-positive tumor nodules, PCR amplified the integrated shRNAs, and cloned them into a recipient vector that could also be used for subsequent validation (Figure 3C). As a cutoff criterion for further studies, we chose to isolate shRNAs from tumors that were relatively large and derived from pools that efficiently accelerated tumorigenesis (average tumor volume ≥ 0.1cm3 and ≥ 50% take rate). None of the random shRNA pools fit these two criteria (Figures S2C and S2D). The resulting plasmid pools were then sequenced to determine the representation of particular shRNAs (96 sequence reads per tumor, more than three tumors per pool). In most cases, more than one shRNA was identified from each tumor nodule, suggesting that the tumors were multiclonal. Interestingly, independent shRNAs targeting Pten were highly enriched in tumors produced from cells transduced with two different shRNA pools (Figure 3D). By comparing the relative representation of each Pten shRNA to that in the initial pool, we noted that Pten.932 (HP_524) was enriched from 3% to 41% during tumor expansion (Figure 3D, upper panel), whereas Pten.5331 (HP_465354) went from 1% to 67% of the total sequence reads (Figure 3D, lower panel). Immunoblotting revealed that both shRNAs suppressed Pten and increased Akt phosphorylation (Figure 3G), indicating that they were biologically active. Interestingly, although shRNA Pten.932 was more potent than shRNA Pten.5331 in the preinjected cell population, the resulting tumors showed comparable levels of Pten knockdown and p-Akt (Figure 3G). Apparently, cells with optimal knockdown are selected from polyclonal populations during tumor expansion. PTEN is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in many tumor types (Tokunaga et al., 2008Tokunaga E. Oki E. Egashira A. Sadanaga N. Morita M. Kakeji Y. Maehara Y. Deregulation of the Akt pathway in human cancer.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2008; 8: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and whose deletion promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in mice (Horie et al., 2004Horie Y. Suzuki A. Kataoka E. Sasaki T. Hamada K. Sasaki J. Mizuno K. Hasegawa G. Kishimoto H. Iizuka M. et al.Hepatocyte-specific Pten deficiency results in steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1774-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we identified several HCCs with either focal or broad chromosome 10 deletions encompassing PTEN (Figure 3E). To confirm that suppression of Pten is oncogenic in our model, we retested the recovered Pten shRNAs by introducing them into p53−/−;Myc hepatocytes and testing their ability to form tumors after subcutaneous or intrasplenic injection. In both contexts, Pten knockdown rapidly triggered tumor growth (Figure 3F and Figure S3), thus validating our screening strategy and providing a blueprint for testing shRNAs targeting less characterized genes. Next, we systematically determined the representation of shRNAs contained within all 31 tumors (derived from seven shRNA pools) that showed accelerated tumor growth (Figure 3B; Table S2). From a total of 2307 sequence reads, we identified 36 shRNAs that were enriched at least 2.5-fold over the predicted representation in the initial plasmid pool (∼2% of total). For example, the two validated Pten shRNAs ranked the 5th and 16th, respectively, among the most enriched shRNAs (Table S3). Besides Pten, we selected 16 shRNAs targeting 14 different genes for validation (Figures 4A and 4B, Table S3). These included all shRNAs that were the most abundant in at least two tumors (targeting Xpo4, Armcx2, Nrsn2, Zbbx), all shRNAs for which a second shRNA against the same gene was recovered (targeting Fgf6, Set, Fstl5), and a group of seven additional shRNAs that were also highly enriched (targeting Wdr49, Wdr37, Armcx1, Gjd4, Glo1, Ddx20, Btbd9). Interestingly, although one candidate target gene, SET (histone chaperone and/or protein phosphatase inhibitor), is associated with a rare translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (von Lindern et al., 1992von Lindern M. Fornerod M. Soekarman N. van Baal S. Jaegle M. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Grosveld G. Translocation t(6;9) in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia results in the formation of a DEK-CAN fusion gene.Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1992; 5: 857-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), none of the other genes previously have been linked to cancer. Nevertheless, their deletion in a subset of human tumors suggests each could be a relevant tumor suppressor (Figure 4B). All 16 shRNAs were individually retested with the same experimental setup employed in the initial screen. A validated Pten shRNA (Pten.5331) was used as a positive control. Many of the candidate shRNAs triggered tumor growth above background, with those targeting Xpo4 (nuclear export protein), Ddx20 (GEMIN3, RNA helicase), Gjd4 (CX40.1, putative gap junction protein), Fstl5 (Follistatin-like 5), and Nrsn2 (Neurensin 2) showing the most prominent acceleration of tumor growth (Figure 4C). Since our control shRNA never accelerated tumorigenesis, insertional mutagenesis was not solely responsible for the biological effects of our candidate shRNAs—presumably, suppression of the targeted gene was required. To rule out the possibility that individual shRNAs might promote tumorigenesis through off-target effects, we generated additional shRNAs against each candidate gene and tested them for their ability to promote hepatocarcinoma development in situ. p53−/−;Myc liver progenitor cells were transduced with each shRNA, and knockdown of the predicted target gene was confirmed by immunoblotting or quantitative RT-Q-PCR (Figure S4). The resulting cell populations were transplanted into the livers of mice by intrasplenic injection, and recipients were monitored for tumor formation with bioluminescence imaging. At least three independent shRNAs targeting each candidate accelerated tumorigenesis (Figure 4D, see also Figures S5 and S6). Similar results were obtained with independent populations of p53−/−;Myc liver progenitor cells (Figure S7). Therefore, genes identified through our in vivo RNAi screen are bona fide tumor suppressors in mice. The shRNA that was most enriched in our screen targets Xpo4 (Table S3). Exportin 4 belongs to the importin-β family of nuclear transporters and has two known substrates—SMAD3 and EIF5A (Figure 5A; see also Lipowsky et al., 2000Lipowsky G. Bischoff F.R. Schwarzmaier P. Kraft R. Kostka S. Hartmann E. Kutay U. Görlich D.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SMAD3 is an effector of TGF-β signaling that can have pro- or antioncogenic effects depending on context but whose activation is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma progression (Teufel et al., 2007Teufel A. Staib F. Kanzler S. Weinmann A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Galle P.R. Genetics of hepatocellular carcinoma.World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). In response to TGF-β, SMAD3 becomes phosphorylated and shuttles to the nucleus, where it forms complexes with coactivators that transactivate TGF-β target genes (Massagué, 2000Massagué J. How cells read TGF-beta signals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). As predicted, murine hepatoma cells expressing Xpo4 shRNAs showed an increase in nuclear total and phospho-Smad3 (Figure S8A), which correlated with an increase in the levels of the TGF-β target genes Jun, Col7a1, Timp1, and p15 (Figure S8B). Although it is straightforward to conceptualize how XPO4 might influence tumorigenesis by modulating SMAD3 function, its biological action on EIF5A is not clear. EIF5A was identified as a eukaryotic translation initiation factor and, in mammals, is encoded by two highly related genes (EIF5A1 and EIF5A2). Although in vitro studies suggest that EIF5A stimulates the formation of the first peptide bond during protein synthesis (Benne and Hershey, 1978Benne R. Hershey J.W. The mechanism of action of protein synthesis initiation factors from rabbit reticulocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may also influence nucleocytoplasmatic transport of mRNA and/or mRNA stability (Caraglia et al., 2001Caraglia M. Marra M. Giuberti G. D'Alessandro A.M. Budillon A. Del Prete S. Lentini A. Beninati S. Abbruzzese A. The role of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis.Amino Acids. 2001; 20: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As was observed for Smad3, knockdown of Xpo4 in murine hepatoma cells led to nuclear accumulation of Eif5a1 and Eif5a2 (Figures 5B and 5C), suggesting that Xpo4 may also modulate Eif5a activity. Interestingly, Xpo4 shRNAs enhanced the pro"

However, the role of telomerase in organismal aging has remained unaddressed, in part because of the cancer-promoting activity of telomerase. To circumvent this problem, we have constitutively expressed telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), one of the components of telomerase, in mice engineered to be cancer resistant by means of enhanced expression of the tumor suppressors p53, p16, and p19ARF. In this context, TERT overexpression improves the fitness of epithelial barriers, particularly the skin and the intestine, and produces a systemic delay in aging accompanied by extension of the median life span. These results demonstrate that constitutive expression of Tert provides antiaging activity in the context of a mammalian organism.

These results demonstrate that constitutive expression of Tert provides antiaging activity in the context of a mammalian organism. Aging is a multifactorial process that has been adjusted by nature to a wide spectrum of life spans, even in closely related species, thus suggesting that aging is a flexible trait susceptible to the influence of a number of molecular pathways (Brown-Borg et al., 1996Brown-Borg H.M. Borg K.E. Meliska C.J. Bartke A. Dwarf mice and the ageing process.Nature. 1996; 384: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, Haigis and Guarente, 2006Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P.

The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). One such process is the progressive attrition of telomeres that occurs in association with organismal aging in humans (Harley et al., 1990Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Telomeres shorten during ageing of human fibroblasts.Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4389) Google Scholar) and in other mammals, such as mice (Flores et al., 2008Flores I. Canela A. Vera E. Tejera A. Cotsarelis G. Blasco M.A. The longest telomeres: a general signature of adult stem cell compartments.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 654-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that have a role in protecting the chromosome ends from DNA repair and degrading activities (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Mammalian telomeres consist of TTAGGG repeats bound by a multiprotein complex known as shelterin (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). A minimum length of TTAGGG repeats and the integrity of the shelterin complex are necessary for telomere protection (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a cellular reverse transcriptase (TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase) capable of compensating telomere attrition through de novo addition of TTAGGG repeats onto the chromosome ends by using an associated RNA component as template (Terc, telomerase RNA component) (Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts.Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). Telomerase is expressed in most adult stem cell compartments; however, this is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, as evidenced by the fact that telomere shortening occurs with age in most human and mouse tissues (Harley et al., 1990Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Telomeres shorten during ageing of human fibroblasts.Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4389) Google Scholar, Blasco, 2007Blasco M.A. Telomere length, stem cells and aging.Nat. Chem.

Blasco M.A. The longest telomeres: a general signature of adult stem cell compartments.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 654-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some diseases characterized by premature loss of tissue renewal and premature death, such as dyskeratosis congenita, anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are linked to germline mutations in Tert and Terc genes, which result in decreased telomerase activity and accelerated telomere shortening (Mitchell et al., 1999Mitchell J.R.

Telomerase mutations in families with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). A role for telomerase in tissue renewal and organismal life span is also supported by telomerase-deficient (Terc−/−) mice (Blasco et al., 1997Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Telomere shortening and tumor formation by mouse cells lacking telomerase RNA.Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Longevity is progressively shortened upon successive intercrossing of telomerase-deficient mice (Blasco, 2005Blasco M.A. Telomeres and human disease: ageing, cancer and beyond. Nat. Rev. Genet.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), an effect already noticeable at the first generation of Terc null mice where both the median and maximum life span are reduced (Garcia-Cao et al., 2006Garcia-Cao I. Garcia-Cao M. Tomas-Loba A. Martin-Caballero J. Flores J.M. Klatt P. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Increased p53 activity does not accelerate telomere-driven ageing.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 546-552PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, telomerase overexpression is sufficient to extend the life span of most human cells in culture (Bodnar et al., 1998Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Extension of life-span by introduction of telomerase into normal human cells.Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar). Together, the evidence strongly suggests that telomerase activity and telomere length are rate limiting for mammalian life span and supports a model in which short telomeres actively contribute to aging by limiting tissue renewal. An important prediction of this model is that slowing the rate of telomere shortening should delay aging. However, to address experimentally this prediction, it is necessary to take into account the role of telomere biology in cancer. Telomere shortening is an important barrier for the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells (Feldser and Greider, 2007Feldser D.M. Greider C.W. Short telomeres limit tumor progression in vivo by inducing senescence.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 461-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, Blasco, 2005Blasco M.A. Telomeres and human disease: ageing, cancer and beyond. Nat. Rev. Genet.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In this context, it is not surprising that constitutive telomerase expression in several independent Tert-transgenic mouse models resulted in increased incidence of spontaneous tumors (González-Suárez et al., 2001González-Suárez E. Samper E. Ramirez A. Flores J.M. Martin-Caballero J. Jorcano J.L.

Biol. 2004; 24: 4275-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, in normal laboratory mice, the advantageous impact of telomerase on cancer cells obscures the potentially beneficial effects of telomerase in the context of normal cells and tissues; for this reason, we have resorted to cancer-resistant mice previously generated by us (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002Garcia-Cao I. Garcia-Cao M. Martin-Caballero J. Criado L.M. Klatt P. Flores J.M. Weill J.C.

Delayed aging through damage protection by the Arf/p53 pathway.Nature. 2007; 448: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In particular, by transgenesis using large, nonmanipulated, genomic segments, we have generated mice carrying a single transgenic copy of p53 or a single transgenic copy of the locus encoding Arf and p16 (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002Garcia-Cao I. Garcia-Cao M. Martin-Caballero J. Criado L.M. Klatt P. Flores J.M. Weill J.C. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. “Super p53” mice exhibit enhanced DNA damage response, are tumor resistant and age normally.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6225-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, Matheu et al., 2004Matheu A.

Increased gene dosage of Ink4a/Arf results in cancer resistance and normal aging.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These three tumor suppressors are involved in protection against a large variety of cancers (Collado et al., 2007Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cellular senescence in cancer and aging.Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned transgenic mice, which we call super-p53 (Sp53) or super-p16/Arf (Sp16/SArf), possess three gene doses of each of the indicated tumor suppressors instead of the normal diploid gene dose; this increase in tumor suppression activity is sufficient to significantly increase cancer resistance (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002Garcia-Cao I. Garcia-Cao M. Martin-Caballero J. Criado L.M. Klatt P. Flores J.M. Weill J.C. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. “Super p53” mice exhibit enhanced DNA damage response, are tumor resistant and age normally.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6225-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, Matheu et al., 2004Matheu A.

Increased gene dosage of Ink4a/Arf results in cancer resistance and normal aging.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Of relevance, single transgenic Sp53 or Sp16/SArf mice have a normal aging and life span (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002Garcia-Cao I. Garcia-Cao M. Martin-Caballero J. Criado L.M. Klatt P. Flores J.M. Weill J.C.

Increased gene dosage of Ink4a/Arf results in cancer resistance and normal aging.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but the combination of both transgenes in doubly transgenic Sp53/Sp16/SArf mice results in delayed aging, probably because of the ability of these tumor suppressors to eliminate cellular damage and damaged cells (Matheu et al., 2007Matheu A. Maraver A. Klatt P. Flores I. Garcia-Cao I. Borras C. Flores J.M. Viña J. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Delayed aging through damage protection by the Arf/p53 pathway.Nature. 2007; 448: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Here, we address the role of telomerase in mouse fitness and aging by generating Tert-transgenic mice in a tumor-resistant genetic background, in an effort to dissociate the effects of telomerase on cancer and aging. In this context, we demonstrate that Tert overexpression has antiaging activity. Mice that constitutively express the telomerase Tert gene in the stem and proliferative compartments of a wide range of epithelial tissues (K5-Tert mice, González-Suárez et al., 2001González-Suárez E.

The resulting Tert-transgenic mice with increased tumor resistance were named Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice. TgTert tissues show ≤10-fold increase in telomerase activity compared to wild-type tissues (González-Suárez et al., 2001González-Suárez E. Samper E. Ramirez A. Flores J.M. Martin-Caballero J.

Blasco M.A. Genetic analysis of Myc and telomerase interactions in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6130-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TgTert-associated phenotypes include increased wound healing, improved epidermal stem cell mobilization/proliferation, and increased tumorigenesis (González-Suárez et al., 2001González-Suárez E.

Blasco M.A. Genetic analysis of Myc and telomerase interactions in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6130-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These effects of Tert overexpression are noticeable already at young ages and require the telomerase Terc component (Flores et al., 2005Flores I. Cayuela M.L. Blasco M.A. Effects of telomerase and telomere length on epidermal stem cell behavior.Science. 2005; 309: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, Flores et al., 2006Flores I. Evan G.

Nevertheless, it is relevant to note that other authors have suggested additional roles of Tert overexpression on stem cell proliferation, which are independent of telomerase activity (Sarin et al., 2005Sarin K.Y. Cheung P. Gilison D. Lee E. Tennen R.I. Wang E. Artandi M.K. Oro A.E. Artandi S.E. Conditional telomerase induction causes proliferation of hair follicle stem cells.Nature. 2005; 436: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and could also have a positive impact on aging and longevity. We used a single set of parental mice (TgTert × Sp53/Sp16/SArf) to obtain two pairs of cancer-resistant strains—namely, Sp53 and Sp53/TgTert strains, and Sp53/Sp16/SArf and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert strains (see Experimental Procedures). We first analyzed whether the tumorigenic effects of the Tert transgene (Figure 1A) had been canceled in the Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf backgrounds. Importantly, both the incidence and time of onset of malignant tumors (lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas) did not differ significantly between Sp53 and Sp53/TgTert cohorts, or between Sp53/Sp16/SArf and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice (Figure 1A), thus indicating that the tumorigenic effects of TgTert have been effectively canceled in these backgrounds. Degenerative inflammatory pathologies of the skin (dermatitis) and of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (gastritis, enteritis, and peritonitis) are common in aged mice and are often associated with increased susceptibility to pathogens or external antigens. Analysis of these lesions in aged mice indicated that TgTert-expressing mice have a decreased incidence of degenerative inflammatory pathologies in both cancer-resistant contexts (Sp53 background and Sp53/Sp16/SArf background; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08, respectively; Figure 1B). Although a direct effect of Tert expression on the long-term function of the immune system cannot be dismissed, these results also suggest that telomerase may contribute to a more robust maintenance of the skin and GI epithelia. To further support this, we analyzed morphological criteria of aging in these tissues. The thinning of the subcutaneous adipose layer is a known aging-associated morphological feature, which, in turn, is associated with increased risk of skin injuries and infections. Aged Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice showed a better preservation of both the thickness of the epidermis and of the subcutaneous fat layer compared to their corresponding Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 for all comparisons; Figures 1C and 1E). Similarly, we also detected a better preservation of the GI tract epithelia (length of the villi) in the TgTert-expressing genotypes at old age compared with their non-TgTert controls (p < 0.001 for both comparisons; Figure 1F). To address whether these mice had an improved epithelial barrier function in the GI tract, we treated mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), a well-established inducer of intestinal ulcers (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004Rakoff-Nahoum S. Paglino J. Eslami-Varzaneh F. Edberg S. Medzhitov R. Recognition of commensal microflora by toll-like receptors is required for intestinal homeostasis.Cell. 2004; 118: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3033) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice were more resistant to DSS than were wild-type and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls, as indicated by decreased intestinal bleeding and a lower number and grade of ulcers following DSS treatment (Figures 2A–2D) (Experimental Procedures). A similar protective effect of TgTert was observed when Sp53/TgTert mice were compared to Sp53 mice (Figures 2A–2D). Finally, the onset of a large variety of age-related pathologies, mostly atrophies and inflammatory processes, was also significantly delayed in Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice, compared with the Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 in both cases; see Figure S1 and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). Altogether, these results indicate that, in two independent cancer-resistant backgrounds (Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf mice), TgTert expression provides improved fitness to epithelial barriers and protection against aging-associated degenerative and inflammatory processes. Antiaging manipulations targeted at a single tissue can result in systemic antiaging effects, as illustrated by mice lacking the insulin receptor exclusively in the adipose tissue and showing an extended longevity (Blüher et al., 2003Blüher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Extended longevity in mice lacking the insulin receptor in adipose tissue.Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), or by systemic antiaging effects mediated by soluble factors in the blood (Conboy et al., 2005Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Wagers A.J. Girma E.R. Weissman I.L. Rando T.A. Rejuvenation of aged progenitor cells by exposure to a young systemic environment.Nature. 2005; 433: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we wondered whether targeted Tert expression to epithelial tissues, as performed here, in cancer-resistant mice also had systemic antiaging effects. To this end, we analyzed various additional well-established biomarkers of aging, such as the progressive loss of neuromuscular coordination (Ingram and Reynolds, 1986Ingram D.K. Reynolds M.A. Assessing the predictive validity of psychomotor tests as measures of biological age in mice.Exp. Aging Res. 1986; 12: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which can be measured with the so-called tightrope test (see Experimental Procedures). Interestingly, tightrope test performance was significantly improved in Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice at ≥1 years of age, compared with age-matched wild-type and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 for both comparisons; Figures 3A and 3B), and the contribution of TgTert was also significant in the Sp53/TgTert mouse cohort, compared with both wild-type and Sp53 controls (p ≤ 0.04; Figures 3A and 3B). Metabolic disorders, such as glucose intolerance, have been also associated with aging (Goren et al., 2004Goren H.J. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Glucose homeostasis and tissue transcript content of insulin signaling intermediates in four inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6, C57BLKS/6, DBA/2, and 129X1.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3307-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice showed a significantly improved glucose tolerance, compared with the other genotypes, as indicated by a better glucose uptake following glucose injection (p < 0.05 in both cases, Figure 3C; see Figure S2 for complete glucose curves). Finally, using metabolic cages, we observed no gross differences in food or water intake, or in feces and urine output, between the different genotypes (see Experimental Procedures) (Figure S3). In addition, body weights were similar in both males and females at young and old ages in the different mouse cohorts (Figure S4), in agreement with the fact that these mice were not calorie restricted and had ad libitum access to food. Although lifelong exposure to low IGF1 extends life span (Brown-Borg et al., 1996Brown-Borg H.M. Borg K.E. Meliska C.J. Bartke A. Dwarf mice and the ageing process.Nature. 1996; 384: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, Murphy et al., 2003Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C. Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2003; 424: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar), it is also known that IGF1 levels decrease with aging (Hammerman, 1987Hammerman M.R. Insulin-like growth factors and aging.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1987; 16: 995-1011PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some mouse models of premature aging present an accelerated decrease in IGF1 (Niedernhofer et al., 2006Niedernhofer L.J. Garinis G.A. Raams A. Lalai A.S. Robinson A.R. Appeldoorn E. Odijk H. Oostendorp R. Ahmad A. van Leeuwen W. et al.A new progeroid syndrome reveals that genotoxic stress suppresses the somatotroph axis.Nature. 2006; 444: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), suggesting that decreased IGF1 signaling in aged mice could be secondary to organismal decay. Interestingly, old Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice showed significantly higher serum IGF1 levels compared with age-matched wild-type and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p = 0.02 in both cases; Figure 4); similar differences were observed in young mice from both Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert genotypes (Figure 4A). These observations suggest that the delayed aging of these mice is not the consequence of decreased serum IGF1 levels. High serum IGF1 levels in Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice may explain their improved glucose uptake and their improved neuromuscular coordination, because IGF1 has been described to act as a insulin mimetic (Yuen and Dunger, 2007Yuen K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2152249282,"The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has emerged as an archetype of eukaryotic cell biology. Here we show that S. cerevisiae is also a model for the evolution of cooperative behavior by revisiting flocculation, a self-adherence phenotype lacking in most laboratory strains. Expression of the gene FLO1 in the laboratory strain S288C restores flocculation, an altered physiological state, reminiscent of bacterial biofilms. Flocculation protects the FLO1 expressing cells from multiple stresses, including antimicrobials and ethanol. Furthermore, FLO1(+) cells avoid exploitation by nonexpressing flo1 cells by self/non-self recognition: FLO1(+) cells preferentially stick to one another, regardless of genetic relatedness across the rest of the genome. Flocculation, therefore, is driven by one of a few known ""green beard genes,"" which direct cooperation toward other carriers of the same gene. Moreover, FLO1 is highly variable among strains both in expression and in sequence, suggesting that flocculation in S. cerevisiae is a dynamic, rapidly evolving social trait."

https://openalex.org/W2156393136,"Many immune system receptors signal through cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motifs (ITAMs), but how receptor ligation results in ITAM phosphorylation remains unknown. Live-cell imaging studies showed a close interaction of the CD3epsilon cytoplasmic domain of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the plasma membrane through fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a C-terminal fluorescent protein and a membrane fluorophore. Electrostatic interactions between basic CD3epsilon residues and acidic phospholipids enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane were required for binding. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the lipid-bound state of this cytoplasmic domain revealed deep insertion of the two key tyrosines into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Receptor ligation thus needs to result in unbinding of the CD3epsilon ITAM from the membrane to render these tyrosines accessible to Src kinases. Sequestration of key tyrosines into the lipid bilayer represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for control of receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2133827033,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active ingredient in household bleach, is an effective antimicrobial produced by the mammalian host defense to kill invading microorganisms. Despite the widespread use of HOCl, surprisingly little is known about its mode of action. In this study, we demonstrate that low molar ratios of HOCl to protein cause oxidative protein unfolding in vitro and target thermolabile proteins for irreversible aggregation in vivo. As a defense mechanism, bacteria use the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33, which responds to bleach treatment with the reversible oxidative unfolding of its C-terminal redox switch domain. HOCl-mediated unfolding turns inactive Hsp33 into a highly active chaperone holdase, which protects essential Escherichia coli proteins against HOCl-induced aggregation and increases bacterial HOCl resistance. Our results substantially improve our molecular understanding about HOCl's functional mechanism. They suggest that the antimicrobial effects of bleach are largely based on HOCl's ability to cause aggregation of essential bacterial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2106974809,"Chris Kintner and colleagues report that a Xenopus homolog of the transcription factor Foxj1 is sufficient to induce motile cilia by upregulating expression of genes encoding key components of the motile ciliary machinery. Similar findings are reported in a related study by Sudipto Roy and colleagues. It has been proposed that ciliated cells that produce a leftward fluid flow mediate left-right patterning in many vertebrate embryos. The cilia on these cells combine features of primary sensory and motile cilia, but how this cilia subtype is specified is unknown. We address this issue by analyzing the Xenopus and zebrafish homologs of Foxj1, a forkhead transcription factor necessary for ciliogenesis in multiciliated cells of the mouse. We show that the cilia that underlie left-right patterning on the Xenopus gastrocoel roof plate (GRP) and zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle are severely shortened or fail to form in Foxj1 morphants. We also show that misexpressing Foxj1 is sufficient to induce ectopic GRP-like cilia formation in frog embryos. Microarray analysis indicates that Xenopus Foxj1 induces the formation of cilia by upregulating the expression of motile cilia genes. These results indicate that Foxj1 is a critical determinant in the specification of cilia used in left-right patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2064572662,"Control of stem cell behavior is a crucial aspect of developmental biology and regenerative medicine. While the functional role of electrophysiology in stem cell biology is poorly understood, it has become clear that endogenous ion flows represent a powerful set of signals by means of which cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration can be controlled in regeneration and embryonic morphogenesis.We examined the membrane potential (V(mem)) changes exhibited by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) undergoing adipogenic (AD) and osteogenic (OS) differentiation, and uncovered a characteristic hyperpolarization of differentiated cells versus undifferentiated cells. Reversal of the progressive polarization via pharmacological modulation of transmembrane potential revealed that depolarization of hMSCs prevents differentiation. In contrast, treatment with hyperpolarizing reagents upregulated osteogenic markers.Taken together, these data suggest that the endogenous hyperpolarization is a functional determinant of hMSC differentiation and is a tractable control point for modulating stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2152297755,"Glutamate NMDA receptors are involved in pain signaling, but inhibiting them would have too many side effects. These authors show that inhibiting the binding of NMDA receptors to Src, a molecule that is resposible for amplifying glutamate signaling, reduces inflammatory and neuropathic pain in mice and rats ( pages 1313–1315 ). Chronic pain hypersensitivity depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). However, clinical use of NMDAR blockers is limited by side effects resulting from suppression of the physiological functions of these receptors. Here we report a means to suppress pain hypersensitivity without blocking NMDARs, but rather by inhibiting the binding of a key enhancer of NMDAR function, the protein tyrosine kinase Src. We show that a peptide consisting of amino acids 40–49 of Src fused to the protein transduction domain of the HIV Tat protein (Src40–49Tat) prevented pain behaviors induced by intraplantar formalin and reversed pain hypersensitivity produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant or by peripheral nerve injury. Src40–49Tat had no effect on basal sensory thresholds, acute nociceptive responses or cardiovascular, respiratory, locomotor or cognitive functions. Thus, through targeting of Src-mediated enhancement of NMDARs, inflammatory and neuropathic pain are suppressed without the deleterious consequences of directly blocking NMDARs, an approach that may be of broad relevance to managing chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2064363195,"Meiosis differs from mitosis in that DNA replication is followed by the segregation of homologous chromosomes but not sister chromatids. This depends on the formation of interhomolog connections through crossover recombination and on the attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. We show that in yeast, the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) provides a link between premeiotic S phase, recombination, and monopolar attachment. Independently from its established role in initiating DNA replication, DDK promotes double-strand break formation, the first step of recombination, and the recruitment of the monopolin complex to kinetochores, which is essential for monopolar attachment. DDK regulates monopolin localization together with the polo-kinase Cdc5 bound to Spo13, probably through phosphorylation of the monopolin subunit Lrs4. Thus, activation of DDK both initiates DNA replication and commits meiotic cells to reductional chromosome segregation in the first division of meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2022959668,"The Repeat in Toxin (RTX) motif is a tandemly repeated calcium-binding nonapeptide sequence present in proteins that are secreted by the type I secretion system (T1SS) of Gram-negative bacteria.

In the extracellular medium, calcium binding can then trigger the folding of the polypeptide into its functional state.

Biol. 2005; 22: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This machinery was originally described as a dedicated secretion apparatus of α-hemolysin (HlyA), an essential pore-forming toxin produced by diverse uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains (3Felmlee T. Pellett S. Lee E.Y. Welch R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Felmlee T. Pellett S. Welch R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 94-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar systems were soon identified in many other mammalian or plant pathogens and shown to secrete a wide variety of virulence factors endowed with many different biological activities such as pore-forming cytolytic capacities (like HlyA), adenylate cyclase, actin cross-linking, lipases, proteases, adhesion proteins, hemophores, etc. (1Delepelaire P.

T1SS is a tripartite machinery consisting of: (i) an inner membrane ABC transporter that recognizes the protein substrate, (ii) a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and (iii) an outer membrane protein (OMP) (1Delepelaire P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Young J. Mol. Membr.

Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The proteins are usually recognized through a non-cleavable secretion signal, localized at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain and are exported from the cytosol to the extracellular medium without periplasmic intermediates (1Delepelaire P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Young J. Mol. Membr.

Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 85-111PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exported proteins vary widely in terms of biochemical function as well as in size (from less than one hundred to several thousands amino acids), one of their prominent features is the presence of characteristic repeated motifs known as RTX (for Repeat in Toxin), localized immediately upstream to the C-terminal secretion signal (1Delepelaire P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Young J. Mol. Membr.

RTX sequences are glycine- and aspartate-rich nonapeptides of the prototype GGXGXDXLX (X stands for any amino acid, L is occasionally substituted by V, I, F, or Y) that are present in variable number (from 5 to more than 50), generally in a tandem fashion. These motifs constitute a specific type of Ca2+ binding site that is essential for the function of the proteins. Indeed most cytolysins of the HlyA family are calcium-dependent and few of them (e.g. E. coli HlyA and the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis) have been shown to bind calcium in solution (7Ludwig A.

Crystallographic studies of two metalloproteases and a lipase revealed that these repeats, in the presence of calcium, fold into a parallel β-roll, in which the first six amino acids GGXGXD form a turn while the remaining three residues XLX fold into a short β-strand, with the leucine residue (or other nonpolar amino acids), making the hydrophobic core of the β-roll (11Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 12Meier R. Drepper T. Svensson V. Jaeger K.E. Baumann U. J. Biol.

The arrangement of consecutive turns and β-strands builds up a right-handed helix of parallel β-strands, one turn of this helix consisting of two consecutive RTX motifs. Calcium is bound between two adjacent turns by the conserved aspartic acids and by backbone carbonyls. Previous studies indicated that the RTX structures are important for the secretion of the corresponding substrates through the T1SS, without being per se part of the secretion signal (13Nicaud J.M. Mackman N. Gray L. Holland I.B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Felmlee T. Welch R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that the RTX motifs may serve as a flexible hinge between the secretion signal, and the upstream domains of the substrate. Besides, it is generally assumed that the newly synthesized polypeptide chain has to adopt a loosely folded conformation compatible with the passage through the narrow channel of the T1SS (6Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Given the low calcium concentration within the bacterial cytosol, it has been hypothesized that, inside bacteria, the RTX sequences could adopt an unfolded conformation favorable for the secretion of the protein substrate (1Delepelaire P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Young J. Mol. Membr.

To provide direct experimental evidences for this model, we have examined the conformational flexibility of the RTX motifs from the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) of B. pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough (16Ladant D. Ullmann A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 172-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Vojtova J. Kamanova J. Sebo P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CyaA, one of the major virulence factors of B. pertussis, is secreted by a dedicated T1SS, made of the CyaB, CyaD, and CyaE proteins, and is able to invade eukaryotic target cells, where upon activation by calmodulin, it produces supraphysiological levels of cAMP. CyaA is a 1706-amino acid long protein that contains in its C-terminal moiety (i.e. residues 1006-1706) about 40 RTX motifs organized in five successive blocks, each consisting of 8-10 RTX motifs, separated by linkers of variable length (from 23-49 residues). Here, we have characterized the conformational, thermodynamic, and hydrodynamic properties of the apo (Ca2+-free) and holo (Ca2+-bound) forms of the CyaA RTX domain (RD) by various biophysical approaches. We showed that at low calcium concentrations, similar to those prevailing in the bacterial cytosol, RD presents the characteristic features of an intrinsically disordered protein (18Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M. Hipps K.W. Ausio J. Nissen M.S. Reeves R. Kang C. Kissinger C.R. Bailey R.W. Griswold M.D. Chiu W.

Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), while in the presence of millimolar calcium concentrations (like those found in the extracellular medium), the protein exhibits a stable and compact β-sheet conformation. The biological relevance of these findings for the secretion by the T1SS of CyaA and, more generally, of RTX-containing protein substrates will be discussed. Materials—Hepes-d18 (D18, 98%, DLM-3786-0) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. D2O (D215B), NaOD, and DCl were from Euriso-top (C.E.A. Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Experiments were done in 5 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3 (buffer A), at 37 °C, unless stated otherwise. Protein Preparation—The RD of CyaA corresponds to residues 1006-1706 of CyaA. The RD protein was overproduced in E. coli and purified by Ca2+-dependent phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (10Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After hydrophobic interaction chromatography, RD was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S300 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl) and by ion exchange chromatography (IEC) on Q Sepharose. Elution was done with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl at room temperature. The IEC elution buffer was finally exchanged against 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3 on a G25SF column. The protein solution was stored at -20 °C or dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. We checked by CD, fluorescence, and trypsin partial digestion that the lyophilization process did not affect the calcium-induced conformational changes of RD. Protein batches were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, and by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS model PCS 4000, Ciphergen). A molar mass of 72,621 g·mol-1, and a molar extinction coefficient of 72000 m-1·cm-1 were computed from the amino acid sequence of RD. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer model 215, equipped with a water-cooled Peltier unit. CD measurements were carried out in a 1-mm path length Suprasil cell (110.QS, Hellma) at a scan rate of 0.5 nm/sec (step: 0.5 nm and integration time: 1 s) with a time constant of 100 ms and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Four scans were averaged to obtain each spectrum. The spectrum of buffer A was subtracted to all spectra. The CD units used are the mean residue ellipticity (MRE), expressed in degrees square centimeter per decimol of residue ((deg·cm2)/(dmol·res)) and calculated from the relationship in Equation 1, [θ]F=(100θm)/(CIN),(Eq. 1) where θm is the measured ellipticity in degrees, C is the concentration in moles per liter, l is the path length of the cell in centimeter, and N is the number of residues. The value 100 arises from the conversion of the concentration in mole per liter to decimole per cubic centimeter. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Thermal-induced denaturation of RD at various calcium concentrations was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Measurements were performed with an FP-6200 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco) in a Peltier-thermostatted cell holder, using a 1-cm path length quartz cell (111-QS) with constant stirring. The tryptophan emission spectra of RD at a concentration of 1 μm at different calcium concentrations (from 0 to 2 mm) were recorded from 300 to 400 nm (excitation at 292 nm at a scan rate of 125 nm·min-1) as a function of temperature, ranging from 10 to 98 °C, with a temperature increment of 1 °C between each spectrum. A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for both excitation and emission beams. The ratio of fluorescence intensities (rFI) at 360 nm and 320 nm (rFI 360/320) was used to determine the fraction of unfolded protein fU using the relation: fU = (rFIT - rFI10)/(rFI98 - rFI10) where rFI10, rFI98, and rFIT, are the rFI at 10 °C, 98 °C, and temperature T, respectively. The fraction of native protein fN that populated the native state, N, is given by Equation 2, fN=NN+U=(1+(UN))−1=(1+KT)−1(Eq. 2) where U is the concentration of RD in the thermal-unfolded state and KT the equilibrium constant at the given temperature: KT = U/N. The equilibrium constant KT is related to the free energy ΔG according to K = exp(-ΔG/RT), and in the vicinity of the half-melting point Tm, the fraction of native RD, fN, is related to the Van't Hoff enthalpy ΔHvH according to Equation 3.fN=(1+exp(ΔHvHR×(1Tm−1T)))−1(Eq. 3) Fittings were done with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Purified RD in 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA was buffer-exchanged against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) on prepacked G25SF desalting columns at room temperature and freeze-dried. Two cycles of resuspension of the lyophilized protein in D2O and freeze-drying were performed to exchange amide protons and to reduce H2O concentration. Buffers and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) were D2O-exchanged twice by repeated freeze-drying and resuspension. Apo-RD samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized RD in 5 mm Hepes-d18, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, prepared in D2O (99.99%), supplemented or not with 5.3 m GdnHCl. Holo-RD samples were prepared from apo-RD samples by addition of 2 mm CaCl2. Protein concentrations ranged between 55 and 75 μm. NMR experiments were conducted at 37 °C on an Inova 600 (Varian Inc., Palo Alto) spectrometer with a 14.1 Tesla magnetic field, and equipped with a cryoprobe. Spectra were recorded, processed and analyzed using Vnmr 6.1C (Varian). Water signal was suppressed by low-power irradiation during the 2 s recovery delay or using the jump-return (21Plateau P. Guéron H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) or double pulse-field gradient stimulated-echo (22Dalvit C. Shapiro G. Böhlen J.-M. Parella T. Magn. Reson. in Chem. 1999; 37: 7-14Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) schemes. Proton spectra were acquired with 4096 complex points and a sweep width of 12 ppm. Transverse relaxation times (T2) were obtained from standard spin-echo experiments that used short (≤4 ms) variable τ relaxation delays (π/2-τ-π/2) to safely neglect J-coupling evolution. Bulk T2 values were estimated by fitting the data of the aliphatic region (below 3.2 ppm) to a single exponential decay. One-dimensional saturation transfer experiments were performed by selective saturation (1.7 ppm) of the aromatic region using trains of 90° gaussian pulses centered at 7.1 ppm. Thirty-two scans were accumulated for each saturation time, which varied between 0 and 1.7 s. An identical set of experiments with off-resonance saturation was used as reference. The nuclear Overhauser effect (nOe) between aromatic and aliphatic protons was calculated from the intensities of the aliphatic region (upfield of 2.5 ppm) of the on- (IS) and off- (IR) resonance experiments as follows: nOe = [IS-IR]/IR. Intrinsic Viscosity and Molecular Mass Measurements with SEC-TDA—Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments were done on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) controlled by a GPCmax module and connected on-line to a triple detector array (TDA) model 302 (Viscotek Ltd., Houston, Basingstoke, UK). The oven of the TDA contained (i) a static light scattering cell with two photodiode detectors, at 7° for low angle (LALS) and at 90° for right angle laser light scattering (RALS), (ii) a deflection refractometer, (iii) a photometer, and (iv) a differential viscometer. The general procedures described by Viscotek were followed. All solutions were filtered on 0.2-μm filters and allowed to equilibrate at 10 °C. SEC was performed at 10 °C, and detection in the TDA oven was done at 20 °C. All experimental sequences contained injections of bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml, various volumes) and apo-RD or holo-RD (at least four injections of different volumes). Bovine serum albumin injections were used for TDA internal constants calibration. The refractive index increments, dn/dc, were experimentally determined and were similar for both states (dn/dc: 0.184). Buffer A (5 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) was used for apo-RD and buffer A supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 for holo-RD. All data were acquired using the Omnisec software. Protein concentration was determined using both the photometer and the deflection refractometer. The RALS and LALS data, in combination with the concentration, provided the molecular mass M. Intrinsic viscosity [η] was calculated using the differential viscometer, which is made of a balanced four-capillary bridge, an original adaptation of the electrical Wheatstone bridge to fluid materials (23Harding S.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 207-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Both molecular mass and intrinsic viscosity were calculated with the Omnisec software. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) equipped with an AN60-Ti rotor. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min prior to experiments. Detection of the protein concentration as a function of radial position and time was performed by optical density measurements at a wavelength of 280 nm. Buffer A supplemented with either 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA was used for holo-RD or apo-RD, respectively. The buffer viscosity η and density ρ, calculated with Sednterp 1.09 were η = 1.016 cP and 1.00456 g·ml-1. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, protein samples (40 μl, 2.5 μm) were loaded in a 1.2-mm thick six channels epon centerpiece. Apo-RD samples were centrifuged successively 3 h at rotor speeds of 10,000 rpm, 2 h at 12,000 rpm, and then 2 h at 18,000 rpm. Holo-RD samples were centrifuged 3 h at 18,000 rpm, 2 h at 22,000 rpm, and 2 h at 26,000 rpm. Data were recorded for each speed after controlling that the sedimentation/diffusion equilibrium had been effectively reached. The baseline was measured at 42,000 rpm after 2 h. Radial distributions were analyzed by global fitting of the three speeds using the one species model of the Ultrascan 9.5 software. Partial specific volumes were obtained by fixing the molecular mass to the computed mass of the monomer. For sedimentation velocity experiments, the protein samples (300 μl at 2.5, 7, 15, and 25 μm) were loaded in 1.2-mm thick epon double sector cells and spun at 35 000 rpm. Sedimentation velocity profiles were monitored at 3-min intervals. Data were analyzed with the Sedfit 11.3 software using a continuous size distribution c(s) model with invariant diffusion coefficient D (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). Quasi-elastic Light Scattering—QELS experiments were performed on a DynaPro MS800 (Wyatt), using the Protein Solution Dynamics software version 6.2.05. The laser power was 100%, and its incident light wavelength was λQELS: 824.7 nm. Buffers and samples were filtrated on 0.2-μm filters prior to acquisition. Protein concentration was routinely 5 μm. A microcuvette of dimensions 3 × 8.5 mm (105.251 QS) was loaded with 100 μl of RD. Samples were thermally equilibrated for 10 min in the cell compartment at 20 °C. Acquisition time was 10 s, with an interval time of 1 s. At least 30 acquisitions were averaged to produce a data collection. A set of three independent data collections was obtained for each experimental condition. The data were processed with SEDFIT 9.2 and analyzed using: (i) Continuous Hydrodynamic Radius Distribution and (ii) Stokes Radii models. The maximum entropy and the Tikhonov-Phillips 2nd derivative regularization procedures were used with a confidence level (F-ratio) of 0.55. The hydrodynamic radius, RH, was calculated from the Stokes-Einstein equation RH = (kBT)/6πηsDt, where kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature, and ηs the viscosity of the solvent. The frictional ratio from quasi-elastic light scattering is given by f/f0 = RH/RS, where RS stand for the radius of an anhydrous sphere of the same mass as RD. Protein Shape and Hydration—The viscosity increment v (also called the Simha-Einstein hydrodynamic function) is related to the axial ratio a/b of an ellipsoid of revolution and can be calculated from the Einstein's viscosity relation: M[η] = νVHNA, where VH is the hydrodynamic volume defined by VH = 4πRH/3 and NA the Avogadro number. Hydration is calculated from the intrinsic viscosity relation described below. The intrinsic viscosity in a defined solvent depends on the shape, the hydration, the molecular volume of the protein, and electroviscous effects. Its expression is the product of the viscosity increment ν and the swollen volume Vs according to [η]=vVs=v(v¯+δ/ρ), from which the hydration parameter is extracted: δ=(([η]/v)−v¯)ρ. The swollen volume, Vs, is the sum of the partial specific volume v¯ of the protein (volume occupied by one gram of protein) and the time-averaged apparent hydration δ of the protein (volume of water per gram of protein). The hydration parameter of the protein includes: (i) the water molecules bound to the protein and (ii) the water molecules dragged by the diffusion of the protein. The molecular mass M was measured by SELDI and static light scattering. The partial specific volume v¯ was determined by equilibrium AUC and the translational diffusion coefficient Dt by velocity AUC and QELS (see above). The viscosity increment provides the axial ratio a/b, using the inversion formulae of the hydrodynamic function v using the parameters for polynomial fit described by Harding and Cölfen (25Harding S.E. Colfen H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The semi axes a and b, with a>b, describe the shape of the ellipsoid of revolution. The values of a and b semi axes for prolate (a, b, b) and oblate (a, a, b) conformations were determined using Ultrascan. Calcium-induced Conformational Changes of RD—The RD protein (amino acids 1006-1706 of CyaA; molecular mass of 72.6 kDa) was overexpressed as a soluble polypeptide in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (10Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Bauche C. Chenal A. Knapp O. Bodenreider C. Benz R. Chaffotte A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16914-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectrum of the apo-state of RD (apo-RD, in the absence of calcium) was typical of a predominantly unfolded protein, as shown by the strong negative π0-π* band around 200 nm (Fig. 1). Yet, the weak negative n′-π* band, appearing as a shoulder around 220 nm, indicated the presence of some residual secondary structure elements in apo-RD. A very similar spectrum was observed for the protein equilibrated in the presence of 5 m GdnHCl. Upon addition of 2 mm calcium to apo-RD, secondary structures were formed, as revealed by the concomitant intensity decrease of the π0-π* band and the increase of the n′-π* band in the holo-RD spectrum, as previously reported (10Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Bauche C. Chenal A. Knapp O. Bodenreider C. Benz R. Chaffotte A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16914-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structures of holo-RD were readily denatured upon addition of 5 m GdnHCl, leading to a spectrum similar to that of the apo-state. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to further characterize the calcium-induced conformational changes of RD. The one-dimensional spectrum of apo-RD in the presence of the denaturant GdnHCl (5.3 m) showed no evident secondary chemical shifts, with all peaks appearing at the expected frequencies for an unfolded protein, the so-called “random-coil” chemical shifts (Fig. 2A). The low chemical-shift dispersion was consistent with a protein with no stable secondary and tertiary structures. The spectrum of the apo-form under native conditions also showed very poor chemical shift dispersion, and resembled that of the protein denatured in GdnHCl, but with somewhat narrower lines. Noticeably, the bands of the apo-RD spectrum were strikingly narrow for a 701-residue long protein, suggesting that apo-RD had a highly dynamic structure in which most of its side-chains could freely reorient in solution. These observations suggested that apo-RD was mainly natively disordered. Yet, its NMR spectrum contained few signals that were well dispersed and that appeared at chemical shifts characteristic of a well-ordered conformation with stable tertiary structure (see Fig. 2B). The apo-RD spectrum indeed displayed some down-field shifted Hα resonances (≥4.8 ppm) indicative of β-sheet structures, upfield shifted signals in the methyl region (≤0.79 ppm), as well as several dispersed peaks in the aromatic region (7.7-6.5 ppm) at non-random coil frequencies indicating the presence of stable hydrophobic interactions. From integration of the downfield part of the Hα region and comparison with the whole Hα envelope integration (excluding the residual water signal at 4.62 ppm), we could roughly estimate that apo-RD contained at least ∼7% of β-sheets. Similarly, integration of the upfield signals in the methyl region (≤0.79 ppm) of the apo-RD spectrum suggested that ca. 17 methyls (i.e. 6% of the 286 Ile/Leu/Val methyls) were implicated in a stable hydrophobic environment that likely involved aromatic residues. The NMR spectrum of calcium-bound RD was drastically different. First, it exhibited an increase of the envelope of upfield-shifted H"
https://openalex.org/W2088905973,Fluorination has gained an increasingly important role in drug discovery and development. Here we describe a versatile strategy that combines cytochrome P450–catalyzed oxygenation with deoxofluorination to achieve mono- and polyfluorination of nonreactive sites in a variety of organic scaffolds. This procedure was applied for the rapid identification of fluorinated drug derivatives with enhanced membrane permeability.
https://openalex.org/W2156193902,"Actin-based cell motility and force generation are central to immune response, tissue development, and cancer metastasis, and understanding actin cytoskeleton regulation is a major goal of cell biologists. Cell spreading is a commonly used model system for motility experiments -- spreading fibroblasts exhibit stereotypic, spatially-isotropic edge dynamics during a reproducible sequence of functional phases: 1) During early spreading, cells form initial contacts with the surface. 2) The middle spreading phase exhibits rapidly increasing attachment area. 3) Late spreading is characterized by periodic contractions and stable adhesions formation. While differences in cytoskeletal regulation between phases are known, a global analysis of the spatial and temporal coordination of motility and force generation is missing. Implementing improved algorithms for analyzing edge dynamics over the entire cell periphery, we observed that a single domain of homogeneous cytoskeletal dynamics dominated each of the three phases of spreading. These domains exhibited a unique combination of biophysical and biochemical parameters -- a motility module. Biophysical characterization of the motility modules revealed that the early phase was dominated by periodic, rapid membrane blebbing; the middle phase exhibited continuous protrusion with very low traction force generation; and the late phase was characterized by global periodic contractions and high force generation. Biochemically, each motility module exhibited a different distribution of the actin-related protein VASP, while inhibition of actin polymerization revealed different dependencies on barbed-end polymerization. In addition, our whole-cell analysis revealed that many cells exhibited heterogeneous combinations of motility modules in neighboring regions of the cell edge. Together, these observations support a model of motility in which regions of the cell edge exhibit one of a limited number of motility modules that, together, determine the overall motility function. Our data and algorithms are publicly available to encourage further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2102847068,"The loading of oligomeric helicases onto replication origins marks an essential step in replisome assembly. In cells, dedicated AAA+ ATPases regulate loading, however, the mechanism by which these factors recruit and deposit helicases has remained unclear. To better understand this process, we determined the structure of the ATPase region of the bacterial helicase loader DnaC from Aquifex aeolicus to 2.7 A resolution. The structure shows that DnaC is a close paralog of the bacterial replication initiator, DnaA, and unexpectedly shares an ability to form a helical assembly similar to that of ATP-bound DnaA. Complementation and ssDNA-binding assays validate the importance of homomeric DnaC interactions, while pull-down experiments show that the DnaC and DnaA AAA+ domains interact in a nucleotide-dependent manner. These findings implicate DnaC as a molecular adaptor that uses ATP-activated DnaA as a docking site for regulating the recruitment and correct spatial deposition of the DnaB helicase onto origins."
https://openalex.org/W2098136731,"In the absence of stimuli, most motile eukaryotic cells move by spontaneously coordinating cell deformation with cell movement in the absence of stimuli. Yet little is known about how cells change their own shape and how cells coordinate the deformation and movement. Here, we investigated the mechanism of spontaneous cell migration by using computational analyses.We observed spontaneously migrating Dictyostelium cells in both a vegetative state (round cell shape and slow motion) and starved one (elongated cell shape and fast motion). We then extracted regular patterns of morphological dynamics and the pattern-dependent systematic coordination with filamentous actin (F-actin) and cell movement by statistical dynamic analyses.We found that Dictyostelium cells in both vegetative and starved states commonly organize their own shape into three ordered patterns, elongation, rotation, and oscillation, in the absence of external stimuli. Further, cells inactivated for PI3-kinase (PI3K) and/or PTEN did not show ordered patterns due to the lack of spatial control in pseudopodial formation in both the vegetative and starved states. We also found that spontaneous polarization was achieved in starved cells by asymmetric localization of PTEN and F-actin. This breaking of the symmetry of protein localization maintained the leading edge and considerably enhanced the persistence of directed migration, and overall random exploration was ensured by switching among the different ordered patterns. Our findings suggest that Dictyostelium cells spontaneously create the ordered patterns of cell shape mediated by PI3K/PTEN/F-actin and control the direction of cell movement by coordination with these patterns even in the absence of external stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2030992905,"Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor by cellular stress leads to variable responses ranging from growth inhibition to apoptosis. TIGAR is a novel p53-inducible gene that inhibits glycolysis by reducing cellular levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, an activator of glycolysis and inhibitor of gluconeogenesis. Here we describe structural and biochemical studies of TIGAR from Danio rerio. The overall structure forms a histidine phosphatase fold with a phosphate molecule coordinated to the catalytic histidine residue and a second phosphate molecule in a position not observed in other phosphatases. The recombinant human and zebra fish enzymes hydrolyze fructose-2,6-bisphosphate as well as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate but not fructose 6-phosphate in vitro. The TIGAR active site is open and positively charged, consistent with its enzymatic function as bisphosphatase. The closest related structures are the bacterial broad specificity phosphatase PhoE and the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain of the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. The structural comparison shows that TIGAR combines an accessible active site as observed in PhoE with a charged substrate-binding pocket as seen in the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain of the bifunctional enzyme."

Current understanding of NO2-FA signal transduction lacks insight into how or if NO2-FA are modified or metabolized upon formation or administration in vivo. Here the disposition and metabolism of nitro-9-cis-octadecenoic (18:1-NO2) acid was investigated in plasma and liver after intravenous injection in mice. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that no 18:1-NO2 or metabolites were detected under basal conditions, whereas administered 18:1-NO2 is rapidly adducted to plasma thiol-containing proteins and glutathione. NO2-FA are also metabolized via β-oxidation, with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of liver lipid extracts of treated mice revealing nitro-7-cis-hexadecenoic acid, nitro-5-cis-tetradecenoic acid, and nitro-3-cis-dodecenoic acid and corresponding coenzyme A derivatives of 18:1-NO2 as metabolites. Additionally, a significant proportion of 18:1-NO2 and its metabolites are converted to nitroalkane derivatives by saturation of the double bond, and to a lesser extent are desaturated to diene derivatives. There was no evidence of the formation of nitrohydroxyl or conjugated ketone derivatives in organs of interest, metabolites expected upon 18:1-NO2 hydration or nitric oxide (•NO) release. Plasma samples from treated mice had significant extents of protein-adducted 18:1-NO2 detected by exchange to added β-mercaptoethanol. This, coupled with the observation of 18:1-NO2 release from glutathione-18:1-NO2 adducts, supports that reversible and exchangeable NO2-FA-thiol adducts occur under biological conditions.

The conditions promoting fatty acid nitration by •NO and NO2− species (low oxygen tension, radical formation, and low pH) are not expected to be broadly distributed systemically (e.g. in plasma or extracellular fluids). Rather, nitration reactions will preferably occur during inflammatory or metabolic stress in microenvironments such as the intermembrane space of mitochondria, the low pH environment of the digestive tract, and activated macrophage and neutrophil-rich compartments. Moreover, the acidic, NO2− replete and low O2 tension conditions that promote nitration reactions are characteristic of inflammatory loci. Although multiple reactions leading to accelerated formation of nitrating species occur at specific anatomic sites, plasma levels of nitrated fatty acids are expected to be low due to events described herein. Robust electrophilic reactivity and avid nuclear lipid receptor ligand activity have conferred to the class of fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives potent anti-inflammatory properties that occur predominantly via non-cGMP-dependent mechanisms.

Previous observations of the •NO-mediated, cGMP-dependent vessel relaxation induced by NO2-FA were made under serum- and lipid-free conditions.

The high electronegativity of NO2 substituents, when bound to an alkenyl carbon of fatty acids, confers an electrophilic nature to the adjacent β-carbon and enables Michael addition reaction with nucleophiles such as protein His and Cys residues. This process, termed nitroalkylation (22Baker L.M. Baker P.R. Golin-Bisello F. Schopfer F.J. Fink M. Woodcock S.R. Branchaud B.P. Radi R. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Further support for the inflammatory generation of NO2-FA comes from lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ-activated murine J774.1 macrophages, where increased nitration of the acyl chain of cholesteryl linoleate was paralleled by increased macrophage expression and activity of nitric-oxide synthase 2 (27Ferreira A.M.

To date, insight into the mechanisms of nitroalkene signaling actions overshadows knowledge of the generation, trafficking, and metabolism of nitroalkenes in vivo.

Because the in vivo administration of NO2-FA may exert anti-inflammatory benefit, the disposition and metabolite profiles of these species in vivo is of relevance. Here we report that only 2.4% of nitrooctadecenoic acid (18:1-NO2) is immediately detectable in the vascular compartment as native 18:1-NO2 upon intravenous injection in mice, with the remaining pool of 18:1-NO2 (a) reversibly bound to plasma and tissue thiols via Michael addition; (b) metabolized to nitro-octadecanoic acid (18:0-NO2) and nitro-octadecadienoic acid (18:2-NO2); and (c) catabolized by hepatic β-oxidation following thioester formation with coenzyme A. Materials—A synthesis producing equal yields of 9- and 10-nitro-9-cis-octadecenoic acid regioisomers (collectively termed 18:1-NO2) and [13C]18:1-NO2 was conducted as previously shown (1Baker P.R.

In some experiments, [3H]18:1-NO2 was utilized, prepared by a similar synthetic and purification strategy using 9,10-[3H]-cis-octadecenoic acid as the starting material. The 9- and 10-nitro regioisomers of octadecenoic acid were not differentiated for the present study and for shorter acyl chain length β-oxidation products, the NO2 position was assumed to remain on these carbons (e.g. becoming 3-nitro-3-cis-dodecenoic acid and 4-nitro-3-cis-dodecenoic acid). CoA-heptadecanoic acid (17:0-CoA) was from Sigma. Solvents used for extractions and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). C57/Bl6 mice were from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Insulin syringes for tail vein injections were from BD Biosciences. Experimental Preparations—All animal studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval 0605735-A3). Male C57BL/6 mice, 8–10 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), were used for all described procedures. 18:1-NO2 or [13C]18:1-NO2 were solvated in 30 μl of 20% ethanol to obtain a final concentration of 10 mm for measurements involving free and plasma constituent-adducted 18:1-NO2 and to a final concentration of 60 mm for measurement of hepatic NO2-FA CoA derivatives. Because of limited amounts of [13C]18:1-NO2, this molecule was not utilized for hepatic metabolite studies. Injection solutions were prepared freshly for every animal and administered immediately via the tail vein. Injection of 30 μl of vehicle was administered to control mice. Blood samples were collected from the saphenous vein prior to 18:1-NO2 injection and then at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min post injection. Mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal® sodium solution (65 mg/kg, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL) after 90 min to obtain liver specimens and final blood samples by right ventricular cardiac puncture. Blood samples were transferred to heparinized tubes and stored on ice for further processing. Samples were then stored at –80 °C until further analysis. Liver specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for further analysis. Analysis of 18:1-NO2 Metabolites—For lipid extraction, 40 μl of cold (–20 °C) acetonitrile were added to 10 μl of whole blood. Samples were mixed well and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. For quantification purposes [13C]18:1-NO2 and [13C]nitro-9-cis-12-cis-octadecadienoic acid ([13C]linoleic acid) were added as internal standards to samples obtained from animals treated with saline and [12C]18:1-NO2 prior to extraction with acetonitrile. Qualitative and quantitative lipid analyses were conducted by using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI MS/MS) using either a hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API 4000) or a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API 5000, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Framingham, MA). NO2-FA molecular species were resolved by integrated reversed-phase HPLC (Shimadzu CBM20A, Japan) employing a 150-mm × 2-mm C18 Luna column (particle size, 3 μm, Phenomenex, Belmont, CA) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using a gradient elution with 0.1% acetic acid as solvent A and 0.1% acetic acid in 100% acetonitrile as solvent B. Elution was carried out with the following gradient profile: 0–3 min 3% of B, 3–6 min of 3–50% B, 6–45 min 50–99% of B, 45–53 min 99% of B, and 53.1–65 min 3% of B. Electrospray voltage was –4.5 kV, and the source temperature was set at 550 °C. Mass spectrometric detection of NO2-FA was first performed using the precursor ion scan mode set to detect molecules that, upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), generate a fragment corresponding to NO2− (m/z 46). The precursor masses of molecules containing a nitro functional group were identified, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were used to detect and quantify NO2-FA molecular species using a collision energy of –32.0 eV. The mass transition of m/z 326/46 was used to detect 18:1-NO2 with the appearance of 46 atomic mass units being consistent with the formation of NO2−. Mass transitions for β-oxidation metabolites of 18:1-NO2 were calculated according to expected differences in mass, i.e. to account for each loss of an ethyl moiety (-CH2-CH2-) as to be expected in the course of β-oxidation a mass of 28 was subtracted for Q1 (e.g. 326–28 = 298 for nitro-7-cis-hexadecenoic acid), whereas Q3 remained unaltered (Table 1). Similarly, monitoring for 18:0-NO2 and 18:2-NO2 was performed allowing for the respective changes in masses (Table 1). Additionally, expected MRM transitions of nitrohydroxyl and conjugated ketone derivatives were employed. Structural confirmation of observed compounds was carried out by MS/MS analysis using the same HPLC settings described earlier. After confirmation of structure, quantification of biological samples was performed using a 20- × 2-mm reversed-phase column (Mercury MS Gemini 3μ C18, 110 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and a linear gradient of solvent B (11–99% in 3.5 min). For quantification of 18:1-NO2 and 18:2-NO2, peak areas were assessed using Analyst 1.4.2 quantification software (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), and ratios of analytes to internal standard were calculated for determination of concentration. Peak areas for 18:0-NO2 were determined as for 18:1-NO2. An external standard curve of nitro-octadecanoic acid was used to determine concentration. The same approaches for quantification were used to approximate concentrations of the metabolites of 18:1-NO2 and 18:0-NO2. Because no standards were available for these metabolites standards for 18:1-NO2 and 18:0-NO2, respectively, were used to correct for any losses and values reported as area ratio.TABLE 1MRM transitions for free, adducted, and CoA-activated nitrated fatty acids Open table in a new tab Metabolism of 18:1-NO2 to 18:0-NO2 Acid in Vitro—Peripheral human blood was collected by venipuncture into heparinized tubes with Institutional Review Board approval (number 0606145). Blood was centrifuged (2500 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min) to obtain plasma. NO2-OA was added to a final concentration of 200 nm and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Controls were performed using oleic acid (final concentration, 200 nm) or an equal volume of saline to separate plasma samples and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Sample processing for HPLC-ESI MS/MS analysis was then performed as for whole blood. Conversion of 18:1-NO2 to 18:0-NO2 was assessed by scanning for the corresponding transitions using HPLC-ESI MS/MS in the MRM scanning mode. Separately, bovine aortic endothelial cells (passages 7–9) were grown to confluence on 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with 0.15 m NaCl, oleic acid (5 μm, as control), 18:1-NO2 (5 μm), or [13C]18:1-NO2 (5 μm) in 3 ml of Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS). Cell medium (200 μl) was collected at baseline and after 5, 15, 30, and 90 min. After 90 min, cells were washed twice with HBSS and collected by scraping in 200 μl of HBSS. Media samples, cells, and a parallel HBSS solution, which was also incubated with lipids at 37 °C for 90 min, were all treated with acetonitrile as above to deproteinize and extract lipids. Further analysis was performed by HPLC-ESI MS/MS. Analysis of NO2-FA Adduction—Serum samples obtained 90 min after injection of 18:1-NO2 were used to investigate nitroalkylation of plasma components. Free 18:1-NO2 was measured as above using HPLC-ESI MS/MS after lipid extraction with acetonitrile. For evaluation of the presence of glutathione (GSH)-adducted 18:1-NO2 (GS-18:1-NO2) the same HPLC-ESI MS/MS approach was employed. The positive mass transition of m/z 633.3/306.3 was used in the MRM scan mode, where 306.3 is the mass of glutathione and 633.3 is the mass of the adduct of 18:1-NO2 to glutathione. To assess the total amount of 18:1-NO2 (free and adducted to any plasma components) [13C]18:1-NO2 was added to serum samples as internal standard, and samples were treated with 500 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37°C. Under these conditions, nitroalkylated adducts undergo an exchange reaction where the nitroalkylated moiety transnitroalkylates with BME to form BME adducts (BME-18:1-NO2), and the original protein amino acid moiety is restored to its reduced form. Samples were then analyzed by HPLC-ESI MS/MS using the same chromatographic gradient as for quantification of free NO2-FA. Detection of BME-adducted NO2-FA was performed in MRM scan mode using mass transitions of m/zx + 78 to m/zx (where x = the mass of the nascent NO2-FA and 78 is the atomic mass units of a neutral loss of BME). For assessment of 18:1-NO2 adducted to albumin, serum proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis (Criterion XT Precast Gel, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After separation, bands of albumin were detected by Coomassie staining, excised, and cut in 1-mm3 cubes in 400 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing [13C]18:1-NO2 as an internal standard. Subsequently, BME was added to a final concentration of 500 mm, and samples were incubated for 2 h to transnitroalkylate 18:1-NO2 from albumin nucleophiles to BME. Finally, BME-adducted 18:1-NO2 was quantified after extraction with acetonitrile by HPLC-ESI MS/MS as above. To estimate the concentration of 18:1-NO2-adducted to albumin a plasma albumin concentration of 30 mg/ml was assumed. To evaluate the reversibility of 18:1-NO2-nucleophile alkylation reactions further, glutathione-adducted 18:1-NO2 (GS-18: 1-NO2) was synthesized and purified. Glutathione (GSH) (300 mm) was solvated in 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer (final pH 7.4) and treated with 1.5 mm of 18:1-NO2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by acidification with formic acid at a final pH of 2.0. GS-18:1-NO2 was purified from residual GSH by reversed-phase chromatography. Samples were loaded onto PrepSep™ C18 columns (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and"
https://openalex.org/W1999944478,"The end-Permian biotic crisis (~252.5 Ma) represents the most severe extinction event in Earth's history. This paper investigates diversity patterns in Anomodontia, an extinct group of therapsid synapsids ('mammal-like reptiles'), through time and in particular across this event. As herbivores and the dominant terrestrial tetrapods of their time, anomodonts play a central role in assessing the impact of the end-Permian extinction on terrestrial ecosystems. Taxonomic diversity analysis reveals that anomodonts experienced three distinct phases of diversification interrupted by the same number of extinctions, i.e. an end-Guadalupian, an end-Permian, and a mid-Triassic extinction. A positive correlation between the number of taxa and the number of formations per time interval shows that anomodont diversity is biased by the Permian-Triassic terrestrial rock record. Normalized diversity curves indicate that anomodont richness continuously declines from the Middle Permian to the Late Triassic, but also reveals all three extinction events. Taxonomic rates (origination and extinction) indicate that the end-Guadalupian and end-Permian extinctions were driven by increased rates of extinction as well as low origination rates. However, this pattern is not evident at the final decline of anomodont diversity during the Middle Triassic. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the Middle Triassic extinction represents a gradual or abrupt event that is unique to anomodonts or more common among terrestrial tetrapods. The end-Permian extinction represents the most distinct event in terms of decline in anomodont richness and turnover rates."

The mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is regarded as a major player in this process, although its abrogation has not been tested yet in animal models. Here, we generated transgenic mice, named ßGlud1–/–, with ß-cell-specific GDH deletion. Our results show that GDH plays an essential role in the full development of the insulin secretory response. In situ pancreatic perfusion revealed that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced by 37% in ßGlud1–/–. Furthermore, isolated islets with either constitutive or acute adenovirus-mediated knock-out of GDH showed a 49 and 38% reduction in glucose-induced insulin release, respectively. Adenovirus-mediated re-expression of GDH in ßGlud1–/– islets fully restored glucose-induced insulin release. Thus, GDH appears to account for about 40% of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and to lack redundant mechanisms. In ßGlud1–/– mice, the reduced secretory capacity resulted in lower plasma insulin levels in response to both feeding and glucose load, while body weight gain was preserved. The results demonstrate that GDH is essential for the full development of the secretory response in ß-cells.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Then, increasing the magnitude of the secretory response requires amplification of the calcium signal supported by metabolism-derived additive factors (2Maechler P. Carobbio S. Rubi B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, 2The abbreviations used are: GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; BCH, 2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid; ITT, insulin tolerance test. EC 1.4.1.3) has been proposed to participate to the development of the secretory response. GDH is a homohexamer located in the mitochondrial matrix that catalyzes the reversible reaction: α-ketoglutarate + NH3 + NAD(P)H ⇆ glutamate + NAD(P)+; inhibited by GTP and activated by ADP (3Hudson R.C. Daniel R.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 106: 767-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 4Frigerio F. Casimir M. Carobbio S. Maechler P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Regarding ß-cell, allosteric activation of GDH by l-leucine or its non-metabolized analogue BCH has triggered most of the attention over the last three decades (5Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To date, the role of GDH in ß-cell function remains unclear and debated. Specifically, GDH might play a role in glucose-induced amplifying pathway through generation of glutamate (6Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 7Hoy M. Maechler P. Efanov A.M. Wollheim C.B. Berggren P.O. Gromada J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GDH is also an amino acid sensor triggering insulin release upon glutamine stimulation in conditions of GDH allosteric activation (8Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Malaisse W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Kmiotek E.H. Mertz R.J. Fahien C.M. J. Biol.

Recently, the importance of GDH has been further highlighted by studies showing that SIRT4, a mitochondrial ADP-ribosyltransferase, down-regulates GDH activity and thereby modulates insulin secretion (11Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K. Christodoulou D.C. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Karow M. Blander G. Wolberger C. Prolla T.A. Weindruch R. Alt F.W. Guarente L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33583-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). GDH is encoded by a well-conserved 45-kb gene named GLUD1, which is organized into 13 exons (13Michaelidis T.M. Tzimagiorgis G. Moschonas N.K. Papamatheakis J. Genomics. 1993; 16: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A decade ago, clinical data and associated genetic studies revealed GDH as a key enzyme for the control of insulin secretion. Indeed, mutations rendering GDH more active are responsible for a hyperinsulinism syndrome (14Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Mutations producing a less active, or even nonactive, GDH enzyme have not been reported, leaving open the question if such mutations would be either lethal or asymptomatic. Despite these numerous reports on GDH and insulin secretion, abrogation of GDH in ß-cells has not been tested in animal models until now. As a consequence, it is not yet established if GDH is in fact required for normal ß-cell function and glucose homeostasis. Here, we generated transgenic mice lacking GDH specifically in ß-cells and questioned the putative requirement of GDH for ß-cell function as well as the consequences of GDH abrogation on glucose homeostasis. Transgene Cloning—By screening a RPCI-22 mouse 129 BAC library (MRC Genome Resource Facility, The Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) with a cDNA probe corresponding to human GLUD1 exons 6–8, we obtained two fragments, respectively, of 6 and 10 kb comprising the sequence of Glud1 exon 7. Successively, three DNA fragments of the 129 SvJ Glud1 locus were inserted into the cloning sites of the targeting vector. They comprised 3 kb of the region upstream Glud1 exon 7 (short arm), 0.6 kb of the region containing Glud1 exon 7, and 5.6 kb of the region downstream Glud1 exon 7 (long arm). The three fragments were obtained by PCR using a RPCI-22 129 BAC clone as template and ligated into the KSloxPfrtNeoBS (3′-5′) vector (15Bonnafe E. Touka M. AitLounis A. Baas D. Barras E. Ucla C. Moreau A. Flamant F. Dubruille R. Couble P. Collignon J. Durand B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4417-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The resulting targeting construct contained two loxP sites flanking Glud1 exon 7, one frt-flanked neomycin resistance cassette, and two homology arms. Generation of Glud1lox/lox Mouse—The targeting vector (15 μg) was linearized at the single SacII site and electroporated into three batches of 1.7 × 107 R1 ES cells, a cell line derived from (129/Sv × 129/Sv-CP)F1 3.5-day blastocysts (16Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Cells were then cultured in the presence of G418 (0.7 mg/ml) for 6 days. Homologous recombination events were identified by PCR and Southern blot analyses, see supporting information. Correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and implanted into recipient females (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden). Resulting chimeric mice (F0) were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice and germline transmission into F1 was assessed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. The Glud1lox/lox mouse line was obtained following deletion of the frt-flanked neomycin resistance cassette by crossing heterozygous with Flpe deleter mice (17Rodriguez C.I. Buchholz F. Galloway J. Sequerra R. Kasper J. Ayala R. Stewart A.F. Dymecki S.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Generation ßGlud1–/– Mouse—Glud1 floxed animals were crossed with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under a rat insulin promoter (18Herrera P.L. Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous ßGlud1–/+ were then bred with homozygous Glud1lox/lox to obtain homozygous ßGlud1–/– mice. Mice were maintained on a mixed (C57BL/6J × 129/Sv) genetic background. Mouse breeding and handling was carried out in our local certified animal facility according to procedures that were approved by the Animal Care and Experimentation authorities of the Canton of Geneva. Genotyping and Immunoblotting—Transgenic animals were identified by PCR on genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies (Genelute Mammalian Genomic DNA kit, Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland). Primers (purchased from Microsynth GmbH, Baglach, Switzerland) used to genotype floxed mice were: 5′-TGTAATGTGTCTGTGTGTCAC and 5′-CTAAGGACCCAGACAGTGG (86-bp fragment). Primers to genotype RIP-Cre mice were: 5′-TAAGGCTAAGTAGAGGTGT and 5′-TCCATGGTGATACAAGGGAC (350-bp fragment). GDH protein was analyzed by immunoblotting as described (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) on 13% SDS-PAGE that was run using 10 μg of proteins from pancreatic islet extract or standards of purified bovine GDH (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Immunohistochemistry—Adult mouse pancreata were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde before embedding in paraffin and 5-μm thick tissue sections were mounted on adhesive-coated slides. Pancreata sections were incubated with a diluted primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, and with an appropriate Cy3-(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, WestGrove, PA) or ALEXA-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) anti-IgG serum for 1 h. The antibodies and their dilution used in the present analysis were as follows: guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, dilution 1/400), rabbit anti-glucagon (Dako, Carpinteria, CA; dilution 1/100). Sections were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with an Axiocam color CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland). Islet morphology was analyzed to discriminate between organized versus disorganized islets. As a criterion, islets with more than 10% α-cells present in the core of the islets were considered as disorganized. Pancreatic Islets Isolation and Adenoviral Treatment—Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and cultured free-floating in RPMI 1640 medium before use. For rescue experiments, ectopic expression of hGLUD1 was achieved by transducing islets isolated from ßGlud1–/– with the recombinant adenovirus Ad-GDH over a 90-min period as detailed previously (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and islets were used the next day for secretion assays and control immunoblotting. For acute in vitro GDH knock-out, islets isolated from control and transgenic Glud1lox/lox mice were subjected to adenoviral treatment for 90 min with 0.4 μl/ml of the recombinant adenovirus rAdInsPNCre, thereby enabling expression of nuclear-localized Cre recombinase specifically in ß-cells (20Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Islets transduced with rAdInsPNCre were kept in culture for 3 days before insulin secretion assays. Insulin Secretion and Measurements—Prior to the experiments, islets were maintained for 2 h in glucose-free culture medium. For static incubations, islets were then washed and preincubated further in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH, containing in mm: 135 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Then, batches of 10 islets were hand-picked and incubated as described (21Rubi B. del Arco A. Bartley C. Satrustegui J. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55659-55666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C at basal (2.8 mm) glucose and stimulated with 22.8 mm glucose or 5 mm glutamine plus 10 mm BCH (2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid). At the end of the assay period, islets were resuspended in acid-EtOH to determine their insulin contents. For islets perifusions (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), 10 hand-picked islets were put per chamber of 250 μl volume, thermostatted at 37 °C (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). The flux was set at 0.5 ml/min, and fractions were collected every minute after a 20-min washing period at basal 2.8 mm glucose. In situ pancreatic perfusion was performed in anesthetized mice as described (22Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S99-S102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a 1.5 ml/min perfusion rate. Pancreatic insulin content was determined in mouse pancreata that were first frozen in liquid nitrogen, then homogenized, resuspended in cold acid ethanol, and left at 4 °C for 48 h with sonication after 24 h. Insulin concentration in these different collected samples was measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). A bioluminescent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to measure ATP levels in batches of 10 isolated islets following a 30-min incubation period at 37 °C in the presence of 2.8 and 22.8 mm glucose. The enzymatic activity of GDH in isolated islets was measured as described (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) under the oxidative deamination direction as NADH fluorescence excited at 340 nm and measured at 460 nm in a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). Glucose Tolerance and Insulin Release Tests—Overnight (15 h) fasted mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (3 g/kg body weight). Whole blood was collected from tail vein at times 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 min for glucose level measurements using a glucometer (Glucotrend, Roche Applied Science). Additionally, plasma insulin levels were determined from time 0 and 15-min blood sampling using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). For the insulin tolerance test, overnight fasted mice were injected intraperitoneally with human recombinant insulin (0.75 units/kg body weight, Novo Nordisk Pharma AG, Küsnacht, Switzerland) and glucose levels determined (Glucotrend) in blood collected from the tail vein at the indicated time intervals. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) calculated as follows: fasting glucose (mm) × fasting insulin (milliunits/ml)/22.5 (23Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45874-45879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Circulating glucagon and insulin levels from fed and fasted mice were determined on multiplex suspension array system (Bio-Plex, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Reinach, Switzerland) using LincoPlex kits for mouse hormones (Linco Research Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences between the ßGlud1–/– and the control group were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation of Transgenic Mice—We generated transgenic mice with ß-cell-specific conditional abrogation of GDH using the loxP-flp-recombinase strategy. The targeting vector carried Glud1 (NCBI Access No. P26443) exon 7, comprising the NADH binding site essential for GDH activity (13Michaelidis T.M. Tzimagiorgis G. Moschonas N.K. Papamatheakis J. Genomics. 1993; 16: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), flanked by two loxP sites (Fig. 1A). We cloned 5′ and 3′ regions flanking exon 7 as 3-kb and 5.6-kb fragments, respectively. The targeting vector also contained a neor-cassette (positive marker) flanked by two Flp/frt sites. The resulting founder mice were crossed to obtain F1 mice carrying a mutant Glud1 genomic locus containing the exon 7 flanked by loxP sites and the neor-cassette (Glud1-neor-lox). Next, excision of the neor-cassette by crossing F1 with Flp deleter mice gave rise to mice carrying intact Glud1 exon 7 flanked by loxP sites only (Glud1lox/lox). Constitutive ß-Cell-specific GDH Knock-out—Glud1lox/lox mice were crossed with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of an insulin promoter (RIP), generating mice with ß-cell-specific GDH knock-out (ßGlud1–/–). Allele analysis in different tissues revealed that the 278-bp knock-out allele was detected in pancreas and not in other tissues (Fig. 1B). In particular, we did not detect homologous recombination in the brain following a cross with the RIP-Cre transgenic line used in our study (18Herrera P.L. Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unlike what was reported using another RIP-Cre mouse line (26Ristow M. Mulder H. Pomplun D. Schulz T.J. Muller-Schmehl K. Krause A. Fex M. Puccio H. Muller J. Isken F. Spranger J. Muller-Wieland D. Magnuson M.A. Mohlig M. Koenig M. Pfeiffer A.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At the protein level, immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE on isolated islets (Fig. 1C) showed efficient targeted GDH knock-out, although the lowest unspecific band was unchanged. Some residual expression could be contributed by the non-ß-cells. GDH enzymatic activity was reduced by 60% (p < 0.05) in islets isolated from ßGlud1–/– mice compared with controls (Fig. 1D). The remaining activity corresponds approximately to the proportion of non-ß-cells composing the islets. As control mice, we used Glud1lox/lox animals obtained from the same litters as ßGlud1–/– mice to optimize standardization of the genetic background between the two groups. Phenotype and Pancreatic Secretory Responses of ß-Cell GDH Knockout Mice—Surprisingly, ß-cell-specific GDH knock-out mice were not diabetic, no glucosuria was detected, and the growth and organ weights were normal compared with control mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Based on the unexpected normal development of the animals, despite deletion of GDH in ß-cells, we measured insulin secretion in the in situ pancreatic perfusion preparation (Fig. 2C), a model that integrates paracrine and neuronal effectors of the ß-cell. This physiological model demonstrated clear reduction of the secretory response evoked by 22.8 mm glucose in ßGlud1–/– mice versus controls; both during the first (–48%, p < 0.01) and the second (–37%, p < 0.05) phases (Fig. 2D). The data show that abrogation of the mitochondrial enzyme GDH in ß-cells limits both the phase of secretion commonly associated with the amplifying pathway (second phase) as well as the triggering pathway (first phase). In good agreement with basal versus stimulated insulin secretion measured in the perfused pancreas (Fig. 2C), circulating insulin concentrations were not significantly different in the fasted state, but the increase associated with the fed state was reduced by 55% (p < 0.05) in ßGlud1–/– mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Plasma analysis in control and ßGlud1–/– miceControlaMice of 5-7 months of age.βGlud1-/-aMice of 5-7 months of age.Glucagon (pmol/l) Fast26.3 ± 10.127.8 ± 9.9Insulin (pmol/l) Fed143.3 ± 27.4bp < 0.05 versus fasted mice of corresponding genotype; n = 4-7.65.2 ± 10.5bp < 0.05 versus fasted mice of corresponding genotype; n = 4-7.,cp < 0.05 versus control.

Open table in a new tab Islet Phenotype of Constitutive ß-Cell-specific GDH Knockout—Insulin secretory defects have been associated with modified islet organization in general and infiltration of α-cells within the core of the islet in particular (27Gorogawa S. Fujitani Y. Kaneto H. Hazama Y. Watada H. Miyamoto Y. Takeda K. Akira S. Magnuson M.A. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Hori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we analyzed islet cell distribution by immunostaining on pancreatic sections (Fig. 3, A and B). Most of the control islets (70%) exhibited the expected α- and ß-cell distribution, i.e. insulin ß-cells in the core of the islet and glucagon α-cells forming its periphery. In ßGlud1–/– animals, the percentage of disorganized islets was as high as 67%, revealing α-cells mixed with ß-cells in the core of the islet (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that RIP-Cre transgene does not by itself promote changes in islet morphology (18Herrera P.L. Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic insulin contents were not affected in ßGlud1–/– animals compared with controls (124.1 ± 24.9 and 125.7 ± 9.1 ng/g pancreas of wet mass, respectively), and islets were similarly distributed in the whole pancreas. Functions of the α-cells were apparently not affected by GDH knockout in ß-cells, as revealed by similar plasma glucagon levels between the two groups under fasting (stimulatory) conditions (Table 1). A primary function of mitochondrial metabolism is to produce ATP that is necessary in ß-cells for triggering (first phase) and maintaining (second phase) the secretory response. At this point, it could be hypothesized that ß-cell GDH knock-out would impair the primary function of mitochondrial activation that is to generate ATP and thereby inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. ATP levels were slightly lower under basal glucose concentrations (2.8 mm) in islets of ßGlud1–/– mice. However, upon glucose stimulation (22.8 mm), islet ATP concentrations increased similarly between the two groups (Fig. 3D). GDH knock-out did not affect glucose-induced ATP generation. Interestingly, data suggest that maintenance of basal housekeeping ATP levels under low glucose conditions might be normally contributed by GDH-dependent metabolism. Secretory Responses of Isolated Islets with Constitutive ß-Cell GDH Knock-out—Kinetics of secretory responses were analyzed in perifusion experiments on islets isolated from ßGlud1–/– compared with controls. Basal insulin release measured at 2.8 mm glucose was not affected by the absence of GDH. When stimulated with 22.8 mm glucose, control and ßGlud1–/– islets exhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release (Fig. 4A). However, constitutive abrogation of GDH in ß-cells resulted in markedly reduced secretory responses, both during first phase (–68%, p < 0.01) and second sustained phase (–49%, p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that GDH is essential for the full development of the secretory response. To test if the reduced glucose-evoked insulin release observed in ßGlud1–/– islets was a direct consequence of the absence of GDH, we reintroduced GDH by means of adenoviral transduction (Fig. 4B). Insulin secretion stimulated with 22.8 mm glucose was increased 5.7-fold in control islets (p < 0.01) and only 2.0-fold in ßGlud1–/– islets (p < 0.05). Following ectopic re-expression of GDH in ßGlud1–/– islets, amplitude of the secretory response was rescued to similar levels compared with controls (4.9-fold, p < 0.05). As expected from a previous study (19Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), overexpression of GDH did not significantly modify glucose-induced insulin release compared with control islets (Fig. 4B). Secretory Responses of Isolated Islets with Acute in Vitro ß-Cell GDH Knock-out—To investigate whether abrogation of GDH could induce compensatory pathways in the ß-cells, we also performed acute in vitro knock-out in islets of transgenic floxed mice. Islets isolated from Glud1lox/lox mice were transduced with a recombinant adenovirus (rAdInsPNCre) expressing the Cre recombinase specifically in ß-cells (20Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). PCR analysis demonstrated in vitro homologous recombination resulting in the knock-out of GDH in ß-cells of islets isolated from transgenic Glud1lox/lox mice but not in islets from wild-type animals (Fig. 5A). In control islets, stimulatory glucose concentration (22.8 mm) induced a 4.9-fold (p < 0.05) increase in insulin secretion compared with basal release (Fig. 5B). The secretory response evoked by 22.8 mm glucose was reduced by 38% (p < 0.02) in islets with acute abrogation of GDH. These results are in accordance with knockdown of GDH by antisense approach in insulinoma INS-1E cells (2Maechler P. Carobbio S. Rubi B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Insulin release was also stimulated by a mixture commonly used to specifically induce GDH-dependent insulin secretion (5Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), i.e. 5 mm glutamine plus the l-leucine analogue BCH (10 mm) serving as an allosteric activator of GDH. The resulting amino acid dependent secretory response had a magnitude of 3.2-fold (p < 0.005) in control islets, that was inhibited by 47% (p < 0.03) in knock-out islets. As both acute (Fig. 5) and constitutive (Fig. 4) knock-outs exhibited similar secretion impairments, we can conclude that redundant mechanisms do not exist at the cellular level. Glucose Homeostasis in ß-Cell GDH Knock-out—Parameters related to the control of glucose homeostasis were measured at 2, 5, and 12 months of age. After a 15-h fasting period, glycemia were similar to controls in ßGlud1–/– mice of all tested ages. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT) were performed on 2- and 5-month-old mice. Despite the severe reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in ßGlud1–/– animals (Fig. 2, C and D), blood glucose excursions were similar to controls (Fig. 6, A and E). At 2 months of age, plasma insulin levels measured 15 min following intraperitoneal glucose injection were reduced by 38% (p < 0.001) in ßGlud1–/– mice (Fig. 6C). When performing an insulin tolerance test (ITT) in 2-month-old mice, blood glucose lowering was faster in ßGlud1–/– mice compared with controls (Fig. 6B). Low circulating insulin concentrations associated with accelerated glucose clearance suggested higher sensitivity of peripheral tissues. However, ITT performed in 5-month-old mice did not show significant differences between knock-outs and controls (Fig. 6F). To further investigate insulin sensitivity in 2- and 5-month-old mice, we calculated the HOMA index as a surrogate of euglycemic clamp test (28Ye F. Tao R. Cong W. Tian J. Liu Q. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2008; 70: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, insulin resistance increased with age in both groups (Fig. 6D) and ßGlud1–/– mice exhibited similar HOMA-IR compared with controls. It should be noticed that RIP-Cre transgenic mice used in the present study (18Herrera P.L.

We implied earlier that alpha(1)-AAB might have a mechanistic role and could represent a therapeutic target.To pursue the issue, we performed clinical and basic studies. We observed that 41 of 81 patients with refractory hypertension had alpha(1)-AAB; after immunoadsorption blood pressure was significantly reduced in these patients. Rabbits were immunized to generate alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antibodies (alpha(1)-AB). Patient alpha(1)-AAB and rabbit alpha(1)-AB were purified using affinity chromatography and characterized both by epitope mapping and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor were incubated with patient alpha(1)-AAB and rabbit alpha(1)-AB and the activation of signal transduction pathways was investigated by Western blot, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and gene expression. We found that phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2-IIA) and L-type calcium channel (Cacna1c) genes were upregulated in cardiomyocytes and VSMC after stimulation with both purified antibodies. We showed that patient alpha(1)-AAB and rabbit alpha(1)-AB result in protein kinase C alpha activation and transient extracellular-related kinase (EKR1/2) phosphorylation. Finally, we showed that the antibodies exert acute effects on intracellular Ca(2+) in cardiomyocytes and induce mesentery artery segment contraction.Patient alpha(1)-AAB and rabbit alpha(1)-AB can induce signaling pathways important for hypertension and cardiac remodeling. Our data provide evidence for a potential clinical relevance for alpha(1)-AAB in hypertensive patients, and the notion of immunity as a possible cause of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1980582637,"Higher expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and subsequent activation of telomerase occur during cellular immortalization and are maintained in cancer cells. To understand the mode of hTERT expression in cancer cells, we identified cancer-specific trans-regulatory proteins that interact with the hTERT promoter, using the promoter magnetic precipitation assay coupled with mass spectrometry. The identified proteins include MutS homolog 2 (MSH2), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) D, hnRNP K and grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2). We noticed a higher expression of these proteins in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells than in normal cells, which do not exhibit telomerase activity. Knockdown of MSH2, hnRNP D and GRHL2 resulted in a notable reduction of the hTERT promoter activity in tested cancer cells. Silencing of the above genes resulted in a significant reduction of the telomerase activity in OSCC cells. Interestingly, among the four identified genes, silencing of GRHL2 was essential in reducing telomerase activity and viability of tested cancer cells. These results suggest a possible role of GRHL2 in telomerase activation during cellular immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W1972385101,"Background Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with increased future risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that young LBW men have reduced skeletal muscle expression of PI3K p85α regulatory subunit and p110β catalytic subunit, PKCζ and GLUT4 in the fasting state. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signalling pathways is altered in skeletal muscle of young adult men with LBW. Methods Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from 20 healthy 19-yr old men with BW</ = 10th percentile for gestational age (LBW) and 20 normal birth weight controls (NBW), matched for physical fitness and whole-body glucose disposal, prior to (fasting state) and following a 4-hr hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (insulin stimulated state). Expression and phosphorylation of selected proteins was determined by Western blotting. Principal Findings Insulin stimulated expression of aPKCζ (p<0.001) and Akt1 (p<0.001) was decreased in muscle of LBW men when compared to insulin stimulated controls. LBW was associated with increased insulin stimulated levels of IRS1 (p<0.05), PI3K p85α (p<0.001) and p110β (p<0.05) subunits, while there was no significant change in these proteins in insulin stimulated control muscle. In addition LBW had reduced insulin stimulated phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (p<0.01), indicative of reduced Akt signalling. Insulin stimulated expression/phosphorylation of all the MAPK proteins studied [p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-ERK (Thr 202/Tyr204), JNK1, JNK2 and phospho-JNK (Thr 183/Tyr185)] was not different between groups. Conclusions We conclude that altered insulin activation of the PI3K/Akt but not the MAPK pathway precedes and may contribute to development of whole-body insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in men with LBW."
https://openalex.org/W2070042548,"Proteorhodopsins (PRs), photoactive retinylidene membrane proteins ubiquitous in marine eubacteria, exhibit light-driven proton transport activity similar to that of the well studied bacteriorhodopsin from halophilic archaea. However, unlike bacteriorhodopsin, PRs have a single highly conserved histidine located near the photoactive site of the protein. Time-resolved Fourier transform IR difference spectroscopy combined with visible absorption spectroscopy, isotope labeling, and electrical measurements of light-induced charge movements reveal participation of His-75 in the proton translocation mechanism of PR. Substitution of His-75 with Ala or Glu perturbed the structure of the photoactive site and resulted in significantly shifted visible absorption spectra. In contrast, His-75 substitution with a positively charged Arg did not shift the visible absorption spectrum of PR. The mutation to Arg also blocks the light-induced proton transfer from the Schiff base to its counterion Asp-97 during the photocycle and the acid-induced protonation of Asp-97 in the dark state of the protein. Isotope labeling of histidine revealed that His-75 undergoes deprotonation during the photocycle in the proton-pumping (high pH) form of PR, a reaction further supported by results from H75E. Finally, all His-75 mutations greatly affect charge movements within the PR and shift its pH dependence to acidic values. A model of the proteorhodopsin proton transport process is proposed as follows: (i) in the dark state His-75 is positively charged (protonated) over a wide pH range and interacts directly with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97; and (ii) photoisomerization-induced transfer of the Schiff base proton to the Asp-97 counterion disrupts its interaction with His-75 and triggers a histidine deprotonation.

A variety of unicellular microorganisms contain primary proton pumps that convert solar energy into a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient, which is subsequently used by membrane ATP synthases to generate chemical energy. Well known examples of such pumps are the haloarchaeal rhodopsins, photoactive, seven-helix membrane proteins, which include the well studied proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) 4The abbreviations used are: BR, bacteriorhodopsin; FTIR, Fourier Transform IR; PR, proteorhodopsin; GPR, green-absorbing proteorhodopsin; OG, octyl glucoside; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. from Halobacterium salinarum and BR homologs in other haloarchaea. Recently, a much larger new family of light-driven proton pumps, the proteorhodopsins (PRs), was identified in marine proteobacteria throughout the oceans (1Beja O. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Suzuki M.T.

Science.. 2004; 304: 66-74Google Scholar). Despite the diverse properties of PRs, including different visible absorption maxima and photocycle rates (4Beja O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Leclerc M. DeLong E.F. Nature.. 2001; 411: 786-789Google Scholar, 5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Beja O.

Chem... 2003; 278: 33985-33991Google Scholar), they all share with BR several key conserved residues as well as an all-trans-retinylidene chromophore in their unphotolyzed state, which is covalently bound to transmembrane helix G via a protonated Schiff base linkage. Many of the molecular events that occur in PRs following light activation are similar to those of BR, including an initial ultrafast all-trans→13-cis-retinal isomerization, which triggers a sequence of protein conformational changes, including several intramolecular proton transfer reactions. The two key carboxylate groups involved in proton pumping in helix C of BR are conserved in PRs, and in the first found and most commonly studied PR, the Monterey Bay variant eBAC31A08, also known as green-absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR), the helix C residues Asp-97 and Glu-108 undergo protonation changes during the photocycle similar to those of the homologous carboxylate residues in BR. Initial FTIR studies on GPR identified the role of Asp-97 as the Schiff base counterion and proton acceptor during Schiff base deprotonation and concomitant M formation and Glu-108 as the proton donor that reprotonates the Schiff base during N formation (7Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 321: 821-838Google Scholar, 8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). Studies of other variants indicate these roles of the two carboxylic acid residues are general in the proteorhodopsin family. 5V. B. Bergo, R. Partha, E. N. Spudich, and J. L. Spudich, unpublished results. One major difference between BR and the PRs is the presence of a highly conserved histidine residue at position 75, near the middle of transmembrane helix B in the latter pigments. The His-75 homolog is not present in BR nor thus far found in other microbial rhodopsins (9Sharma A.K. Spudich J.L. Doolittle W.F. Trends Microbiol... 2006; 14: 463-469Google Scholar). The proximity of His-75 to the protein active site and specifically to the Schiff base counterion Asp-97 inferred from the x-ray crystal structure of BR suggests its involvement in spectral tuning of the visible absorption (10Rangarajan R. Galan J.F. Whited G. Birge R.R. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 12679-12686Google Scholar) and potentially PR photochemical reactions. Because the pKa of histidine in solution is close to neutral pH (11Tanokura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1983; 742: 576-585Google Scholar), its imidazole group often plays a major role in intramolecular proton transfers in enzymes, including NADPH oxidase (12Mankelow T.J. Henderson L.M. Protoplasma.. 2003; 221: 101-108Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (13LeBrun L.A. Park D.H. Ramaswamy S. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 3014-3026Google Scholar), carbonic anhydrase II (14Fisher Z. Hernandez Prada J.A. Tu C. Duda D. Yoshioka C. An H. Govindasamy L. Silverman D.N. McKenna R. Biochemistry.. 2005; 44: 1097-1105Google Scholar), and serine proteases (15Bruylants G. Redfield C. Bartik K. Chem Bio Chem... 2007; 8: 51-54Google Scholar). In this study we have used a combination of time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy, visible absorption spectroscopy, isotope labeling, kinetic charge displacement measurements, and site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of His-75 in GPR. We report evidence that protonated His-75 interacts directly with Asp-97 in the unphotolyzed protein and during the photocycle undergoes a deprotonation in response to the protonation of Asp-97. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Monterey Bay eBAC31A08 variant of PR (also designated as green-absorbing PR (GPR)) cloned in a pBAD-TOPO® (Invitrogen) vector was used to construct the mutants H75A, H75E, and H75R using Stratagene Quik-Change® (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant PR were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli strain UT5600 using the pBAD-TOPO® plasmid as described elsewhere (1Beja O. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Suzuki M.T. Hadd A. Nguyen L.P. Jovanovich S.B. Gates C.M. Feldman R.A. Spudich J.L. Spudich E.N. DeLong E.F. Science.. 2000; 289: 1902-1906Google Scholar). Cultures grown overnight were diluted to 1:50 and grown to 0.4 absorbance units at 600 nm at 37 °C. At this stage, the cells were induced with 0.2% (+)-l-arabinose for 3 h at 37 °C. For flash photolysis and proton pumping experiments, 5 μm (final concentration) all-trans-retinal was added with the (+)-l-arabinose. Procedures for purification of His-tagged PR and its reconstitution in E. coli polar lipids were similar to those used previously (16Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Google Scholar). After the induction period, the cells expressing PR were centrifuged at 1000 × g, resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and disrupted by sonication. The membranes containing pigment were collected by centrifugation (39,000 × g, 30 min) and solubilized in a wash buffer (50 mm KPi, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1.5% octyl glucoside (OG), pH 7.0) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Unsolubilized membranes were removed by centrifugation at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with a His-binding resin on a shaker at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The bound resin was washed with 3× volumes of wash buffer followed by elution buffer (50 mm KPi, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 1.0% OG, pH 7.0). Purified His-tagged PR was reconstituted in the E. coli polar lipids (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) at 1:10 protein-to-lipid (w/w) ratio. Lipids initially dissolved in chloroform were dried under argon and resuspended in the dialysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) to which OG was added to the final concentration of 1%. The lipid solution was incubated with the OG-solubilized protein for 1 h on ice and dialyzed against the dialysis buffer with three buffer changes every 24 h. The reconstituted protein was centrifuged for 15 min and resuspended in the sample buffer (50 mm CHES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 9.5). Protein Isotope Labeling—Wild-type and H75E mutant PR was heterologously expressed in the histidine auxotroph E. coli strain JM1100 using the pBAD-TOPO® plasmid. The JM1100 strain was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. The histidine-labeling protocol (17Venter H. Ashcroft A.E. Keen J.N. Henderson P.J. Herbert R.B. Biochem. J... 2002; 363: 243-252Google Scholar) was modified as described previously (18Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2001; 20: 71-75Google Scholar) to minimize the consumption of labeled media. Briefly, E. coli cultures were grown in 0.5-liter volume using LB medium to the cell density of at least 0.4 absorbance units at 600 nm, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, washed with an equal volume of 1× M9 medium (Sigma), and transferred to an equal volume of minimal growth medium (18Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2001; 20: 71-75Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μm U-13C6-l-histidine (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Andover, MA) or alternatively nonlabeled l-histidine (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h to remove unlabeled metabolites. The cells were subsequently induced with 0.2% (+)-l-arabinose to which 5 μm (final concentration) all-trans-retinal was added and incubated for additional 5 h. In a control experiment, cell cultures transferred to the minimal growth medium lacking histidine did not exhibit any detectable protein expression (data not shown). The label incorporation was verified by comparing the absolute absorption FTIR spectra of unlabeled and labeled protein samples (data not shown). To demonstrate the absence of isotope label scrambling, purified PR samples were digested with trypsin and sequenced using an ABI 4800 Plus matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The mass and peptide fragmentation pattern obtained from the internal fragment GVWIETGDSPTVFR (amino acids 81–94), which does not contain a histidine residue, was identical between the labeled and nonlabeled protein samples (supplemental Fig. 1). The data indicate that the 13C isotope label was not transferred to other amino acids. FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—Protein films were prepared by depositing 5–10 ml of the proteoliposome suspension in the sample buffer, pH 9.5, onto a polished 2-mm thick, 25-mm diameter CaF2 window (Wilmad, Buena, NJ) and drying the sample under a gentle stream of argon. Films were rehydrated via the vapor phase and then sealed in a temperature-controlled IR cell (model TFC, Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY) using a second CaF2 window. Rapid scan time-resolved FTIR spectra were recorded with a Bruker IFS 66 v/s FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany) at 5 °C as described previously (19Bergo V.B. Ntefidou M. Trivedi V.D. Amsden J.J. Kralj J.M. Rothschild K.J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 15208-15214Google Scholar) at 4 cm–1 spectral resolution and 240-kHz scanner velocity corresponding to the data acquisition window of 18 ms. Between 10 and 20 individual spectra were averaged to produce the final spectrum. The low temperature FTIR measurements were performed using a Bio-Rad FTS-60A FTIR spectrometer (BioRad, Digilab Division, Cambridge, MA) (20Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 2823-2830Google Scholar). Charge Movements—Laser flash-induced charge movements in GPR and its mutant forms were recorded in suspensions of E. coli cells expressing the rhodopsins as described (21Sineshchekov O.A. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci... 2004; 3: 548-554Google Scholar). Visible Absorption of His-75 Mutants at Acidic and Alkaline pH—PR mutants were prepared in which His-75 was replaced with a neutral (Ala), acidic (Glu), or basic (Arg) residue. The formation of a pigment was observed for all substitutions, although the protein yield was lower in the case of H75E and H75R. The H75R mutant also exhibited more rapid bleaching, possibly because of destabilization of the retinal-binding pocket. Visible spectra of the wild-type and mutant PRs were recorded using octyl glucoside-solubilized purified protein (Fig. 1). In agreement with earlier reports (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Beja O. EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Google Scholar), the spectrum of wild-type GPR has a visible absorption maximum near 522 nm at pH 9, which is red-shifted to 545 nm at pH 5. This shift is attributable to the spectral transition due to protonation of the Schiff base counterion Asp-97 at acidic pH (7Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 321: 821-838Google Scholar, 8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). A similar transition also occurs in H75A and H75E GPR. However, the H75A absorption maximum is blue-shifted from the wild-type pigment by 11 nm at pH 9 and red-shifted by 11 nm at pH 5. As a result, the mutant undergoes a considerably larger shift between the acidic and alkaline forms. In the case of the H75E mutant, the absorption is blue-shifted from the wild type by 11 nm at pH 9 and by 9 nm at pH 5, possibly reflecting protonation changes of the glutamate residue (see below). These results support the earlier conclusion that His-75 plays an important role in the color regulation of PR (10Rangarajan R. Galan J.F. Whited G. Birge R.R. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 12679-12686Google Scholar). Most interesting is the effect of the substitution of His-75 by Arg. At high pH, this mutation has no effect on the visible absorption unlike H75E and H75A. At low pH, the substitution prevents the normal red shift apparently by blocking the protonation of the Schiff base counterion Asp-97. A similar effect was observed by substituting positively charged lysine at this position (10Rangarajan R. Galan J.F. Whited G. Birge R.R. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 12679-12686Google Scholar). As described below, the light-induced transfer of the Schiff base proton to Asp-97 is also blocked during M formation when the Schiff base proton is normally transferred to Asp-97. Interaction between the Counterion Asp-97 and His-75—To explore the effect of His-75 on the protein changes, which occur upon light activation, FTIR difference spectra of the wild-type and mutant GPR were measured in the millisecond time window using rapid-scan spectroscopy (19Bergo V.B. Ntefidou M. Trivedi V.D. Amsden J.J. Kralj J.M. Rothschild K.J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 15208-15214Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The wild-type spectra are very similar to those reported previously (7Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 321: 821-838Google Scholar, 8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). Negative bands reflecting vibrations in the unphotolyzed PR state appear in the configurationally sensitive C-C stretch region characteristic of the all-trans-retinal chromophore at 1198 (–), 1235 (–), and 1252 (–) cm–1, whereas positive bands at 1170 and 1187 cm–1 arise from the formation of a mixture of late photocycle intermediates similar to the M, N, and O intermediates in BR (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). The negative ethylenic band at 1537 cm–1 agrees with the expected position based on an empirical inverse correlation of vibrational frequency and visible absorption wavelength (see Ref. 16Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Google Scholar and references therein). Strong bands appear in the amide I region at 1689 (+), 1660 (+), and 1674 (–) cm–1 reflecting mainly protein backbone movements (7Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 321: 821-838Google Scholar). In the carboxylic acid region, a positive band at 1757 cm–1 in the wild-type PR arises from protonation of the counterion Asp-97, which accepts a proton from the Schiff base during the formation of the M intermediate (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). The pair of bands at 1727 (–)/1742 (+) cm–1 reflects a change in hydrogen bond strength of Glu-108. Similarly to Asp-96 in BR, this group functions as a proton donor to the Schiff base (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar) and is expected to undergo a transient deprotonation during the decay of the M intermediate as in BR (22Bousché O. Sonar S. Krebs M.P. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol... 1992; 56: 1085-1096Google Scholar). H75E and H75A—These mutations do not cause large perturbations in the FTIR difference spectra. However, evidence is found for changes in the protein environments of both the Schiff base proton acceptor Asp-97 and the proton donor Glu-108 as well as altered kinetics of the late photocycle. The positive peak at 1757 cm–1 in the wild-type GPR difference spectra is upshifted by ∼3 cm–1 in H75A (Fig. 2B, middle trace) and to a smaller degree in the H75E mutant (Fig. 2B, bottom trace) indicating a more hydrophobic hydrogen-bonding environment of the protonated counterion in the light-activated pigment (23Nie B. Stutzman J. Xie A. Biophys. J... 2005; 88: 2833-2847Google Scholar). Note that this frequency upshift does not appear to result from changes in the relative concentrations of the late photointermediates (see below) because the 1757 cm–1 peak undergoes a downshift during the late photocycle in wild-type PR (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). The negative 1727 cm–1 peak associated with Glu-108 is still present in both the mutant spectra, but the 1742 cm–1 positive peak appears absent. The absence of a positive peak indicates that Glu-108 does not reprotonate until reformation of the unphotolyzed PR state in the His-75 mutants. Finally, a new negative peak appears near 1715 cm–1 in H75E but does not in H75A spectra. Its frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a glutamic acid side chain located in a hydrophilic environment (23Nie B. Stutzman J. Xie A. Biophys. J... 2005; 88: 2833-2847Google Scholar). Thus, this band most likely reflects deprotonation of the Glu residue introduced at position 75, in response to protonation of Asp-97. As discussed below, a similar deprotonation of His-75 is indicated on the basis of isotope labeling His-75 in the wild-type pigment. In addition to the carboxylate peaks, the H75A and H75E mutations cause changes in the retinal fingerprint and ethylenic stretching regions. In particular, the increase of intensity of the 1187 cm–1 peak assigned to photointermediate(s) containing the 13-cis chromophore (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar) is observed in the mutants (Fig. 2C) indicating altered kinetics of the retinal reisomerization to the all-trans form. Also, the split of the 1537 cm–1 negative band (Fig. 2A) resulting in two minima at 1530 and 1541 cm–1 can be explained by appearance of a positive band with a frequency close to 1537 cm–1, most likely due to accumulation of an intermediate with the chromophore C=C stretching vibration close to that of the unphotolyzed state. Changes in the photocycle kinetics evident from the decay rates of FTIR difference bands show that both H75A and H75E mutants exhibit significantly faster return to the protein initial state (Fig. 3A). The analysis of absorption changes in the visible range (16Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Google Scholar) also reveals an accelerated photocycle (Fig. 3B), although the rate of dark state recovery, which is monitored at 500 nm, appears to be more similar between H75A and wild-type GPR. The differences from the FTIR data may be attributable to the different sample properties (hydrated proteoliposome films versus E. coli cell suspensions). Also the final intermediate in the PR photocycle may have absorption very close to that of the unphotolyzed state, and therefore its decay may not produce a pronounced absorption change at this wavelength (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). In any case, both measurements show acceleration of the photocycle by the His-75 mutations. H75R—This mutation had the most drastic effect on the FTIR difference spectra relative to wild-type spectra (Fig. 4). In the first 50 ms (top trace), a strong 1525 cm–1 (+) ethylenic band appears along with a retinal fingerprint peak near 1183 cm–1 (+). Both peaks are characteristic of the early K-like intermediate (16Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Google Scholar) and are also present in the low temperature static H75R spectra recorded at 215 K, where the transition to subsequent intermediates is blocked (Fig. 4, 2nd trace). However, additional bands also appear in this time period, which are similar to peaks in wild-type late photocycle difference spectra, including the 1689 (+)/1697 (–) cm–1 bands assigned to Asn-230 (16Bergo V. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Google Scholar) and 1187 (+) cm–1 peak assigned to the retinal C-C stretch mode (7Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 321: 821-838Google Scholar). The later (200 ms) time traces show a decrease of the 1525 and 1183 cm–1 bands and concomitant appearance of bands typical of the late photocycle such as the 1554 cm–1 peak (Fig. 4, 3rd trace) reflecting spectral transition from K to the late photocycle intermediates (Fig. 4, bottom trace). One of the most striking features of H75R difference spectra in both early (50 ms) and late (200 ms) traces as well as the low temperature static spectra is the complete absence of the 1757-cm–1 band assigned to the protonation of the Asp-97 counterion. This indicates that the H75R substitution blocks proton transfer from the Schiff base to Asp-97, a key molecular event in PR and almost all other microbial rhodopsins except in cases where the counterion is protonated such as sensory rhodopsin I (24Rath P. Spudich E. Neal D.D. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 6690-6696Google Scholar), not present such as halorhodopsin (25Rothschild K.J. Bousché O. Braiman M.S. Hasselbacher C.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry.. 1988; 27: 2420-2424Google Scholar), or the proton transfer occurs in the opposite direction as in a C-terminally truncated form of the Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (21Sineshchekov O.A. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci... 2004; 3: 548-554Google Scholar, 26Sineshchekov O.A. Spudich E.N. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J... 2006; 91: 4519-4527Google Scholar). The appearance of late photocycle intermediates in the H75R photocycle indicates that the absence of Asp-97 protonation cannot be attributed to a photocycle that is completely blocked in the K intermediate stage. Interestingly, a band is still present in the carboxylic acid region near 1724 (–) cm–1 indicating that protonation changes involving Glu-108 (see above) occur in this mutant despite the absence of a Schiff base proton transfer. Proton Transfer in His-75 Mutants—Proton transport is greatly affected in all His-75 mutants (Fig. 5). Although both wild-type GPR and H75A exhibit outward charge movements indicative of the Schiff base proton transfer to Asp-97 and reprotonation of the Schiff base, the overall proton translocation is inhibited by at least 50% in the mutant. H75E shows a complex kinetics involving both outward and inward charge movements, whereas mutation of His-75 to Arg completely eliminates light-induced proton transfer. The lack of proton transfers in the latter mutant correlates with the absence of the 1757-cm–1 band in the FTIR spectra and further supports the finding that H75R substitution blocks proton transfer from the Schiff base to Asp-97. The blocking of proton transfer is also confirmed by visible flash-induced absorption changes. Laser flash photolysis shows no absorption change at 400 nm (Fig. 6), a wavelength indicative of the Schiff base-deprotonated intermediate M. Rather, depletion of the unphotolyzed pigment band monitored at 500 nm results in transient appearance of a red-shifted species not preceded by M formation. The pH dependences of absorption changes and charge movements in H75A and H75E are acid-shifted as compared with wild type by ∼0.5 and ∼0.7 units, correspondingly (data not shown). The shift in pKa of Asp-97 in H75R mutant is evidently greater because color changes are not observed down to pH 5. Further acidification led to precipitation of the protein. Effects of mutations on the pKa of Asp-97 support the conclusion discussed below of direct interaction of His-75 and Asp-97. Protonation Changes of His-75 during the Photocycle—To identify difference bands that arise from structural changes of His-75 in the FTIR spectra, the wild-type protein was uniformly labeled with [13C6]histidine (see “Experimental Procedures”), and spectra were compared with nonlabeled PR. Except for the recombinant C-terminal His6 tag, which is not perturbed by photoactivation (see below), His-75 is the only histidine residue in the GPR sequence; therefore, any spectral changes observed can be unambiguously assigned to His-75 vibrations. The labeled and unlabeled spectra closely resemble each other as expected because isotope labeling should not alter the structure or conformational changes that GPR undergoes during the photocycle (Fig. 7, top and middle traces). However, reproducible changes were detected in several spectral regions that are characteristic of histidine side-chain vibrations (27Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers.. 1990; 30: 1259-1271Google Scholar, 28Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Google Scholar, 29Hasegawa K. Ono T. Noguchi T. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2000; 104: 4253-4265Google Scholar). The negative signal near 1610 cm–1 is reduced in the [13C6]histidine PR spectrum, consistent with existence of a small negative band at this frequency, which is altered because of histidine labeling. The spectra of fully protonated HisH+2 exhibit a strong C4–C5 mode near 1631 cm–1 that shifts to lower frequency upon increased hydrogen bonding (28Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Google Scholar, 29Hasegawa K. Ono T. Noguchi T. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2000; 104: 4253-4265Google Scholar). In contrast, this mode is considerably weaker and appears below 1600 cm–1 in the spectra of neutral HisH. Because 13C labeling downshifts the C4—C5 band by as much as 38 cm–1 (28Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Google Scholar), the likely assignment of the 1610 cm–1 (–) peak is to fully protonated His-75 in the PR initial state. A similar assignment of the 1617 cm–1 peak to HisH+2 in the FTIR difference spectra of photosystem II was suggested on the basis of 13C His labeling by Hienerwadel et al. (28Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Google Scholar). Our results do not rule out the possibility that histidine difference bands also appear at higher frequency. Although no reproducible spectral changes because of the isotope labeling were found between 1630 and 1650 cm–1 (supplemental Fig. 2), weaker bands in this region may be obscured by larger noise resulting from the strong background water absorption. Substitution with [13C6]histidine also results in disappearance of a small band at 1108 cm–1 (+) superimposed on top of a larger positive peak, which is not affected by the labeling. The strong C-N stretching mode of the imidazole ring near 1100 cm–1 is not significantly affected by the environment, such as ligand binding, and therefore serves as a highly specific IR marker of the histidine protonation state (30Noguchi T. Inoue Y. Tang X.S. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 10187-10195Google Scholar). This band is found at 1102–1108 cm–1 in the spectra of HisH (N3-protonated nitrogen), and at 1088–1094 cm–1 in HisH+2 (29Hasegawa K. Ono T. Noguchi T. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2000; 104: 4253-4265Google Scholar, 30Noguchi T. Inoue Y. Tang X.S. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 10187-10195Google Scholar). On this basis, we assign the observed spectral feature to the C-N stretching vibration of neutral His-75 in the PR light-activated state. Isotope labeling also affects the peak near 1268 cm–1, which has different intensity in the spectra of protonated and neutral histidine (29Hasegawa K. Ono T. Noguchi T. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2000; 104: 4253-4265Google Scholar). The isotope-induced spectral changes at 1108 (+) and 1610 (–) cm–1 indicate that His-75 undergoes a structural change during the late photocycle consistent with its deprotonation. Confirming that these spectral differences are attributable to His-75, and not to the His6-terminal tag, the spectra of isotope-labeled and unlabeled H75E mutant of PR, which has a photocycle similar to the wild-type, do not exhibit the differences at 1108, 1268, and 1610 cm–1 (Fig. 7, bottom traces). The latter result is not surprising because the solvent-exposed residues in the His6 tag are expected to remain unprotonated because of the high pH (9.5) of the sample buffer. The above results reveal a significant role of His-75, a highly conserved residue in the proteorhodopsin family, on spectral tuning and photochemical reactions of GPR. In the predicted folding structure (Fig. 8), this residue is located near the middle of transmembrane helix B. An x-ray crystal structure of a PR is not available, but substituting a histidine residue for the homologous residue Met-56 into the crystal structure of bacteriorhodopsin (31Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 291: 899-911Google Scholar) predicts that His-75 is in a position to directly interact with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97 (Fig. 8, inset), which was previously shown using the energy minimization method (10Rangarajan R. Galan J.F. Whited G. Birge R.R. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 12679-12686Google Scholar). This proximity suggests that the protonation state of His-75 would have a significant effect on various properties of PR, including its color (e.g. visible absorption spectrum) and photocycle. Furthermore, because histidine has a near-neutral pKa, a protonated form may form a salt bridge with the negative counterion. Our results indicate that His-75 does interact directly with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97 and exists in a protonated state even at pH as high as 9. The evidence includes the information below. His-75 When Substituted with a Positively Charged Arg Does Not Shift the Visible Absorption—The absence of a shift is especially significant in view of the related result that the substitutions H75A and H75E both substantially affect the λmax of PR in the low pH (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Beja O. EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Google Scholar) and high pH (9Sharma A.K. Spudich J.L. Doolittle W.F. Trends Microbiol... 2006; 14: 463-469Google Scholar) forms. Given that the substitution of Arg for His is not structurally conservative unless His carries a positive charge like Arg, this result indicates that His-75 exists in unphotolyzed GPR in a protonated form. H75R Blocks the Acid-induced Protonation of the Schiff Base Counterion Asp-97—This result would be explained if Arg-75 interacted directly with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97, thereby preventing it from undergoing a protonation, which normally occurs at low pH. This would occur if the Asp-97 salt bridge with Arg-75 is more stable than that with His-75, effectively preventing Asp-97 protonation at pH 5. An earlier study has shown that the elevated pKa of Asp-97 compared with the homologous residue in BR most likely results from a weaker interaction between the carboxylate group and Arg-94 because of a larger distance between these residues (32Partha R. Krebs R. Caterino T.L. Braiman M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1708: 6-12Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the replacement of nearby His-75 with an arginine restores a strong Asp-97-arginine counterion interaction, which would significantly lower the pKa of Asp-97. The pKa of Asp-97 is shifted to more acidic values in each of the three His-75 substitutions made, further supporting a salt-bridge interaction between His-75 and Asp-97 that raises the Asp-97 pKa. His-75 Mutations Have Strong Effects on the Schiff Base Counterion in the Light-activated Protein—In addition to the effect described above, Asp-97 does not appear to undergo a protonation reaction during the H75R photocycle. Instead, the decay of the early K-like intermediate is significantly prolonged, and no photointermediate possessing deprotonated Schiff base is detected. The H75A and H75E substitutions seem to be less perturbing and do not block the counterion protonation. However, the environment of Asp-97 is more hydrophobic in these mutants. Histidine Isotope Labeling and the Substitution with Glu-75 Indicate That His-75 Undergoes a Deprotonation during the Photocycle—These findings favor a model whereby the protonation of the counterion Asp-97 disrupts its interaction with His-75, thereby causing His-75 to deprotonate. Such a mechanism may be a part of the overall proton ejection pathway. In fact, the initial study performed under similar pH as this study showed existence of a fast proton release in PR coincident with the formation of M, leading to the suggestion that the PR mechanism may involve different groups than those in BR (33Krebs R.A. Alexiev U. Partha R. DeVita A. Braiman M.S. BMC Physiol... 2002; 2: 5Google Scholar). However, in another study performed at lower pH, proton release to the extracellular medium was not observed in GPR until after M formation (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar), suggesting that under certain conditions there may exist a delay in His-75 deprotonation, or alternatively there may be additional residues acting as a relay in the proton ejection pathway. One possibility is Glu-142, which has recently been found to exist in a protonated state in GPR but in an ionized state in blue-absorbing proteorhodopsin (34Kralj J.M. Bergo V.B. Amsden J.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 3447-3453Google Scholar). It is notable that the molecular changes because of His-75 mutations extend outside the Schiff base region and affect Glu-108 on the protein cytoplasmic side. Similar to BR, a proton transfer pathway exists in the late photocycle intermediates of GPR that connects Glu-108 to the Schiff base (8Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Google Scholar). This structure is likely to be altered in the mutants, which causes Glu-108 reprotonation to be delayed until the end of the photocycle. On the other hand, the mutations do not change the environment of Glu-108 in the initial state of the protein as evident from the identical frequency of the negative band assigned to this residue (1727 cm–1) in the wild-type and mutant PRs. The presence of Glu-108 predominantly in the unprotonated form is in agreement with the observed larger accumulation of the 13-cis photointermediates in the mutants. This correlation is analogous to BR where the 13-cis→all-trans chromophore isomerization does not occur until re-protonation of the homologous group Asp-96 (22Bousché O. Sonar S. Krebs M.P.

https://openalex.org/W1989388991,"Background Infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary event in the multi-step process of cervical carcinogenesis. Little is known about the natural history of HPV infection among unscreened young adults. As prophylactic vaccines are being developed to prevent specifically HPV 16 and 18 infections, shifts in prevalence in the post vaccine era may be expected. This study provides a unique opportunity to gather baseline data before changes by nationwide vaccination occur. Methods and Principal Findings This cross-sectional study is part of a large prospective epidemiologic study performed among 2065 unscreened women aged 18 to 29 years. Women returned a self-collected cervico-vaginal specimen and filled out a questionnaire. All HPV DNA-positive samples (by SPF10 DEIA) were genotyped using the INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping assay. HPV point prevalence in this sample was 19%. Low and high risk HPV prevalence was 9.1% and 11.8%, respectively. A single HPV-type was detected in 14.9% of all women, while multiple types were found in 4.1%. HPV-types 16 (2.8%) and 18 (1.4%) were found concomitantly in only 3 women (0.1%). There was an increase in HPV prevalence till 22 years. Multivariate analysis showed that number of lifetime sexual partners was the most powerful predictor of HPV positivity, followed by type of relationship, frequency of sexual contact, age, and number of sexual partners over the past 6 months. Conclusions and Significance This study shows that factors independently associated with HPV prevalence are mainly related to sexual behaviour. Combination of these results with the relative low prevalence of HPV 16 and/or 18 may be promising for expanding the future target group for catch up vaccination. Furthermore, these results provide a basis for research on possible future shifts in HPV genotype prevalence, and enable a better estimate of the effect of HPV 16-18 vaccination on cervical cancer incidence."

Moreover, P/CAF exists as an acetylated protein in vivo. P/CAF is autoacetylated and acetylated by p300 but not by CBP.

In addition to its acetyltransferase activity, P/CAF has intrinsic ubiquitination activity, which is important in controlling Hdm2 protein levels (23Linares L.K. Kiernan R. Triboulet R.

For example, HAT CBP/p300 is cleaved during apoptosis in the central nervous system (36Rouaux C. Jokic N. Mbebi C. Boutillier S. Loeffler J.P. Boutillier A.L.

Although P/CAF is a nuclear protein, its nuclear localization was reported to change in response to cellular or extracellular signals (17Gregoire S. Xiao L. Nie J. Zhang X. Xu M. Li J. Wong J.

Here, we report that P/CAF localization is regulated by intramolecular autoacetylation. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). HeLa, CV1COS, HTC119, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed either by standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 3 μg of each expression vector or with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed after 14 h and harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were then treated with either a HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) (0, 100, or 150 nm for 12 h); an inhibitor of nuclear export, leptomycin B (20 nm added to the culture medium for 2–8 h); a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (10 μm for 12 h); or dexamethasome (2 μm), followed by collection and analysis. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—P/CAF-(352–832) and P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT were cloned from PCX-GFP-P/CAF(FL)-FLAG and PCX-GFP-P/CAFΔHAT-FLAG (16Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T.

A mutation was introduced at leucine 606 in P/CAF cDNA using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. pcDNA3-HDAC1-FLAG, pcDNA3-HDAC4, and pcDNA3-HDAC2 were previously described (39Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Sekimoto, respectively. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with methanol for 10 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, coverslips were incubated with a 1:200–500 anti-P/CAF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 1:500 anti-acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), and/or 1:100 anti-FLAG (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies in PBS and 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. This was followed by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG, used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS and 3% bovine serum albumin. After each antibody incubation, the coverslips were washed four times for 10 min each time with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature. Cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature were incubated with fluorescent annexin V (Roche Applied Science) for 20 h. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. To distinguish endogenous and ectopic, transfected P/CAF immunofluorescence signals, different laser intensities were used at the confocal microscope. In addition, transfected cells were followed by GFP coexpression (see supplemental Fig. 1). Cell Extract Preparation and Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Total cell extracts were prepared in IPH buffer (40Valls E. Sanchez-Molina S. Martinez-Balbas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42592-42600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by keeping the cells on ice for 20 min or for the indicated time, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All buffers contained protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies were acetyl-Lys antibody (Chemicon) used at a 1:1,000 dilution, anti-P/CAF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) used at a 1:1,000 dilution, and anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) used at a 1:100. Immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described elsewhere (41Valls E. de la Cruz X. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except for the in vivo acetylation detection and immunoprecipitation and HAT assays, in which the IPH buffer was changed for radioimmune precipitation buffer. HAT and Acetyltransferase Assays—In vitro HAT and acetyltransferase assays were performed as described elsewhere (4Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). P/CAF autoacetylation was performed under the same conditions as HAT assays but in the absence of histones (16Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martinez-Balbas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation, Recombinant Proteins, and Pull-down Assay—In vitro translations and GST pull-downs were performed essentially as described previously (41Valls E. de la Cruz X. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XA90 using the pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) vector system for 4 h at 30 °C after 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-m-galactopyranoside was added. Purification from crude bacterial lysates was performed as in Ref. 41Valls E. de la Cruz X. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. The buffer used for the pull-downs was a variation of Z′ (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm KCl). P/CAF Lacking HAT Activity Localizes to the Cytoplasm—Previous work has shown that amino acids 428–442 of P/CAF contain the NLS. Mutations of lysines 428, 430, 441, and 442 to arginines leads to P/CAF cytoplasmic accumulation (16Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martinez-Balbas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These lysines are the targets of intramolecular autoacetylation (16Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martinez-Balbas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, mutations of the NLS lysines are not direct proof of the autoacetylation requirement, since the lysines themselves are essential for NLS function. Here, we investigated the role of P/CAF intramolecular autoacetylation on P/CAF subcellular distribution using a HAT-domain mutant. P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT cannot be autoacetylated (Fig. 1, A and C), because it lacks the N-terminal part of the protein, the region required for intermolecular acetylation (16Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martinez-Balbas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and HAT catalytic activity (Fig. 1B). HAT catalytic activity is required for intramolecular autoacetylation (Fig. 1C). However, P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT retains the NLS (Fig. 1A). First, we analyzed the cellular localization of P/CAF-(352–832) and P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT. To do this, we transfected CV1COS cells with either P/CAF-(352–832) or P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT. The cellular distribution of P/CAF was analyzed by immunostaining using an antibody that specifically recognizes P/CAF. P/CAF-(352–832) signal was found exclusively in the nucleus, whereas P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT was located predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). To confirm these results, we constructed a P/CAF HAT mutant (L606A) (Fig. 1A) that had only a limited ability to acetylate histones, and it is not able to autoacetylate (Fig. 1, B and C). We then tested the cellular localization of this mutant. CV1COS cells were transfected either with P/CAF-(352–832) or with P/CAF-(352–832)L606A, and their localizations were revealed by immunostaining using an antibody that specifically recognizes P/CAF. As expected, P/CAF-(352–832) was nuclear and P/CAF-(352–832)L606A was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that P/CAF autoacetylation might be involved in its cellular distribution. To determine whether this result was specific to the CV1COS cell line used in these experiments, we examined the subcellular localization of P/CAF-(352–832) and P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT in different cell lines. P/CAF-(352–832) was found mainly in the nuclei in all analyzed cell types (Table 1). In contrast, varying levels of the P/CAFΔHAT mutant were distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that P/CAF requires HAT activity and the NLS to localize in the nucleus.TABLE 1Subcellular distribution of P/CAF on different cell linesConstructCOS293THCT116HeLaNIH3T3P/CAF79% N74% N66% N75% N71% N21% N + C26% N + C34% N + C25% N + C29% N + C0% C0% C0% C0% C0% CP/CAFΔHAT0% N0% N0% N0% N0% N17% N + C4% N + C33% N + C37% N + C66% N + C83% C96% C67% C63% C34% C Open table in a new tab We next tested whether intramolecular autoacetylation might regulate the localization of full-length P/CAF. To do this, we transfected CV1COS cells either with P/CAF full-length (P/CAF-FL) or with P/CAFΔHAT-FL and revealed their localization by immunostaining using an antibody that specifically recognizes P/CAF. As expected, P/CAF-FL was mainly nuclear (68% of the analyzed cells), and P/CAFΔHAT-FL was partially cytoplasmic (57% of the analyzed cells were cytoplasmic, 28% were distributed between nucleus, and cytoplasm and 15% were nuclear) (Fig. 1E). We next examined the subcellular localization of P/CAF-FL and P/CAFΔHAT-FL in different cell lines (HeLa, NIH3T3, and 293T). P/CAF-FL was found mainly in the nuclei in all analyzed cell types. In contrast, P/CAFΔHAT-FL was distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm at levels similar to those of P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT (data not shown). These results indicate that P/CAF autoacetylation might be involved in its cellular distribution. We performed some experiments using P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT or P/CAFΔHAT-FL fused to GFP and FLAG epitopes at the N terminus of the protein. Surprisingly, in these cases, P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT was enriched in the nucleus (data not shown), probably due to (i) a conformational change in P/CAF protein induced by the epitopes or (ii) a change in the accessibility of the P/CAF NLS in the fusion proteins. P/CAF Nuclear Localization Correlates with Autoacetylation—Since HAT activity is required for P/CAF nuclear accumulation, we next sought to confirm that P/CAF nuclear localization correlates with autoacetylation. To that end, we transfected P/CAF-(352–832), P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT, and P/CAF-(352–832)L606A into CV1COS cells. The transfected proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation, and their acetylation status was analyzed by immunoblot using an antibody that specifically recognizes acetylated lysines. Only nuclear P/CAF was acetylated in vivo (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In contrast, cytoplasmic P/CAFs lacking HAT activity were not acetylated in vivo (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). We then treated P/CAF-(352–832)- and P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT-transfected cells with varying amounts of the HDAC inhibitor TSA. Subsequently, the P/CAF location was analyzed by immunostaining. As expected, TSA did not modify the P/CAF cellular distribution (Fig. 2B), probably because cytoplasmic P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT is a nonacetylated protein and therefore is not affected by changes in HDAC activity. Proteasome Inhibition Partially Reverses P/CAF Cytoplasmic Accumulation—Once we had confirmed that P/CAF acetylation correlates with localization to the nucleus, we sought to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this cellular distribution. Autoacetylation could affect the localization of P/CAF-(352–832) by affecting nuclear import or nuclear export. The recognition of NLS-containing proteins in the cytoplasm is mediated by the heterodimeric importin-α/β receptor, in which the importin α subunit is the saturable component of the receptor, and the importin β targets the NLS-containing protein in the nuclear pore complex (42Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 43Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether P/CAF-(352–832) directly bound importin α or β and whether autoacetylation affected this interaction in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-P/CAF-(352–832) interacted with importin-α1 in an in vitro pull-down assay. Moreover, P/CAF-(352–832) bound to GST-importin-β in vitro (Fig. 3B). In addition, P/CAF-(352–832) autoacetylation decreased these interactions (Fig. 3, A (lanes 3 and 4) and B (lane 3)). To confirm these results, we transfected CV1COS cells with P/CAF or P/CAFΔHAT, prepared whole cell extracts from the transfected cells, and used them for pull-down experiments with GST, GST-importin α1, and GST-importin β columns. Both P/CAF and P/CAFΔHAT interacted efficiently with importin α1 and GST-importin β (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that nuclear import was not the cause of the observed P/CAF cellular distribution, probably because cytoplasmic P/CAF, which recognized the heterodimeric importin-α/β receptor, was always nonacetylated, as we showed in Fig. 2. To gain further insight into how P/CAF autoacetylation regulates subcellular distribution, we analyzed whether nuclear export is affected by autoacetylation. To do this, we transfected CV1COS cells with P/CAF-(352–832), P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT, or GFP-Sirt2 (as a control) and treated them with leptomycin B, which impairs CRM1-dependent nuclear export. P/CAF localization was determined by immunostaining with an antibody that specifically recognizes P/CAF. Blocking nuclear export did not affect either P/CAF-(352–832) (nuclear localization) or P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT (cytoplasmic localization), but nuclear export of GFP-Sirt2 was affected (as described in Ref. 44North B.J. Verdin E. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The above results suggest that cytoplasmic P/CAF is efficiently imported into the nucleus. What happens to nonacetylated nuclear P/CAF? The results shown in Fig. 4A suggest that it is not actively exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, nuclear nonacetylated protein may be degraded by proteolytic processing. We therefore tested whether the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could reverse the cytoplasmic localization of P/CAFΔHAT. To this end, we transfected CV1COS cells with P/CAF-(352–832) or P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT and then treated them with MG132, which blocks proteasome-mediated degradation. The P/CAF localization was determined by immunostaining with an antibody that specifically recognizes P/CAF. Blocking protein degradation induced the accumulation of P/CAF in promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies (data not shown). However, it did not significantly alter the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of P/CAF (Fig. 4B). In contrast, MG132 treatment allowed a partial accumulation of P/CAF-(352–832)ΔHAT in the nucleus; the protein was distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in 70% of the cells (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, nonautoacetylated P/CAF also accumulated in the promyelocytic leukemia protein and in other cell bodies (data not shown). P/CAF Deacetylation by HDAC3 Promotes P/CAF Cytoplasmic Accumulation—Our results thus far suggested that autoacetylation was important in promoting the nuclear localization of P/CAF. On the other hand, it had previously been shown that some HDACs bind P/CAF (17Gregoire S. Xiao L. Nie J. Zhang X. Xu M. Li J. Wong J. Seto E. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2023491912,"Pesticide resistance is a major concern in natural populations and a model trait to study adaptation. Despite the importance of this trait, the dynamics of its evolution and of its ecological consequences remain largely unstudied. To fill this gap, we performed experimental evolution with replicated populations of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to the pesticide Levamisole during 20 generations. Exposure to Levamisole resulted in decreased survival, fecundity and male frequency, which declined from 30% to zero. This was not due to differential susceptibility of males. Rather, the drug affected mobility, resulting in fewer encounters, probably leading to reduced outcrossing rates. Adaptation, i.e., increased survival and fecundity, occurred within 10 and 20 generations, respectively. Male frequency also increased by generation 20. Adaptation costs were undetected in the ancestral environment and in presence of Ivermectin, another widely-used pesticide with an opposite physiological effect. Our results demonstrate that pesticide resistance can evolve at an extremely rapid pace. Furthermore, we unravel the effects of behaviour on life-history traits and test the environmental dependence of adaptation costs.

Leukemias and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are the most predominant FA-associated cancers, with the latter exhibiting markedly early disease onset and aggressiveness. Although studies of hematopoietic cells derived from FA patients have provided much insight into bone marrow deficiencies and leukemogenesis, molecular transforming events in FA-deficient keratinocytes, which are the cell type of origin for SCC, are poorly understood. We describe here the growth and molecular properties of FANCA-deficient versus FANCA-corrected HPV E6/E7 immortalized keratinocytes in monolayer and organotypic epithelial raft culture. In response to DNA damage, FANCA-deficient patient-derived keratinocyte cultures displayed a G2/M phase arrest, senescence and apoptosis. Organotypic raft cultures exhibited DNA repair-associated defects with more 53BP1 foci and TdT-mediated dNTP nick end labeling-positive cells over their corrected counterparts. Interestingly, together with reduced rates of DNA damage, FA correction resulted in a marked decrease in epithelial thickness and the presence of fewer cell layers. The observed FANCA-mediated suppression of hyperplasia correlated with the detection of fewer cells transiting through the cell cycle in the absence of gross differentiation abnormalities or apoptotic differences. Importantly, the knockdown of either FANCA or FANCD2 in HPV-positive keratinocytes was sufficient for increasing epithelial hyperplasia. Our findings support a new role for FA pathways in the maintenance of differentiation-dependent cell cycle exit, with the implication that FA deficiencies may contribute to the high risk of FA patients for developing HPV-associated SCC."

Mass spectrometry-based global peptide profiling of mice lacking dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) identified endogenous DPP4 substrates and revealed an unrecognized pathway during proline peptide catabolism that interlinks aminopeptidase and DPP4 activities. Together, these studies elucidate specific aspects of DPP4-regulated metabolism and, more generally, highlight the utility of global peptide profiling for studying peptide metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1985213602,"Gln3, the major activator of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription, is often used as an assay of Tor pathway regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gln3 is cytoplasmic in cells cultured with repressive nitrogen sources (Gln) and nuclear with derepressive ones (Pro) or after treating Gln-grown cells with the Tor inhibitor, rapamycin (Rap). In Raptreated or Pro-grown cells, Sit4 is posited to dephosphorylate Gln3, which then dissociates from a Gln3-Ure2 complex and enters the nucleus. However, in contrast with this view, Sit4-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation is greater in Gln than Pro. Investigating this paradox, we show that PP2A (another Tor pathway phosphatase)-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation is regulated oppositely to that of Sit4, being greatest in Pro- and least in Gln-grown cells. It thus parallels nuclear Gln3 localization and NCR-sensitive transcription. However, because PP2A is not required for nuclear Gln3 localization in Pro, PP2A-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation and nuclear localization are likely parallel responses to derepressive nitrogen sources. In contrast, Rap-induced nuclear Gln3 localization absolutely requires all four PP2A components (Pph21/22, Tpd3, Cdc55, and Rts1). In pph21Δ22Δ, tpd3Δ, or cdc55Δ cells, however, Gln3 is dephosphorylated to the same level as in Rap-treated wild-type cells, indicating Rap-induced Gln3 dephosphorylation is insufficient to achieve nuclear localization. Finally, PP2A-dependent Gln3 dephosphorylation parallels conditions where Gln3 is mostly nuclear, while Sit4-dependent and Rap-induced dephosphorylation parallels those where Gln3 is mostly cytoplasmic, suggesting the effects of these phosphatases on Gln3 may occur in different cellular compartments.

One of the principal roles of Tor is participation in the adjustment of cell metabolism and cell biology to intra- and extracellular nutrient fluctuations. Investigation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tor proteins (Tor1 and Tor2) has added much to our understanding of their mammalian homologue (mTor) (1Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu.

Central to many of these investigations has been the GATA-binding transcriptional activator, Gln3, well known for its control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription (5Cooper T.G.

It permits cells to rapidly and successfully cope with nutritional changes ranging from starvation after a rain storm to luxurious nitrogen excess when situated in decaying fruit. NCR-sensitive regulation is achieved by controlling the action of Gln3. When cells are growing in the presence of sufficient quantities of a good nitrogen source (e.g. glutamine), Gln3 is restricted to the cytoplasm; an outcome that requires the negative regulator, Ure2. This prevents Gln3 from binding to its target sites in the promoters of NCR-sensitive genes (10Cox K.H. Rai R. Distler M. Daugherty J.R. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 17611-17618Google Scholar, 11Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 14408-14414Google Scholar, 12Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Google Scholar). Hence the transcription of these genes, whose products are required to transport and catabolize poor nitrogen sources, is repressed. At the opposite end of the nutrient spectrum, when cells are growing in the presence of poor sources (e.g. proline) or there are insufficient quantities of good nitrogen sources available, Gln3 is nuclear and bound to NCR-sensitive promoters (10Cox K.H. Rai R. Distler M. Daugherty J.R. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 17611-17618Google Scholar, 11Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

As a result, NCR-sensitive transcription is greatly derepressed. It is this derepressed transcription of NCR-sensitive genes that permits the cell to scavenge its environment more broadly for alternative poor nitrogen sources until more favorable conditions again prevail. Between these extremes are a variety of additional nitrogen sources, which can be roughly categorized as good (e.g. ammonia, serine, high concentrations of urea) or intermediate (glutamate or aspartate) (13Cooper T.G.

EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Google Scholar) and NCR-sensitive transcription was established quite unexpectedly by results from several transcriptome analyses in which Tor activity was specifically inhibited by the clinically important drug, rapamcyin (15Bertram P.G.

These and other studies laid the groundwork for development of an engaging molecular model explaining how NCR was achieved (Fig. 1A) (16Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature.. 1999; 402: 689-692Google Scholar). The seminal findings were four important correlations in which rapamycin treatment of cells provided with a good nitrogen source elicited: (i) Gln3 dephosphorylation, (ii) Gln3 nuclear localization, (iii) increased NCR-sensitive transcription, and (iv) a strong Sit4 requirement for all three processes (15Bertram P.G.

According to the model and its subsequent refinements (Fig. 1A), under conditions of nitrogen excess, Tor (now known to be the protein complex TorC1) phosphorylates Tap42 (Tor-associated protein) thereby promoting its association with Sit4 (14Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Google Scholar, 15Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Google Scholar, 16Beck T.

The PTap42-Sit4 complex, bound to TorC1, is inactive and hence unable to dephosphorylate Gln3 (15Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Google Scholar, 16Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature.. 1999; 402: 689-692Google Scholar, 21Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Google Scholar, 24Düvel K.

This, in turn, prevents a phosphorylated Gln3-Ure2 complex from dissociating. When Tor kinase activity is inhibited by limiting nutrients or treating cells with rapamycin, the PTap42-Sit4 complex is released from TorC1, thereby becoming active until Tap42 and Sit4 themselves dissociate from one another (25Yan G. Shen X. Jiang Y. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Google Scholar). Active PTap42-Sit4 complex dephosphorylates Gln3, which brings about its dissociation from Ure2, thereby permitting free Gln3 to enter the nucleus and activate NCR-sensitive transcription (15Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Google Scholar, 16Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature.. 1999; 402: 689-692Google Scholar, 22Blinder D.

Jiang Y. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Google Scholar).For the past several years, we have been investigating Tor regulation of Gln3 by testing predictions that emanate from the above model. Observations and conclusions from experiments in our laboratory and others that have generated the questions we address here are briefly summarized in the next two sections.Does Rapamycin Treatment Faithfully Mimic a Condition of Limiting Nitrogen?—A key tenant of the Tor model described above is that Tor itself or some molecule preceding it in the regulatory pathway receives the signal of nitrogen excess or limitation. Tor-mediated events then implement the response to that signal. In the case of nitrogen limitation, implementation can be mimicked by treating cells with rapamycin (16Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature.. 1999; 402: 689-692Google Scholar, 26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Google Scholar). Thus, the signal generated by nitrogen limitation or excess has been thought to enter the Tor regulatory pathway at or above the level of events triggered by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1A).We, on the other hand, have been led to an alternative view that rapamycin treatment does not congruently mimic nitrogen limitation and that the dominant nitrogen signal controlling Gln3 enters the Tor regulatory pathway below the level of rapamycin action or enters via another regulatory pathway (9Cooper T.G. Winderickx J. Taylor P.M. Nutrient-induced Responses in Eukaryotic Cells, Topics in Current Genetics. 7. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg2004: 225-257Google Scholar, 27Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Google Scholar, 28Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Google Scholar). This view derives from four observations. (i) Rapamycin-induced CIT2 transcription is nitrogen source-dependent. It occurs in ammonia but not proline- or glutamate-grown cells, arguing that the nitrogen signal dictates whether or not rapamycin treatment will increase CIT2 transcription (27Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Google Scholar, 28Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Google Scholar). (ii) Gln3 phosphorylation and intracellular localization in nutrient limitation and starvation differ from those generated by rapamycin treatment (29Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Google Scholar, 30Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar). (iii) Latrunculin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, inhibits nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization and NCR-sensitive transcription following transfer of cells from ammonia to proline medium, but not after rapamycin addition (31Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 19294-19301Google Scholar). (iv) Nuclear localization of Gln3 in proline-grown but not rapamycin-treated cells requires participation of Golgi-to-endosome trafficking proteins (32Puria R. Zurita-Martinez S.A. Cardenas M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2008; 105: 7194-7199Google Scholar). Parenthetically, the latter report confirms our earlier conclusion that “movement of Gln3 and Gat1 into and out of the nucleus, like that of Rtg3 another phosphorylated transcription factor reported to be regulated by the Tor1,2 signal transduction pathway, involves the participation of a general protein trafficking pathway” (30Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar).Sit4 and PP2A Phosphatase Participation in the Tor Regulatory Pathway and Control of Gln3—Another key feature of the Tor model are the prominent roles of type 2A (PP2A) and type 2A-related (Sit4) protein phosphatases (1Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet.. 2009; 42: 2.1-2.55Google Scholar). Both phosphatases have been previously thought to be regulated similarly with respect to nutrient supply and also to respond similarly to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1, A and B) (14Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Google Scholar). PP2A and Sit4 consist of catalytic subunit(s) (redundant Pph21/22 for PP2A or Sit4), associated with proteins that regulate their specificities and/or activities (14Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Tap42 binds to Pph21/Pph22 and Sit4, whereas Tpd3 plus Cdc55 or Rts1 bind only to Pph21/22 (14Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev.. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Google Scholar). The PP2A complexes are thought to possess different target specificities (20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Google Scholar).The centrality of Sit4 phosphatase to Tor regulation and hence directly or indirectly to NCR prompted us to analyze its effects on Gln3 first. We found that Sit4 is required for nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization in proline-grown or rapamycin-treated glutamine-grown cells, confirming multiple earlier reports performed with cells growing in complex rich media (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar). A paradoxical result, however, emanated from analysis of Sit4-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar). If Sit4 occupies the position posited in the Tor model (Fig. 1A), one would expect it to be most active under conditions in which Gln3 is most dephosphorylated and nuclear (in proline-grown cells) and least active when Gln3 is most phosphorylated and restricted to the cytoplasm (in glutamine-grown cells). Experimentally, the opposite result was observed. There was greater Sit4-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation with glutamine than with proline as nitrogen source (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar). Further, cells treated with methionine sulfoximine (Msx), an inhibitor of glutamine synthesis (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Google Scholar), induced nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization and did so equally well in wild type and sit4Δ mutant cells (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar). This demonstrated that Msx-induced nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization occurred via an intracellular transport pathway that was mechanistically distinct in one or more ways from the one involved with Sit4-dependent effects of rapamycin treatment or growth with a poor nitrogen source. Moreover, in contrast with rapamycin treatment, Msx treatment increased rather than decreased Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation (34Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280 (Erratum in: J. Biol. Chem. 282, 13139): 27195-27204Google Scholar). In sum, the above information about Sit4 did not comfortably fit within the model presented in Fig. 1A. Therefore we turned our attention to the PP2A phosphatase.Involvement of PP2A (Pph21/22) in the regulation of NCR-sensitive transcription was discovered only recently by the demonstration that the phosphatase was required for rapamycin-induced expression of DAL5 (35Giannattasio S. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 42528-42535Google Scholar). However, because the Sit4 requirements for rapamycin-induced nuclear Gln3-Myc13 and Gat1-Myc13 localization differ markedly from one another (Fig. 1A) (36Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res.. 2006; 6: 218-229Google Scholar), we analyzed PP2A participation in Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation and intracellular localization in much the same way as we did in our earlier studies of Sit4 (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar).Our experiments support three equally important conclusions. (i) Sit4- and PP2A-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation respond inversely to the spectrum of nitrogen sources used by S. cerevisiae. With repressive nitrogen sources, Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation is highest with Sit4 and lowest with PP2A, whereas with derepressive nitrogen sources Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation is highest with PP2A and lowest with Sit4. (ii) Gln3-Myc13, which is dephosphorylated to the same extent as in rapamycin-treated wild type cells, does not enter the nucleus in pph21Δpph22Δ, tpd3Δ, cdc55Δ, and rts1Δ mutant cells. Therefore, we conclude that Sit4-dependent Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation is not sufficient to elicit its nuclear localization, which is a central tenant of the model in Fig. 1A. (iii) Rapamycin-induced nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization strongly requires PP2A especially in glutamine-grown cells, whereas similar Gln3-Myc13 localization in response to growth with a poor nitrogen source does not.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Growth conditions were identical to those described in Tate et al. (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar). Cultures (50 ml) were grown to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in YNB minimal medium containing the indicated nitrogen source at a final concentration of 0.1%. Allantoin was provided at 0.2%. Appropriate supplements (120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, tryptophan, and arginine) were added to the medium as necessary to cover auxotrophic requirements. Where indicated, cells were treated with 200 ngm/ml rapamycin for 20 min as described earlier (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Google Scholar).TABLE 1Strains used in this workStrainPertinent genotypeBack-groundParentComplete genotypePrimerTB123W.T.

(29Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Google Scholar, 34Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280 (Erratum in: J. Biol.

Western blot results were recorded on Kodak BioMax XAR film. A wide range of exposures were collected for each sample and gamma settings of the final images uniformly changed to ensure that no minor bands were lost and that the final images reproduced the x-ray films as closely as possible.Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell collection and immunofluorescent staining were performed as previously described (12Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Google Scholar, 30Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar, 33Tate J.J. Feller A.

Unless indicated otherwise, cells were fixed by addition of 0.55 ml of 1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and 0.5 ml of 37% formalin to a 5-ml aliquot of the culture to be assayed. This was followed by incubation for 60-70 min. at 30 °C. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope with a ×100 Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective at room temperature. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio camera and AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator programs. Gamma settings were altered where necessary to avoid any change or loss in cellular detail relative to what was observed in the microscope; changes were applied uniformly to the image presented.Determination of Intracellular Gln3-Myc13 Distribution—More comprehensive descriptions of Gln3-Myc13 localization were achieved by manually scoring Gln3-Myc13 localization in 200 or more cells in multiple, randomly chosen fields from which each image presented was taken. Scoring was performed exclusively using unaltered primary image files viewed with Zeiss AxioVision 3.0 and 4.6.3 software.Cells were classified into one of three categories: cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic Gln3-Myc13 fluorescence only), nuclear-cytoplasmic (Gln3-Myc13 fluorescence appearing in the cytoplasm as well as co-localizing with DAPI-positive material), and nuclear (Gln3-Myc13 fluorescence co-localizing only with DAPI-positive material). A representative collection of “standard” images demonstrating the differences in these categories is shown in Fig. 2. The intracellular distribution of Gln3-Myc13 in panels 4-6 is clearly different from that in panels 1-3 or 9 and 10. It is for this reason that we use three-category scoring in contrast to scoring Gln3-Myc13 localization as cytoplasmic or nuclear. In the first report that control of intracellular Gln3-Myc13 localization was associated with a cytoplasmic membranous system, Gln3-Myc13 fluorescence was shown to be contained within or attached to tubular structures extending out from the nucleus (30Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar, 31Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 19294-19301Google Scholar). Because this fluorescence did not co-localize with DAPI-positive material, but was either partially within the nucleus or in its immediate proximity, we classified cells with these characteristics as nuclear-cytoplasmic. Arrows in panels 4-7 point out instances areas where Gln3-Myc13 is in proximity of the nucleus, but does not completely co-localize with DAPI-positive material (Fig. 2). Higher resolution examples of this appear in Fig. 11 of Ref. 31Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 19294-19301Google Scholar, Figs. 7, 8, 9 of Ref. 30Cox K.H. Tate J.J.

Knock-out experiments indicate that H1s play a role in regulation of only a small subset of genes but are an essential component in mouse development. Here, we show that linker histone (H1) is involved in the global regulation of DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum. We find that genomic DNA of H1 knock-down cells is more rapidly replicated, an effect due at least in part to disruption of the native timing of replication fork firing. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that H1 is transiently lost from replicating chromatin via a process facilitated by phosphorylation. Our results suggest that linker histones generate a chromatin environment refractory to replication and that their transient removal via protein phosphorylation during S phase is a critical step in the epigenetic regulation of replication timing.

Our results suggest that linker histones generate a chromatin environment refractory to replication and that their transient removal via protein phosphorylation during S phase is a critical step in the epigenetic regulation of replication timing. Chromatin plays an active role in the control of gene expression and other nuclear processes that require access to DNA. In contrast to our understanding of the role of the core histones and post-translational modifications of these proteins in chromatin-related processes (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science.. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar), the functions of linker histones, which are as abundant as each major class of the core histones in chromatin, have not been completely elucidated. Linker histones have been identified in all eukaryotes; however, compared with core histones, they exhibit a reduced degree of conservation and a much greater number of non-allelic variants within an organism or cell type (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). To explain this variability, Hansen et al. (3Hansen J.C. Lu X. Ross E.D. Woody R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 1853-1856Google Scholar) have hypothesized that linker histone carboxyl-terminal regions are intrinsically disordered, facilitating interactions with several macromolecular partners, suggesting that amino acid composition rather than primary structure of the protein might be most critical for biological function. Linker histones were long believed to play a general role in transcription regulation. However, knock-out of the unique somatic linker histone in Tetrahymena thermophila did not alter bulk levels of transcription in the transcriptionally active macronuclei (4Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1996; 86: 475-483Google Scholar). However, a small subset of specific genes was transcriptionally up- or down-regulated upon the loss of Tetrahymena H1 or introduction of mutations that mimicked the phosphorylated or dephosphorylated protein (4Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1996; 86: 475-483Google Scholar, 5Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar). Similarly, in Neurospora crassa, disruption of H1 genes revealed improper regulation of expression of a pyruvate decarboxylase gene (6Folco H.D. Freitag M. Ramon A. Temporini E.D. Alvarez M.E. Garcia I. Scazzocchio C. Selker E.U. Rosa A.L. Eukaryot. Cell.. 2003; 2: 341-350Google Scholar). More extensive analyses of gene expression in a linker histone-disrupted strain of Saccaromyces cerevisiae revealed only a few genes affected by its absence but that knock out resulted in a decreased efficiency of DNA repair by homologous recombination (7Downs J.A. Kosmidou E. Morgan A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 1685-1692Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas knock-out of any one of the six subtypes of linker histone in mice had no phenotype (8Fan Y. Sirotkin A. Russell R.G. Ayala J. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 7933-7943Google Scholar), simultaneous knock-out of three subtypes, resulting in a marked deficiency in linker histone, caused embryonic lethality (9Fan Y. Nikitina T. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Zhao J. Magnuson T.R. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2003; 23: 4559-4572Google Scholar). However, similar to studies in unicellular organisms, microarray analysis showed that expression of only a small number of genes is affected in linker histone-deficient mouse cells (10Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Cell.. 2005; 123: 1199-1212Google Scholar). These data suggest that in multicellular organisms linker histones can have essential functions during development that were not evident in studies with unicellular organisms (4Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1996; 86: 475-483Google Scholar, 5Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar, 6Folco H.D. Freitag M. Ramon A. Temporini E.D.

Chem... 2001; 276: 13587-13592Google Scholar, 12Downs J.A. Oncogene.. 2007; 26: 7765-7772Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, in Xenopus, replacement of the oocyte linker histone B4 by a somatic H1 occurs concomitant with zygotic gene activation at the midblastula transition and is essential for proper development (13Steinbach O.C. Wolffe A.P. Rupp R.A. Nature.. 1997; 389: 395-399Google Scholar, 14Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Bioessays.. 1997; 19: 249-255Google Scholar). In addition, supplementation of Xenopus egg extracts with mouse somatic H1s caused a dramatic decrease in both the rate and extent of DNA replication of remodeled nuclei (15Lu Z.H. Sittman D.B. Brown D.T. Munshi R. Leno G.H. J. Cell Sci... 1997; 110: 2745-2758Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of H1 in development may involve regulation of DNA replication. However, the molecular bases of linker histone functions during development have not been clarified. Using the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we investigated the cellular function of linker histone. Physarum macroplasmodia proceed through the cell cycle with perfect synchrony of more than 500 million nuclei within a single cell and can internalize exogenous biochemical factors, making this model system ideal for cellular and biochemical analyses at defined cell cycle stages. We previously demonstrated that incorporation of exogenous linker histone subtypes induced a general repressive effect on transcription and that the efficiency of repression was subtype-specific (16Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 965-973Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that H1 knock-down in Physarum cells causes specific effects on DNA replication timing. Cultures of Physarum—P. polycephalum, strain TU291, was maintained in liquid cultures. Naturally synchronous macroplasmodia were cultured as described in Ref. 17Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 2048-2053Google Scholar (and the references therein). Mitosis was determined by phase contrast microscopy (16Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 965-973Google Scholar). Drug treatment with okadaic acid was performed by the incubation of macroplasmodia in presence of 500 nm of okadaic acid and BrdUrd 3The abbreviations used are: BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MNase, micrococcal nuclease. 50 μg/ml for 1 h and harvested for carrying out immunoprecipitation experiments. RNA Interference—A portion of a Physarum H1 c-DNA (residues 1–466) was cloned into Bluescript plasmids SK and KS. The inserts were transcribed in vitro using T7 RiboMax Express kit from Promega. Both transcripts were then annealed together and digested with RNase III for generating ∼21–23-bp siRNAs. Interference was performed by direct incorporation of siRNA into Physarum similarly to the procedure described earlier (16Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 965-973Google Scholar, 17Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 2048-2053Google Scholar). Cell Labeling and Immunofluorescence—Labeling of macroplasmodia was carried out by the addition of [3H]thymidine or BrdUrd into the culture medium for periods indicated in the figure legends. Detection of tritium was determined by counting of nuclei previously isolated as described in Ref. 17Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 2048-2053Google Scholar. Dectection of BrdUrd was carried out by immunofluorescence with primary and secondary antibodies diluted to 1:500. The slides were then observed with a Zeiss microscope and analyzed with Image J software. Protein Analyses and Immunoprecipitation—Efficiency of RNA interference was assayed by Western blotting using an anti-PpH1 antiserum. This antiserum recognizes biochemically purified PpH1 and H1 in whole cell extracts (Fig. 1, A and B) and is specifically competed by a PpH1 peptide (supplemental Fig. S1). Immunoprecipitation of BrdUrd-incorporated DNA was used to determine the timing of replication of specific genes and was performed accordingly to Ref. 18Vassilev L. Russev G. Nucleic Acids Res... 1988; 16: 10397Google Scholar. DNA sequences were detected using PCR amplification with primers specific to Lav1.1 (replicated in early S phase) or Lav2.1 (replicated in the late S phase). ChIP experiments were carried out using immunopurified antibodies specific to H1. Briefly, macroplasmodia were washed in 5 mm EDTA, and filter paper was incubated for 8 min in 1% formaldehyde for cross-linking the cells. Nuclear fractions were prepared by homogenization followed by low speed centrifugation. Nuclei were sonicated using Branson sonifier six times for 5 s of output 2. Chromatin was then separated from insoluble fraction by centrifugation for 10 min, maximum speed, in a microcentrifuge. Soluble fractions were incubated overnight with specific antibodies. Protein A coupled to agarose beads was then added, and chromatin was immunoprecipitated. The beads were then washed prior to be treated with proteinase K, and cross-links were reversed by heating the samples at 65–70 °C overnight, followed by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (19Thiriet C. Methods.. 2004; 33: 86-92Google Scholar). Amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA was carried as described in Ref. 20Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol.. 1999; 304: 399-414Google Scholar with the primers specific to Lav2.1. Note that Lav1.1 is transcribed during the S phase, and the results with this gene could not be attributable only to replication. For experiments of phosphorylation of H1, detection of phospho-H1 was carrying out by Western blotting using anti-phospho-H1 (Abcam) with a dilution of 1:250 and 1:1000 for the secondary antibodies. A linker histone in Physarum has been previously characterized biochemically (21Fischer S.G. Laemmli U.K. Biochemistry.. 1980; 19: 2240-2246Google Scholar, 22Mueller R.D. Yasuda H. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 5081-5086Google Scholar). Despite its unusual migration in SDS-PAGE (∼60 kDa), cleavage of the Physarum H1 by chymotrypsin (22Mueller R.D. Yasuda H. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 5081-5086Google Scholar) or trypsin (results not shown) indicates the presence of a typical ∼80-amino acid residue H1 globular domain in this protein. This protein also exhibited acid solubility typical of linker histones (Fig. 1A). A partial sequence obtained from this protein revealed significant homology with the globular domains of known linker histones as indicated by peptide alignment (supplemental Fig. S2). We generated an antiserum against an internal peptide from this protein that reacted against the band corresponding to Physarum H1 in Western blots but also cross-reacted with two other peptides present in nuclear lysates that are unlikely to be linker histones (Fig. 1A, lane 2; see legend). Indeed, when we reprobed the blot with another antiserum that has recognized all linker histones tested so to date (despite the low conservation of H1s) (23Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18740-18745Google Scholar), only the 60-kDa band was detected in common with the antiserum directed against the H1 peptide (Fig. 1A). We knocked down Physarum linker histone levels by direct incorporation of enzymatically generated siRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) into macroplasmodia in a manner similar to methods we developed for incorporation of exogenous proteins (16Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 965-973Google Scholar, 17Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 2048-2053Google Scholar). We found that incorporation of siRNA into the cell was less efficient than protein incorporation, because only ∼5% of labeled siRNA were recovered from the cells after the incorporation procedure. Nevertheless, Western blots of proteins from nuclei treated with H1-specific siRNA showed a striking diminution of the linker histone band compared with untreated cells or cells treated with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). Importantly, the unidentified peptides that cross-reacted with our anti-H1 antiserum did not decrease after H1-siRNA treatment, supporting the specificity of the knock-down. We then examined the effects of H1 knock-down on growth of Physarum throughout the cell cycle. In contrast to the effects of incorporation of exogenous linker histones into Physarum (16Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 965-973Google Scholar), cellular fragments treated with either H1-specific or nonspecific siRNAs exhibited indistinguishable timing of mitosis compared with untreated controls. Although no striking phenotype was observed throughout the cell cycle, we did notice a transient and subtle growth phenotype in early S phase of plasmodia treated with H1-siRNA. This was evidenced by a slightly greater cellular proliferation at the cut edge of the H1-depleted macroplasmodium (Fig. 1C). Because of this slight S phase-related phenotype, we wondered whether DNA replication might be affected by the decreased amount of H1 in macroplasmodia. We thus examined incorporation of BrdUrd at a point 1 h into the 3-h S phase in macroplasmodia treated with H1-siRNA, nonspecific siRNA or only buffer (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, we found a greater incorporation of BrdUrd in H1 siRNA-treated cells compared with controls. Therefore, we then examined the extent of incorporation of [3H]thymidine throughout S phase to further investigate the effects of H1 depletion on DNA replication. Surprisingly, these experiments showed that the genomes of plasmodia treated with H1-siRNA were nearly completely replicated after 1.5 h, whereas control plasmodia exhibited a normal 3-h replication phase, as expected (24Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev... 2005; 19: 677-682Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, our data showed that both untreated and treated plasmodia reached similar plateaus of at about 18 kcpm/μg of DNA, indicating that both knock-down and control cells completed a single round of genome replication. Therefore, we presumed that the loss of linker histone might affect either the temporal regulation of replication origin firing or the rate of propagation of replication forks. To address whether the acceleration in replication was due to an increase in the rate of progression of replication forks or aberrant early firing of origins, we examined replication foci by immunodetection after short pulses of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2C). We reasoned that in replicating cells treated with H1-siRNA, if the number of replication forks were increased early in S phase, the number foci would increase, whereas if the progression of replication forks were increased, the number of foci would stay the same, but their intensity would increase. Microscopic observations revealed that siRNA-treated plasmodia exhibit larger nuclear volume than untreated plasmodia (Fig. 2C), consistent with results from Tetrahymena H1 knockout experiments (25Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1995; 82: 47-56Google Scholar), indicating that H1 plays a role in chromatin compaction. In normal cells, replication foci were observed throughout the S phase. In contrast, H1-depleted cells exhibit a higher number of replication foci in the early S phase with the number of foci decreasing rapidly such that 1 h after mitosis most foci exhibiting BrdUrd incorporation were in the nucleolus, and almost no foci were observed 2.5 h after mitosis (only weak labeling can be detected in nucleoli where rDNA autonomously replicates throughout cell cycle; data not shown). Importantly, we noticed that the size and intensity of BrdUrd foci were similar in both untreated and siRNA-treated nuclei, suggesting that replication forks do not progress faster in H1-depleted cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the acceleration of the replication phase is associated with a change in the temporal regulation of DNA synthesis in which many replicons shift from replicating late in S to replicating early. We next determined whether depletion of linker histone correlated with alteration in temporal regulation of specific replicons. Previous work by Pierron et al. (26Pierron G. Benard M. Puvion E. Flanagan R. Sauer H.W. Pallotta D. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 553-566Google Scholar) documented the exact replication timing of specific replicons in Physarum plasmodia. These authors have shown that the lav1.1 replicon is replicated exclusively within the first hour of S phase, whereas lav2.1 replicon was replicated within the last hour of the 3-h S phase. To study the effect of H1 depletion on these replicons, we pulse-labeled cells for 1 and 3 h with BrdUrd and analyzed replication by immunoprecipitation of replicating DNA with anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by detection of specific sequences by PCR (Fig. 3A). Control plasmodia treated with just buffer or nonspecific siRNA exhibited the expected incorporation of BrdUrd in both replicons (Fig. 3B), such that only lav1.1 was replicated within the first hour of S phase, with no further BrdUrd incorporation after the 1-h time point, whereas after 3 h both lav1.1 and lav2.1 were replicated and labeled with BrdUrd. We then repeated the incorporation of BrdUrd and pull-down in the same conditions with plasmodia concomitantly treated with H1-siRNA. As expected, we found that lav1.1 was replicated within the first hour of the S phase. However, in contrast to control plasmodia, incorporation of BrdUrd within lav2.1 was also detected after 1 h of replication. These data indicated that linker histone depletion either abrogates pauses during replication fork propagation or leads to early firing of the replication origin. We reasoned that if H1 has a repressive function in replication regulation, then activation of replication origins may involve a transient release of this protein from chromatin. To examine whether release of H1 occurs concomitantly with origin firing, we carried out ChIP experiments to detect H1 association with the Lav2.1 replicon during the S and G2 phases (Fig. 4A). Importantly, in these experiments the H1-depleted plasmodia provide a convenient negative control to verify the specificity of the immunoprecipitated chromatin. Western blots showed a significant reduction (∼80%) of H1 in siRNA-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Additionally, we found that micrococcal nuclease digestion patterns of chromatin from H1-depleted macroplasmodia clearly revealed a greater accessibility of the enzyme to DNA compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with results from other organisms (4Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1996; 86: 475-483Google Scholar, 6Folco H.D. Freitag M. Ramon A. Temporini E.D. Alvarez M.E. Garcia I. Scazzocchio C. Selker E.U. Rosa A.L. Eukaryot.

Using affinity-purified H1 antibodies, we then immunoprecipitated chromatin and examined the association of H1 with the Lav2.1 replicon in early S phase, in late S phase when Lav2.1 replication takes place, and in early G2 phase after Lav2.1 replication (Fig. 4C). We found that Lav2.1 was associated with H1 in the early S phase, but association was significantly reduced during the period when Lav2.1 replicates. H1 is again found associated with this locus during the subsequent G2 phase only in H1-containing plasmodia. These results indicate that linker histone association is transiently reduced on replicating chromatin. (Note that because of high levels of transcriptional activity, it was not possible to clearly demonstrate H1 removal upon replication of the early replicated Lav1.1 locus). Importantly, chromatin replication has been correlated with H1 phosphorylation and chromatin decondensation (27Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 875-886Google Scholar). In Tetrahymena, phosphorylation of linker histone regulates gene expression by mimicking H1 removal (5Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar), consistent with data indicating that H1 phosphorylation increases the dynamic exchange of linker histones in chromatin (28Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 6142-6146Google Scholar, 29Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature.. 2000; 408: 873-876Google Scholar). We thus wanted to determine whether phosphorylation of H1 plays a role in defining the replication program in Physarum. Macroplasmodia were treated in the early S phase with okadaic acid, which increased the level of H1 phosphorylation by inhibition of phosphatases, as shown by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-H1 antiserum (Fig. 5, A and B). We then examined the rate of replication in cells treated with okadaic acid versus untreated cells. Interestingly, we found that incorporation of BrdUrd was ∼2-fold higher in hyperphosphorylated H1 containing macroplasmodia than normal cells at a point 1 h after the beginning of the S phase (Fig. 5C). We then determined whether the higher rate of replication correlated with a loss of replication timing at specific loci by immunoprecipitation of digested genomic DNA with anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by PCR analyses. We detected incorporation of BrdUrd in the Lav2.1 replicon when cells were treated with okadaic acid, but not in the control cells at a time point where replication of this locus normally has not yet begun (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that phosphorylation of H1 leads to linker histone removal and thus make chromatin permissive for replication. Our results demonstrate that linker histone plays an essential role in proper regulation of replication timing, We have found that upon H1 knock-down, the majority of Physarum genomic DNA replication is achieved within 1.5 h instead of the normal 3 h, indicating that linker histone exerts a global influence on DNA replication, in contrast to the relatively minor global effect of linker histone depletion on transcription (4Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell.. 1996; 86: 475-483Google Scholar, 5Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar, 6Folco H.D. Freitag M. Ramon A. Temporini E.D.

Chem... 2001; 276: 13587-13592Google Scholar). Temporal organization of replication units is believed to be an important feature that is linked to transcription of specific genes and chromatin organization and is subject to epigenetic controls during differentiation (30Maric C. Benard M. Pierron G. EMBO Rep... 2003; 4: 474-478Google Scholar). In higher organisms, including flies, sea urchins, frogs, and mice, linker histone subtypes are exchanged during early embryogenesis (14Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Bioessays.. 1997; 19: 249-255Google Scholar). For instance, in Xenopus, maternal linker histone B4 is replaced by somatic H1 after the midblastula transition, and zygotic genes are activated (31Smith R.C. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Genes Dev... 1988; 2: 1284-1295Google Scholar), suggesting essential functions of linker histone during development (9Fan Y. Nikitina T. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Zhao J. Magnuson T.R. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2003; 23: 4559-4572Google Scholar). In vitro replication in Xenopus egg extracts was found to be inhibited by exogenously added H1, by limiting the assembly of prereplication complexes (15Lu Z.H. Sittman D.B. Brown D.T. Munshi R. Leno G.H. J. Cell Sci... 1997; 110: 2745-2758Google Scholar, 32Lu Z.H. Sittman D.B. Romanowski P. Leno G.H. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1998; 9: 1163-1176Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that H1 plays a critical role in regulating the firing of replication origins and that different patterns of timing are required at different stages of development in multicellular organisms. Moreover, in this work we have shown by ChIP that association of H1 with a replicon is reduced only during the period when that replicon is undergoing replication and that inhibition of a phosphatase that results in increased phosphorylation of H1 causes a late firing origin to be replicated aberrantly early in the S phase (Figs. 3 and 4). Our results are consistent with a model whereby spatially and temporally regulated phosphorylation of H1, possibly via the cdc2 kinase pathway (27Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 875-886Google Scholar), facilitates the release of H1 and leads to a more replication-competent chromatin structure. Indeed, Alexandrow and Hamlin (27Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 875-886Google Scholar) have shown that recruitment of Cdc45, a required factor for initiation of replication and fork progression, correlates with H1 phosphorylation, likely by Cdk2. Recently, it has been shown that mitotic remodeling of replicons and chromosome structure was required for resetting replicon potential in differentiated erythrocyte nuclei (33Lemaitre J.M. Danis E. Pasero P. Vassetzky Y. Mechali M. Cell.. 2005; 123: 787-801Google Scholar). Although the role of linker histone in this process has not yet been examined, it is important to point out that mitotic phosphorylation of linker histones is a conserved feature (22Mueller R.D. Yasuda H. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 5081-5086Google Scholar). Higher order structure of chromatin is stabilized by linker histones, and depletion of H1 in mammals leads to alteration of global chromatin structure (10Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Cell.. 2005; 123: 1199-1212Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the idea that linker histone and phosphorylation of this histone organizes chromatin to generate replication-competent and refractory states. In these experiments we took advantage of the very precise cell cycle exhibited by Physarum, which includes a 3-h S phase, a 6-h G2 phase, and a ∼15-min mitosis (note there is no G1 phase in this organism). Surprisingly, although we find that the bulk of genomic DNA replication in the H1-deficient Physarum cells appears to be completed in half the normal time of 3 h, we noticed that the S phase and the overall cell cycle does not appear to be shortened by a commensurate amount. This may be due to a small amount of late replicating genomic DNA responsible for defining the length of S or an alternative timing mechanism that is not dependent on the presence of H1s. It will be interesting in future experiments to use this system to examine how bulk DNA replication timing is related to defining the overall length of the S phase. We are grateful to Marty Gorovsky, Marianne Bénard, and Chrystelle Antoinat-Maric for critical reading of the manuscript and to Chris Huggins for the partial Physarum H1 sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2003221852,"Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1) protects centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion in early mitosis and, thus, prevents premature sister-chromatid separation. The protein level of Sgo1 is regulated during the cell cycle; it peaks in mitosis and is down-regulated in G1/S. Here we show that Sgo1 is degraded during the exit from mitosis, and its degradation depends on the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Overexpression of Cdh1 reduces the protein levels of ectopically expressed Sgo1 in human cells. Sgo1 is ubiquitinated by APC/C bound to Cdh1 (APC/C(Cdh1)) in vitro. We have further identified two functional degradation motifs in Sgo1; that is, a KEN (Lys-Glu-Asn) box and a destruction box (D box). Although removal of either motif is not sufficient to stabilize Sgo1, Sgo1 with both KEN box and D box deleted is stable in cells. Surprisingly, mitosis progresses normally in the presence of non-degradable Sgo1, indicating that degradation of Sgo1 is not required for sister-chromatid separation or mitotic exit. Finally, we show that the spindle checkpoint kinase Bub1 contributes to the maintenance of Sgo1 steady-state protein levels in an APC/C-independent mechanism."

In this study, we show that activated PKCδ (wild-type PKCδ stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or constitutively active PKCδ) decreased Gli-luciferase reporter activity in NIH/3T3 cells, as well as the endogenous hedgehog-responsive gene PTCH1.

Silencing of PKCδ by siRNA rescued the inhibition of cell growth by KAAD-cyclopamine, an antagonist of hedgehog signaling element Smoothened, suggesting that PKCδ acts downstream of Smoothened. The biological relevance of our study is shown in hepatocellular carcinoma where we found that hepatocellular carcinoma with detectable hedgehog signaling had weak or no detectable expression of PKCδ, whereas PKCδ highly expressing tumors had no detectable hedgehog signaling.

Hh signaling starts with association of the Hh ligand with its receptor Patched (PTCH), which releases PTCH inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), and allows Smo to transduce a signal for the activation and nuclear translocation of a family of transcription factors, cubitus interruptus in Drosophila and Glis (including Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) in vertebrates, which, in turn, promotes expression of Hh signal target genes. In the absence of Hh ligand, phosphorylation of Gli2/3 targets latent Gli proteins to proteasome-dependent repressor formation (9Riobo N.A. Lu K. Ai X. Haines G.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Compared with Gli2/3, the mechanism of Gli1 regulation is poorly understood. The transcription factors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 are critical for the regulation of Hh signaling.

Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology.. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Wang Q. Hu W. Evers B.M. Oncogene.. 2004; 23: 1885-1895Google Scholar). The relative Gli-luciferase activity was normalized by TK-Renilla activity. Immunohistochemistry—The status of Hh signaling of HCC tissues has been determined with in situ hybridization (4Huang S. He J. Zhang X. Bian Y. Yang L. Xie G. Zhang K. Tang W. Stelter A.A. Wang Q. Zhang H. Xie J. Carcinogenesis.. 2006; 27: 1334-1340Google Scholar), and the sections were prepared as described previously (36Ma X. Chen K. Huang S. Zhang X. Adegboyega P.A. Evers B.M. Zhang H. Xie J. Carcinogenesis.. 2005; 26: 1698-1705Google Scholar). Tissue sections were deparaffinized, followed by rehydration with decreased concentrations of ethanol, and immersed in 3% H2O2 for 10 min. Following antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0), the tissue sections were incubated with normal goat serum to block nonspecific antibody binding (20 min at room temperature). The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (at 1:200 dilution) at 37 °C in humid chambers for 2 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, the sections were incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) and streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by phosphate-buffered saline wash. The sections were incubated with the diaminiobenzidine substrate for <30 min. Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Negative controls were performed in all cases by omitting the first antibodies. mRNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from treated NIH/3T3 or/and Hep3B cells transfected with different vectors or siRNA with the RNeasy kit and RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). An aliquot (1 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription with a High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit using random primers. One twentieth of the final cDNA was used in each PCR reaction. For mouse PTCH1, cDNA was amplified with CCGTTCAGCTCCGCACAGA (forward primer) and CTCACTCGGGTGGTCCCATAAA (reverse primer), mouse β-actin GCTTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCGT (forward primer) and CCTTCTGACCCATTCCCACC (reverse primer). For quantitative PCR analyses, we detected transcripts of Gli1 and PTCH1 using Applied Biosystem's assays-by-demand assay mixtures (the sequences for human Gli1 and PTCH1 have been patented by Applied Biosystems) and pre-developed 18 S rRNA (VIC™-dye labeled probe) TaqMan® assay reagent (P/N 4319413E) was used as an internal control. The levels of Gli1 and PTCH1 were measured in the Real-time PCR Core Facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Protein Preparation, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Protein preparation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (17Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Google Scholar, 37Li J. O'Connor K.L. Cheng X. Mei F.C. Uchida T. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Mol. Endocrinol.. 2007; 21: 159-171Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed with 1× cell lysis buffer from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBST buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin, followed with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were developed using the ECL detection system. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (17Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples (300 μg) were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1 μl) and protein A/G beads (20 μl) on a shaker at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and 4× Trisglycine sample buffer was added. Samples were denatured and analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence Staining—Hep3B cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 cells, incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min, and then with incubated primary antibody for 1 h in blocking solution at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature in the blocking solution. RNA Interference—The SMARTpool PKCδ siRNA and non-targeting siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research in the annealed and purified form. Transfection of siRNA duplexes (40 nm) was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 following the instructions of the manufacturer. At 72 h after transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to either real-time PCR, immunoblot, or immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. Cell Proliferation Assay—Hep3B cells were transfected with PKC siRNA or non-targeting siRNA, and 24 h later, replated into 24-wells plates with minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Either KAAD-cyclopamine or vehicle (DMSO) was added, respectively. Cells were collected by trypsinization daily and counted by using a Coulter counter. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times, and data are reported as means ± S.E. For each experiment, real-time PCR values and relative luciferase activity were analyzed using a two-sample t test or analysis of variance for a one- or two-factor experiment according to the structure of factor(s). The factors were vector, drug, and/or dose. Main effects and interactions were assessed at the 0.05 level of significance. Multiple comparisons were conducted using a t statistic with the standard error computed from the residual mean square in the analysis of variance and the comparison-wise error rate with Bonferroni adjustment for the number of comparisons. Statistical computations were carried out using PROC TTEST and PROC GLM in SAS®, Release 9.1. PKCα Increases Gli-luciferase Activity in NIH/3T3 Cells—Neill et al. (48Neill G.W. Ghali L.R. Green J.L. Ikram M.S. Philpott M.P. Quinn A.G. Cancer Res.. 2003; 63: 4692-4697Google Scholar) have shown that PKCα is a potent regulator of Gli1 transcriptional activity in 293T cells. To test if the effect of PKCα on the regulation of Gli1 is cell type-dependent, we first investigated the effects of PKCα on Gli1-luciferase activity in NIH/3T3 cells. NIH/3T3 cells were co-transfected with a wild-type Gli-luciferase reporter or a mutated Gli-luciferase reporter (point mutation that abolishes the binding of Gli), Gli1, and constitutively active PKCα AE. PKCα AE significantly increased the wild-type Gli-luciferase activity, but not the mutant, indicating the specific regulation of PKCα on Gli activity (Fig. 1A, top panel). Western blot analysis was performed in cells overexpressing Gli1 and PKCα AE to monitor the status of protein expression (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Expression of Myc-tagged Gli1 was not altered by PKCα AE compared with the control vector; phosphorylation of overexpressed PKCα AE was detected using anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (Thr-638/641) antibody to demonstrate the activation of PKCα. It has been suggested that activation of MEK/ERK signaling is involved downstream of the PKC pathway (30Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Google Scholar, 31Keshamouni V.G. Mattingly R.R. Reddy K.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 22558-22565Google Scholar); therefore, we probed the membrane with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not altered by PKCα AE. To further determine if PKCα regulation of Gli1 is mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway, cells were transfected with Gli-luciferase reporter, Gli1 and wild-type PKCα followed by combination treatment of PMA and PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, for 6 h. The presence of PD98059 completely blocked Gli1 luciferase activity (Fig. 1B, top panel). Results from Western blot shows that PD98059 treatment effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation; whereas, either PMA or PD98059 had no effect on Myc-tagged Gli1 protein expression (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Our data suggest that PKCα plays a positive role in the regulation of Gli1 activity; this effect is mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway. PKCδ Down-regulates Gli-luciferase Activity in NIH/3T3 Cells—It has been demonstrated that PKCδ increased the activity of Gli1 in NIH/3T3 (13Riobo N.A. Haines G.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Cancer Res.. 2006; 66: 839-845Google Scholar) and 293T cells (48Neill G.W. Ghali L.R. Green J.L. Ikram M.S. Philpott M.P. Quinn A.G. Cancer Res.. 2003; 63: 4692-4697Google Scholar). To examine the role of PKCδ in regulating Gli activity, we co-transfected NIH/3T3 cells with Gli luciferase reporter, Gli1, and either wild-type PKCδ (PKCδ WT), kinase-dead PKCδ K376R (PKCδ KD), constitutively active PKCδ (PKCδ ΔNPS), which is an N-terminal pseudosubstrate domain deletion or empty vector (pcDNA3), and then treated with PMA (200 nm) for 6 h (Fig. 2A, top panel). Consistent with the previous findings (13Riobo N.A. Haines G.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Cancer Res.. 2006; 66: 839-845Google Scholar, 48Neill G.W. Ghali L.R. Green J.L. Ikram M.S. Philpott M.P. Quinn A.G. Cancer Res.. 2003; 63: 4692-4697Google Scholar), PMA treatment increased Gli-luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with pcDNA3. In contrast, PMA treatment significantly decreased Gli-luciferase activity in cells transfected with PKCδ WT. In the cells transfected with PKCδ ΔNPS, Gli-luciferase activity was further decreased either in the presence or absence of PMA, whereas Gli-luciferase activity was not altered in cells transfected with PKCδ KD. To further test the specificity of PKCδ-dependent Gli-luciferase activity by PMA treatment, NIH/3T3 cells were co-transfected with Gli luciferase reporter and PKCδ WT as well as pcDNA3 and treated with various doses of PMA (Fig. 2B, top panel). In the cells transfected with pcDNA3, PMA treatment enhanced Gli1-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent fashion; however, in the presence of PKCδ WT, PMA treatment decreased Gli-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The decrease of Gli-luciferase activity in cells transfected with PKCδ WT, stimulated by PMA, was blocked by rottlerin (Fig. 2C, top panel), further suggesting the effect of PKCδ on Gli activity. Fig. 2D shows PD98059 decreased Gli-luciferase activity in the cells with PKCδ WT overexpression either in the absence or presence of PMA. In addition, Western blots were performed (Fig. 2, A–D, bottom panels) showing the effect of PKCδ on ERK signaling. PMA treatment deleted endogenous phosphorylated and total PKCδ expression (Fig. 2A), indicating that the endogenous PKCδ does not play an important role in PMA-stimulated Gli activity in NIH/3T3 cells. PMA treatment did not affect HA-tagged PKCδ expression in either total or phosphorylation level. Furthermore, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not altered by overexpression of PKCδ. We also examined the effect of PKCδ on the expression of the endogenous Gli-regulated gene PTCH1. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays showed that, in cells transfected with pcDNA3 as well as PKCδ KD, PTCH1 mRNA expression was not altered either with or without PMA treatment. In contrast, PMA treatment decreased PTCH1 mRNA levels in cells transfected with PKCδ WT in the presence of PMA; PTCH1 mRNA expression was also decreased in cells transfected with PKCδΔ NPS either in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our data demonstrate that PKCδ plays a negative role in the regulation of Gli activity stimulated by PMA. Similar results were also observed when Gli2 was used (data not shown). PKCδ Affects Hh Pathway Signaling and Gli1 Protein Expression in Human Hepatoma Hep3B Cells—Our findings imply an antagonistic role for PKCδ on the activity of Gli, suggesting a role of PKCδ in regulating tumor cell progression via Hedgehog signaling. Therefore, we next focused on PKCδ to test whether PKCδ plays a similar role in Hep3B hepatoma cells, which possess constitutive Hh activity (4Huang S. He J. Zhang X. Bian Y. Yang L. Xie G. Zhang K. Tang W. Stelter A.A. Wang Q. Zhang H. Xie J. Carcinogenesis.. 2006; 27: 1334-1340Google Scholar). For this purpose, Hep3B cells were co-transfected with Gli luciferase reporter, Gli, and various concentrations of the PKCδ ΔNPS; NIH/3T3 cells were used as a positive control (Fig. 3A, top panel). Similar to NIH/3T3 cells, overexpression of PKCδ ΔNPS significantly decreased Gli-luciferase activity in Hep3B cells in a dose-dependent pattern. To understand how PKCδ down-regulates Gli1 activity, we tested if overexpression of PKCδ ΔNPS affected Myc-tagged Gli1 protein expression by Western blot analysis. The Myc-tagged Gli1 was decreased by the overexpression of PKCδ ΔNPS in a dose-dependent fashion in either NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3A, bottom panel, left) or Hep3B cells (Fig. 3A, bottom panel, right). Next, we determined whether PKCδ affects endogenous Hh target genes, PTCH1 and Gli1, in Hep3B cells by real-time RT-PCR. mRNA expression of PTCH1 and Gli1 was decreased in cells transfected with PKCδ WT and PKCδ ΔNPS, whereas PKCδ KD did not affect the expression of these genes (Fig. 3B, top panel). Furthermore, endogenous Gli1 protein levels in Hep3B cells were decreased by PKCδ WT and PKCδ ΔNPS but not PKCδ KD as shown by Western blot in Fig. 3B, bottom panel. To address whether PKCδ regulates Gli1 through direct protein-protein interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results show that both PKCδ WT and KD associated with Gli1 in cells (Fig. 3C). As a positive control, the interaction between PKCδ and its upstream kinase PDK1 was readily detected as well. In addition, the time course for Gli1 protein degradation was monitored using pulse-chase experiments. Hep3B cells expressing Gli1 and co-transfected with a control vector or PKCδ ΔNPS were treated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. The rate of Gli1 degradation was similar in the control and PKCδ ΔNPS-expressing cells (data not shown), suggesting that PKCδ is not involved in regulating the protein stability of Gli1 in Hep3B cells. Taken together, our results indicate that overexpression of an active form (either WT or ΔNPS) but not a kinase-dead mutant of PKCδ negatively regulates Gli1 expression likely through transcriptional down-regulation of Gli1 mRNA. Wild-type and Constitutively Active PKCδ Decreases Nuclear Gli1 Expression—We have shown that PKCδ down-regulated exogenous and endogenous Gli activity. Modulation of Gli accumulation in the nucleus is a major mechanism for controlling its activity (39Di Marcotullio L. Ferretti E. Greco A. De Smaele E. Po A. Sico M.A. Alimandi M. Giannini G.

Reversine has been shown to induce dedifferentiation of multiple terminally differentiated mesodermal origin cells, which are capable of being directed to differentiate into other cell types within mesodermal lineages. However, the possibilities of these cells to give rise to other lineages have not been examined. Here we show that large scale gene expression profiling of reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts identifies a subset of up-regulated genes involved in specification of neuroectodermal as well as mesodermal lineages. Reversine treatment leads to up-regulation of priming genes of neuroectodermal lineages, such as Ngn2, Nts, Irx3, Pax7, Hes1, and Hes6, through active histone modifications in the promoter regions of these genes. Additionally, reversine increases the expression of markers for other cell types of mesodermal lineages, Ogn and apoE, via inducing active histone modifications, while down-regulating the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor, MyoD, via repressive histone modifications. Consistent with up-regulation of these genes, reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts redifferentiate into neural as well as mesodermal lineages, under appropriate stimuli. Taken together, these results indicate that reversine induces a multipotency of C2C12 myoblasts via inducing a specific combination of active histone modifications. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the application of reversine to dedifferentiation of somatic cells.

Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the application of reversine to dedifferentiation of somatic cells. Stem cells that possess an unlimited potential for self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into various specialized cells in response to appropriate signals can be classified into embryonic and tissue-specific stem cells. Embryonic stem (ES) 3The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; EC, embryonic carcinoma; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GM, growth medium; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; pol, polymerase; Ogn, osteoglycine; Nts, neurotensin; Ngn2, neurogenin2; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocysts and can differentiate into all kinds of somatic cell types. In contrast, tissue-specific adult stem cells are found in differentiated tissues as unspecialized cells and can self-renew and differentiate into specialized cell types of the tissue in which they reside (1Hubner K. Fuhrmann G. Christenson L.K. Kehler J. Reinbold R. De La Fuente R. Wood J. Strauss III, J.F. Boiani M. Scholer H.R. Science.. 2003; 300: 1251-1256Google Scholar, 2Toyooka Y. Tsunekawa N. Akasu R.

Schultz P.G. Nat. Biotechnol... 2004; 22: 833-840Google Scholar). The characteristics of stem cells attract great attention for their potential therapeutic use for degenerative diseases, including type I diabetes, muscular dystrophies, cancers, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. However, the applications of stem cells for cell replacement therapy have a number of problems such as the limited propagation capacity and the restricted differentiation of stem cells, as well as allograft rejection (5Fairchild P.J. Cartland S. Nolan K.F. Waldmann H. Trends Immunol... 2004; 25: 465-470Google Scholar). Dedifferentiation of adult differentiated cells into multipotent progenitors could be a very attractive alternative to overcome many of these obstacles (6Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Nature.. 2006; 441: 1061-1067Google Scholar). Although somatic cells are thought to be stably committed to their fate, emerging evidence indicates that dedifferentiation events can occur through nuclear transfer (7Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature.. 1997; 385: 810-813Google Scholar), cell fusion (8Cowan C.A. Atienza J. Melton D.A. Eggan K. Science.. 2005; 309: 1369-1373Google Scholar, 9Tada M. Takahama Y. Abe K. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Curr. Biol... 2001; 11: 1553-1558Google Scholar, 10Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Evans E.P. Smith A.G. Nature.. 2002; 416: 545-548Google Scholar), ectopic gene expression (11Odelberg S. Kollhoff A. Keating M. Cell.. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Google Scholar), and exogenous factors (12Chen X. Mao Z. Liu S. Liu H. Wang X. Wu H. Wu Y. Zhao T. Fan W. Li Y. Yew D.T. Kindler P.M. Li L. He Q. Qian L. Wang X. Fan M. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 3140-3151Google Scholar). For example, nuclear transfer of adult somatic cell into unfertilized eggs has been shown to dedifferentiate the somatic cells into pluripotent ES cells and give birth to cloned animals. Similarly, fusion of neuronal progenitor cells or bone marrow-derived cells with ES cells results in hybrids that express markers of pluripotency and contribute to chimeras. Similar observations resulted from fusing human fibroblasts with ES cells. Fusion of embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells with T-lymphoma cells also promotes the formation of colonies expressing pluripotent cell transcripts from the lymphoma genome. Thus, components of pluripotent ES or EC cells have the potential of eliciting reprogramming events in a somatic genome. Recently, a major breakthrough has been reported whereby the combined expression of four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 in fibroblasts is sufficient to induce fibroblasts to become pluripotent stem cells, which accompany the global reversion of the somatic epigenome into an ES-like state (13Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell.. 2006; 126: 663-676Google Scholar). However, the clinical success with these methods using genetic manipulation must await development of methods that avoid potentially harmful genetic modification. As an alternative, the epigenome of somatic cells may also be reprogrammed using small molecules that could increase the cellular plasticity of mammalian cells. Such small molecules could offer several advantages that include the ability for temporal, tunable, and modular control of specific proteins involved in dedifferentiation processes without abnormal genetic modification. Recently, Chen et al. (14Chen S. Zhang Q. Wu X. Schultz P.G. Ding S. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 410-411Google Scholar) have screened a library of small heterocyclic compounds, including 2,6-disubstituted purine, for their ability to induce dedifferentiation in somatic mammalian cells, and they identified a purine derivative, reversine, that can increase the plasticity of lineage-committed progenitor cells of mouse myotubes (myoblasts, C2C12 cells). C2C12 myoblasts treated with reversine do not differentiate into myotubes but gain the ability to redifferentiate into other mesodermal lineages, osteoblasts and adipocytes, respectively, when cultured with the appropriate medium (14Chen S. Zhang Q. Wu X. Schultz P.G. Ding S. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 410-411Google Scholar). Furthermore, reversine has been shown to promote the reprogramming of primary murine and human fibroblasts into myogenic competent cells, which can be then converted into skeletal muscle both in vitro and in vivo (15Anastasia L. Sampaolesi M. Papini N. Oleari D. Lamorte G. Tringali C. Monti E. Galli D. Tettamanti G. Cossu G. Venerando B. Cell Death Differ.. 2006; 13: 2042-2051Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that reversine can increase the plasticity of C2C12 myoblasts at the single-cell level and is active in multiple cell types, including 3T3E1 osteoblasts and human primary skeletal myoblasts. Reversine functions as a dual inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II heavy chain and MEK1, and both activities are required for the function of reversine in dedifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Inhibition of MEK1 and epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor results in accumulation of G2/M phase cells and a decrease in the global acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (16Chen S. Takanashi S. Zhang Q. Xiong W. Zhu S. Peters E.C. Ding S. Schultz P.G. Chen S. Takanashi S. Zhang Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 10482-10487Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of PI3K blocks the effect of reversine on the redifferentiation potential of C2C12 myoblasts toward other cell types of mesodermal lineages. Although dedifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts by reversine and the subsequent redifferentiation toward other mesodermal lineages have been shown, the full potential of reversine on dedifferentiation of these cells remains to be addressed. Toward this end, we have carried out large scale gene expression profiling of reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts. Multiple specific markers of mesodermal and neural lineages have been identified to be up-regulated in these cells via a specific combination of active histone modifications of these genes. Consistent with the gene expression profiling, the reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts dedifferentiate into more multipotent progenitor-type cells and can be induced to differentiate into neural and other mesodermal lineage cells. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which reversine promotes dedifferentiation of the lineage-committed cells into multipotent progenitor-type cells and suggest a potential rationale for the application of reversine in regenerative medicine. Cell Culture and Transfection—The C2C12 cell line, which is mouse myoblasts, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 cells were plated at a seeding density of 5 × 104/10-cm cell culture plates in 15% FBS and antibiotics, and the next day, transfection was performed with Hes6 RNA interference or control RNA (Invitrogen) as indicated in the text. 1 day later, the cells were treated and differentiated as described above according to neural differentiation methods. C17.2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 5% horse serum (growth medium (GM)) and passaged at the density of 50% confluence every 2 days. To induce differentiation, ∼60% confluent cultures were transferred to DMEM containing 2% horse serum (differentiation medium). P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Reagents and Antibodies—Reversine was obtained from Calbiochem or prepared by the known procedures (14Chen S. Zhang Q. Wu X. Schultz P.G. Ding S. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 410-411Google Scholar). LY294002 and rapamycin were obtained from Calbiochem. Commercial primary antibodies were as follows: anti-β-actin, anti-pol II, anti-trimethyl-H3 Lys-4, and H3 Lys-9 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA); anti-MyoD, Akt, phospho-Ser-473 Akt, anti-NFM, anti-NG2, and anti-S100β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-acetyl-histone H4 and H3 (Lys-9/Lys-14) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); anti-Tuj1, anti-GFAP, anti-MAP2, and anti-NCAM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Q-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using easy-Blue reagent (iNtRON Biotechnology, Sungnam, Korea). Integrity of RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Using a RNA PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI), 1 μg of RNA was used as a template for each RT-mediated PCR. The cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles under the following conditions: melting at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Reaction products were analyzed with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. For Q-PCR, template cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCRs were performed in 20 μl using 1% of the RT reaction, 50 nm of each primer, and SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCRs were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Expression levels of Gapdh were used to normalize the expression levels of each sample. Primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: MyoD, 5′-AGTAGAGAAGTGTGCGTGCT-3′ and 5′-ACGACTTCTATGATGATCCG-3′; apoE, 5′-TGCTGTTGGTCACATTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTCTGCAGCTCTTCCT-3′; Ogn, 5′-AACCTGTGCAAAGCCAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTCCTTGGGCTAAGTG-3′; Ngn2, 5′-GATGCCAAGCTCACGAAGA-3′ and 5′-ACCGTGGAGTTGGAGGATGAC-3′; Hes6, 5′-TTCACCTCTCCCTGCCTTTT-3′ and 5′-TTAATTCGGTTGGAGCATCG-3′; Nts, 5′-GAAAGCCAGGAGAGTCAGGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGAAGGCAAGAGGAAGC-3′; Irx3, 5′-CCCCTATGGCCAGTACCAGT-3′ and 5′-ATAAGCATTGCCCTCCTCGT-3′; Hes1, 5′-GTCACCTTCCAGTGGCTCCT-3′ and 5′-GTGGGCTAGGGACTTTACGG-3′; Pax7, 5′-GCCAAGAGGTTTATCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-AGAGGGGTGGACACTTCCAG-3′; GFAP, 5′-TGCTGGCTTCAAGGAGACAC-3′ and 5′-GACATCAGCCAGTTTGGTGG-3′; Tuj1, 5′-TGCTGGCCATCCAGAGTAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGTTTGAACAGCTCCTG-3′; Mash1, 5′-GGCTCAACTTCAGCGGCTTC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGTAAAGTCCAGCAGCTC-3′; MAP2, 5′-GCAACGCCAATGGATTTCCA-3′ and 5′-CTCCTGCTCAGGGAATTCCA-3′; NFM, 5′-AGACCTTTGAGGAGAAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCTCATATTGCACAAAGG-3′; Ngn1, 5′-GGCTCTGCTGCACTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCTCGATCTTCGTGAGCTTG-3′; S100β, 5′-CGCCTGGAGACGCCATCCACG-3′ and 5′-CCTGAAAACTTTGCCCCCTCC-3′; CD44, 5′-GCTCCACCATCGAGAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-ACCAGAAGTTGTGGTCACTCC-3′; and Gapdh, 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min, and then 30 μg of each protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; the membranes were blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The membranes were then washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody, and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin from 1 × 106 C2C12 cells sheared by a sonicator was precleared with salmon sperm DNA-saturated protein A/G-Sepharose and then precipitated by acetylated histone H3 antibody and others. After immunoprecipitation, recovered chromatin fragments were subjected to PCR (PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 30 s) using primer pairs specific for MyoD, Ogn, ApoE, Hes1, and Hes6 promoter. The primer sequences for each promoter are as follows: MyoD, 5′-CTTTCTTCACCACACCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTTAACTTTCTGCCACT-3′; Ogn, 5′-TGCCGCAGTTTCAAATATCC-3′ and 5′-GTTTCAGGGCCCAACAGTTT-3′; ApoE, 5′-TGAAGGGGGAGAGAACAACC-3′ and 5′-CAAGTCCTTAGCCTCCAGGG-3′; Hes1, 5′-CGGAATCCCCTGTCTACCTC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCTTCTCAGTCCCCAGAG-3′; and Hes6, 5′-GCCGAGGCTGCTGTCTG-3′ and 5′-TGGGCGTCTGGCCGACA-3′. cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from control and reversine-treated C2C12 cells using easy-Blue reagent (iNtRON Biotechnology) with an additional purification step (RNeasy, Qiagen) before quality assessment (Agilent Bioanalyzer, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with the chemiluminescent RT-IVT labeling kit (Applied Biosystems) and hybridized to a 60-mer whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray (Applied Biosystems) containing 33,202 probes representing 29,098 genes. Array hybridization, chemiluminescence detection, image acquisition, and analysis were performed using Applied Biosystems chemiluminescence detection kit and Applied Biosystems 1700 chemiluminescent microarray analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol. The hybridization reaction was duplicated per sample. Mesodermal Lineage Differentiation—C2C12 cells were treated with 5 μm reversine for 4 days and washed in DMEM. For adipogenic differentiation, cells were cultured for a further 3 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml indomethacin, 0.45 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 50 μg/ml ascorbate 2-phosphate, and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. Cells were fixed with 4% formalin, washed in 5% isopropyl alcohol and stained for 15 min with Oil-Red-O. For osteogenic differentiation, cells were cultured for 6 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 50 μm ascorbate 2-phosphate and 10 mm β-glycerophosphatase, replacing the medium every 2–3 days. Extracellular matrix mineralization nodules were visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining. Induction of Neural Differentiation—C2C12 cells were treated with 5 μm reversine for 4 days or with 20 nm reversine for 2 days and washed in DMEM. For neuronal differentiation, cells were cultured for further 4 days in 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with N2 and B27 (Invitrogen), replacing the medium every 2–3 days. Reversine/RA-induced Neural Differentiation—C2C12 or P19 cells were plated at a seeding density of 5 × 104 cells/60-mm poly-d-lysine- (Sigma) and laminin (Invitrogen)-coated dish 1 day before treatment of reversine. After 2 days of incubation of 20 nm reversine, cells were then treated with 0.5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) in serum-free medium (DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with the ITS (Sigma) and antibiotics) for 2 days and switched into serum-free medium in the absence of RA with replacement of the medium every 2 days (17Pacherník J. Bryja V. Esner M. Kubala L. Dvorák P. Hampl A. Physiol. Res... 2005; 54: 115-122Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton was achieved by adding 2 μg/ml cytochalasin-D (Sigma) or 2% DMSO for 90 min in growth condition and neural differentiation condition. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured onto coverslips, and after induction of differentiation, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocking with bovine serum albumin. The following primary antibodies were used to analyze neuronal and glial differentiation of cells: anti-Tuj1, anti-GFAP, anti-MAP2, anti-NFM, anti-NCAM, anti-NG2, and anti-S100β. Secondary antibodies used were conjugated with Alexa 488 and Alexa 555 (Invitrogen). For the nuclei staining, the cells were incubated in 4 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min (Biosciences). Large Scale Gene Expression Profiling of Reversine-treated C2C12 Cells Identifies Genes Indicative of Multilineage Priming for Mesodermal and Neuroectodermal Lineages—Reversine has been reported to induce dedifferentiation of murine myoblasts into more multipotent progenitor-type cells that can be directed to differentiate not only adipocytes but also osteoblasts (14Chen S. Zhang Q. Wu X. Schultz P.G. Ding S. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 410-411Google Scholar, 15Anastasia L. Sampaolesi M. Papini N. Oleari D. Lamorte G. Tringali C. Monti E. Galli D. Tettamanti G.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 10482-10487Google Scholar). The processes underlying differentiation and dedifferentiation are precisely controlled by proper gene expression through epigenetic programming and reprogramming of the genome. To evaluate the extent of transcriptional alterations elicited by reversine, and to examine the possibility of reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts to redifferentiate to other lineage cells than mesodermal lineage cells, global gene expression levels were determined by an AB 1700 full genome expression mouse microarray analysis and compared between control and reversine-treated C2C12 cells. Reversine induces up- and down-regulation of 3426 and 3467 genes with more than 2-fold significant changes relative to control C2C12 cells, respectively (p < 0.05). Functional classification of the up- and down-regulated genes reveals that most annotated up-regulated genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction, nucleotide metabolism, immunity, protein metabolism, and developmental processes, whereas down-regulated genes are distributed into classes of nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, protein metabolism, cell cycle, and developmental processes (Fig. 1A). Among these, the up- and down-regulated genes related to the developmental process encode elements associated with anterior/posterior patterning, determination of dorsal/ventral axis, ectoderm development, embryogenesis, fertilization, gametogenesis, meiosis, mesoderm development, and segment specification (supplemental Table S1). Notably, expression of genes involved in ectoderm and mesoderm development is significantly changed. In the category of ectoderm-related genes, 32 genes are up-regulated, and 41 genes are down-regulated, and in mesoderm-related genes, 48 genes are increased, and 23 genes are decreased (Fig. 1B). Table 1 lists markers of multilineage differentiation potential for mesodermal and neuroectodermal lineages. The expressions of Ogn and apoE mRNA, which are specific markers of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, respectively, are markedly up-regulated upon treatment of C2C12 cells with reversine. In addition, genes of procollagen families, specific markers of chondrogenic lineage, are also up-regulated significantly. Interestingly, we also noted the up-regulation of specific markers of neural lineage such as Ngn2, Nts, Irx3 (Iroquois-related homeobox 3), Pax7 (paired box gene 7), Hes1 (hairy and enhancer of split), and Hes6 with more than 2-fold increases. However, we were not able to identify markers of multilineage differentiation potential for endodermal development. Taken together, these results indicate that reversine promotes the up-regulation of markers of multipotency and suggest the establishment of a multilineage priming for neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages in C2C12 myoblasts treated with reversine.TABLE 1Changes in expression level of markers of multilineage differentiation potential by reversineNameAccession no.DescriptionFold (up-regulation)Neurogenic lineageNgn2NM_009718.2Neurogenin 22.38NtsNM_024435.2Neurotensin2.40Hes1NM_008235.2Hairy and enhancer of split 12.53Hoxc8NM_010466.1Homeobox C82.59Hes6NM_019479.3Hairy and enhancer of split 62.62Irx3NM_008393.1Iroquois-related homeobox 32.86Hoxa10NM_008263.1Homeobox protein A103.10Lhx9NM_010714.1LIM homeobox protein 93.56Nr4a2NM_013613.1Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 23.57Pax7NM_011039.1Paired box gene 76.07Atoh8NM_153778.2Okadin14.46Nr4a1NM_010444.1Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 142.68Osteogenic lineageCtskNM_007802.2Cathepsin K2.54OgnNM_008760.2Osteoglycin491.50Adipogenic lineageApobec3NM_030255.2Apolipoprotein B editing complex 38.35Apobec2NM_009694.1Apolipoprotein B editing complex 22.36Apoa1bpNM_144897.3Apolipoprotein A-I-binding protein3.43Apobec1NM_031159.2Apolipoprotein B editing complex 18.62Apob48rNM_138310.1Apolipoprotein B48 receptor12.14ApoeNM_009696.2Apolipoprotein E96.46Chondrogenic lineageCol5a2NM_007737.1Procollagen, type V, α22.55Col8a1NM_007739.1Procollagen, type VIII, α12.98Col16a1NM_028266.3Procollagen, type XVI, α13.27Col3a1NM_009930.1Procollagen, type III, α13.44Col1a1NM_007742.2Procollagen, type I, α13.84Col1a2NM_007743.1Procollagen, type I, α26.01Col2a1NM_031163.1Procollagen, type II, α16.31Col11a1NM_007729.1Procollagen, type XI, α111.95Col12a1NM_007730.1Procollagen, type XII, α117.42Col6a2NM_146007.1Procollagen, type VI, α234.13Col6a1NM_009933.1Procollagen, type VI, α144.43 Open table in a new tab Reversine Alters Expression of MyoD Gene, and Markers of Mesodermal Lineage Differentiation Potential, ApoE, and Ogn Genes, through Changing Histone Modifications in Their Promoter Regions—To understand the molecular mechanism of the reversine action, we first examined its effect on expression of MyoD, a myogenic specific marker. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with 5 μm reversine in growth medium markedly reduces the level of MyoD mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B) as reported previously (14Chen S. Zhang Q. Wu X. Schultz P.G. Ding S. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 410-411Google Scholar). Histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation play an important role in regulation of gene expression through altering chromatin structure (18Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell.. 2007; 128: 707-719Google Scholar). To examine whether down-regulation of MyoD expression by reversine is also associated with alteration of histone modifications on the nucleosomes in the promoter region containing muscle-specific CAAT-box (MCAT), and various transcription factor binding sites for MyoD, Sp1, and AP2, we determined the levels of histone H3-Lys-4 and -Lys-9 trimethylation, as well as acetylation of H4 and H3 Lys-9/Lys-14 in the presence or absence of reversine using ChIP analysis. Acetylation of both H3 and H4 is depleted following reversine treatment (Fig. 2C). In addition, Lys-4-trimethylated H3, an active marker, on the nucleosomes in the promoter region are enriched in the absence of reversine, whereas reversine treatment results in a significant depletion of Lys-4-trimethylated H3. In contrast, the repressive marker Lys-9-trimethylated H3 is increased in the presence of reversine, which is accompanied by the down-regulation of MyoD expression. Taken together, the results indicate that down-regulation of MyoD expression by reversine might be attributed to depletion of active histone modifications, including acetylated H3, H4, and Lys-4-trimethylated H3, and enrichment of repressive marker Lys-9-trimethylated H3 in the promoter of MyoD. Expression of markers of multilineage differentiation potential is essential for the establishment of multilineage differentiation priming of multipotent progenitors. Thus, we confirmed the microarray data showing that reversine up-regulates the expression of genes indicative of mesodermal lineage priming, apoE for adipogenic lineage, and Ogn for osteogenic lineage. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with reversine causes a significant increase in expression levels of apoE and Ogn as determined by RT-PCR analysis, which are maintained during differentiation (Fig. 2D). Changes in expression level of the genes are accompanied by histone modifications in their promoter regions (Fig. 2E). Reversine treatment up-regulates expression of the ApoE gene by active histone modifications, including hyperacetylation of H4 and H3Lys-9/Lys-14, enrichment of Lys-4-trimethylated H3, and depletion of repressive marker, Lys-9-trimethylated H3. Similarly, active histone modifications in the promoter of the Ogn gene are enriched in the presence of reversine. In parallel, reversine-treated myoblasts can redifferentiate into mesodermal lineage, osteoblast and adipocyte, under specific differentiation conditions (Fig. 2F), consistent with the previous report (16Chen S. Takanashi S. Zhang Q. Xiong W. Zhu S. Peters E.C. Ding S. Schultz P.G. Chen S. Takanashi S. Zhang Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 10482-10487Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that increase in plasticity of reversine-treated C2C12 cells for mesodermal lineage might be attributed to up-regulation of genes indicative of mesodermal lineage priming, such as ApoE and Ogn, through inducing active histone modifications on their promoter regions. Reversine Up-regulates Specific Markers of Neural Lineage and Induces Active Histone Modifications on Their Promoter Regions—Although reversine has been shown to induce redifferentiation of C2C12 cells into other cell types of mesodermal lineages, including osteoblasts and adipocytes, large scale gene expression profiling of reversine-treated C2C12 cells showing the up-regulation of specific markers of neural lineages leads to an assumption that reversine-treated C2C12 myoblasts might also have a potential to red"

The PNC is a generally heritable trait, in which the number of PNCs per cell in daughter cells often mimics that of their mother cells. The PNC is heterogeneous in shape and ranges from 0.5 to 4 μm in size (1Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), is stable through interphase, disassembles during mitosis, and reassembles in early G1 (1Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H.

The PNC is concentrated with newly synthesized RNA polymerase III RNAs (MRP RNase RNA, RNase P H1 RNA, hY RNAs (hY1, -2, and -5), AluRNA, and SRP (7SL) RNA) and RNA-binding proteins (nucleolin, PTB, CUG repeat-binding protein, KSRP, Raver1, Raver2, and Rod1) (2Huang S.

Huang S. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 95: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the complete molecular composition and function of the PNC remain to be elucidated. Extensive in vitro studies showed that the PNC is unique to tumor cells and preferentially forms in tumor cells derived from solid tissues (1Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Norton J.T. Pollock C.B. Wang C. Schink J.C. Kim J.J. Huang S. Cancer. 2008; 113: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of cancer cell lines from various origins and malignant capacities have shown that PNC prevalence correlates with the malignancy of tumors and has the potential to be developed as a pan-cancer prognostic marker (10Norton J.T. Pollock C.B. Wang C. Schink J.C. Kim J.J. Huang S. Cancer. 2008; 113: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo investigations using human breast tissue samples demonstrated that PNC prevalence was 0% in normal breast epithelium, increases in parallel with the disease progression (as determined by staging), and reaches nearly 100% in distant metastases, demonstrating that PNC prevalence associates with the malignancy of breast cancer in vivo. Multivariate analysis further showed that a high PNC prevalence is associated with poor patient outcomes independent of current prognostic factors for stage I breast cancer patients (11Kamath R.V. Thor A.D. Wang C. Edgerton S.M. Slusarczyk A. Leary D.J. Wang J. Wiley E.L. Jovanovic B. Wu Q. Nayar R. Kovarik P. Shi F. Huang S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the presence of the PNC reflects an advanced transformation state of cancer cells that are capable of metastasis. Although a handful of components has been discovered, little is known regarding the structure and function of the PNC or its mechanistic link to cancer. Therefore, we report here the combinational use of chemical biology and cell biology approaches to gain a better understanding of the PNC. Because the PNC is so tightly associated with the malignant phenotype, known anti-cancer compounds were screened to identify those that can reduce PNC prevalence in cancer cell lines. We found that two types of drugs can significantly reduce PNC prevalence as follows: pol III transcription inhibitors and a subset of DNA-damaging agents. In depth analyses of the DNA-damaging agents indicated that the PNC is likely associated with a DNA locus. This idea is supported through cell biology approaches, leading to the conclusion that PNC is nucleating upon a mid S phase replicating DNA locus. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—HeLa, HT2-19 (kind gift from Dr. Yossi Gruenbaum, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel), and FEMX (including FVP1 and FVP3, kind gifts from Dr. Ira Pastan, National Institutes of Health) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential media (Invitrogen), and PC-3M and DU145 (including RC1 and RC0.1, kind gifts from Dr. Yves Pommier, National Institutes of Health) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). All media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). All drugs and compounds were kept as 10 or 100 mm stocks (20 mm for folinic acid) in DMSO at –20 °C except for cis-platin and carbo-platin, which were dissolved to 10 mm in sterile PBS and kept at 4 °C (made fresh every 2 weeks). For drug treatments, cells were plated ∼24 h prior to treatment and treated for 20 h unless otherwise noted. UV treatment (100 mJ/m2) was performed on coverslips and removed from media, in a UV cross-linking chamber. All xenobiotics were obtained from Sigma, except for gemcitabine (kind gift from Dr. Steven Rosen, Northwestern Medical School) and the NCI mechanistic and diversity sets (from the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI, National Institutes of Health). For screening this library, HeLa cells were plated at a density of ∼10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate, treated overnight with the compounds at 10 μm (mechanistic set) or 100 μm (diversity set) to get a final solvent concentration of 1% DMSO, and stained with SH54 antibody to mark the PNC (see below for details). If this concentration killed all the cells, it was titrated down to a dose that allowed for PNC prevalence determination. All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed, two sample (unequal variance) Student's t test. Immunofluorescent Staining to Mark the PNC—The media were removed from cells plated on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips, and cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 min. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min each with PBS, solubilized for 5 min with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and then washed three times for 5 min each with PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in a 1:200 dilution of SH54 (anti-PTB antibody (1Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) in PBS for 1 h and then washed three times for 10 min each with PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and washed three times for 10 min each with PBS and then mounted on slides with anti-fade. Greater than 200 cells per coverslip were scored for PNC prevalence (n = 3). To be considered PNC-positive, a cell must have a distinct, punctate, perinucleolar labeling of PTB that is ∼1.5 times or greater the intensity of the nucleoplasmic PTB labeling. PNC scoring was performed by adjusting the focus plane through the entire depth of each cell scored using a ×60 objective on an epifluorescent microscope. A ×100 objective on an epifluorescent microscope was used for determining PNC number per cell. For screening the NCI library a ×20 objective on an inverted epifluorescent microscope was used. Growth Inhibition Assay—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The media were removed, and 198 μl of fresh media was added to each well. Each well was treated with 1 of 8 doses for each drug (105, 104.66, 104.33 nm,... 102.66 nm or 106 nm, 105.66, 10533 nm,... 103.66 nm) to give a final vehicle concentration of 1% DMSO and media volume of 200 μl. Cell proliferation was measured at t = 0 (time at start of treatment) and t = 72 h using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, AQueous nonradioactive proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, the medium was removed and replaced with 120 μl of 1:5 v/v 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt/media solution and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37°C. The absorbance at 490 nm in each well was read with a Spectramax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The absorbance at t = 0 was subtracted from all absorbances at t = 72 h so that a 100% growth inhibitory concentration ([GI100%]) corresponds to when A0 h = A72 h; for HeLa cells the GImax is ∼110%. Each experiment was repeated four times, and the data for each concentration were averaged, and growth inhibition curves were constructed using XLfit4 software (IDBS, Guilford, UK). RNase T1 Protection Assay—To determine the effect of various drugs on RNA polymerase III (7SK and Y1 promoters) transcription, 500 ng of pBS-7SK-3.6 and pBS-Y1-997 were each transiently transfected separately into 200,000 HeLa cells (in 35-mm dishes) with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pBS-7SK-3.6 and pBS-Y1-997 reporter plasmids contain 243 bp of the 7SK promoter region or 997 bp of the Y1 promoter region, respectively, upstream from an inverted β-globin gene insert followed by a sequence from the U1 gene containing the U1 3′ box as an RNA polymerase II termination signal and six Ts as an RNA polymerase III termination signal. The pBS-7SK-3.6 and pBS-Y1-997 reporter plasmids were used to make the complementary radiolabeled probes for each respective reporter using a T7 promoter located in an inverted orientation 28 bp downstream of the six Ts. Six hours after transfection, cells were treated with the drugs. After an additional 20 h, cells were lysed, and total RNA was collected using 1 ml of TRIzol. Total RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop spectrometer, and the RNA concentrations for each sample were verified by measuring the rRNA from 1 μg of total RNA using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Specific RNA transcripts from each reporter gene were analyzed using RNase T1 protection assays using ∼1 μg of total RNA and hybridizing to 300,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe specific to the appropriate reporter transcript. The signals from protected RNA species were quantified using a phosphorimaging scanner and Multi-Gauge software from Fujifilm. siRNA and Immunoblotting—SMARTpool double-stranded RNAs against topoisomerase I were chemically synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research Inc. The sequences of the pooled topo I oligonucleotides are as follows: 5′-GACUAGAGAAGCCAUUUUCUU-3′; 5′-AAUCAUUCAAUCGGAAAUCUU-3′; 5′-UGGGUGUAGAUUGAUGUGCUU-3′, and 5′-GACUCUACUACCUUCUUCGUU-3′. The negative control siRNA was from Ambion, Inc. (Silencer® Negative Control 2 siRNA). PC-3M cells were plated at a density of ∼200,000 per 35-mm well and allowed to attach overnight. Transfection of siRNA into the cells was conducted utilizing Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Seventy two hours post-transfection cells were lysed in 150 μl of detergent buffer containing 1:100 v/v protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were run on denaturing 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) dried milk in TBST, incubated in anti-topoisomerase I antibody (Topogen, Port Orange, FL) at 1:2,000 v/v dilution in 5% milk in TBST overnight at 4 °C, washed, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5,000 v/v dilution in 5% milk for 1 h, and then developed. The membranes were then stripped with a reducing buffer, blocked in 5% milk, incubated in rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma) at 1:2,000 v/v dilution in 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, washed, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5,000 v/v dilution in 5% milk for 1 h, and then developed. Membranes were developed with PicoWest developing solution (Pierce) and exposed to film. The band intensity was determined by scanning the developed films with a Kodak Image Station 440 CF and measuring the average pixel intensity of an area slightly larger than each band and subtracting the median background pixel intensity of the perimeter of the same area using Kodak MI software. PNC Prevalence Reduction by Chemotherapeutic Drugs—Our previous studies have correlated PNC prevalence with the level of malignancy in solid tumors (10Norton J.T. Pollock C.B. Wang C. Schink J.C. Kim J.J. Huang S. Cancer. 2008; 113: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Kamath R.V. Thor A.D. Wang C. Edgerton S.M. Slusarczyk A. Leary D.J. Wang J. Wiley E.L. Jovanovic B. Wu Q. Nayar R. Kovarik P. Shi F. Huang S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar), and because the molecular mechanisms of clinically used anti-cancer drugs are well characterized, we screened these drugs for the ability to reduce PNC prevalence. HeLa and PC-3M cancer cell lines (PNC prevalence of ∼80–85%) were treated with 100 μm of each drug for 20 h, and if this concentration killed the vast majority of cells or arrested the cells in mitosis (PNCs disassemble during mitosis), the concentration was titrated down by 100.33 m until a concentration was achieved that allowed for PNC prevalence determination (maximum tolerated concentration, see Table 1). To allow for PNC prevalence determination, greater than 200 nonapoptotic interphase cells must remain on the coverslip after processing. PNCs were detected by immunofluorescent staining against the PTB, a component of the PNC (Fig. 1B). The results show that a subset of drugs, including topoisomerase I (topo I) and topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors, DNA cross-linkers, a subset of nucleoside analogs, and methotrexate were able to reduce PNC prevalence well below the vehicle-treated controls in both cell lines at the maximum tolerated concentration, whereas DNA alkylators, microtubule disrupting drugs (including 100 μm, 3-h treatments; data not shown), hydroxyurea (including 2 mm, 20-h treatments; data not shown), and some nucleoside analogs had no effect (Fig. 1A). The phenotypic effect on the PNC of drugs that disassemble the structure and those that do not is exemplified in Fig. 1B.TABLE 1Maximum tolerated concentrations (MTC) of anti-cancer chemotherapeutics in HeLa and PC-3M cells MTC is the highest dose up to 100 μm that allowed for PNC prevalence determination after 20 h of treatment. Open table in a new tab Reduction of PNC Prevalence Can Be Uncoupled from Drug-induced Cytotoxicity and Cell Cycle Block—Cancer drugs are usually cytotoxic or cytostatic to proliferating cancer cells. PNC prevalence reduction parallels the growth inhibition by some of these drugs as exemplified by camptothecin (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PNC prevalence reduction is either due to inhibition of the molecular targets of the drugs or a result of growth inhibition. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the PNC prevalence reduction to the growth inhibition by camptothecin (PNC reducing topo I inhibitor) and chlorambucil (non-PNC reducing DNA alkylator). Seventy two hour growth inhibition (GI) curves were created for HeLa cells treated with these drugs, and the [GI99%] was determined from the curves. HeLa cells were then treated for 72 h with this concentration, and PNC prevalence was compared with the proliferation rate at 12-h time points. In both treatments there was a separation of PNC prevalence from growth inhibition. The majority of chlorambucil-treated cells began undergoing apoptosis by the end of 72 h, but the PNC prevalence remained near control levels in the remaining live cells and in some pre-apoptotic cells (Fig. 2B). In comparison, the PNC prevalence in camptothecin-treated cells dropped to nearly 10% of the control while the cells were still proliferating (Fig. 2B). To further validate that PNC prevalence reduction is because of specific molecular actions of compounds, HeLa cells were treated with camptothecin, which is a reversible inhibitor of topo I, at the [GI99%] for 36 h and then allowed to recover for 36 h in the absence of drug. PNC prevalence returns to near control levels within 12 h and fully returns to control levels 36 h after removal of the drug (Fig. 2C). The PNC prevalence recovery is not because of selective proliferation of PNC-positive cells after drug removal but is because of reformation of PNCs because camptothecin induces cell cycle block in late S or G2 phases (12Li L.H. Fraser T.J. Olin E.J. Bhuyan B.K. Cancer Res. 1972; 32: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar), as demonstrated by the stable cell number after drug removal (Fig. 2C). Other cell cycle blockers such as hydroxyurea (G1/S blocker, Fig. 1A) and various cell cycle blocking kinase inhibitors have no effect on PNC prevalence (data not shown). This result also indicates that the PNC loss in treated cells is not because of interphase cell cycle block. The reversibility of PNC prevalence reduction by camptothecin suggests that PNC reduction induced by this drug is likely due to its on-target inhibition of topo I, because the inhibitory effect of the drug on this enzyme is reversible. In addition, as demonstrated in Fig. 2A, PNC prevalence reduction correlates with the growth inhibition in camptothecin-treated cells, suggesting that the cytotoxic mechanism of the drug (topo I inhibition) is the same as the PNC disassembling mechanism. To test this possibility, camptothecin-resistant cells (RC1 and RC0.1) that contain a mutation in the topo I enzyme (13Urasaki Y. Laco G.S. Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Kohlhagen G. Gioffre C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1964-1969PubMed Google Scholar) and their camptothecin-sensitive parental cells, DU145 (human prostate cancer), were used. The mutant cell lines are 500–1000 times more resistant to camptothecin (Table 2) in accordance with previously published data (13Urasaki Y. Laco G.S. Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Kohlhagen G. Gioffre C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1964-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if PNC prevalence reduction by camptothecin is due to off-target effects rather than to topo I inhibition, PNC prevalence should be close to 0% in the mutant cell lines at their respective low growth inhibitory concentrations (i.e. [GI10%]) because these higher concentrations would reduce PNC prevalence to near 0% in the parental line. However, the PNC prevalence reduction in the mutant cells was similar to, or less than, the parental cell line at the same GI concentrations of camptothecin, demonstrating that PNC prevalence reduction by camptothecin is indeed due to the inhibition of topo I (Fig. 3A). A similar approach was used to show that PNC reduction by etoposide is due to inhibition of the topo II enzyme. Etoposide-resistant cell lines (FVP1 and FVP3), which have mutations in the topo II enzyme, and the parental FEMX melanoma cell line were treated with etoposide, and in accordance with previously published data (14Campain J.A. Padmanabhan R. Hwang J. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the mutant cell lines are severalfold more resistant to etoposide (Table 2). The PNC prevalence reduction in the mutant cells was similar to, or less than, the parental cell line at the same GI concentrations of etoposide, demonstrating that PNC prevalence reduction by etoposide is due to the inhibition of topo II (Fig. 3B). In addition, methotrexate, which inhibits pyrimidine synthesis through antagonism, is able to reduce PNC prevalence. When folinic acid, which allows cells to overcome inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by methotrexate, is added to the media along with the methotrexate, it prevents PNC prevalence reduction (Fig. 3C). Thus far, these findings indicate that PNC prevalence reduction by xenobiotics is a result of inhibiting the molecular targets of the compound, rather than nonspecific cytotoxic effects. Therefore, PNC prevalence reduction is a screening marker that will be useful for identifying compounds to investigate the structure and function of the PNC.TABLE 2Growth inhibition (GI) 10, 50, and 90% concentrations of camptothecin/etoposide for the DU145 cell line and its camptothecin-resistant sublines (RC1 and RC0.1) as well as for the FEMX cell line and its etoposide-resistant sublines (FVP1 and FVP3) as determined by the MTS proliferation assay Open table in a new tab RNA Polymerase III Inhibition Versus PNC Prevalence Reduction by Chemotherapeutic Drugs—Methotrexate inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, whereas hydroxyurea only inhibits DNA synthesis. Because methotrexate is able to disassemble the PNC and hydroxyurea cannot (Fig. 1), along with the data from Fig. 3C, these data demonstrate that RNA synthesis but not DNA replication is crucial for PNC maintenance. This is consistent with our previous studies in which the integrity of the PNC is dependent upon pol III transcription, but not immediately dependent upon pol I or pol II transcription. Previous observations in cells treated with polymerase inhibitors were made after only 3–5-h treatments (2Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and because we treated cells with drugs for 20 h in the present studies, it is not clear whether a prolonged pol I or pol II inhibition can disassemble the PNC. To examine this possibility, HeLa cells were treated with cycloheximide, which indirectly inhibits pol I activity through protein synthesis inhibition, and 5,6-dichloro-1-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, which directly inhibits pol II transcription, for 20 h at the same concentrations used for prior short term treatments (2Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inhibition of pol I (by way of inhibition of protein synthesis) and pol II for 20 h does not affect the PNC prevalence (Fig. 4A), indicating that PNC prevalence reduction by methotrexate is most likely due to pol III inhibition. To further determine the relationship between RNA polymerase III transcription and PNC prevalence, we utilized an RNase protection assay to quantify pol III transcription in drug-treated cells. In this system, HeLa cells are transfected with an untranslatable reporter driven by either the Y1 or 7SK pol III promoters (Fig. 4B) and treated with drugs, and after 20 h the total RNA is isolated for probing in the RNase protection assay. pol III inhibition correlates well (p > 0.05) with the PNC prevalence reduction when cells were treated with the nucleoside analogs and methotrexate (Fig. 4C). Because DNA synthesis inhibition and pol I/II inhibition does not disassemble the PNC, the data demonstrate that PNC reduction by these nucleic acid analogs and anti-metabolites is a result of pol III transcription inhibition. Interestingly, not all drugs that reduce PNC prevalence inhibit pol III transcription in parallel. For example, actinomycin D reduces PNC prevalence to near 0% of the control at 9 nm, but only decreases pol III transcription by 18% (p < 0.01), suggesting that it, as well as camptothecin and mitomycin C (p < 0.05), is reducing PNC prevalence, at least in part, through mechanisms other than pol III transcriptional inhibition. In addition, decreased pol III transcription alone does not always correlate with decreased PNC prevalence as demonstrated by the pol III inhibition caused by bleomycin and N,N′,N′-triethylenethiophosphoramide (p < 0.05), neither of which affect PNC prevalence, suggesting that other effects of these drugs are inhibiting the disassembly of the PNC because tagetin, a very specific and direct inhibitor of pol III, has been shown to disassemble the PNC (2Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DNA Damage Disassembles the PNC—Topoisomerase inhibiting, DNA cross-linking, DNA-alkylating, and DNA-oxidizing drugs all ultimately cause extensive DNA damage. Therefore, we determined if the DNA damage induced by the PNC-affecting drugs was responsible for PNC disassembly. The topo II-inhibiting drugs, such as etoposide, cause DNA damage as a result of inhibiting topo II in its enzymatic cycle so as to prevent cut DNA from being religated. To determine whether the loss of function of the enzyme or the DNA damage is the cause of PNC disassembly by topo II inhibitors, HeLa cells were treated with merbarone and ICRF-193, which inhibit topo II catalytic activity without inducing DNA damage (15Fortune J.M. Osheroff N.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17643-17650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that neither of these compounds is able to decrease PNC prevalence at their maximum tolerated concentrations (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that the DNA damage rather than the loss of topo II function is responsible for disassembly of the PNC. Topo I inhibitors also induce extensive DN"

Knockout of Palladin in mice is embryonic lethal, demonstrating the importance of Palladin in development yet its role in the vasculature is not known. In the present study, smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers, such as myosin, actin, caldesmon, calponin, and LPP, were down-regulated in embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from embryonic stem cells lacking Palladin. Transgenic embryonic stem cell lines were generated that stably expressed a puromycin-resistance gene under the control of a SM α-actin (SMA) promoter. Negative selection was then used to purify SMCs from EBs. Purified SMCs expressing multiple SMC markers were designated APSCs (SMA-puromycin-selected cells). Palladin null APSCs express significantly less myosin, actin, calponin, and h-caldesmon. The filamentous (F) to globular (G) actin ratio, known to regulate myocardin family transcription factors, was also decreased. Palladin null APSCs showed increased cell adhesion and decreased cell motility. Importantly, Palladin null APSCs within collagen gels generated less maximum contractile force when stimulated with endothelin-1, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and thrombin. Myosin light chains (MLC20) were phosphorylated by lysophosphatidic acid to the same extent in Palladin null and wild type APSCs but myosin content/total protein was reduced by >50%, consistent with the observed decreases in contractility. All together, these results suggest that Palladin is essential for expression of the full complement of contractile proteins necessary for optimal force development of SMCs derived from EBs.

All together, these results suggest that Palladin is essential for expression of the full complement of contractile proteins necessary for optimal force development of SMCs derived from EBs. The contractile state of smooth muscle regulates the normal function of most hollow organs, the airway and the vasculature. Disregulation can result in diseases such as hypertension and asthma. Contractility of smooth muscle depends on myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and crossbridge cycling, as well as expression and organization of the contractile apparatus. Palladin is a key regulator of actin organization. It localizes to focal adhesions, cell-cell junctions, dorsal and circular ruffles, growth cones, and other actin-based cellular structures, and is required for the maintenance of normal stress fibers in cultured cells (1Boukhelifa M. Parast M.M. Bear J.E. Gertler F.B. Otey C.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 2004; 58: 17-29Google Scholar, 2Ronty M. Taivainen A. Moza M. Otey C.A. Carpen O.

Other palladin family members expressed in skeletal muscle are important for sarcomere integrity and mutated forms are associated with inherited muscular disorders. We have found that palladin is highly expressed in smooth muscle (SM) (4Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar), raising the possibility that palladin could be important, as in striated muscles, for the organization of the SM cytoskeleton and thus contraction. Loss of Palladin retards motility of SMCs (4Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar), primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells (5Boukhelifa M. Parast M.M. Valtschanoff J.G. LaMantia A.S. Meeker R.B. Otey C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 2721-2729Google Scholar), invasive carcinoma cells (6Ryu B. Jones J. Hollingsworth M.A. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Cancer Res.. 2001; 61: 1833-1838Google Scholar), and fibroblasts (7Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 150: 643-656Google Scholar). Palladin is rapidly up-regulated when fibroblasts differentiate into contractile myofibroblasts (8Ronty M.J. Leivonen S.K. Hinz B. Rachlin A. Otey C.A. Kahari V.M. Carpen O.M. J. Investig. Dermatol.. 2006; 126: 2387-2396Google Scholar). Palladin serves as a scaffold for multiple actin-binding proteins, signaling molecules, and also is an actin cross-linking protein (9Goicoechea S.M. Arneman D. Otey C.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol.. 2008; 87: 517-525Google Scholar). It localizes to dense bodies in differentiated SM tissues and has a migratory role in response to environmental cues such as following vascular injury (4Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar). SMC motility involves reorganization of the cytoskeleton, relies on the recruitment of multiple signaling and adaptor proteins to focal or fibrillar adhesion sites that reiteratively form, deconstruct, and regenerate themselves, allowing cells to detach and reattach to the existing and provisional matrix on which they exert a tractional force (10Jones P.L. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 757-760Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that palladin plays an important role in organizing actin arrays within migrating cells, through both direct and indirect molecular mechanisms.We have previously shown that palladin interacts with the focal adhesion protein lipoma preferred partner (LPP) at focal adhesions in cultured cells and dense bodies in SM tissues (4Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar). They both play a significant role in SMC migration and spreading and that expression of both LPP and Palladin, like SMA, is increased by angiotensin II, regulated by actin dynamics, modulated by focal adhesion kinase, and appear in the neointima of injured vessels. We have also reported, in a model system of SMC differentiation, that Palladin and LPP, like other SM contractile proteins, are up-regulated upon differentiation and modulated by myocardin SRF, coactivator of transcription in SM and cardiac muscle, and by the Rho/ROCK signaling pathways (4Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar). The precise role of Palladin in embryonic development and vascular SM is elusive. Inactivation of Palladin leads to lethality at embryonic day 15.5 due to severe defects of cranial neural tube closure and germination of liver and intestine (11Liu X.S. Li X.H. Wang Y. Shu R.Z. Wang L. Lu S.Y. Kong H. Jin Y.E. Zhang L.J. Fei J. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Gu M.M. Lu Z.Y. Wang Z.G. Blood.. 2007; 110: 870-876Google Scholar, 12Liu X.S. Luo H.J. Yang H. Wang L. Kong H. Jin Y.E. Wang F. Gu M.M. Chen Z. Lu Z.Y. Wang Z.G. J. Cell. Biochem.. 2007; 100: 1288-1300Google Scholar) thus indicating that Palladin plays a critical role in embryonic development. However, because of the early death of Palladin knock-out mouse embryos, its role in SMC differentiation and development of contractile properties has not been determined. Interestingly, Palladin is up-regulated in neural crest cells, which is one of multiple embryonic lineages giving rise to SMCs (13Gammill L.S. Bronner-Fraser M. Development.. 2002; 129: 5731-5741Google Scholar). The present studies were focused on determining the effects of Palladin knock-out on development of SMC from embryonic stem cells using a novel in vitro embryoid model of differentiation previously reported by our laboratories (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar). Of interest, we show for the first time that Palladin-deficient ESCs can form EBs containing SMCs but these cells showed marked reductions in expression of multiple SMC marker genes including contractile proteins. In addition, Palladin knock-out ESC/EB-derived SMCs exhibited reduced contractile force development in response to agonist stimulation reflecting a reduction in myosin filament content and/or a disorganized actin network.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESESC Culture—ESCs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethonal, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 0.2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. ESCs were initially cultured on a feeder layer of irradiated embryonic fibroblasts (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V.

ESC/EBs were formed by aggregating the ESCs in hanging drops for 72 h and then cultured in suspension for 3 days. On day 6, the ESC/EBs were plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated surfaces and allowed to attach for 24 h, then were supplemented with 10 nm all-trans retinoic acid (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H.

The EBs were harvested on days 7, 10, 15, and 28 for real time RT-PCR and Western blotting.ESC-derived SMC Isolation—ESCs were electroporated with a plasmid containing a puromycin-N-acetyltransferase under the control of a SMA promoter (14Sinha S.

Stable puromycin-N-acetyltransferase ESCs colonies were selected by puromycin and the presence of puromycin-N-acetyltransferase was confirmed by PCR. EBs were generated as described above. SMA expressing SMCs were isolated by selection with puromycin. These SMC-like cell lines were designated as SMA-puromycin selected cells (APSCs).Smooth Muscle Collagen Fiber Preparation and Isometric Force Measurement—Contractile function was evaluated by incorporating cultured cells into collagen gels as previously described (15Sinha S. Hoofnagle M.H. Kingston P.A. McCanna M.E. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol.. 2004; 287: C1560-C1568Google Scholar, 16Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci.. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Google Scholar). In brief, cultured cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in neutralized collagen I solution containing 1.2 mg/ml of collagen in PBS. The collagen solution was transferred into a rectangular trough (17 × 5.5 × 1.7 mm) with a 1.6-mm diameter Teflon pole near each end. Culture medium was added to the dishes and specimens cultured for 14 days. The medium was changed every other day.The rod-shaped fibers was cut into 4-mm long strips, and then cut in half longitudinally. For isometric force measurements one end of the segment was tied to a force transducer and the other to a micromanipulator using monofilament silk thread as previously described (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar, 17Khromov A.S. Wang H. Choudhury N.

The fibers were stretched to 1.2 times slack length and equilibrated in the normal Krebs-bicarbonate solution for at least 1 h before experiments. Strips were oxygenated and kept at 30 °C in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer throughout the experiments. The contractile responses to vasoactive agonists including high potassium, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), thrombin, endothelin-1, and the myosin phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Calbiochem, San Diego) were as indicated in the figures.Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol and cDNA was generated with a cDNA synthesis kit as previously described (4Jin L.

Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res.. 2007; 100: 817-825Google Scholar).Measurement of Myosin Light Chain (MLC) Phosphorylation—The subconfluent APSCs were serum starved overnight, stimulated with 1 μm lysophosphatidic acid for 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 min, and fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The fixed samples were incubated on ice for 1 h, and collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min, then thoroughly washed with acetone. The dried samples were solubilized in urea gel buffer at room temperature. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with MLC20 polyclonal antibody (21Gailly P. Gong M.C. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol.. 1997; 500: 95-109Google Scholar).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.03% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed and blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm sodium azide, and then incubated with an rabbit anti-LPP polyclonal antibody (1:800), anti-SMA monoclonal antibody (1:500), and anti-Palladin polyclonal antibody (1:800) diluted in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) in blocking buffer (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Some cells were labeled for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (1:1,000), and Alexa 594-conjugated DNase I (1:1000, Molecular Probes) for G-actin. Cells were washed four times for 5 min with PBS before being mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, PA). Confocal images were obtained on an Olympus FV300 microscope.Electron Microscopy—Collagen gels integrated with wild type and Palladin knock-out APSCs were fixed with 2% glutaldehyde in 0.075 m cacodylate buffer with 4.5% sucrose, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with 0.075 m sodium cacodylate buffer (22Bond M. Somlyo A.V. J. Cell Biol.. 1982; 95: 403-413Google Scholar), post-fixed in 2% osmium in 0.05 m cacodylate buffer followed by 1% tannic acid, and subsequently saturated uranyl acetate. Finally, the collagen gels were dehydrated in graded alcohols and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were examined in a Phillips CM12 electron microscope and images captured with an SIA 8C digital camera (Deluth, GA) CCD camera.RESULTSPalladin Was Required for the Induction of SMC Marker Genes within ESC-embryoid Bodies—Two independent clones of homozygous Palladin knock-out ES cells were isolated from heterozygous Palladin knock-out ESCs by use of high dose G418 screening. The genotype of clones was assessed by RT-PCR for the knock-out Palladin allele, and by Western blotting for Palladin protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Wild type, heterozygous knock-out, and homozygous Palladin knock-out ES cell lines all showed expression of the ESC markers, Oct4, Sox2 and SSEA-1 (stage specific embryonic antigen-1, Fig. 1C) confirming maintenance of pluripotency. The Palladin knockout cells were then tested for their ability to differentiate into SMCs in the context of EBs. The homozygous and heterozygous ESCs were capable of forming EBs similar in size to wild type ES cells (data not shown).In wild type EBs induction of SMC marker genes, including SMA, SM22, and SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), has been previously reported (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar, 23Shang Y. Yoshida T. Amendt B.A. Martin J.F. Owens G.K. J. Cell Biol.. 2008; 181: 461-473Google Scholar). Palladin mRNA was induced in EBs at day 20 (Fig. 1D). Of major interest, induction of these SMC marker genes as well as the Lpp gene was dramatically decreased in Palladin knock-out ESCs derived EBs at day 28 (Fig. 2A). There was no detectable change in the expression of SMC genes at days 7 and 10 (data not shown). In heterozygous Palladin knock-out ESC-derived EBs, the SMC genes were also partially decreased.FIGURE 2A, the expression of SMC differentiation marker genes is attenuated in embryoid bodies derived from Palladin knock-out homozygous ESCs. The wild type (WT), heterozygous (Het), and homozygous ESCs (KO) were induced to differentiate into embryoid bodies, and the expression of SMA, SM22, and SM-MHC at day 28 was determined by real time RT-PCR. B, the expression of contractile proteins was reduced in embryoid bodies at day 28. Western blotting shows the expression of SM contractile proteins in the wild type (WT), heterozygous (Het), and homozygous (KO) EBs. Equal amounts of protein were loaded for each. C, results of quantitative analysis of SM contractile proteins. The expression is normalized to GAPDH and the values for Het and KO cells normalized to that of controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SMC Derived from Palladin Knock-out ESC Showed Diminished Expression of SM Contractile Proteins—ESCs are pluripotent because they develop into a variety of cell types in vivo when injected into a developing blastocyst (24Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E. Nature.. 1984; 309: 255-256Google Scholar). In vitro, when placed in aggregates, ESCs form EBs that can recapitulate many developmental processes (24Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E. Nature.. 1984; 309: 255-256Google Scholar, 25Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol.. 1985; 87: 27-45Google Scholar). As part of their developmental program, EBs have been shown to form regions of spontaneously contracting SMCs (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar, 26Drab M. Haller H. Bychkov R. Erdmann B. Lindschau C. Haase H. Morano I. Luft F.C. Wobus A.M. FASEB J.. 1997; 11: 905-915Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although these beating regions vary between preparations, they were observed in EBs derived from both palladin null, heterozygous Palladin knock-out, and wild type ESCs. In Palladin homozygous knock-out EBs at day 28, the expression of SMC contractile proteins, MLC20, caldesmon, and calponin was significantly decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with wild type (Fig. 2). The expression of these contractile proteins was also partially decreased in the Palladin heterozygote EBs (Fig. 2). These results and those below on the APSCs suggest that palladin was essential for full SMC contractile protein induction during embryo development.SMC Derived from Palladin Knock-out ESC Exhibited Reduced Force Generation When Aggregated within Collagen Gels—To test the role of Palladin in SMC contractile regulation, we purified SMCs from ESC-derived EBs. The SMA-puromycin-N-acetyltransferase constructs were transfected into wild type and Palladin homozygous knock-out ESCs. The ESC clones that stably integrated the puromycin resistance gene under the control of the promoter-enhancer region of the SMA were amplified. EBs were generated from the transgenic ESC lines. At day 28 the EBs were disaggregated using enzyme digestion into a single cell suspension and plated in the presence of puromycin continually for 3 days. It has been shown that the SMA promoter-enhancer region is sufficient to completely recapitulate expression patterns of endogenous genes in transgenic mice and in EBs (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar). The surviving puromycin-selected SMA expressing cells were designated as APSCs. Around 10% of plated cells survived overnight selection. The purity of APSCs was confirmed with SMA staining (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the protein expression of SMA and the SM specific protein, LPP, was reduced in Palladin knock-out versus wild type APSC. Based on the absence of mRNA and Palladin protein detected by Western blotting, the residual Palladin fluorescence signal in the Palladin KO cells likely reflects nonspecific staining with this antibody. Protein levels of MLC20, h-caldesmon, and calponin were reduced in the Palladin KO versus wild type APSCs (Fig. 3, B and C). SM-MHC was identified on Western blots with antibodies specific to SM1 and SM2, which do not react with non-muscle myosin II. Both SM1 and SM2 expression was decreased in Palladin null APSCs, whereas non-muscle IIA and IIB were unchanged (Fig. 3D). We incorporated the same number of wild type and Palladin knock-out APSCs into collagen gels (Fig. 4A). The central region of the collagen muscle fibers were cut into 4-mm long sections and split in half longitudinally for contractility studies. Thus each strip had the same dimensions, the same number of cells based on phalloidin staining, and the same number of cells counted following enzymatic dissociation of the reconstituted muscle fibers, and finally, Western blotting showed the same contents of GAPDH in WT and KO APSCs in the collagen gels (supplemental Fig. S1). Strips were mounted on a force transducer (Fig. 4A), and the contractile response to agonists was studied. Reconstituted muscle fibers generated from wild type APSCs had potassium-induced contractions (120 mm KCl) similar to intact SM tissue (14Sinha S. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Thomas J. Neppl R.L. Deering T. Helmke B.P. Bowles D.K. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Stem Cells.. 2006; 24: 1678-1688Google Scholar, 16Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci.. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Google Scholar). The muscle fibers contracted in response to S1P (1 μm), thrombin (1 μm), and endothelin-1 (10 nm). Finally, addition of the myosin phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (100 nm), was added to generate maximal MLC20 phosphorylation and force. Maximum calyculin-induced force generated by Palladin knock-out APSCs was significantly less (38 ± 5% S.E., n = 4, p =<0.05) than that of wild type APSCs (Fig. 4, B and C). S1P-, thrombin-, and ET-1-induced contractions were reduced by about 70% in KO versus WT reconstituted muscle fibers (Fig. 4C). The force generated by wild type APSCs was comparable with that of rat aortic SMCs incorporated into collagen gels further substantiating that the APSCs have a SM functional phenotype (data not shown). Furthermore, in both wild type and Palladin knock-out APSCs, the contraction induced by vasoactive agonists was relaxed with the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 indicating that the Ca2+ sensitization pathway is conserved (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3A, immunofluorescence results in APSCs showing reduced expression of SMA and the focal adhesion protein LPP.

https://openalex.org/W1996433325,"Background Defects in APC and regulatory cells are associated with diabetes development in NOD mice. We have shown previously that NOD APC are not effective at stimulating CD4+CD25+ regulatory cell function in vitro. We hypothesize that failure of NOD APC to properly activate CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells in vivo could compromise their ability to control pathogenic cells, and activation of NOD APC could restore this defect, thereby preventing disease. Methodology/Principal Findings To test these hypotheses, we used the well-documented ability of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), an APC activator, to prevent disease in NOD mice. Phenotype and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells from untreated and CFA-treated NOD mice were determined by FACS, and in vitro and in vivo assays. APC from these mice were also evaluated for their ability to activate regulatory cells in vitro. We have found that sick NOD CD4+CD25+ cells expressed Foxp3 at the same percentages, but decreased levels per cell, compared to young NOD or non-NOD controls. Treatment with CFA increased Foxp3 expression in NOD cells, and also increased the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells infiltrating the pancreas compared to untreated NOD mice. Moreover, CD4+CD25+ cells from pancreatic LN of CFA-treated, but not untreated, NOD mice transferred protection from diabetes. Finally, APC isolated from CFA-treated mice increased Foxp3 and granzyme B expression as well as regulatory function by NOD CD4+CD25+ cells in vitro compared to APC from untreated NOD mice. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that regulatory T cell function and ability to control pathogenic cells can be enhanced in NOD mice by activating NOD APC."

Principal Findings We report the isolation of the zebrafish α2 macroglobulin-like (A2ML) gene and its specific expression in the liver during differentiation. Morpholino-based knock-down of A2ML did not block the initial formation of the liver primordium, but inhibited liver growth and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2078503799,"Hedgehog signaling is often activated in tumors, yet it remains unclear how GLI2, a transcription factor activated by this pathway, acts as an oncogene. We show that GLI2 is a pleiotropic oncogene. The overexpression induces genomic instability and blocks differentiation, likely mediated in part by enhanced expression of the stem cell gene SOX2. GLI2 also induces transforming growth factor (TGF)B1-dependent transdifferentiation of foreskin and tongue, but not gingival fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, creating an environment permissive for invasion by keratinocytes, which are in various stages of differentiation having downregulated GLI2. Thus, upregulated GLI2 expression is sufficient to induce a number of the acquired characteristics of tumor cells; however, the stroma, in a tissue-specific manner, determines whether certain GLI2 oncogenic traits are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2001893708,"Bordetella bronchiseptica is a pathogen of humans and animals that colonizes the respiratory tract. It produces a lipopolysaccharide O antigen that contains a homopolymer of 2,3-dideoxy-2,3-diacetamido-l-galacturonic acid (l-GalNAc3NAcA). Some of these sugars are found in the uronamide form (l-GalNAc3NAcAN), and there is no discernible pattern in the distribution of amides along the chain. A B. bronchiseptica wbmE mutant expresses an O polysaccharide unusually rich in uronamides. The WbmE protein localizes to the periplasm and catalyzes the deamidation of uronamide-rich O chains in lipopolysaccharide purified from the mutant, to attain a wild-type uronamide/uronic acid ratio. WbmE is a member of the papain-like transglutaminase superfamily, and this categorization is consistent with a deamidase role. The periplasmic location of WbmE and its acceptance of complete lipopolysaccharide as substrate indicate that it operates at a late stage in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, after polymerization and export of the O chain from the cytoplasm. This is the first report of such a modification of O antigen after assembly. The expression of wbmE is controlled by the Bordetella virulence gene two-component regulatory system, BvgAS, suggesting that this deamidation is a novel mechanism by which these bacteria modify their cell surface charge in response to environmental stimuli.

Bordetella bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative coccobacillus, which colonizes the mammalian respiratory tract. It has a broad host range and is commonly associated with atrophic rhinitis in pigs (1Chanter N. Magyar T. Rutter J.M. Res. Vet. Sci. 1989; 47: 48-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough) in dogs (2Wagener J.S. Sobonya R. Minnich L. Taussig L.M. Am. J. Vet.

Most of the genes implicated in host colonization and virulence are under the transcriptional control of the two-component regulatory system BvgAS (reviewed in Ref. 3Mattoo S. Cherry J.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 326-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), being expressed maximally in the Bvg+ phase.

LPS is the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. LPS has three domains: first, Lipid A is the lipophilic domain that anchors LPS into the outer membrane; second, a complex, branched-chain oligosaccharide known as core is attached to lipid A and in Bordetella the lipid A-core structure is known as B-band LPS; third, a domain distal to the membrane consisting of saccharide repeats may be present, which is commonly called O antigen. In a proportion of B. bronchisepica LPS molecules the lipid A core is substituted with a trisaccharide, and this species is known as A-band LPS. The O polysaccharide consists of a homopolymer of 2,3-dideoxy-2,3-diacetamido-l-galacturonic acid (l-GalNAc3NAcA) (7Di Fabio J.L. Caroff M. Karibian D. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. FEMS Microbiol.

A proportion of the O polysaccharide repeating units are present as the uronamide (l-GalNAc3NAcAN) (9Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol.

In Bvg– B. bronchiseptica RB50, the uronamides make up ∼17% of the O polysaccharide residues and the positions of these along the chain appears to be random (9Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O.

Uronamide sugars are uncommon in bacteria, but are present in the O polysaccharides of Shigella dysenteriae (11Feng L. Tao J. Guo H. Xu J. Li Y. Rezwan F. Reeves P. Wang L. Microb.

O antigen synthesis is encoded in B. bronchiseptica by the wbm locus that contains 24 coding sequences including putative genes for the wzm and wzt components of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) O antigen transporter (14Preston A. Allen A.G. Cadisch J. Thomas R. Stevens K. Churcher C.M. Badcock K.L. Parkhill J. Barrell B. Maskell D.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of ABC transporter genes suggests that this O antigen is probably assembled according to the ABC transporter-dependent model (reviewed in Ref. 15Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar) in which the polymer is assembled and terminated on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, then exported across this membrane to the periplasmic face where the O chain is transferred to lipid A core.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) identified the B. bronchiseptica gene product WbmE as a member of the papain-like transglutaminase superfamily although in their report, wbmE was mistakenly identified as a B. pertussis sequence.

Yee V.C. Bishop P.D. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Transglutaminase activity is defined as bridge formation between peptide chains by an acyl transfer reaction between a glutamine γ-carboxamide and a lysine ϵ-amine, but transglutaminase enzymes also catalyze a range of other chemical reaction types, all of which involve either the formation, or breaking of amide bonds (reviewed in Ref. 20Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). To date, the only functionally characterized microbial members of this family, PeiP and PeiW, are peptidases (21Luo Y. Pfister P. Leisinger T. Wasserfallen A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 47-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the characterization of the wbmE gene and its protein product. WbmE catalyzes deamidation of complete O chains, and this is the first report of such a late O antigen modification. Furthermore, given that wbmE expression is regulated by the BvgAS system (22Cummings C.A. Bootsma H.J. Relman D.A. Miller J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), this enzyme probably constitutes a novel mechanism by which the B. bronchisepica cell surface is modified in response to environmental stimuli. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Bacterial strains used in this study are described in the supplemental Table S1. B. bronchiseptica was grown on Bordet-Gengou agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% defibrinated horse blood (TCS Cellworks Ltd). Escherichia coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar. All strains were incubated at 37 °C and ampicillin (100 μg ml–1), kanamycin (50 μgml–1), tetracycline (10 μg ml–1 for E. coli, 5 μg ml–1 for B. bronchiseptica) or streptomycin (200 μgml–1) were added where required. Suicide plasmids were based on the host-restricted pEX100T backbone (23Schweizer H.P. Hoang T.T. Gene. 1995; 158: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and broad host-range shuttle vectors were based on a kanamycin resistant derivative of pBBR1MCS (24Antoine R. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1785-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The phoA reporter fusion was derived from pRMCD28 (25Daniels C. Vindurampulle C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For preparation of LPS, B. bronchiseptica was grown in tryptone soya broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 50 mm MgSO4 as this maximizes O antigen expression in RB50 by modulating the phase to Bvg– (supplemental Fig. S1). DNA Methods—Standard methods were used for DNA manipulations. Oligonucleotides were supplied by Sigma-Genosys. PCR was performed with template from boiled bacteria (26Preston A. Maxim E. Toland E. Pishko E.J. Harvill E.T. Caroff M. Maskell D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) or KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen). Generation of wbmE Mutants—The wbmE mutant allele was obtained by in vitro transposon-mediated mutagenesis of the wbm locus-containing cosmid, BbLPS1 (14Preston A. Allen A.G. Cadisch J. Thomas R. Stevens K. Churcher C.M. Badcock K.L. Parkhill J. Barrell B. Maskell D.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AJ007747) using an EZ-Tn5™ <Tet-1> insertion kit (Epicenter). The <Tet-1> transposon, plus flanking wbmE DNA, was cut out by partial digestion with AluI and ligated into SmaI-cut pEX100T. Allelic exchange constructs were transferred to B. bronchiseptica by conjugation with E. coli SM10λpir as donor (27Simon R. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar). Loss of the plasmid-encoded sacB gene in allelic exchange mutagenesis of B. bronchiseptica was selected for by growth on LB agar with reduced salt supplemented with 10% (w/v) sucrose (28Gay P. Le Coq D. Steinmetz M. Berkelman T. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 918-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting (not shown). Multiple mutant clones were obtained in independent mating experiments, and were confirmed to have the same phenotype as the representative wbmE strain, RBE3c (not shown). Complementation of wbmE Mutation—The B. bronchiseptica flaA promoter was amplified using primers 5′-GCTCTAGATAGGCGCATGCCATGGCC-3′ (XbaI site underlined) and 5′-AAGGATCCCATATGGAGGCTCCCAAGAGAGAA-3′ (BamHI and NdeI sites underlined), and cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites in pBBR1MCS-kan to generate the vector pCompEmpty. wbmE was amplified using primers 5′-AAAAAAACATATGATTCGCAAGAGCTAC-3′ (NdeI site underlined) and 5′-AAAAAGCTTAGATCTCCACATAGAGCAGATGTC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and topoisomerase-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, and the insert was verified by sequencing. wbmE was then excised and cloned into pCompEmpty using NdeI and HindIII restriction sites to generate the wbmE complementation vector pCompE. For complementation of the wbmE mutation by expressing WbmE with a C-terminal His6 tag, the pCR2.1-TOPO vector containing wbmE was used as PCR template with the primers 5′-CCCGGTTTGAAGAAGCCTTTCTC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCTTCAGTGATGATGATGATGATGGTTCGGGGCGCTGGCGCG-3′ (HindIII site underlined, reverse complement of His6 codons italicized). wbmE-his6 was then cloned into pCompEmpty using NdeI and HindIII, generating pCompETag. Shuttle vectors were moved into B. bronchiseptica by conjugation with E. coli CC118 as donor (29Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), with trans-acting transfer functions provided by E. coli S17-1 pNJ5000 as helper (27Simon R. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar, 30Grinter N.J. Brewster G. Barth P.T. Plasmid. 1989; 22: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE Analysis of LPS—LPS for SDS-PAGE analysis was obtained from B. bronchiseptica using a modification of the method of Hitchcock and Brown (31Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as has been described (32Preston A. Maskell D. Johnson A. Moxon E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 396-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of LPS was performed using Novex precast 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). LPS was oxidized in-gel with periodic acid (33Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar) and visualized with the Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). Purification of LPS—B. bronchiseptica RB50 and RBE3c LPS were extracted from 4-liter cultures using a modification of the hot aqueous phenol extraction method of Johnson and Perry (34Johnson K.G. Perry M.B. McDonald I.J. Russel R.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1975; 21: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as has been described (26Preston A. Maxim E. Toland E. Pishko E.J. Harvill E.T. Caroff M. Maskell D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analysis of LPS Structures—O polysaccharides were cleaved from LPS molecules by 24-h solvolysis with anhydrous HF and subsequently purified as described (9Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization MS spectra were obtained on a Micromass Quattro spectrometer, with samples dissolved in 50% MeCN, 0.2% HCOOH, and delivered by direct injection at a flow rate of 15 μl min–1. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) experiments were performed as described previously (35Li J. Richards J.C. Mass. Spectrom. Rev. 2007; 26: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Generation of the phoA Fusion and Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—The first 200 bases of wbmE were PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-AAAAAAAGATCTCCGCGGAAGGAGGATATACATATGATTCGCAAGAGCTACATCATCG-3′ (SacII site underlined) and 5′-AAAAAAAAGCTTTTAAAGGATCCAGAATTCCAGAAGGCGTAGCAAGTCCGGC-3′ (HindIII site underlined). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and SacII, and cloned into similarly digested pRMCD28 (25Daniels C. Vindurampulle C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), placing the wbmE 5′-end in-frame with the phoA fragment on the vector. The reporter plasmid was transformed into the phoA E. coli strain LMG194. For alkaline phosphatase assays, 5 μl of stationary phase liquid culture was spotted onto low-phosphate solid medium (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 40 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.004 mm ZnCl2, 0.002 mm FeCl3, 0.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.4% (w/v) glycerol, 1.5% (w/v) agar) supplemented with 40 μgml–1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP), 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 5 μgml–1 thiamine, 0.5% (w/v) casamino acids, and ampicillin) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Expression of WbmE-His6 in B. bronchiseptica—The plasmid pCompETag has the wbmE-his6 gene fusion under the control of the promoter for the B. bronchiseptica flagellin gene flaA. As flaA is expressed in the Bvg– phase (36Akerley B.J. Miller J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3468-3479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), WbmE-His6 expression from this vector was induced by supplementing the medium with 50 mm MgSO4. WbmE Assay using Whole Cell Lysates—For analysis by SDS-PAGE: B. bronchisepica was harvested from 75-ml liquid cultures at an absorbance of 0.2 (at 595 nm). Cells were washed with 37.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at pH 6.5 (PBS), and suspended in 5 ml of PBS. One-tenth and one-hundredth dilutions were made of these suspensions. 1:1 mixtures were made of these neat, one-tenth, and one-hundredth cell suspensions with a 0.4 mg ml–1 solution of purified RBE3c LPS dissolved in PBS. WbmE was then released from the cells by sonicating the mixtures on ice for 15 s, using a VibraCell™, sonicator (Sonics and Materials Inc.), fitted with a microtip, at 40% power. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 3, 30, or 300 min with shaking. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 100 μl of the supernatant was boiled with 50 μl of buffer 1 (0.1875 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% (w/v) glycerol), and then incubated overnight at 55 °C after addition of 225 μl of buffer 2 (10 mg ml–1 proteinase K, 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled prior to loading 10 μl per lane on Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. In this assay, whole cell lysates are used as a source of enzyme. So that no O antigen derived from the cells themselves could interfere with analysis of the substrate after incubation, we used a B. bronchisepica strain, RBB1a, as the wbmE+ cells. RBB1a is a B. bronchiseptica RB50-derived mutant in the putative glycosyl transferase wbmB, which does not produce O antigen. 4J. D. King, A. Preston, and D. J. Maskell, unpublished results. To maximize the amount of WbmE in the lysates, the vector pCompETag was also maintained in these RBB1a cells so that the enzyme is probably expressed from the plasmid as well as from the chromosomal copy of the wbmE gene. For the negative control, whole cell lysates were obtained from the wbmE mutant strain, RBE3c, containing the empty vector pCompEmpty. For CE-MS characterization of the transformed O antigen, incubations were performed in the same proportions, but at larger scale and for 16 h, with 15 mg of RBE3c LPS in each sample and using neat wbmE+ or wbmE– cell suspensions. Purification of WbmE-His6—WbmE-His6 was expressed in B. bronchisepica from the plasmid pCompETag as before. Cells were pelleted (10 min at 10,000 × g) from 1 liter of culture and frozen (–20 °C). The pellet was thawed and suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl. Cells were broken with ultrasound (40% power, macro-tip, 3 min, in 5-s bursts, on ice), and cell debris was pelleted (20 min at 20,000 × g). Membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g), and the supernatant was incubated with 3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) slurry (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. The nickel affinity resin was loaded into a column, washed with 25 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and then WbmE-His6 was eluted with small fractions of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole. 1.6 ml of eluent containing most of the eluted protein was diluted one-sixth with water and loaded onto a 5-ml Econo-Pac High-Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5 over 50 ml. WbmE-His6 eluted into five 1-ml fractions at ∼200 mm NaCl. The activity of each fraction was tested by incubating overnight (37 °C) with an equal volume of 0.4 mg ml–1 RBE3c LPS dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl. After incubation, the LPS was processed for analysis by SDS-PAGE as described above. WbmE-His6-containing fractions were then pooled, glycerol was added to 25% (v/v), and the protein was stored at –20 °C. Analysis of the wbmE LPS Phenotype by SDS-PAGE—To characterize the role of wbmE in O antigen expression it was mutated by insertion of a tetracycline resistance gene cassette into the coding sequence. Disruption of wbmE does not alter the A- or B-band LPS but does change the appearance of O band LPS on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The mutant O band has reduced electrophoretic mobility and has a more clearly resolved banding pattern. Individual wild-type O antigen-containing species are not so clearly resolved, the O band appearing as a smear on the gel. Complementation of the wbmE mutation by expression of the wild-type allele from a plasmid restores the wild-type electrophoretic mobility of O band (Fig. 3). The mutation can also be complemented by a vector in which codons for a His6 tag are fused to the 3′-end of the wbmE gene (Fig. 3). wbmE Mutant LPS Differs from Wild-type by Having a Greater Number of Uronamides in the O Antigen—Altered electrophoretic mobility in a polymeric molecule such as O antigen often indicates that the chain length has altered (37Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35709-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but can also reflect a change in the electrostatic charge on O antigen sugars (38King J.D. Mulrooney E.F. Vinogradov E. Kneidinger B. Mead K. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine the cause of the SDS-PAGE band shift in this case, we purified LPS from the wild-type and wbmE mutant and analyzed their O chains by mass spectrometry. Prior to analysis, O antigen was cleaved from the rest of the LPS molecule by solvolysis with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which cleaves the polysaccharide chain at the GalNAc position in the O antigen linker region (Fig. 1) (9Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectra of wild-type and wbmE O polysaccharides both show a series of peaks separated by ∼258 atomic mass units (a.m.u.) (Fig. 4). Because 258 a.m.u. is approximately the mass of an O antigen GalNAc3NAcA(N) repeating unit, these series represent the variation in O chain lengths expressed by the bacteria. There was no difference in the gross distribution of chain lengths between the two samples demonstrating that the reduction in electrophoretic mobility of the mutant O antigen-containing LPS is not due to increased O chain length. Furthermore, each of the peaks in the spectrum derived from the wbmE mutant sample is shifted downwards by 4–6 a.m.u compared with corresponding peaks in the spectrum of wild-type O chain. MS and NMR analysis of wild-type O antigen has established that the O repeating units are present as both uronic acids (GalNAc3NAcA) and uronamides (GalNAc3NAcAN) (9Preston A. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Kubler-Kielb J. Ben-Menachem G. Li J. Vinogradov E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18135-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We hypothesized, therefore, that the difference in mass between the wbmE mutant and wild-type O polysaccharide species was due to the wbmE mutant producing a greater proportion of uronamide residues (between four and six additional uronamides per LPS molecule). An implication of this hypothesis is that the mutant will have 4–6 fewer negative charges per O antigen molecule, and this is consistent with slower migration toward the anode in SDS-PAGE. The molecular weights measured for particular peaks in the wbmE O antigen mass spectrum suggested that while this mutant expresses a more uronamide-rich O polysaccharide than its parental strain, the wbmE O antigen still contains a mixture of uronic acid and uronamide residues. For example the peak at 3383 corresponds with the predicted molecular weight of an HF-cleaved polysaccharide containing five GalNAc3NAcAN residues, four GalNAc3NAcA residues, the capping sugar, and the ManNAc3NAcAN-GalNAc3NAcAN-GalNAc portion of the linker (calculated MW = 3383.1). To confirm our interpretation of the electrospray MS data, HF-cleaved O polysaccharide was subjected to fragmentation in a capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) experiment. The pseudo-tandem mass spectra of wild-type and wbmE O polysaccharides show peaks corresponding to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide fragments derived from the polymers (Fig. 5, A and B). Interpretation of these spectra is complicated by the fact that true M+1 peaks due to additional uronic acids overlap with isotopic peaks, but comparison of the two spectra indicates that wbmE O antigen fractures to give a greater proportion of all-uronamide fragments, but the distribution of masses still indicates the presence of uronic acid residues in the mutant O chain. WbmE Is Localized in the Periplasm—Analysis of the structure of the LPS synthesized by the wbmE mutant suggested that WbmE plays a role in converting uronamide residues to uronic acids. Conceivably this could occur either by WbmE acting on completed O chain, or WbmE could operate at an earlier stage, and catalyze the deamidation of a sugar-nucleotide O antigen precursor. The stage at which LPS biosynthetic enzymes operate is dictated by their cellular localization: sugar-nucleotides are soluble, cytoplasmic metabolites, and according to the ABC transporter-dependent model of O antigen biosynthesis, the O polysaccharide will be completed before it is transported across the inner membrane. Analysis of the WbmE sequence using the LipoP 1.0 signal peptide prediction server (39Juncker A.S. LipoP 1.0 Signal Peptide Prediction Server. 2003; (Technical University of Denmark)Google Scholar, 40Juncker A.S. Willenbrock H. Von Heijne G. Brunak S. Nielsen H. Krogh A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1652-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) predicts a signal peptidase I cleavage signal (log-odds score >10) including a predicted transmembrane helix close to the N terminus (Ile-7 to Gln-26) with the peptide bond targeted for cleavage probably one of those between amino acids Gly-21 and Ala-32. WbmE is therefore highly likely to be secreted from the cytoplasm. To verify the function of the predicted signal peptide, and localize WbmE, C-terminally His6-tagged WbmE (WbmE-His6) expression was induced in B. bronchiseptica from the vector previously used to test the ability of"

https://openalex.org/W2000979595,"Bacteriophage N4 mini-virion RNA polymerase (mini-vRNAP), the 1106-amino acid transcriptionally active domain of vRNAP, recognizes single-stranded DNA template-containing promoters composed of conserved sequences and a 3-base loop-5-base pair stem hairpin structure. The major promoter recognition determinants are a purine located at the center of the hairpin loop (-11G) and a base at the hairpin stem (-8G). Mini-vRNAP is an evolutionarily highly diverged member of the T7 family of RNAPs. A two-plasmid system was developed to measure the in vivo activity of mutant mini-vRNAP enzymes. Five mini-vRNAP derivatives, each containing a pair of cysteine residues separated by approximately 100 amino acids and single cysteine-containing enzymes, were generated. These reagents were used to determine the smallest catalytically active polypeptide and to map promoter, substrate, and RNA-DNA hybrid contact sites to single amino acid residues in the enzyme by using end-labeled 5-iododeoxyuridine- and azidophenacyl-substituted oligonucleotides, cross-linkable derivatives of the initiating nucleotide, and RNA products with 5-iodouridine incorporated at specific positions. Localization of functionally important amino acid residues in the recently determined crystal structures of apomini-vRNAP and the mini-vRNAP-promoter complex and comparison with the crystal structures of the T7 RNAP initiation and elongation complexes allowed us to predict major rearrangements in mini-vRNAP in the transition from transcription initiation to elongation similar to those observed in T7 RNAP, a task otherwise precluded by the lack of sequence homology between N4 mini-vRNAP and T7 RNAP."
