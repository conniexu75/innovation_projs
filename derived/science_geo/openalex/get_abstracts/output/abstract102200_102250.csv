https://openalex.org/W1521279639,"We previously identified novel human ets-1 transcripts in which the normal order of exons is inverted, and demonstrated that although the order of exons is different than in the genomic DNA, splicing of these exons out of order occurs in pairs using genuine splice sites (1). Here we determine the structure of these novel transcripts, showing that they correspond to circular RNA molecules containing only exons in genomic order. These transcripts are stable molecules, localized in the cytoplasmic component of the cells. To our knowledge, this is the first case of circular transcripts being processed from nuclear pre-mRNA in eukaryotes. This new type of transcript might represent a novel aspect of gene expression and hold some interesting clues about the splicing mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2102572112,"The prominent role of the CD40 receptor in B cell responses led us to investigate the role of the gp39-CD40 interaction in a group of primary immunodeficient patients with defective antibody production. Here we report that patients with hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) have a defective gp39-CD40 interaction. B cells from HIM patients express functional CD40, but their T cells do not bind CD40-Ig. These patients expressed normal levels of gp39 mRNA, but these mRNAs encode defective gp39 proteins owing to mutations in the extracellular domain of gp39. Soluble recombinant forms of gp39 containing these mutations were unable to bind CD40 and drive normal B cell proliferation. The gene encoding gp39 was mapped to Xq26, the X chromosome region where the gene responsible for HIM had previously been mapped. These data suggest that a defect in gp39 is the basis of X-linked HIM."
https://openalex.org/W2124328573,"The immunoregulatory proteins C-C chemokines are potent chemoattractants of lymphocytes and monocytes, as well as activators and attractants of eosinophils and basophils. We have isolated a cDNA that encodes a seven transmembrane-spanning receptor, with homology to other chemoattractant receptors, that encodes a protein designated C-C CKR-1 that acts as a receptor for the C-C chemokines. Human and murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), human human monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and RANTES all bind to the C-C CKR-1 with varying affinities. Chemokine binding affinity does not predict how well the ligand will transmit a signal through the receptor: RANTES and human MIP-1 alpha induce a similar intracellular calcium flux while binding with disparate affinities, while MCP-1 and human MIP-1 beta induce calcium mobilization only at high concentrations. Finally, C-C chemokines were shown to bind a C-C CKR-1-related gene product encoded by cytomegalovirus, suggesting a role for C-C chemokines in viral immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1986473194,"The general transcription factor TFIID is a multiprotein complex containing the TATA-binding protein and several associated factors (TAFs), some of which may function as coactivators that are essential for activated, but not basal, transcription. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the first gene encoding a TAF protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of TAF110 revealed the presence of several glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich regions reminiscent of the protein-protein interaction domains of the regulatory transcription factor Sp1 that are involved in transcription activation and multimerization. In both Drosophila cells and yeast, TAF110 specifically interacts with the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1. Moreover, purified Sp1 selectively binds recombinant TAF110 in vitro. These findings taken together suggest that TAF110 may function as a coactivator by serving as a site of protein-protein contact between activators like Sp1 and the TFIID complex."
https://openalex.org/W2001871185,"The neural circuits that link the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex are critically involved in the generation and control of voluntary movement. Retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 was used to examine the organization of connections in the cebus monkey between an output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and three cortical areas: the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor ara, and the ventral premotor area. Spatially separate regions of the GPi were labeled after virus injections into each cortical area. The GPi projects to multiple cortical motor areas, and this pallidal output is organized into discrete channels. This information provides a new anatomical framework for examining the function of the basal ganglia in skeletomotor control."

https://openalex.org/W1993004730,"We have isolated cDNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes, activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis following induction for differentiation along either the macrophage or granulocyte lineage in human myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells. One cDNA clone of a primary response gene, expressed upon macrophage differentiation, encoded for Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor. The Egr-1 gene was observed to be transcriptionally silent in HL-60 cells, but active in U-937 and M1 cells, the latter two being predetermined for macrophage differentiation. Egr-1 antisense oligomers in the culture media blocked macrophage differentiation in both myeloid leukemia cell lines and normal myeloblasts. HL-60 cells constitutively expressing an Egr-1 transgene (HL-60Egr-1) could be induced for macrophage, but not granulocyte, differentiation. These observations indicate that expression of Egr-1 is essential for and restricts differentiation of myeloblasts along the macrophage lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2091837097,"In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from cultured rat hippocampal neurons, the 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466 was a potent antagonist of kainate- and AMPA-activated currents (IC50 values, 7.5 and 11 microM, respectively), but was inactive against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or gamma-aminobutyric acid responses. The block produced by GYKI 52466 occurred in a noncompetitive fashion, was voltage independent, and failed to show use dependence, indicating an allosteric blocking mechanism. In kinetic experiments with kainate as the agonist, the GYKI 52466 binding and unbinding rates were 1.6 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 and 3.2 s-1, respectively. GYKI 52466 also suppressed non-NMDA receptor-mediated spontaneous synaptic currents via a postsynaptic action. Non-competitive AMPA/kainate antagonists such as GYKI 52466 could offer advantages over competitive antagonists in the treatment of glutamate-associated neurological disorders, particularly under conditions in which high levels of the amino acid would render the competitive antagonists relatively ineffective. Moreover, the results demonstrate the existence of a novel recognition site for an atypical benzodiazepine on non-NMDA receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1513908459,"Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) vectors have been used for gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells and may be useful in gene therapy for diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF) which affect the airways. The AAV p5 promoter together with the AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) forms a 263-base pair cassette which mediated efficient expression in a CF bronchial epithelial cell line. We report here that the ITR itself can mediate gene expression. In stable transfection assays, AAV-CF vectors expressing the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA from either the p5 promoter or the ITR restored cAMP regulation of the chloride efflux characteristic of CFTR function. An AAV-ITR-CF vector deleted for the amino terminus of CFTR was also functional. This vector was packaged into AAV particles and used to transduce cells without selection. Transduced cells also exhibited cAMP-regulated Cl- efflux. The complemented cell lines showed increased levels of CFTR protein immunofluorescence, and the presence of intact AAV-CF vector sequence was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of rescued vector sequences. These studies provide novel insights into AAV gene expression, and this newly described promoter allows for the production of AAV vectors expressing CFTR in those differentiated cells affected in CF."
https://openalex.org/W1538787080,"The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) is essential for transcription of the interleukin-2 gene upon T cell activation. Here we use a technique involving elution and renaturation of proteins from SDS-acrylamide gels to identify a DNA-binding component of NF-AT (NF-ATp) that is present in hypotonic extracts of T cells prior to activation and appears in nuclear extracts when T cells are activated. NF-ATp is present in resting T cells predominantly in a form migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000-140,000, while NF-ATp from nuclear extracts of activated T cells migrates with a lower apparent molecular weight (90,000-125,000). This difference is likely to reflect dephosphorylation of NF-ATp, since treatment of NF-ATp with calf intestinal phosphatase or the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in vitro results in a similar decrease in its apparent molecular weight. We show that NF-ATp is dephosphorylated in cell lysates by a calcium-dependent process that is blocked by inclusion of EGTA or a specific peptide inhibitor of calcineurin in the cell lysis buffer. Moreover, dephosphorylation of NF-ATp in cell extracts is inhibited by prior treatment of T cells with the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A or FK506, which inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin when complexed with their specific binding proteins, cyclophilin and FK506-binding protein. This work identifies NF-ATp as a DNA-binding phosphoprotein and a target for the drug/immunophilin/calcineurin complexes thought to mediate the inhibition of interleukin-2 gene induction by cyclosporin A and FK506."
https://openalex.org/W1990557260,"Extracellular Zn2+ attenuates NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity and increases AMPA receptor-mediated toxicity. Known electrophysiological effects of Zn2+ predict only the former. We considered the possibility that the latter rather reflects AMPA potentiation of Zn2+ toxicity, perhaps mediated by neuronal depolarization and Zn2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. High K+ or kainate also potentiated Zn2+ toxicity, and AMPA plus Zn2+ toxicity was attenuated by raising extracellular Ca2+, or by Ca2+ channel blockers. AMPA plus Zn2+ exposure induced an increase in fluorescence from neurons loaded with the Zn(2+)-sensitive dye TS-Q and increased subsequent 45Ca2+ accumulation. The ability of AMPA receptor activation to potentiate Zn2+ toxicity may be relevant to neuronal death associated with intense activation of glutamatergic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1591360311,"The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor is a member of a large family of transmembrane signal transducing molecules. The defining characteristic of this class of receptors is the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain. While it has been demonstrated that this tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for the action of a number of transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, no evidence of this type has been adduced to date with respect to the signaling requirement of the IGF-I receptor. We have now shown that stably transfected NIH-3T3 cell lines overexpressing human IGF-I receptors display increased responses to IGF-I and an IGF-I-mimetic antibody, alpha IR-3, in terms of short, intermediate, and long term actions initiated by activation of the IGF-I receptor. These include receptor autophosphorylation, activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and 2-deoxyglucose uptake, induction of ornithine decarboxylase gene expression, and stimulation of thymidine incorporation. In short term responses, the kinetics seen with alpha IR-3 were slower than those seen with IGF-I. These effects were severely decreased in clones expressing human IGF-I receptors in which the lysine residue in the ATP-binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain had been mutated to alanine or arginine. This was true for both IGF-I and alpha IR-3. These results indicate that, for all parameters tested, the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-I receptor is necessary for activation of the IGF-I-stimulated signal transduction cascade. Additionally, the effects of alpha IR-3 also require tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2050258368,"The oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular matrix protein J1-160/180 displays repellent substrate properties toward neurons. In a search for neuronal ligands mediating the response to J1-160/180, we have identified the F3/11 cell surface protein, a glyco-phosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. F3/11 mediates the initial recognition between a J1-160/180 substrate and cerebellar neurons or F3-transfected CHO cells. In cerebellar neurons, the F3/11-J1-160/180 interaction induces a repulsion consisting of the loss of substrate adhesion with time in culture and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Antibody blocking experiments show that the avoidance response of neurites at J1-160/180 substrate borders is also mediated by F3/11. Active cell-cell and cell-substrate repulsion is considered a major mechanism governing the extent and directionality of axonal growth, but the ligand-receptor interactions involved have remained unknown. Our results show that F3/11 mediates the neuronal response to the repellent molecule J1-160/180 and may thus be involved in signal transduction leading to cell repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W1593205980,"We have produced a set of bacterial expression proteins corresponding to 10 segments of tenascin and two of fibronectin and tested them for heparin binding and cell adhesion. We used polymerase chain reaction cloning to terminate the segments precisely at domain boundaries. Heparin binding activity was mapped to two different tenascin segments: one comprising the fourth and fifth fibronectin type III domains, and to TNfbg, the fibrinogen-like terminal knob. TNfbg, but none of the other tanascin segments, also supported adhesion of primary rat embryo skin fibroblasts. The fibroblasts did not spread on TNfbg but remained rounded. Cell binding to TNfbg occurred in the presence or absence of divalent cations and was not inhibited by RGD peptides, suggesting that integrins are not involved. Fibroblast binding to TNfbg was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin, by treating the cells with heparitinase, or by culture conditions that cause undersulfation of proteoglycans. These observations suggest that cell attachment to TNfbg is mediated by cell surface proteoglycans. We have also made full-length cDNA constructs for the largest and smallest splice variants of human tenascin, as well as one truncated after the 14th epidermal growth factor-like domain, in the pNUT mammalian cell expression vector. Stably transfected baby hamster kidney cell lines secreted large quantities of tenascin, and this was assembled into normal hexabrachions, the arm length corresponding to the construct."

https://openalex.org/W2020911593,"We studied inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels in rat superior cervical ganglion neurons by substance P (SP) and somatostatin-14 (Som). In whole-cell clamp, 70 of 82 acutely dissociated neurons showed inhibition (mean 37%) by 500 nM SP, and 54 of 61 showed inhibition by 240 nM Som (mean 57% ). Pertussis toxin (PTX) blocked Som but not SP inhibition; intracellular dialysis with 2 mM GDP-β-S attenuated inhibition with either peptide. Inhibition was voltage dependent with Som but not with SP. Neurokinin A (1 μM) or B was without effect, implicating NK1 tachykinin receptors. In cell-attached patches with bath-applied drugs, to test for a diffusible messenger, inhibition by SP or Som was only 8%. Thus, SP signaling is voltage independent and PTX insensitive; Som inhibition is voltage dependent and PTX sensitive; and both are membrane delimited."
https://openalex.org/W2017866790,"Guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) is an essential component of Ras signaling pathways. GAP functions in different cell types as a deactivator and a transmitter of cellular Ras signals. A domain (amino acids 275 to 351) encompassing the Src homology region 3 (SH3) of GAP was found to be essential for GAP signaling. A monoclonal antibody was used to block germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) induced by the oncogenic protein Ha-ras Lys12 in Xenopus oocytes. The monoclonal antibody, which was found to recognize the peptide containing amino acids 275 to 351 within the amino-terminal domain of GAP, did not modify the stimulation of the Ha-Ras-GTPase by GAP. Injection of peptides corresponding to amino acids 275 to 351 and 317 to 326 blocked GVBD induced by insulin or by Ha-Ras Lys12 but not that induced by progesterone. These findings confirm that GAP is an effector for Ras in Xenopus oocytes and that the SH3 domain is essential for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1992358363,"The boxA sequences of the E. coli ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons are sufficient to cause RNA polymerase to read through Rho-dependent transcriptional terminators. We show that a complex of the transcription antitermination factors NusB and ribosomal protein S10 interacts specifically with boxA RNA. Neither NusB nor S10 binds boxA RNA on its own, and neither NusA nor NusG affects the interaction of the NusB-S10 complex with boxA RNA. Mutations in boxA that impair its antitermination activity compromise its interaction with NusB and S10, suggesting that ribosomal protein S10 regulates the synthesis of ribosomal RNA in bacteria. RNA containing the closely related boxA sequence from the bacteriophage λ nutR site is not stably bound by NusB and S10. This probably explains why antitermination in phage λ depends on the phage λ N protein and the boxB component of the nut site, in addition to boxA."
https://openalex.org/W1950601528,"The COOH-terminal half of the amphiregulin (AR) molecule has sequence homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF). The ability of AR to elicit in vivo phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and p185erbB2 was studied in four human epithelial cell lines which expressed either or both of the receptor tyrosine kinases. AR induced the phosphorylation of the EGFR and p185erbB2, and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in both receptor proteins. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds to the extracellular domain of the EGFR blocked the phosphorylation of the EGFR and p185erbB2 as well as AR-induced mitogenesis indicating that the EGFR mediated these responses. In MDA-MB-453 cells which lack EGFRs, AR did not induce phosphorylation of p185erbB2, did not affect proliferation, and had no detectable effect on the phosphorylation of cellular proteins isolated using an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Qualitatively, in vivo phosphorylations induced by AR and EGF were found to be indistinguishable as demonstrated by analysis of cellular 32P-labeled proteins isolated with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Moreover, in the presence of the anti-EGFR mAb, AR had no effect on the proliferation of cells. These results provide strong evidence that the EGFR is the sole cell surface mediator of the action of AR in human epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043304777,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to microbial epitopes stimulate T cell immunity but their immunogenicity is poor and their half-lives are short. A viral epitope inserted into the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loop of the heavy chain of a self immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule was generated from the Ig context and was presented by I-Ed class II molecules to virus-specific, CD4+ T cells. Chimeric Ig-peptide was presented 100 to 1000 times more efficiently than free synthetic peptide and was able to prime virus-specific T cells in vivo. These features suggest that antigenized Ig can provide an improved and safe vaccine for the presentation of microbial and other peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2057036431,"When Dictyostelium cells that have initiated their developmental program upon starvation are returned to growth medium, there is a rapid and transient de novo tyrosine phosphorylation of a 43-kilodalton protein. This protein was found to be actin. Most of the phosphorylation occurred in a single, minor acidic isoform of actin. Developing cells that had been returned to growth medium lost their pseudopod extensions, became round, and had reduced adhesion to the substratum. These effects occurred with kinetics that matched the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of actin. In mutant cell lines in which the gene for the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1 had been disrupted, tyrosine phosphorylation of actin was rapid and more prolonged. These cells responded with proportionally accelerated kinetics of cell rounding. Cell lines overexpressing PTP1 had diminished amplitude and duration of actin tyrosine phosphorylation and exhibited diminished cell-shape change and an accelerated return to the extended cell-shape morphology seen in starved cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602512023,"The non-peptide substance P (SP) antagonist CP-96,345 has a 90-fold selectivity for the human neurokinin-1 (NK-1) or SP receptor over the rat NK-1 receptor, while the agonist SP shows no such selectivity. The cloned NK-1 receptors from these two species have primary protein structures that differ in only 22 of 407 residues. Wild type, chimeric, and point-mutated NK-1 receptors have been created and functionally expressed to understand the structural basis of this species selectivity. Residue 290 in the seventh putative membrane-spanning region is responsible for 20-fold of the affinity difference seen for CP-96,345 between the rat and human NK-1 receptors. Residues in the second extracellular loop and in membrane-spanning region six contribute the additional 3-5-fold of the species difference. The direct or indirect action of these residues with this nonpeptidic antagonist is discussed. This study serves to emphasize the need for species-appropriate in vitro models for the screening of antagonists in the search for therapeutics, and provides useful information to model nonpeptidic antagonist interactions with peptide hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1545699847,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1(1-154), the precursor for acidic FGF-1(21-154), is a potent angiogenic polypeptide, the structure of which lacks a signal peptide sequence for secretion. To investigate the biological significance of this structural feature, we have attempted forced secretion of FGF-1 through fusion of the entire FGF-1 coding frame with the signal peptide (sp) from the hst/KS3 gene, a secretory member of the heparin-binding growth factor family. We also studied the transforming ability of the signal-less forms of FGF-1 comprising FGF(1-154) and FGF-1(21-154). The presence of a soluble and biologically active form of FGF-1 was readily detected in the conditioned medium of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with sp-hst/KS3:FGF-1(1-154) as demonstrated by Western blot analysis and DNA synthesis assays, whereas sp-hst/KS3:FGF-1(21-154) was not detectable in conditioned medium even though the protein was detected in cellular extracts. The secreted form of sp-hst/KS3:FGF-1(1-154) stimulated the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and was able to induce receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the forced secretion of biologically active FGF-1 resulted in NIH 3T3 cell transformation as demonstrated by altered morphology in vitro, the formation of discrete colonies in soft agarose, growth under serum-free conditions, and ability to rapidly form highly vascular tumors in vivo. Interestingly, sp-hst/KS3:FGF-1(21-154) also mediated the transition to a transformed phenotype despite the inability to detect extracellular FGF-1 in the media conditioned by these NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Although the transfection of FGF-1(21-154) yielded similar NIH 3T3 cell morphologic changes, these transfectants did not grow under serum-free conditions or yield colonies in soft agarose, and formed tumors in vivo with delayed kinetics. Furthermore, the FGF-1(1-154) NIH 3T3 cell transfectants did not exhibit morphologic changes, and this may be due to the inability of mRNA to express protein. These data suggest that although non-sp forms of FGF-1 may alter the monolayer phenotype of NIH 3T3 cells in vitro, the ability of FGF-1 to transform NIH 3T3 cells requires the function of a sp-directed secretory pathway and suggests that this pathway increases tumorigenicity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1578819789,"A complementary DNA encoding the key subunit of the human N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR1) has been cloned using a probe derived from the rat NMDAR1 cDNA. The cDNA encodes a 938-amino acid protein, which shows 99% amino acid homology with the rat counterpart. Of the 7 of 938 amino acids which are different, three occur in the region of the signal peptide and the others in the extracellular amino-terminal domain preceding the 4 putative transmembrane segments. Expression in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that the single protein encoded by the cloned cDNA possesses the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties characteristic of the NMDA receptor, including Ca2+ permeability, voltage-dependent Mg2+ block, and inhibition by selective antagonists such as Zn2+ and channel blockers. The high evolutionary conservation in the structure and properties of NMDAR1 argues strongly for the importance of this receptor in functions of glutamate neurotransmission. RNA blot analysis showed abundant expression of mRNA whose size is about 4.5 and 4.8 kilonucleotides. The human gene encoding the NMDAR1 subunit has been mapped to chromosome 9q34.3 by the analyses of blot hybridization of a DNA panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization of human chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1505315584,"The metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin have been proposed to be mediated by cellular serine/threonine kinases such as the ribosomal protein S6 kinases pp70-S6 (pp70-S6 kinase) and pp90rsk and the erk-encoded mitogen-activated protein kinases (pp42mapk and pp44mapk). Rapamycin completely blocked activation of pp70-S6 kinase by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but did not inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport, translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, or activation of pp90rsk or pp44mapk by insulin. Concordant with the inhibition of kinase activity, rapamycin prevented the insulin-induced decrease in mobility of pp70-S6 kinase visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reflecting a reduction in the hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of the enzyme. The structurally related macrolide, FK506, had no effect on pp70-S6 kinase or hexose uptake. These data demonstrate that rapamycin blocks insulin activation of pp70-S6 kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that pp70-S6 kinase is not required in the signaling pathway leading to insulin-stimulated glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1573158404,"A number of fundamental questions pertaining to the registration and packing of the constituent coiled-coil molecules in keratin intermediate filaments, and to the regions of the sequences that are responsible for these levels of organization, remain to be elucidated. In this study, small assembly-competent oligomers of mouse and human keratin 1/keratin 10 keratin filaments were cross-linked by the formation of disulfide bonds catalyzed by the copper-phenanthroline reaction. By isolation and characterization of cross-linked peptides, it has been possible to establish two major modes of molecule alignment: an antiparallel arrangement of half-staggered molecules with their 2B segments overlapping and an antiparallel arrangement of molecules in close axial registration. These data confirm earlier models based on theoretical considerations (Crewther, W. G., Dowling, L. M., Steinert, P. M., and Parry, D. A. D. (1983) Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 5, 267-274). Interestingly, these models place the conserved H1 and H2 end domain segments, which flank the ends of the rod domains of the type II keratin 1 chain, in alignment with either the ends of the rod domains and/or with the L2 segment near the center of the rod domains, of the nearest neighbor molecules. Competition experiments with synthetic peptides suggest that the conserved H1 (and possibly H2) subdomain sequences unique to type II keratin chains play pivotal roles in the registration of neighboring molecules in keratin filaments. The data thus afford a molecular explanation for why keratin filaments require a type II chain for assembly in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1536434937,"Lysozyme and 10 other proteins are solubilized in reverse micelles formed by 0.1 M sodium di-2-ethyl-hexylsulfosuccinate and 2.0-2.5 M water (pH 7.4) in isooctane solvent. Exposure of the protein-containing reverse micellar solutions to ozone causes oxidative damage to the proteins, as assessed by the oxidation of tryptophan residues. The oxidation product of the protein-bound tryptophan has a molar absorption coefficient of 3275 +/- 81 M-1 cm-1 (mean +/- S.D., n = 6) at 320 nm. The product is suggested to be a Criegee ozonide or a tautomer of the Criegee ozonide and not N-formylkynurenine. Ozonation of lysozyme in reverse micelles results in the formation of hydrogen peroxide in yields of only approximately 0.07 mol/mol of tryptophan residues oxidized. The recovery of hydrogen peroxide added as an internal standard to the lysozyme-containing reverse micellar solutions ranges from 84 to 88%, whether or not the samples are subjected to ozonation. This suggests that hydrogen peroxide is neither destroyed during the process of ozonation nor consumed by the protein to a significant extent in an adventitious reaction. A kinetic model for the overall reaction of ozone with the proteins is developed, taking into account the concentrations and the reactivities of individual amino acid residues toward ozone. The model predicts the fractional reaction of ozone with tryptophan residues in the proteins, despite differences in amino acid composition, molecular weight, and tertiary structures. The lack of influence of protein structure is confirmed further by the observation that the native lysozyme (with and without external S-carboxymethylcysteine) and S-carboxymethylated lysozyme give identical values of the fractional reaction of ozone with tryptophan residues. The kinetic equations for the competitive reactions of ozone with amino acid residues in proteins, with some minor modification, are applicable to ozonations on complex mixtures of lipids, proteins, and antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1588224505,"The biological effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are mediated by cell surface alpha and beta PDGF receptors, which, as a result of ligand binding, undergo dimerization in a manner consistent with PDGF being bivalent. In order to directly demonstrate PDGF bivalency and to define the binding of PDGF AB to isolated beta receptor, we developed solid-phase binding assays using purified recombinant extracellular domain of human PDGF receptors. PDGF AA, AB, and BB were prepared from the monomeric chains expressed in Escherichia coli, and each was purified to homogeneity; PDGF AB contained < 0.5% of either homodimer. The interactions of these isoforms with immobilized PDGF receptors were examined by several approaches. Scatchard analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.5-1.0 nM) of radiolabeled PDGF AA and AB to alpha receptor and of PDGF BB to both receptor subtypes. Contrary to previous reports, PDGF AB also bound beta receptor with high affinity (Kd = 0.9 nM). When a B-chain-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes the putative binding domain of PDGF BB was used for ligand detection, we found that PDGF AB binding to beta receptor occurred exclusively through the B-chain subunit, whereas binding to alpha receptor occurred through either subunit. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis was used to specifically inactivate the B chain of PDGF AB, which eliminated binding to the beta receptor without affecting alpha receptor binding. These results establish that PDGF is bivalent and that monovalent ligand retains high affinity receptor binding."

Local incorporation of a fluorescent lipid analog into the plasma membrane of fast-growing Xenopus neurites revealed an anterograde bulk membrane flow that correlated with neurite elongation. The rate of membrane flow depended on the position of the labeled membrane segment along the neurite, increasing with distance from the soma. This result suggests that new membrane in growing Xenopus neurites is added not at the growth cone but at the cell body and along the neurite."

However, this kinase-negative EGF-R is able to activate MAP kinase (Campos-Gonzalez, R., and Glenny, J. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14535-14538). This observation suggests that signal initiation by the EGF-R can occur by a mechanism that is independent of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we report that the kinase-negative EGF-R is phosphorylated on tyrosine in EGF-treated cells. The mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation can be accounted for by the action of EGF to stimulate a protein kinase activity that is associated with the kinase-negative EGF-R. This protein kinase activity is not intrinsic to the receptor and can be separated from the EGF-R by incubation with 0.5 M NaCl. MAP kinase activation by the kinase-negative EGF-R may therefore occur by a mechanism that requires a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase. Thus, it is unnecessary to propose a novel kinase-independent mechanism of signal initiation to account for MAP kinase activation by the kinase-negative EGF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1915153380,"We have applied the SELEX procedure (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to obtain RNA molecules that bind tightly to the Escherichia coli transcription termination factor rho. The starting pool was a population of RNA molecules 77 nucleotides (nt) long, in which was embedded a cassette of 30 nt of randomized sequence. The apparent dissociation constant of this RNA pool for hexameric rho factor was about 1 μM. After eight rounds of selection by filter binding, with RNA in either 10-fold or 40 to 100-fold excess at each step, the dissociation constant of the selected RNA had dropped by more than 500-fold to about 1 nM. Analysis of 29 clonal isolates from the population revealed that five had KDS substantially weaker than 10 nM (presumably background carryover), 40% were C-rich (as might have been predicted from rho's known substrate binding), and 40% had a strikingly preserved potential hairpin, in most cases of 6 base pairs with a 3 nt CAA loop and preceded by a CCCCA consensus. The rhodependent trp t' terminator region includes a related potential hairpin structure; however, it is energetically unfavorable. The implications of the sequence findings for elucidating both static and dynamic aspects of rho factor recognition and response to its RNA target site are discussed.— Schneider, D., Gold, L., Platt, T.

https://openalex.org/W1600640527,"Multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) is a peculiar molecule consisting of a single-stranded DNA that is branched out from an internal G residue of an RNA molecule (msdRNA) via a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage. The genetic unit required for msDNA synthesis is designated retron and consists of msr (a gene for msdRNA), msd (a gene for msDNA), and a gene for reverse transcriptase (RT) in a single operon. To date, four different msDNAs have been isolated from Escherichia coli. They do not share any primary sequences in either RNA or DNA. To elucidate the specificity of bacterial RT for msDNA synthesis, the msr-msd region from retron-Ec67 was introduced into E. coli cells producing RT-Ec73, or the msr-msd region from retron-Ec73 into E. coli cells producing RT-Ec67. In both cases, msDNA was not synthesized. However, when the msdRNA coding regions (msr) for retron-Ec67 and -Ec73 were mutually exchanged and the chimeric genes were introduced into E. coli cells producing either RT-Ec67 or RT-Ec73, it was thus found that msDNA was produced only when msr and RT were from the same retron. Requirement of the msr region for msDNA synthesis by RT was further investigated by mutations in the msr region for retron-Ec67. These analyses revealed that there is a strict requirement for specific primary sequences as well as the secondary structure in msdRNA. This finding is discussed in relationship to the mechanism of the priming reaction of cDNA synthesis by eukaryotic retroviral RTs using tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1499061149,"Abstract The reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 has been mutagenized within the carboxyl-terminal domain which harbors the RNase H. Two amino acids highly conserved among all 14 known RT sequences but not in the bacterial RNase H have been mutagenized resulting in the mutant proteins N494D and Q475E. They were expressed as recombinant proteins, purified, and analyzed for their in vitro properties in comparison to the p66 homodimeric wild-type and a previously described H539N mutant. The N494D mutant closely resembles the wild-type RNase H, exhibits an endonuclease activity and a processive RNase H activity, gives rise to small RNA hydrolysis products, and acts in concert with the RT. The Q475E mutant is more defective and resembles the H539N mutant, exhibits a retarded endonuclease activity and an impaired 3'-->5' processive RNA cleavage activity, gives rise to predominantly larger RNA hydrolysis products, is less processive in the presence of competitor substrate, and is defective in its ability to hydrolyze the polypurine tract and homopolymeric hybrids. Short homopolymeric stretches cause a pausing of the RT of wild-type and mutants which results in a coordinated action of the RNase H. Pausing of the RT correlates with RNase H cleavages about 20 nucleotides behind the point of synthesis. The defects of the mutant enzymes can be interpreted on the basis of the known crystallography data."
https://openalex.org/W1587483834,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein of plasma and the subendothelial matrix that interacts with specific platelet receptors to establish platelet adhesion at a site of vascular injury. The vWF domain containing the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib-binding site can be expressed in heterologous cells as a recombinant homodimeric fragment that mediates platelet-platelet interaction, analogous to multimeric vWF. The recombinant domain, r116, contains 7 Cys residues within its 290-residue monomeric subunit paired in an unidentified intra- and intermolecular disulfide bond arrangement. In this report we define the disulfide bond-dependent framework of r116 that provides the domain with its essential structural features that support dimer formation and the generation of a disulfide bond-dependent epitope. The results demonstrate that a triplet of Cys residues at positions 459, 462, and 464 are essential for efficient dimer formation. An intramolecular Cys509/Cys695 disulfide loop is required for generating a functional dimeric molecule, and monomeric molecules containing a Cys509/Cys695 intramolecular disulfide bond are unable to support ristocetin-mediated platelet aggregation. The disulfide arrangement in r116 is similar, if not identical, to the proposed arrangement within the corresponding region of plasma vWF, and these studies document the inherent Cys-dependent maturation of an isolated vWF domain."
https://openalex.org/W1569076101,"Extracellular release of platelet activating factor (PAF) following synthesis in inflammatory cells is variable and modulated by a number of as yet undefined cellular mechanisms. Using human neutrophils loaded with the tritiated, nonmetabolizable PAF analog, 1-O-alkyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C-PAF), extracellular release was studied by techniques involving an albumin extraction method. Further modeling of plasma membrane events in the neutrophil was accomplished using movement across the membrane of erythrocyte ghosts. The data demonstrate that C-PAF release is dependent on cellular activation and is accompanied by alterations in the physical properties of the plasma membrane as measured by enhancement of merocyanine 540 (MC540) staining, as well as by bulk, nonspecific transbilayer movement of endogenous phospholipids as detected by the procoagulant activity of externalized phosphatidylserine (a phospholipid class usually sequestered in the plasma membrane inner leaflet). The finding that competitive inhibitors of transglutaminase significantly inhibited C-PAF release, enhancement of MC540 staining, and externalization of phosphatidylserine, strongly suggest a role for this enzyme in the enhancement of phospholipid transbilayer movement. Furthermore, the data suggest that recycling of C-PAF in the plasma membrane is likewise transglutaminase dependent and limits the net extracellular release of C-PAF which, like liberation of endogenously produced PAF, is dependent on extracellular acceptors and shown to be albumin concentration- and cell density-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W1569291446,"The engagement of cell-surface antigen receptors on B lymphocytes by anti-IgM antibodies leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the protein-tyrosine kinase, PTK72. High concentrations of anti-IgM, which promote cell cycle entry and progression through G1, result in a biphasic change in the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of PTK72. An initial, rapid increase is seen within 5 min, which slowly declines to the level found in resting cells over a period of 9 h. A second increase is then observed 18-30 h following the initial stimulation. Low concentrations of anti-IgM, which promote cell cycle entry but not progression through G1, result only in the initial, rapid phosphorylation. The polyclonal mitogens lipopolysaccharide and dextran sulfate, which stimulate both cell cycle entry and progression to late G1, result only in the second, late phase of tyrosine phosphorylation. This second phase of elevated tyrosine phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent, as demonstrated by its appearance in cells blocked at G1/S and absence in cells blocked at G2/M. The increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTK72 is accompanied by an increase in its activity with no change in its concentration. These data suggest a possible second role for PTK72 in the commitment of activated B cells to proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1501602702,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to assess the importance of lysine 263 in substrate binding of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase. Previous studies have indicated that lysine 263 functions in the binding of 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) substrates (Basu, A., Tirumalai, R. S., and Modak, M. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8746-8752). We studied this interaction directly by using site-specific mutagenesis to change lysine 263 to a serine. Highly purified mutant enzyme K263S bound natural dNTP substrates and primed polynucleic acid substrates with equal affinity when compared to the wild type reverse transcriptase. No difference was observed in the binding of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate to the mutant reverse transcriptase on the basis of Km and Ki determinations. The serine substitution had no effect on RNase H activity. These results indicate that lysine 263 is not essential in the binding of substrates to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."
https://openalex.org/W1539211075,"The characterization of retinoic acid (RA)-regulated gene transcription in keratinocytes has important implications as to the function of retinoids in epidermal homeostasis and to the central role retinoids play in the pharmaco-therapy of a variety of skin disorders. We show that cultured mouse keratinocytes (Balb/MK) responded to RA with induced expression of VL30 retrotransposons. The induction was rapid, was present at nanomolar concentrations of RA, was independent of new protein synthesis, and occurred both in proliferating and differentiated keratinocytes. The long terminal repeat of a VL30 retrotransposon, expressed in mouse epidermis in vivo, was found to contain two RA-responsive elements (RREs) that independently conferred RA responsiveness on a heterologous promoter in both cultured Balb/MK cells and normal human keratinocytes. Functional characterization and in vitro binding analysis showed that the sequence requirement for binding of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR, either alpha, beta, or gamma) heterodimers, correlated with the sequence requirement for RA-induced transcription in keratinocytes. The VL30 RREs differed functionally from the RA response element present in the RAR-beta 2 promoter, in that the VL30 RREs were non-responsive in fibroblasts cultured from human skin. The non-responsiveness correlated with a reduced complex formation between a VL30 RRE and endogenously expressed nuclear factors present in skin fibroblasts. The data suggest that a direct repeat of two half-sites, spaced by two base pairs, with the consensus sequence T(A/G)AACTTTT(T/C)ACC(T/C), bound RAR-RXR heterodimers and mediated, at constitutive receptor levels, a primary RA response on gene transcription specifically in keratinocytes."
